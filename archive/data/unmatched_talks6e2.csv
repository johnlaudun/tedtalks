3,1422,1424,Adam Savage 2009,Adam Savage,male,My obsession with objects and the stories they tell,Mar 2009,881,About four years ago  the New Yorker published an article about a cache of dodo bones that was found in a pit on the island of Mauritius. Now  the island of Mauritius is a small island off the east coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean  and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished  all within about     years. Everyone was very excited about this archaeological find  because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton. See  while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection  nobody    not even the actual Natural History Museum on the island of Mauritius    has a skeleton that's made from the bones of a single dodo. Well  this isn't exactly true. The fact is  is that the British Museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the   th century    it was actually mummified  skin and all    but in a fit of space saving zeal  they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire. If you go look at their website today  they'll actually list these specimens  saying  the rest was lost in a fire. Not quite the whole truth. Anyway. The frontispiece of this article was this photo  and I'm one of the people that thinks that Tina Brown was great for bringing photos to the New Yorker  because this photo completely rocked my world. I became obsessed with the object    not just the beautiful photograph itself  and the color  the shallow depth of field  the detail that's visible  the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together    there's an entire story here. And I thought to myself  wouldn't it be great if I had my own dodo skeleton  I want to point out here at this point that I've spent my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell  and this was the very latest one. So I began looking around for    to see if anyone sold a kit  some kind of model that I could get  and I found lots of reference material  lots of lovely pictures. No dice  no dodo skeleton for me. But the damage had been done. I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my  Creative Projects  folder    it's a repository for my brain  everything that I could possibly be interested in. Any time I have an internet connection  there's a sluice of stuff moving into there  everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos. The key that the Marquis du Lafayette sent to George Washington to celebrate the storming of the Bastille. Russian nuclear launch key  The one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay  the one on the bottom is the one I made for myself  because I couldn't afford the one on eBay. Storm trooper costumes. Maps of Middle Earth    that's one I hand drew myself. There's the dodo skeleton folder. This folder has        photos    over    gigabytes of information    and it's growing constantly. And one day  a couple of weeks later  it might have been maybe a year later  I was in the art store with my kids  and I was buying some clay tools    we were going to have a craft day. I bought some Super Sculpeys  some armature wire  some various materials. And I looked down at this Sculpey  and I thought  maybe  yeah  maybe I could make my own dodo skull. I should point out at this time    I'm not a sculptor  I'm a hard edged model maker. You give me a drawing  you give me a prop to replicate  you give me a crane  scaffolding  parts from  Star Wars     especially parts from  Star Wars     I can do this stuff all day long. It's exactly how I made my living for    years. But you give me something like this    my friend Mike Murnane sculpted this  it's a maquette for  Star Wars  Episode Two     this is not my thing    this is something other people do    dragons  soft things. However  I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it    I mean  it couldn't be that difficult. So  I started looking at the best photos I could find. I grabbed all the reference  and I found this lovely piece of reference. This is someone selling this on eBay  it was clearly a woman s hand  hopefully a woman's hand. Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand  I made some measurements of her thumb  and I scaled them out to the size of the skull. I blew it up to the actual size  and I began using that  along with all the other reference that I had  comparing it to it as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be  exactly how long  etc. And over a few hours  I eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull. And I didn't mean to continue  I    it's kind of like  you know  you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time  you can't think about the totality. I wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton  I just noticed that as I finished this skull  the armature wire that I had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be. And one of the other things I'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons  having collected a couple of hundred. I actually understood the mechanics of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them. And so button by button  vertebrae by vertebrae  I built my way down. And actually  by the end of the day  I had a reasonable skull  a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis. And again  I kept on going  looking for more reference  every bit of reference I could find    drawings  beautiful photos. This guy    I love this guy  He put a dodo leg bones on a scanner with a ruler. This is the kind of accuracy that I wanted  and I replicated every last bone and put it in. And after about six weeks  I finished  painted  mounted my own dodo skeleton. You can see that I even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dodo. And TAP Plastics made me    although I didn't photograph it    a museum vitrine. I don't have the room for this in my house  but I had to finish what I had started. And this actually represented kind of a sea change to me. Again  like I said  my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell  and also making them for myself  obtaining them  appreciating them and diving into them. And in this folder   Creative Projects   there are tons of projects that I'm currently working on  projects that I've already worked on  things that I might want to work on some day  and things that I may just want to find and buy and have and look at and touch. But now there was potentially this new category of things that I could sculpt that was different  that I    you know  I have my own R D   but that's    honestly  relative to sculpting  to me  that's easy. And so I went back and looked through my  Creative Projects  folder  and I happened across the Maltese Falcon. Now  this is funny for me  to fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel  because if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people  Chandler people and Hammett people  I am absolutely a Chandler person. But in this case  it's not about the author  it's not about the book or the movie or the story  it's about the object in and of itself. And in this case  this object is    plays on a host of levels. First of all  there's the object in the world. This is the  Kniphausen Hawk.  It is a ceremonial pouring vessel made around      for a Swedish Count  and it is very likely the object from which Hammett drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon. Then there is the fictional bird  the one that Hammett created for the book. Built out of words  it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie  in which another object is created  a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words  inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk  and this represents the falcon in the movie. And then there is this fourth level  which is a whole new object in the world  the prop made for the movie  the representative of the thing  becomes  in its own right  a whole other thing  a whole new object of desire. And so now it was time to do some research. I actually had done some research a few years before    it's why the folder was there. I'd bought a replica  a really crappy replica  of the Maltese Falcon on eBay  and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference. But I discovered  in researching further  really wanting precise reference  that one of the original lead birds had been sold at Christie's in       and so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original Christie's catalogue  and in it I found this magnificent picture  which included a size reference. I was able to scan the picture  blow it up to exactly full size. I found other reference. Avi  Ara  Chekmayan  a New Jersey editor  actually found this resin Maltese Falcon at a flea market in       although it took him five years to authenticate this bird to the auctioneers' specifications  because there was a lot of controversy about it. It was made out of resin  which wasn't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made. It's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it  because I can see it compared to this thing  and I can tell you    it's real  it's the real thing  it's made from the exact same mold that this one is. In this one  because the auction was actually so controversial  Profiles in History  the auction house that sold this    I think in      for about         dollars    they actually included    you can see here on the bottom    not just a front elevation  but also a side  rear and other side elevation. So now  I had all the topology I needed to replicate the Maltese Falcon. What do they do  how do you start something like that  I really don't know. So what I did was  again  like I did with the dodo skull  I blew all my reference up to full size  and then I began cutting out the negatives and using those templates as shape references. So I took Sculpey  and I built a big block of it  and I passed it through until  you know  I got the right profiles. And then slowly  feather by feather  detail by detail  I worked out and achieved    working in front of the television and Super Sculpey    here's me sitting next to my wife    it's the only picture I took of the entire process. As I moved through  I achieved a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon. But again  I am not a sculptor  and so I don't know a lot of the tricks  like  I don't know how my friend Mike gets beautiful  shiny surfaces with his Sculpey  I certainly wasn't able to get it. So  I went down to my shop  and I molded it and I cast it in resin  because in the resin  then  I could absolutely get the glass smooth finished. Now there's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish. My preference is about    coats of this    matte black auto primer. I spray it on for about three or four days  it drips to hell  but it allows me a really  really nice gentle sanding surface and I can get it glass smooth. Oh  finishing up with triple zero steel wool. Now  the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie  when they finally bring out the bird at the end  and they place it on the table  they actually spin it. So I was able to actually screen shot and freeze frame to make sure. And I'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I'm holding the light in the same position  I'm getting the same type of reflection on it    that's the level of detail I'm going into this thing. I ended up with this  my Maltese Falcon. And it's beautiful. And I can state with authority at this point in time  when I'd finished it  of all of the replicas out there    and there is a few    this is by far the most accurate representation of the original Maltese Falcon than anyone has sculpted. Now the original one  I should tell you  is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton. This is where it gets weird. Fred Sexton was a friend of this guy  George Hodel. Terrifying guy    agreed by many to be the killer of the Black Dahlia. Now  James Ellroy believes that Fred Sexton  the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon  killed James Elroy's mother. I'll go you one stranger than that  In       during the production of a weird comedy sequel to  The Maltese Falcon   called  The Black Bird   starring George Segal  the Los Angeles County Museum of Art had a plaster original of the Maltese Falcon    one of the original six plasters  I think  made for the movie    stolen out of the museum. A lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie. John's Grill  which actually is seen briefly in  The Maltese Falcon   is still a viable San Francisco eatery  counted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook  who played Wilmer Cook in the movie  and he gave them one of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon. And they had it in their cabinet for about    years  until it got stolen in January of     . It would seem that the object of desire only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly. So here I had this Falcon  and it was lovely. It looked really great  the light worked on it really well  it was better than anything that I could achieve or obtain out in the world. But there was a problem. And the problem was that  I wanted the entirety of the object  I wanted the weight behind the object. This thing was made of resin and it was too light. There's this group online that I frequent. It's a group of prop crazies just like me called the Replica Props Forum  and it's people who trade  make and travel in information about movie props. And it turned out that one of the guys there  a friend of mine that I never actually met  but befriended through some prop deals  was the manager of a local foundry. He took my master Falcon pattern  he actually did lost wax casting in bronze for me  and this is the bronze I got back. And this is  after some acid etching  the one that I ended up with. And this thing  it's deeply  deeply satisfying to me. Here  I'm going to put it out there  later on tonight  and I want you to pick it up and handle it. You want to know how obsessed I am. This project's only for me  and yet I went so far as to buy on eBay a      Chinese San Francisco based newspaper  in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ... like it is in the movie. Yeah  I know  There you can see  it's weighing in at    and a half pounds. That's half the weight of my dog  Huxley. But there's a problem. Now  here's the most recent progression of Falcons. On the far left is a piece of crap    a replica I bought on eBay. There's my somewhat ruined Sculpey Falcon  because I had to get it back out of the mold. There's my first casting  there's my master and there's my bronze. There's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things  which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin  you lose a little bit of volume  you lose a little bit of size. And when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one  it was shorter by three quarters of an inch. Yeah  no  really  this was like aah    why didn't I remember this  Why didn't I start and make it bigger  So what do I do  I figure I have two options. One  I can fire a freaking laser at it  which I have already done  to do a  D scan    there's a  D scan of this Falcon. I had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make a  D lithography master of this  which I will polish  then I will send to the mold maker and then I will have it done in bronze. Or  There are several people who own originals  and I have been attempting to contact them and reach them  hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds  maybe to take a picture  or even to pull out the hand held laser scanner that I happen to own that fits inside a cereal box  and could maybe  without even touching their bird  I swear  get a perfect  D scan. And I'm even willing to sign pages saying that I'll never let anyone else have it  except for me in my office  I promise. I'll give them one if they want it. And then  maybe  then I'll achieve the end of this exercise. But really  if we're all going to be honest with ourselves  I have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with  was it. Thank you.,"Maker, critical thinker",200903,6.131734197730952
5,1951,1953,Aicha el-Wafi + Phyllis Rodriguez 2011,Aicha el-Wafi + Phyllis Rodriguez,female,"The mothers who found forgiveness, friendship",May 2011,570,Phyllis Rodriguez  We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship. And it is. And yet  it feels natural to us now. I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September   th      . We didn't know if he had perished yet until    hours later. At the time  we knew that it was political. We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son    my husband  Orlando  and I and our family. And when I saw it    and yet  through the shock  the terrible shock  and the terrible explosion in our lives  literally  we were not vengeful. And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism  and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him  if convicted  my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that  publicly. Through that and through human rights groups  we were brought together with several other victims' families. When I saw Aicha in the media  coming over when her son was indicted  and I thought   What a brave woman. Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger.  I was still in deep grief  I knew I didn't have the strength. I knew I would find her someday  or we would find each other. Because  when people heard that my son was a victim  I got immediate sympathy. But when people learned what her son was accused of  she didn't get that sympathy. But her suffering is equal to mine. So we met in November       and Aicha will now tell you how that came about. I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui. And I asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims. So they introduced me to five families. And I saw Phyllis  and I watched her. She was the only mother in the group. The others were brothers  sisters. And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother  just like me. I suffered a lot as a mother. I was married when I was   . I lost a child when I was     a second child when I was   . So the story with Zacarias was too much really. And I still suffer  because my son is like he's buried alive. I know she really cried for her son. But she knows where he is. My son  I don't know where he is. I don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's tortured. I don't know what happened to him. So that's why I decided to tell my story  so that my suffering is something positive for other women. For all the women  all the mothers that give life  you can give back  you can change. It's up to us women  because we are women  because we love our children. We must be hand in hand and do something together. It's not against women  it's for us  for us women  for our children. I talk against violence  against terrorism. I go to schools to talk to young  Muslim girls so they don't accept to be married against their will very young. So if I can save one of the young girls  and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did  well this is something good. This is why I'm here in front of you. PR  I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha  starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members    which was a very private meeting with security  because it was November       and  frankly  we were afraid of the super patriotism of that time in the country    those of us family members. But we were all so nervous.  Why does she want to meet us   And then she was nervous.  Why did we want to meet her   What did we want from each other  Before we knew each others' names  or anything  we had embraced and wept. Then we sat in a circle with support  with help  from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation. And Aicha started  and she said   I don't know if my son is guilty or innocent  but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families. I know what it is to suffer  and I feel that if there is a crime  a person should be tried fairly and punished.  But she reached out to us in that way  and it was  I'd like to say  it was an ice breaker. And what happened then is we all told our stories  and we all connected as human beings. By the end of the afternoon    it was about three hours after lunch    we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever. Now what I learned from her  is a woman  not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then  and what was being done to her son  but the life she's had. I never had met someone with such a hard life  from such a totally different culture and environment from my own. And I feel that we have a special connection  which I value very much. And I think it's all about being afraid of the other  but making that step and then realizing   Hey  this wasn't so hard. Who else can I meet that I don't know  or that I'm so different from   So  Aicha  do you have a couple of words for conclusion  Because our time is up. that we have to try to know other people  the other. You have to be generous  and your hearts must be generous  your mind must be generous. You must be tolerant. You have to fight against violence. And I hope that someday we'll all live together in peace and respecting each other. This is what I wanted to say.,9/11 mothers,201105,5.891185897435896
6,1389,1391,Aimee Mullins 2009,Aimee Mullins,female,Changing my legs - and my mindset,Jan 2009,1222,Sheryl Shade  Hi  Aimee. Aimee Mullins  Hi. SS  Aimee and I thought we'd just talk a little bit  and I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete. AM  Well  for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio    it might have given it away    I'm a double amputee  and I was born without fibulas in both legs. I was amputated at age one  and I've been running like hell ever since  all over the place. SS  Well  why don't you tell them how you got to Georgetown    why don't we start there  Why don't we start there  AM  I'm a senior in Georgetown in the Foreign Service program. I won a full academic scholarship out of high school. They pick three students out of the nation every year to get involved in international affairs  and so I won a full ride to Georgetown and I've been there for four years. Love it. SS  When Aimee got there  she decided that she's  kind of  curious about track and field  so she decided to call someone and start asking about it. So  why don't you tell that story  AM  Yeah. Well  I guess I've always been involved in sports. I played softball for five years growing up. I skied competitively throughout high school  and I got a little restless in college because I wasn't doing anything for about a year or two sports wise. And I'd never competed on a disabled level  you know    I'd always competed against other able bodied athletes. That's all I'd ever known. In fact  I'd never even met another amputee until I was   . And I heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners  and I figured   Oh  I don't know about this  but before I judge it  let me go see what it's all about.  So  I booked myself a flight to Boston in '       years old and definitely the dark horse candidate at this race. I'd never done it before. I went out on a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet to see how far I could run  and about    meters was enough for me  panting and heaving. And I had these legs that were made of a wood and plastic compound  attached with Velcro straps    big  thick  five ply wool socks on    you know  not the most comfortable things  but all I'd ever known. And I'm up there in Boston against people wearing legs made of all things    carbon graphite and  you know  shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things    and they're all looking at me like  OK  we know who's not going to win this race. And  I mean  I went up there expecting    I don't know what I was expecting    but  you know  when I saw a man who was missing an entire leg go up to the high jump  hop on one leg to the high jump and clear it at six feet  two inches ... Dan O'Brien jumped  '    in '   in Atlanta  I mean  if it just gives you a comparison of    these are truly accomplished athletes  without qualifying that word  athlete.  And so I decided to give this a shot  heart pounding  I ran my first race and I beat the national record holder by three hundredths of a second  and became the new national record holder on my first try out. And  you know  people said   Aimee  you know  you've got speed    you've got natural speed    but you don't have any skill or finesse going down that track. You were all over the place. We all saw how hard you were working.  And so I decided to call the track coach at Georgetown. And I thank god I didn't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world. He's coached five Olympians  and the man's office is lined from floor to ceiling with All America certificates of all these athletes he's coached. He's just a rather intimidating figure. And I called him up and said   Listen  I ran one race and I won ...   I want to see if I can  you know    I need to just see if I can sit in on some of your practices  see what drills you do and whatever.  That's all I wanted    just two practices.  Can I just sit in and see what you do   And he said   Well  we should meet first  before we decide anything.  You know  he's thinking   What am I getting myself into   So  I met the man  walked in his office  and saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached. And we got to talking  and it turned out to be a great partnership because he'd never coached a disabled athlete  so therefore he had no preconceived notions of what I was or wasn't capable of  and I'd never been coached before. So this was like   Here we go    let's start on this trip.  So he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break  his free time  and I would come up to the track and train with him. So that's how I met Frank. That was fall of '  . But then  by the time that winter was rolling around  he said   You know  you're good enough. You can run on our women's track team here.  And I said   No  come on.  And he said   No  no  really. You can. You can run with our women's track team.  In the spring of       with my goal of making the U.S. Paralympic team that May coming up full speed  I joined the women's track team. And no disabled person had ever done that    run at a collegiate level. So I don't know  it started to become an interesting mix. SS  Well  on your way to the Olympics  a couple of memorable events happened at Georgetown. Why don't you just tell them  AM  Yes  well  you know  I'd won everything as far as the disabled meets    everything I competed in    and  you know  training in Georgetown and knowing that I was going to have to get used to seeing the backs of all these women's shirts    you know  I'm running against the next Flo Jo    and they're all looking at me like   Hmm  what's  you know  what's going on here   And putting on my Georgetown uniform and going out there and knowing that  you know  in order to become better    and I'm already the best in the country    you know  you have to train with people who are inherently better than you. And I went out there and made it to the Big East  which was sort of the championship race at the end of the season. It was really  really hot. And it's the first    I had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio  and I didn't realize at that time that the amount of sweating I would be doing in the sock    it actually acted like a lubricant and I'd be  kind of  pistoning in the socket. And at about    meters of my     meters sprint  in all my glory  I came out of my leg. Like  I almost came out of it  in front of  like        people. And I  I mean  was just mortified    because I was signed up for the      you know  which went off in a half hour. I went to my coach   Please  don't make me do this.  I can't do this in front of all those people. My legs will come off. And if it came off at    there's no way I'm going     meters. And he just sat there like this. My pleas fell on deaf ears  thank god. Because you know  the man is from Brooklyn  he's a big man. He says   Aimee  so what if your leg falls off  You pick it up  you put the damn thing back on  and finish the goddamn race   And I did. So  he kept me in line. He kept me on the right track. SS  So  then Aimee makes it to the      Paralympics  and she's all excited. Her family's coming down    it's a big deal. It's now two years that you've been running  AM  No  a year. SS  A year. And why don't you tell them what happened right before you go run your race  AM  Okay  well  Atlanta. The Paralympics  just for a little bit of clarification  are the Olympics for people with physical disabilities    amputees  persons with cerebral palsy  and wheelchair athletes    as opposed to the Special Olympics  which deals with people with mental disabilities. So  here we are  a week after the Olympics and down at Atlanta  and I'm just blown away by the fact that just a year ago  I got out on a gravel track and couldn't run    meters. And so  here I am    never lost. I set new records at the U.S. Nationals    the Olympic trials    that May  and was sure that I was coming home with the gold. I was also the only  what they call  bilateral BK     below the knee. I was the only woman who would be doing the long jump. I had just done the long jump  and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says   How do you do that  You know  we're supposed to have a planar foot  so we can't get off on the springboard.  I said   Well  I just did it. No one told me that.  So  it's funny    I'm three inches within the world record    and kept on from that point  you know  so I'm signed up in the long jump    signed up  No  I made it for the long jump and the     meter. And I'm sure of it  you know  I made the front page of my hometown paper that I delivered for six years  you know  It was  like  this is my time for shine. And we're at the trainee warm up track  which is a few blocks away from the Olympic stadium. These legs that I was on  which I'll take out right now    I was the first person in the world on these legs. I was the guinea pig.  I'm telling you  this was  like    talk about a tourist attraction. Everyone was taking pictures     What is this girl running on   And I'm always looking around  like  where is my competition  It's my first international meet. I tried to get it out of anybody I could  you know   Who am I running against here    Oh  Aimee  we'll have to get back to you on that one.  I wanted to find out times.  Don't worry  you're doing great.  This is    minutes before my race in the Olympic stadium  and they post the heat sheets. And I go over and look. And my fastest time  which was the world record  was   .  . Then I'm looking  the next lane  lane two  is   . . Lane three is   . . Lane four is   . . I said   What's going on   And they shove us all into the shuttle bus  and all the women there are missing a hand. So  I'm just  like    they're all looking at me like 'which one of these is not like the other ' you know  I'm sitting there  like   Oh  my god. Oh  my god.  You know  I'd never lost anything  like  whether it would be the scholarship or  you know  I'd won five golds when I skied. In everything  I came in first. And Georgetown    that was great. I was losing  but it was the best training because this was Atlanta. Here we are  like  cr me de la cr me  and there is no doubt about it  that I'm going to lose big. And  you know  I'm just thinking   Oh  my god  my whole family got in a van and drove down here from Pennsylvania.  And  you know  I was the only female U.S. sprinter. So they call us out and  you know     Ladies  you have one minute.  And I remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd  like  the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see. And I'm like   I know  Look  This isn't right.  And I'm thinking that's my last card to play here  if I'm not going to beat these girls  I'm going to mess their heads a little  you know  I mean  it was definitely the  Rocky IV  sensation of me versus Germany  and everyone else    Estonia and Poland    was in this heat. And the gun went off  and all I remember was finishing last and fighting back tears of frustration and incredible    incredible    this feeling of just being overwhelmed. And I had to think   Why did I do this   If I had won everything    but it was like  what was the point  All this training    I had transformed my life. I became a collegiate athlete  you know. I became an Olympic athlete. And it made me really think about how the achievement was getting there. I mean  the fact that I set my sights  just a year and three months before  on becoming an Olympic athlete and saying   Here's my life going in this direction    and I want to take it here for a while  and just seeing how far I could push it.  And the fact that I asked for help    how many people jumped on board  How many people gave of their time and their expertise  and their patience  to deal with me  And that was this collective glory    that there was  you know     people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience of going to Atlanta. So  I apply this sort of philosophy now to everything I do  sitting back and realizing the progression  how far you've come at this day to this goal  you know. It's important to focus on a goal  I think  but also recognize the progression on the way there and how you've grown as a person. That's the achievement  I think. That's the real achievement. SS  Why don't you show them your legs  AM  Oh  sure. SS  You know  show us more than one set of legs. AM  Well  these are my pretty legs. No  these are my cosmetic legs  actually  and they're absolutely beautiful. You've got to come up and see them. There are hair follicles on them  and I can paint my toenails. And  seriously  like  I can wear heels. Like  you guys don't understand what that's like to be able to just go into a shoe store and buy whatever you want. SS  You got to pick your height  AM  I got to pick my height  exactly. Patrick Ewing  who played for Georgetown in the '  s  comes back every summer. And I had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room because he'd come in with foot injuries. I'm like   Get it off  Don't worry about it  you know. You can be eight feet tall. Just take them off.  He didn't find it as humorous as I did  anyway. OK  now  these are my sprinting legs  made of carbon graphite  like I said  and I've got to make sure I've got the right socket. No  I've got so many legs in here. These are    do you want to hold that actually  That's another leg I have for  like  tennis and softball. It has a shock absorber in it so it  like   Shhhh   makes this neat sound when you jump around on it. All right. And then this is the silicon sheath I roll over  to keep it on. Which  when I sweat  you know  I'm pistoning out of it. SS  Are you a different height  AM  In these  SS  In these. AM  I don't know. I don't think so. I may be a little taller. I actually can put both of them on. SS  She can't really stand on these legs. She has to be moving  so ... AM  Yeah  I definitely have to be moving  and balance is a little bit of an art in them. But without having the silicon sock  I'm just going to try slip in it. And so  I run on these  and have shocked half the world on these. These are supposed to simulate the actual form of a sprinter when they run. If you ever watch a sprinter  the ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track. So when I stand in these legs  my hamstring and my glutes are contracted  as they would be had I had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet. AM  It's a company in San Diego called Flex Foot. And I was a guinea pig  as I hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out. But actually these  like I said  are still the actual prototype. I need to get some new ones because the last meet I was at  they were everywhere. You know  it's like a big    it's come full circle. Moderator  Aimee and the designer of them will be at TEDMED    and we'll talk about the design of them. AM  Yes  we'll do that. SS  Yes  there you go. AM  So  these are the sprint legs  and I can put my other... SS  Can you tell about who designed your other legs  AM  Yes. These I got in a place called Bournemouth  England  about two hours south of London  and I'm the only person in the United States with these  which is a crime because they are so beautiful. And I don't even mean  like  because of the toes and everything. For me  while I'm such a serious athlete on the track  I want to be feminine off the track  and I think it's so important not to be limited in any capacity  whether it's  you know  your mobility or even fashion. I mean  I love the fact that I can go in anywhere and pick out what I want    the shoes I want  the skirts I want    and I'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people. They're also silicon. This is a really basic  basic prosthetic limb under here. It's like a Barbie foot under this. It is. It's just stuck in this position  so I have to wear a two inch heel. And  I mean  it's really    let me take this off so you can see it. I don't know how good you can see it  but  like  it really is. There're veins on the feet  and then my heel is pink  and my Achilles' tendon    that moves a little bit. And it's really an amazing store. I got them a year and two weeks ago. And this is just a silicon piece of skin. I mean  what happened was  two years ago this man in Belgium was saying   God  if I can go to Madame Tussauds' wax museum and see Jerry Hall replicated down to the color of her eyes  looking so real as if she breathed  why can't they build a limb for someone that looks like a leg  or an arm  or a hand   I mean  they make ears for burn victims. They do amazing stuff with silicon. SS  Two weeks ago  Aimee was up for the Arthur Ashe award at the ESPYs. And she came into town and she rushed around and she said   I have to buy some new shoes   We're an hour before the ESPYs  and she thought she'd gotten a two inch heel but she'd actually bought a three inch heel. AM  And this poses a problem for me  because it means I'm walking like that all night long. SS  For    minutes. Luckily  the hotel was terrific. They got someone to come in and saw off the shoes. AM  I said to the receptionist    I mean  I am just harried  and Sheryl's at my side    I said   Look  do you have anybody here who could help me  Because I have this problem ...   You know  at first they were just going to write me off  like   If you don't like your shoes  sorry. It's too late.   No  no  no  no. I've got these special feet that need a two inch heel. I have a three inch heel. I need a little bit off.  They didn't even want to go there. They didn't even want to touch that one. They just did it. No  these legs are great. I'm actually going back in a couple of weeks to get some improvements. I want to get legs like these made for flat feet so I can wear sneakers  because I can't with these ones. So... Moderator  That's it. SS  That's Aimee Mullins.,Athlete and actor,200901,5.990806451612903
7,1415,1417,Aimee Mullins 2009,Aimee Mullins,female,My 12 pairs of legs,Mar 2009,484,I was speaking to a group of about     kids  ages six to eight  at a children's museum  and I brought with me a bag full of legs  similar to the kinds of things you see up here  and had them laid out on a table for the kids. And  from my experience  you know  kids are naturally curious about what they don't know  or don't understand  or is foreign to them. They only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way  and maybe censors that natural curiosity  or you know  reins in the question asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids. So I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby with these unruly kids  saying   Now  whatever you do  don't stare at her legs.  But  of course  that's the point. That's why I was there  I wanted to invite them to look and explore. So I made a deal with the adults that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes on their own. The doors open  the kids descend on this table of legs  and they are poking and prodding  and they're wiggling toes  and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that. And I said   Kids  really quickly    I woke up this morning  I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house    nothing too big  two or three stories    but  if you could think of any animal  any superhero  any cartoon character  anything you can dream up right now  what kind of legs would you build me   And immediately a voice shouted   Kangaroo    No  no  no  Should be a frog    No. It should be Go Go Gadget    No  no  no  It should be the Incredibles.  And other things that I don't    aren't familiar with. And then  one eight year old said   Hey  why wouldn't you want to fly too   And the whole room  including me  was like   Yeah.  And just like that  I went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as  disabled  to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet. Somebody that might even be super abled. Interesting. So some of you actually saw me at TED     years ago. And there's been a lot of talk about how life changing this conference is for both speakers and attendees  and I am no exception. TED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life's exploration. At the time  the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics. I had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah  which you may have seen on stage yesterday. And also these very life like  intrinsically painted silicone legs. So at the time  it was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art of building legs. So that we can stop compartmentalizing form  function and aesthetic  and assigning them different values. Well  lucky for me  a lot of people answered that call. And the journey started  funny enough  with a TED conference attendee    Chee Pearlman  who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today. She was the editor then of a magazine called ID  and she gave me a cover story. This started an incredible journey. Curious encounters were happening to me at the time  I'd been accepting numerous invitations to speak on the design of the cheetah legs around the world. And people would come up to me after the conference  after my talk  men and women. And the conversation would go something like this   You know Aimee  you're very attractive. You don't look disabled.  I thought   Well  that's amazing  because I don't feel disabled.  And it really opened my eyes to this conversation that could be explored  about beauty. What does a beautiful woman have to look like  What is a sexy body  And interestingly  from an identity standpoint  what does it mean to have a disability  I mean  people    Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do. Nobody calls her disabled. So this magazine  through the hands of graphic designer Peter Saville  went to fashion designer Alexander McQueen  and photographer Nick Knight  who were also interested in exploring that conversation. So  three months after TED I found myself on a plane to London  doing my first fashion shoot  which resulted in this cover     Fashion able   Three months after that  I did my first runway show for Alexander McQueen on a pair of hand carved wooden legs made from solid ash. Nobody knew    everyone thought they were wooden boots. Actually  I have them on stage with me  grapevines  magnolias    truly stunning. Poetry matters. Poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object to a realm of art. It can transform the thing that might have made people fearful into something that invites them to look  and look a little longer  and maybe even understand. I learned this firsthand with my next adventure. The artist Matthew Barney  in his film opus called the  The Cremaster Cycle.  This is where it really hit home for me    that my legs could be wearable sculpture. And even at this point  I started to move away from the need to replicate human ness as the only aesthetic ideal. So we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs even though they're actually optically clear polyurethane  a.k.a. bowling ball material. Heavy  Then we made these legs that are cast in soil with a potato root system growing in them  and beetroots out the top  and a very lovely brass toe. That's a good close up of that one. Then another character was a half woman  half cheetah    a little homage to my life as an athlete.    hours of prosthetic make up to get into a creature that had articulated paws  claws and a tail that whipped around  like a gecko. And then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these    look like jellyfish legs  also polyurethane. And the only purpose that these legs can serve  outside the context of the film  is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination. So whimsy matters. Today  I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs that various people have made for me  and with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet  and I can change my height    I have a variable of five different heights. Today  I'm  '  . And I had these legs made a little over a year ago at Dorset Orthopedic in England and when I brought them home to Manhattan  my first night out on the town  I went to a very fancy party. And a girl was there who has known me for years at my normal  '  . Her mouth dropped open when she saw me  and she went   But you're so tall   And I said   I know. Isn't it fun   I mean  it's a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts  but I have an entirely new relationship to door jams that I never expected I would ever have. And I was having fun with it. And she looked at me  and she said   But  Aimee  that's not fair.  And the incredible thing was she really meant it. It's not fair that you can change your height  as you want it. And that's when I knew    that's when I knew that the conversation with society has changed profoundly in this last decade. It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency. It's a conversation about augmentation. It's a conversation about potential. A prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore. It can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space. So people that society once considered to be disabled can now become the architects of their own identities and indeed continue to change those identities by designing their bodies from a place of empowerment. And what is exciting to me so much right now is that by combining cutting edge technology    robotics  bionics    with the age old poetry  we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity. I think that if we want to discover the full potential in our humanity  we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths and those glorious disabilities that we all have. I think of Shakespeare's Shylock   If you prick us  do we not bleed  and if you tickle us  do we not laugh   It is our humanity  and all the potential within it  that makes us beautiful.

8,1461,1463,Al Gore 2009,Al Gore,male,What comes after An Inconvenient Truth?,May 2009,445,Last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap  which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower    states  has shrunk by    percent. But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice. The arctic ice cap is  in a sense  the beating heart of the global climate system. It expands in winter and contracts in summer. The next slide I show you will be a rapid fast forward of what's happened over the last    years. The permanent ice is marked in red. As you see  it expands to the dark blue    that's the annual ice in winter  and it contracts in summer. The so called permanent ice  five years old or older  you can see is almost like blood  spilling out of the body here. In    years it's gone from this  to this. This is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean  where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which  when it thaws  is turned into methane by microbes. Compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere  that amount could double if we cross this tipping point. Already in some shallow lakes in Alaska  methane is actively bubbling up out of the water. Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter. Video  Whoa   Laughter  Al Gore  She's okay. The question is whether we will be. And one reason is  this enormous heat sink heats up Greenland from the north. This is an annual melting river. But the volumes are much larger than ever. This is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland. If you want to know how sea level rises from land base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea. These flows are increasing very rapidly. At the other end of the planet  Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet. Last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance. And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under sea islands  is particularly rapid in its melting. That's equal to    feet of sea level  as is Greenland. In the Himalayas  the third largest mass of ice  at the top you see new lakes  which a few years ago were glaciers.    percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow. In the Andes  this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city. The flows have increased. But when they go away  so does much of the drinking water. In California there has been a    percent decline in the Sierra snowpack. This is hitting the reservoirs. And the predictions  as you've read  are serious. This drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires. And the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate. Four times as many in the last    years as in the previous   . This is a completely unsustainable pattern. If you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing. In the last five years we've added    million tons of CO  every    hours       million tons every day to the oceans. Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific  from the Americas  extending westward  and on either side of the Indian subcontinent  where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans. The biggest single cause of global warming  along with deforestation  which is    percent of it  is the burning of fossil fuels. Oil is a problem  and coal is the most serious problem. The United States is one of the two largest emitters  along with China. And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants. But we're beginning to see a sea change. Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed. However there is a political battle in our country. And the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal  which is an oxymoron. That image reminded me of something. Around Christmas  in my home in Tennessee  a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled. You probably saw it on the news. This  all over the country  is the second largest waste stream in America. This happened around Christmas. One of the coal industry's ads around Christmas was this one. Video     Frosty the coal man is a jolly  happy soul. He's abundant here in America  and he helps our economy grow. Frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday. He's affordable and adorable  and workers keep their pay. Al Gore  This is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia. The largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal. Video  Don Blankenship  Let me be clear about it. Al Gore  Nancy Pelosi  Harry Reid  they don't know what they're talking about. Al Gore  So the Alliance for Climate Protection has launched two campaigns. This is one of them  part of one of them. Video  Actor  At COALergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business. That's why we've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal. The fact is  coal isn't dirty. We think it's clean    smells good  too. So don't worry about climate change. Leave that up to us. Video  Actor  Clean coal    you've heard a lot about it. So let's take a tour of this state of the art clean coal facility. Amazing  The machinery is kind of loud. But that's the sound of clean coal technology. And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming  the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything. Take a good long look  this is today's clean coal technology. Al Gore  Finally  the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge. Video  Narrator  America is in crisis    the economy  national security  the climate crisis. The thread that links them all  our addiction to carbon based fuels  like dirty coal and foreign oil. But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess. Repower America with     percent clean electricity within    years. A plan to put America back to work  make us more secure  and help stop global warming. Finally  a solution that's big enough to solve our problems. Repower America. Find out more. Al Gore  This is the last one. Video  Narrator  It's about repowering America. One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet. Man  Future's over here. Wind  sun  a new energy grid. Man     New investments to create high paying jobs. Narrator  Repower America. It's time to get real. Al Gore  There is an old African proverb that says   If you want to go quickly  go alone. If you want to go far  go together.  We need to go far  quickly. Thank you very much.,Climate advocate,200905,5.987342657342657
16,1845,1847,Alex Steffen 2007,Alex Steffen,male,The route to a sustainable future,Apr 2007,1039,When I'm starting talks like this  I usually do a whole spiel about sustainability because a lot of people out there don't know what that is. This is a crowd that does know what it is  so I'll like just do like the    second crib note version. Right  So just bear with me. We'll go real fast  you know  Fill in the blanks. So  you know  sustainability  small planet. Right  Picture a little Earth  circling around the sun. You know  about a million years ago  a bunch of monkeys fell out of trees  got a little clever  harnessed fire  invented the printing press  made  you know  luggage with wheels on it. And  you know  built the society that we now live in. Unfortunately  while this society is  without a doubt  the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created  it's got some major  major flaws. One of them is that every society has an ecological footprint. It has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable. How much stuff goes through your life  how much waste is left behind you. And we  at the moment  in our society  have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this. We're using up about five planets. If everybody on the planet lived the way we did  we'd need between five  six  seven  some people even say    planets to make it. Clearly we don't have    planets. Again  you know  mental  visual     planets  one planet     planets  one planet. Right  We don't have that. So that's one problem. The second problem is that the planet that we have is being used in wildly unfair ways. Right  North Americans  such as myself  you know  we're basically sort of wallowing  gluttonous hogs  and we're eating all sorts of stuff. And  you know  then you get all the way down to people who live in the Asia Pacific region  or even more  Africa. And people simply do not have enough to survive. This is producing all sorts of tensions  all sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing. And there's more and more people on the way. Right  So  this is what the planet's going to look like in    years. It's going to be a pretty crowded place  at least eight billion people. So to make matters even more difficult  it's a very young planet. A third of the people on this planet are kids. And those kids are growing up in a completely different way than their parents did  no matter where they live. They've been exposed to this idea of our society  of our prosperity. And they may not want to live exactly like us. They may not want to be Americans  or Brits  or Germans  or South Africans  but they want their own version of a life which is more prosperous  and more dynamic  and more  you know  enjoyable. And all of these things combine to create an enormous amount of torque on the planet. And if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that torque  we are going to find ourselves more and more and more quickly facing situations which are simply unthinkable. Everybody in this room has heard the worst case scenarios. I don't need to go into that. But I will ask the question  what's the alternative  And I would say that  at the moment  the alternative is unimaginable. You know  so on the one hand we have the unthinkable  on the other hand we have the unimaginable. We don't know yet how to build a society which is environmentally sustainable  which is shareable with everybody on the planet  which promotes stability and democracy and human rights  and which is achievable in the time frame necessary to make it through the challenges we face. We don't know how to do this yet. So what's Worldchanging  Well  Worldchanging you might think of as being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future. You know  what we're out there doing is looking for examples of tools  models and ideas  which  if widely adopted  would change the game. A lot of times  when I do a talk like this  I talk about things that everybody in this room I'm sure has already heard of  but most people haven't. So I thought today I'd do something a little different  and talk about what we're looking for  rather than saying  you know  rather than giving you tried and true examples. Talk about the kinds of things we're scoping out. Give you a little peek into our editorial notebook. And given that I have    minutes to do this  this is going to go kind of quick. So  I don't know  just stick with me. Right  So  first of all  what are we looking for  Bright Green city. One of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world for changing the impact that we have on the planet is changing the way that we live in cities. We're already an urban planet  that's especially true in the developed world. And people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very prosperous  and thus use a lot of stuff. If we can change the dynamic  by first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable ... Here  for example  is Vancouver  which if you haven't been there  you ought to go for a visit. It's a fabulous city. And they are doing density  new density  better than probably anybody else on the planet right now. They're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars  which is a pretty great thing. So you have density. You also have growth management. You leave aside what is natural to be natural. This is in Portland. That is an actual development. That land there will remain pasture in perpetuity. They've bounded the city with a line. Nature  city. Nothing changes. Once you do those things  you can start making all sorts of investments. You can start doing things like  you know  transit systems that actually work to transport people  in effective and reasonably comfortable manners. You can also start to change what you build. This is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London  which is one of the greenest buildings in the world. It's a fabulous place. We're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity  that recycle much of their water  that are much more comfortable than standard buildings  use all natural light  etc.  and  over time  cost less. Green roofs. Bill McDonough covered that last night  so I won't dwell on that too much. But once you also have people living in close proximity to each other  one of the things you can do is    as information technologies develop    you can start to have smart places. You can start to know where things are. When you know where things are  it becomes easier to share them. When you share them  you end up using less. So one great example is car share clubs  which are really starting to take off in the U.S.  have already taken off in many places in Europe  and are a great example. If you're somebody who drives  you know  one day a week  do you really need your own car  Another thing that information technology lets us do is start figuring out how to use less stuff by knowing  and by monitoring  the amount we're actually using. So  here's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use  which I think is a pretty cool concept  although I think it ought to work the other way around  that it gets brighter the more you don't use. But  you know  there may even be a simpler approach. We could just re label things. This light switch that reads  on the one hand  flashfloods  and on the other hand  off. How we build things can change as well. This is a bio morphic building. It takes its inspiration in form from life. Many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful  and also much more effective. This is an example of bio mimicry  which is something we're really starting to look a lot more for. In this case  you have a shell design which was used to create a new kind of exhaust fan  which is greatly more effective. There's a lot of this stuff happening  it's really pretty remarkable. I encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you're into it. We're starting to cover this more and more. There's also neo biological design  where more and more we're actually using life itself and the processes of life to become part of our industry. So this  for example  is hydrogen generating algae. So we have a model in potential  an emerging model that we're looking for of how to take the cities most of us live in  and turn them into Bright Green cities. But unfortunately  most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in. They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world. And there's a statistic I often like to use  which is that we're adding a city of Seattle every four days  a city the size of Seattle to the planet every four days. I was giving a talk about two months ago  and this guy  who'd done some work with the U.N.  came up to me and was really flustered  and he said  look  you've got that totally wrong  it's totally wrong. It's every seven days. So  we're adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days  and most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in. Most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly. They don't have existing infrastructure  they have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty  and enormous numbers of people are trying to figure out how to do things in new ways. So what do we need in order to make developing nation megacities into Bright Green megacities  Well  the first thing we need is  we need leapfrogging. And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere. The idea behind leapfrogging is that if you are a person  or a country  who is stuck in a situation where you don't have the tools and technologies that you need  there's no reason for you to invest in last generation's technologies. Right  That you're much better off  almost universally  looking for a low cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology. One place we're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones. Right  All throughout the developing world  people are going directly to cell phones  skipping the whole landline stage. If there are landlines in many developing world cities  they're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot and cost enormous amounts of money. So I rather like this picture here. I particularly like the Ganesh in the background  talking on the cell phone. So what we have  increasingly  is cell phones just permeating out through society. We've heard all about this here this week  so I won't say too much more than that  other than to say what is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies. The second thing is tools for collaboration  be they systems of collaboration  or intellectual property systems which encourage collaboration. Right  When you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate  you get different kinds of solutions. And those solutions are accessible in a different way to people who don't have capital. Right  So  you know  we have open source software  we have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions. And those things lead to things like this. This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo. This is a pretty remarkable program using free and open source software  cheap  sort of hacked together machines  and basically sort of abandoned buildings    has put together a bunch of community centers where people can come in  get high speed internet access  learn computer programming skills for free. And a quarter million people every year use these now in Sao Paulo. And those quarter million people are some of the poorest people in Sao Paolo. I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back.  Laughter  So one of the things that that's leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion. And one of the things we're really  really interested in at Worldchanging is the ways in which the south is re identifying itself  and re categorizing itself in ways that have less and less to do with most of us in this room. So it's not  you know  Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood. Right  You know  Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels. It's doing something new. There's new things happening. There's interplay between them. And  you know  you get amazing things. Like  I don't know if any of you have seen the movie  City of God   Yeah  it's a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it. And it's all about this question  in a very artistic and indirect kind of way. You have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out. These are people who have just been visited by the Internet bookmobile in Uganda. And who are waving their first books in the air  which  I just think that's a pretty cool picture. You know  So you also have the ability for people to start coming together and acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways  in ways that haven't happened before. And as we heard last night  as we've heard earlier this week  are absolutely  fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions  is we've got to craft new political realities. And I would personally say that we have to craft new political realities  not only in places like India  Afghanistan  Kenya  Pakistan  what have you  but here at home as well. Another world is possible. And sort of the big motto of the anti globalization movement. Right  We tweak that a lot. We talk about how another world isn't just possible  another world's here. That it's not just that we have to sort of imagine there being a different  vague possibility out there  but we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility. We need to start doing things like Lula  President of Brazil. How many people knew of Lula before today  OK  so  much  much better than the average crowd  I can tell you that. So Lula  he's full of problems  full of contradictions  but one of the things that he's doing is  he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that completely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north south dialogue into a whole new way of global collaboration. I would keep your eye on this fellow. Another example of this sort of second superpower thing is the rise of these games that are what we call  serious play.  We're looking a lot at this. This is spreading everywhere. This is from  A Force More Powerful.  It's a little screenshot.  A Force More Powerful  is a video game that  while you're playing it  it teaches you how to engage in non violent insurrection and regime change.  Laughter  Here's another one. This is from a game called  Food Force   which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp. These things are all contributing in a very dynamic way to a huge rise in  especially in the developing world  in people's interest in and passion for democracy. We get so little news about the developing world that we often forget that there are literally millions of people out there struggling to change things to be fairer  freer  more democratic  less corrupt. And  you know  we don't hear those stories enough. But it's happening all over the place  and these tools are part of what's making it possible. Now when you add all those things together  when you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools  you know  second superpower stuff  etc.  what do you get  Well  very quickly  you get a Bright Green future for the developing world. You get  for example  green power spread throughout the world. You get    this is a building in Hyderabad  India. It's the greenest building in the world. You get grassroots solutions  things that work for people who have no capital or limited access. You get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains. You get access to distance medicine. These are Indian nurses learning how to use PDAs to access databases that have information that they don't have access to at home in a distant manner. You get new tools for people in the developing world. These are LED lights that help the roughly billion people out there  for whom nightfall means darkness  to have a new means of operating. These are refrigerators that require no electricity  they're pot within a pot design. And you get water solutions. Water's one of the most pressing problems. Here's a design for harvesting rainwater that's super cheap and available to people in the developing world. Here's a design for distilling water using sunlight. Here's a fog catcher  which  if you live in a moist  jungle like area  will distill water from the air that's clean and drinkable. Here's a way of transporting water. I just love this  you know    I mean carrying water is such a drag  and somebody just came up with the idea of well  what if you rolled it. Right  I mean  that's a great design. This is a fabulous invention  LifeStraw. Basically you can suck any water through this and it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips. So  you know  people who are in desperate straits can get this. This is one of my favorite Worldchanging kinds of things ever. This is a merry go round invented by the company Roundabout  which pumps water as kids play. You know  Seriously    give that one a hand  it's pretty great. And the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis. Right  We're expecting to have upwards of     million refugees by the year      because of climate change and political instability. How do we help people like that  Well  there's all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs that are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet. Some of those designs include models for acting  such as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps. New models for pedagogy for the displaced. And we have new tools. This is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere. Does anyone know what this is  Audience  It detects landmines. Alex Steffen  Exactly  this is a landmine detecting flower. If you are living in one of the places where the roughly half billion unaccounted for mines are scattered  you can fling these seeds out into the field. And as they grow up  they will grow up around the mines  their roots will detect the chemicals in them  and where the flowers turn red you don't step. Yeah  so seeds that could save your life. You know  I also love it because it seems to me that the example  the tools we use to change the world  ought to be beautiful in themselves. You know  that it's not just enough to survive. We've got to make something better than what we've got. And I think that we will. Just to wrap up  in the immortal words of H.G. Wells  I think that better things are on the way. I think that  in fact  that  all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning. All that the human mind has accomplished is but the dream before the awakening.  I hope that that turns out to be true. The people in this room have given me more confidence than ever that it will. Thank you very much.,Planetary futurist,200704,6.239598732840553
17,2023,2025,Alex Steffen 2011,Alex Steffen,male,The shareable future of cities,Aug 2011,600,Climate change is already a heavy topic  and it's getting heavier because we're understanding that we need to do more than we are. We're understanding  in fact  that those of us who live in the developed world need to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions. That's  to put it mildly  not what's on the table now. And it tends to feel a little overwhelming when we look at what is there in reality today and the magnitude of the problem that we face. And when we have overwhelming problems in front of us  we tend to seek simple answers. And I think this is what we've done with climate change. We look at where the emissions are coming from    they're coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth  and we say  okay  well the problem is that they're coming out of fossil fuels that we're burning  so therefore  the answer must be to replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy. And while  of course  we do need clean energy  I would put to you that it's possible that by looking at climate change as a clean energy generation problem  we're in fact setting ourselves up not to solve it. And the reason why is that we live on a planet that is rapidly urbanizing. That shouldn't be news to any of us. However  it's hard sometimes to remember the extent of that urbanization. By mid century  we're going to have about eight billion    perhaps more    people living in cities or within a day's travel of one. We will be an overwhelmingly urban species. In order to provide the kind of energy that it would take for eight billion people living in cities that are even somewhat like the cities that those of us in the global North live in today  we would have to generate an absolutely astonishing amount of energy. It may be possible that we are not even able to build that much clean energy. So if we're seriously talking about tackling climate change on an urbanizing planet  we need to look somewhere else for the solution. The solution  in fact  may be closer to hand than we think  because all of those cities we're building are opportunities. Every city determines to a very large extent the amount of energy used by its inhabitants. We tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing    I choose to turn this light switch on    but really  enormous amounts of our energy use are predestined by the kinds of communities and cities that we live in. I won't show you very many graphs today  but if I can just focus on this one for a moment  it really tells us a lot of what we need to know    which is  quite simply  that if you look  for example  at transportation  a major category of climate emissions  there is a direct relationship between how dense a city is and the amount of climate emissions that its residents spew out into the air. And the correlation  of course  is that denser places tend to have lower emissions    which isn't really all that difficult to figure out  if you think about it. Basically  we substitute  in our lives  access to the things we want. We go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place. And we're basically using mobility to get the access we need. But when we live in a denser community  suddenly what we find  of course  is that the things we need are close by. And since the most sustainable trip is the one that you never had to make in the first place  suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable. And it is possible  of course  to increase the density of the communities around us. Some places are doing this with new eco districts  developing whole new sustainable neighborhoods  which is nice work if you can get it  but most of the time  what we're talking about is  in fact  reweaving the urban fabric that we already have. So we're talking about things like infill development  really sharp little changes to where we have buildings  where we're developing. Urban retrofitting  creating different sorts of spaces and uses out of places that are already there. Increasingly  we're realizing that we don't even need to densify an entire city. What we need instead is an average density that rises to a level where we don't drive as much and so on. And that can be done by raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot. So you can think of it as tent poles that actually raise the density of the entire city. And we find that when we do that  we can  in fact  have a few places that are really hyper dense within a wider fabric of places that are perhaps a little more comfortable and achieve the same results. Now we may find that there are places that are really  really dense and still hold onto their cars  but the reality is that  by and large  what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions is a threshold effect  where people simply stop driving as much  and increasingly  more and more people  if they're surrounded by places that make them feel at home  give up their cars altogether. And this is a huge  huge energy savings  because what comes out of our tailpipe is really just the beginning of the story with climate emissions from cars. We have the manufacture of the car  the disposal of the car  all of the parking and freeways and so on. When you can get rid of all of those because somebody doesn't use any of them really  you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions as much as    percent. And people are embracing this. All around the world  we're seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life. People are saying that it's moving from the idea of the dream home to the dream neighborhood. And when you layer that over with the kind of ubiquitous communications that we're starting to see  what you find is  in fact  even more access suffused into spaces. Some of it's transportation access. This is a Mapnificent map that shows me  in this case  how far I can get from my home in    minutes using public transportation. Some of it is about walking. It's not all perfect yet. This is Google Walking Maps. I asked how to do the greater Ridgeway  and it told me to go via Guernsey. It did tell me that this route maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths  though. But the technologies are getting better  and we're starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation. And as we just heard earlier  of course  we're also learning how to put information on dumb objects. Things that don't have any wiring in them at all  we're learning how to include in these systems of notation and navigation. Part of what we're finding with this is that what we thought was the major point of manufacturing and consumption  which is to get a bunch of stuff  is not  in fact  how we really live best in dense environments. What we're finding is that what we want is access to the capacities of things. My favorite example is a drill. Who here owns a drill  a home power drill  Okay. I do too. The average home power drill is used somewhere between six and    minutes in its entire lifetime  depending on who you ask. And so what we do is we buy these drills that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time  use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit. Our cities  I would put to you  are stockpiles of these surplus capacities. And while we could try and figure out new ways to use those capacities    such as cooking or making ice sculptures or even a mafia hit    what we probably will find is that  in fact  turning those products into services that we have access to when we want them  is a far smarter way to go. And in fact  even space itself is turning into a service. We're finding that people can share the same spaces  do stuff with vacant space. Buildings are becoming bundles of services. So we have new designs that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on    like heating  cooling etc.    and turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on. So we light our buildings with daylight. We cool them with breezes. We heat them with sunshine. In fact  when we use all these things  what we've found is that  in some cases  energy use in a building can drop as much as    percent. Which brings on another threshold effect I like to call furnace dumping  which is  quite simply  if you have a building that doesn't need to be heated with a furnace  you save a whole bunch of money up front. These things actually become cheaper to build than the alternatives. Now when we look at being able to slash our product use  slash our transportation use  slash our building energy use  all of that is great  but it still leaves something behind. And if we're going to really  truly become sustainable cities  we need to think a little differently. This is one way to do it. This is Vancouver's propaganda about how green a city they are. And certainly lots of people have taken to heart this idea that a sustainable city is covered in greenery. So we have visions like this. We have visions like this. We have visions like this. Now all of these are fine projects  but they really have missed an essential point  which is it's not about the leaves above  it's about the systems below. Do they  for instance  capture rainwater so that we can reduce water use  Water is energy intensive. Do they  perhaps  include green infrastructure  so that we can take runoff and water that's going out of our houses and clean it and filter it and grow urban street trees  Do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us by  for example  connecting us to rivers and allowing for restoration  Do they allow for pollination  pollinator pathways that bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities  Do they even take the very waste matter that we have from food and fiber and so forth  and turn it back into soil and sequester carbon    take carbon out of the air in the process of using our cities  I would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible  they're being done right now  and that it's a darn good thing. Because right now  our economy by and large operates as Paul Hawken said   by stealing the future  selling it in the present and calling it GDP.  And if we have another eight billion or seven billion  or six billion  even  people  living on a planet where their cities also steal the future  we're going to run out of future really fast. But if we think differently  I think that  in fact  we can have cities that are not only zero emissions  but have unlimited possibilities as well. Thank you very much.,Planetary futurist,201108,6.264768211920526
28,1067,1069,Anders Fjellberg 2015,Anders Fjellberg,male,Two nameless bodies washed up on the beach. Here are their stories,Oct 2015,874,So this right here is the tiny village of Elle  close to Lista. It's right at the southernmost tip of Norway. And on January   this year  an elderly guy who lives in the village  he went out to see what was cast ashore during a recent storm. And on a patch of grass right next to the water's edge  he found a wetsuit. It was grey and black  and he thought it looked cheap. Out of each leg of the wetsuit there were sticking two white bones. It was clearly the remains of a human being. And usually  in Norway  dead people are identified quickly. So the police started searching through missing reports from the local area  national missing reports  and looked for accidents with a possible connection. They found nothing. So they ran a DNA profile  and they started searching internationally through Interpol. Nothing. This was a person that nobody seemed to be missing. It was an invisible life heading for a nameless grave. But then  after a month  the police in Norway got a message from the police in the Netherlands. A couple of months earlier  they had found a body  in an identical wetsuit  and they had no idea who this person was. But the police in the Netherlands managed to trace the wetsuit by an RFID chip that was sewn in the suit. So they were then able to tell that both wetsuits were bought by the same customer at the same time  October          in the French city of Calais by the English Channel. But this was all they were able to figure out. The customer paid cash. There was no surveillance footage from the shop. So it became a cold case. We heard this story  and it triggered me and my colleague  photographer Tomm Christiansen  and we of course had the obvious question  who were these people  At the time  I'd barely heard about Calais  but it took about two or three seconds to figure out Calais is basically known for two things. It's the spot in continental Europe closest to Britain  and a lot of migrants and refugees are staying in this camp and are trying desperately to cross over to Britain. And right there was a plausible theory about the identity of the two people  and the police made this theory as well. Because if you or I or anybody else with a firm connection to Europe goes missing off the coast of France  people would just know. Your friends or family would report you missing  the police would come search for you  the media would know  and there would be pictures of you on lampposts. It's difficult to disappear without a trace. But if you just fled the war in Syria  and your family  if you have any family left  don't necessarily know where you are  and you're staying here illegally amongst thousands of others who come and go every day. Well  if you disappear one day  nobody will notice. The police won't come search for you because nobody knows you're gone. And this is what happened to Shadi Omar Kataf and Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria. Me and Tomm went to Calais for the first time in April this year  and after three months of investigation  we were able to tell the story about how these two young men fled the war in Syria  ended up stuck in Calais  bought wetsuits and drowned in what seems to have been an attempt to swim across the English Channel in order to reach England. It is a story about the fact that everybody has a name  everybody has a story  everybody is someone. But it is also a story about what it's like to be a refugee in Europe today. So this is where we started our search. This is in Calais. Right now  between       and       people are living here under horrible conditions. It has been dubbed the worst refugee camp in Europe. Limited access to food  limited access to water  limited access to health care. Disease and infections are widespread. And they're all stuck here because they're trying to get to England in order to claim asylum. And they do that by hiding in the back of trucks headed for the ferry  or the Eurotunnel  or they sneak inside the tunnel terminal at night to try to hide on the trains. Most want to go to Britain because they know the language  and so they figure it would be easier to restart their lives from there. They want to work  they want to study  they want to be able to continue their lives. A lot of these people are highly educated and skilled workers. If you go to Calais and talk to refugees  you'll meet lawyers  politicians  engineers  graphic designers  farmers  soldiers. You've got the whole spectrum. But who all of these people are usually gets lost in the way we talk about refugees and migrants  because we usually do that in statistics. So you have    million refugees globally. About half a million have made the crossing over the Mediterranean into Europe so far this year  and roughly       are staying in Calais. But these are numbers  and the numbers don't say anything about who these people are  where they came from  or why they're here. And first  I want to tell you about one of them. This is    year old Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria. We first heard about him after being in Calais the first time looking for answers to the theory of the two dead bodies. And after a while  we heard this story about a Syrian man who was living in Bradford in England  and had been desperately searching for his nephew Mouaz for months. And it turned out the last time anybody had heard anything from Mouaz was October        . That was the same date the wetsuits were bought. So we flew over there and we met the uncle and we did DNA samples of him  and later on got additional DNA samples from Mouaz's closest relative who now lives in Jordan. The analysis concluded the body who was found in a wetsuit on a beach in the Netherlands was actually Mouaz Al Balkhi. And while we were doing all this investigation  we got to know Mouaz's story. He was born in the Syrian capital of Damascus in     . He was raised in a middle class family  and his father in the middle there is a chemical engineer who spent    years in prison for belonging to the political opposition in Syria. While his father was in prison  Mouaz took responsibility and he cared for his three sisters. They said he was that kind of guy. Mouaz studied to become an electrical engineer at the University of Damascus. So a couple of years into the Syrian war  the family fled Damascus and went to the neighboring country  Jordan. Their father had problems finding work in Jordan  and Mouaz could not continue his studies  so he figured   OK  the best thing I can do to help my family would be to go somewhere where I can finish my studies and find work.  So he goes to Turkey. In Turkey  he's not accepted at a university  and once he had left Jordan as a refugee  he was not allowed to reenter. So then he decides to head for the UK  where his uncle lives. He makes it into Algeria  walks into Libya  pays a people smuggler to help him with the crossing into Italy by boat  and from there on he heads to Dunkirk  the city right next to Calais by the English Channel. We know he made at least    failed attempts to cross the English Channel by hiding in a truck. But at some point  he must have given up all hope. The last night we know he was alive  he spent at a cheap hotel close to the train station in Dunkirk. We found his name in the records  and he seems to have stayed there alone. The day after  he went into Calais  entered a sports shop a couple of minutes before   o'clock in the evening  along with Shadi Kataf. They both bought wetsuits  and the woman in the shop was the last person we know of to have seen them alive. We have tried to figure out where Shadi met Mouaz  but we weren't able to do that. But they do have a similar story. We first heard about Shadi after a cousin of his  living in Germany  had read an Arabic translation of the story made of Mouaz on Facebook. So we got in touch with him. Shadi  a couple of years older than Mouaz  was also raised in Damascus. He was a working kind of guy. He ran a tire repair shop and later worked in a printing company. He lived with his extended family  but their house got bombed early in the war. So the family fled to an area of Damascus known as Camp Yarmouk. Yarmouk is being described as the worst place to live on planet Earth. They've been bombed by the military  they've been besieged  they've been stormed by ISIS and they've been cut off from supplies for years. There was a UN official who visited last year  and he said   They ate all the grass so there was no grass left.  Out of a population of          only        are believed to still be left in Yarmouk. Shadi and his sisters got out. The parents are still stuck inside. So Shadi and one of his sisters  they fled to Libya. This was after the fall of Gaddafi  but before Libya turned into full blown civil war. And in this last remaining sort of stability in Libya  Shadi took up scuba diving  and he seemed to spend most of his time underwater. He fell completely in love with the ocean  so when he finally decided that he could no longer be in Libya  late August       he hoped to find work as a diver when he reached Italy. Reality was not that easy. We don't know much about his travels because he had a hard time communicating with his family  but we do know that he struggled. And by the end of September  he was living on the streets somewhere in France. On October    he calls his cousin in Belgium  and explains his situation. He said   I'm in Calais. I need you to come get my backpack and my laptop. I can't afford to pay the people smugglers to help me with the crossing to Britain  but I will go buy a wetsuit and I will swim.  His cousin  of course  tried to warn him not to  but Shadi's battery on the phone went flat  and his phone was never switched on again. What was left of Shadi was found nearly three months later      kilometers away in a wetsuit on a beach in Norway. He's still waiting for his funeral in Norway  and none of his family will be able to attend. Many may think that the story about Shadi and Mouaz is a story about death  but I don't agree. To me  this is a story about two questions that I think we all share  what is a better life  and what am I willing to do to achieve it  And to me  and probably a lot of you  a better life would mean being able to do more of what we think of as meaningful  whether that be spending more time with your family and friends  travel to an exotic place  or just getting money to buy that cool new device or a pair of new sneakers. And this is all within our reach pretty easily. But if you are fleeing a war zone  the answers to those two questions are dramatically different. A better life is a life in safety. It's a life in dignity. A better life means not having your house bombed  not fearing being kidnapped. It means being able to send your children to school  go to university  or just find work to be able to provide for yourself and the ones you love. A better life would be a future of some possibilities compared to nearly none  and that's a strong motivation. And I have no trouble imagining that after spending weeks or even months as a second grade citizen  living on the streets or in a horrible makeshift camp with a stupid  racist name like  The Jungle   most of us would be willing to do just about anything. If I could ask Shadi and Mouaz the second they stepped into the freezing waters of the English Channel  they would probably say   This is worth the risk   because they could no longer see any other option. And that's desperation  but that's the reality of living as a refugee in Western Europe in     . Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you  Anders. This is Tomm Christiansen  who took most of the pictures you have seen and they've done reporting together. Tomm  you two have been back to Calais recently. This was the third trip. It was after the publication of the article. What has changed  What have you seen there  Tomm Christiansen  The first time we were in Calais  it was about       refugees there. They had a difficult time  but they were positive  they had hope. The last time  the camp has grown  maybe four or five thousand people. It seemed more permanent  NGOs have arrived  a small school has opened. But the thing is that the refugees have stayed for a longer time  and the French government has managed to seal off the borders better  so now The Jungle is growing  along with the despair and hopelessness among the refugees. BG  Are you planning to go back  And continue the reporting  TC  Yes. BG  Anders  I'm a former journalist  and to me  it's amazing that in the current climate of slashing budgets and publishers in crisis  Dagbladet has consented so many resources for this story  which tells a lot about newspapers taking the responsibility  but how did you sell it to your editors  Anders Fjellberg  It wasn't easy at first  because we weren't able to know what we actually could figure out. As soon as it became clear that we actually could be able to identify who the first one was  we basically got the message that we could do whatever we wanted  just travel wherever you need to go  do whatever you need to do  just get this done. BG  That's an editor taking responsibility. The story  by the way  has been translated and published across several European countries  and certainly will continue to do. And we want to read the updates from you. Thank you Anders. Thank you Tomm.,Journalist,201510,5.9091773308957904
31,1137,1139,Andrés Ruzo 2016,Andrés Ruzo,male,How I found a mythical boiling river in the Amazon,Feb 2016,939,As a boy in Lima  my grandfather told me a legend of the Spanish conquest of Peru. Atahualpa  emperor of the Inca  had been captured and killed. Pizarro and his conquistadors had grown rich  and tales of their conquest and glory had reached Spain and was bringing new waves of Spaniards  hungry for gold and glory. They would go into towns and ask the Inca   Where's another civilization we can conquer  Where's more gold   And the Inca  out of vengeance  told them   Go to the Amazon. You'll find all the gold you want there. In fact  there is a city called Paititi    El Dorado in Spanish    made entirely of gold.  The Spanish set off into the jungle  but the few that return come back with stories  stories of powerful shamans  of warriors with poisoned arrows  of trees so tall they blotted out the sun  spiders that ate birds  snakes that swallowed men whole and a river that boiled. All this became a childhood memory. And years passed. I'm working on my PhD at SMU  trying to understand Peru's geothermal energy potential  when I remember this legend  and I began asking that question. Could the boiling river exist  I asked colleagues from universities  the government  oil  gas and mining companies  and the answer was a unanimous no. And this makes sense. You see  boiling rivers do exist in the world  but they're generally associated with volcanoes. You need a powerful heat source to produce such a large geothermal manifestation. And as you can see from the red dots here  which are volcanoes  we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon  nor in most of Peru. So it follows  We should not expect to see a boiling river. Telling this same story at a family dinner  my aunt tells me   But no  Andr s  I've been there. I've swum in that river.  Then my uncle jumps in.  No  Andr s  she's not kidding. You see  you can only swim in it after a very heavy rain  and it's protected by a powerful shaman. Your aunt  she's friends with his wife.    C mo     Huh    You know  despite all my scientific skepticism  I found myself hiking into the jungle  guided by my aunt  over     kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center  and well  honestly  mentally preparing myself to behold the legendary  warm stream of the Amazon.  But then ... I heard something  a low surge that got louder and louder as we came closer. It sounded like ocean waves constantly crashing  and as we got closer  I saw smoke  vapor  coming up through the trees. And then  I saw this. I immediately grabbed for my thermometer  and the average temperatures in the river were    degrees C. This is not quite the     degree C boiling but definitely close enough. The river flowed hot and fast. I followed it upriver and was led by  actually  the shaman's apprentice to the most sacred site on the river. And this is what's bizarre    It starts off as a cold stream. And here  at this site  is the home of the Yacumama  mother of the waters  a giant serpent spirit who births hot and cold water. And here we find a hot spring  mixing with cold stream water underneath her protective motherly jaws and thus bringing their legends to life. The next morning  I woke up and    I asked for tea. I was handed a mug  a tea bag and  well  pointed towards the river. To my surprise  the water was clean and had a pleasant taste  which is a little weird for geothermal systems. What was amazing is that the locals had always known about this place  and that I was by no means the first outsider to see it. It was just part of their everyday life. They drink its water. They take in its vapor. They cook with it  clean with it  even make their medicines with it. I met the shaman  and he seemed like an extension of the river and his jungle. He asked for my intentions and listened carefully. Then  to my tremendous relief    I was freaking out  to be honest with you    a smile began to snake across his face  and he just laughed. I had received the shaman's blessing to study the river  on the condition that after I take the water samples and analyze them in my lab  wherever I was in the world  that I pour the waters back into the ground so that  as the shaman said  the waters could find their way back home. I've been back every year since that first visit in       and the fieldwork has been exhilarating  demanding and at times dangerous. One story was even featured in National Geographic Magazine. I was trapped on a small rock about the size of a sheet of paper in sandals and board shorts  in between an    degree C river and a hot spring that  well  looked like this  close to boiling. And on top of that  it was Amazon rain forest. Pshh  pouring rain  couldn't see a thing. The temperature differential made it all white. It was a whiteout. Intense. Now  after years of work  I'll soon be submitting my geophysical and geochemical studies for publication. And I'd like to share  today  with all of you here  on the TED stage  for the first time  some of these discoveries. Well  first off  it's not a legend. Surprise  When I first started the research  the satellite imagery was too low resolution to be meaningful. There were just no good maps. Thanks to the support of the Google Earth team  I now have this. Not only that  the indigenous name of the river  Shanay timpishka   boiled with the heat of the sun   indicating that I'm not the first to wonder why the river boils  and showing that humanity has always sought to explain the world around us. So why does the river boil  It actually took me three years to get that footage. Fault fed hot springs. As we have hot blood running through our veins and arteries  so  too  the earth has hot water running through its cracks and faults. Where these arteries come to the surface  these earth arteries  we'll get geothermal manifestations  fumaroles  hot springs and in our case  the boiling river. What's truly incredible  though  is the scale of this place. Next time you cross the road  think about this. The river flows wider than a two lane road along most of its path. It flows hot for  .   kilometers. Truly impressive. There are thermal pools larger than this TED stage  and that waterfall that you see there is six meters tall    and all with near boiling water. We mapped the temperatures along the river  and this was by far the most demanding part of the fieldwork. And the results were just awesome. Sorry    the geoscientist in me coming out. And it showed this amazing trend. You see  the river starts off cold. It then heats up  cools back down  heats up  cools back down  heats up again  and then has this beautiful decay curve until it smashes into this cold river. Now  I understand not all of you are geothermal scientists  so to put it in more everyday terms  Everyone loves coffee. Yes  Good. Your regular cup of coffee     degrees C  an extra hot one  well    . So  put in coffee shop terms  the boiling river plots like this. There you have your hot coffee. Here you have your extra hot coffee  and you can see that there's a bit point there where the river is still hotter than even the extra hot coffee. And these are average water temperatures. We took these in the dry season to ensure the purest geothermal temperatures. But there's a magic number here that's not being shown  and that number is    degrees C  because that's where things start to hurt  and I know this from very personal experience. Above that temperature  you don't want to get in that water. You need to be careful. It can be deadly. I've seen all sorts of animals fall in  and what's shocking to me  is the process is pretty much the same. So they fall in and the first thing to go are the eyes. Eyes  apparently  cook very quickly. They turn this milky white color. The stream is carrying them. They're trying to swim out  but their meat is cooking on the bone because it's so hot. So they're losing power  losing power  until finally they get to a point where hot water goes into their mouths and they cook from the inside out. A bit sadistic  aren't we  Jeez. Leave them marinating for a little longer. What's  again  amazing are these temperatures. They're similar to things that I've seen on volcanoes all over the world and even super volcanoes like Yellowstone. But here's the thing  the data is showing that the boiling river exists independent of volcanism. It's neither magmatic or volcanic in origin  and again  over     kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center. How can a boiling river exist like this  I've asked geothermal experts and volcanologists for years  and I'm still unable to find another non volcanic geothermal system of this magnitude. It's unique. It's special on a global scale. So  still    how does it work  Where do we get this heat  There's still more research to be done to better constrain the problem and better understand the system  but from what the data is telling us now  it looks to be the result of a large hydrothermal system. Basically  it works like this  So  the deeper you go into the earth  the hotter it gets. We refer to this as the geothermal gradient. The waters could be coming from as far away as glaciers in the Andes  then seeping down deep into the earth and coming out to form the boiling river after getting heated up from the geothermal gradient  all due to this unique geologic setting. Now  we found that in and around the river    this is working with colleagues from National Geographic  Dr. Spencer Wells  and Dr. Jon Eisen from UC Davis    we genetically sequenced the extremophile lifeforms living in and around the river  and have found new lifeforms  unique species living in the boiling river. But again  despite all of these studies  all of these discoveries and the legends  a question remains  What is the significance of the boiling river  What is the significance of this stationary cloud that always hovers over this patch of jungle  And what is the significance of a detail in a childhood legend  To the shaman and his community  it's a sacred site. To me  as a geoscientist  it's a unique geothermal phenomenon. But to the illegal loggers and cattle farmers  it's just another resource to exploit. And to the Peruvian government  it's just another stretch of unprotected land ready for development. My goal is to ensure that whoever controls this land understands the boiling river's uniqueness and significance. Because that's the question  one of significance. And the thing there is  we define significance. It's us. We have that power. We are the ones who draw that line between the sacred and the trivial. And in this age  where everything seems mapped  measured and studied  in this age of information  I remind you all that discoveries are not just made in the black void of the unknown but in the white noise of overwhelming data. There remains so much to explore. We live in an incredible world. So go out. Be curious. Because we do live in a world where shamans still sing to the spirits of the jungle  where rivers do boil and where legends do come to life. Thank you very much.,,201602,6.26464135021096
38,710,712,Arthur Benjamin 2007,Arthur Benjamin,male,"A performance of ""Mathemagic""",Dec 2007,904,Good morning  ladies and gentlemen. My name is Art Benjamin  and I am a  mathemagician.  What that means is  I combine my loves of math and magic to do something I call  mathemagics.  But before I get started  I have a quick question for the audience. By any chance  did anyone happen to bring with them this morning a calculator  Seriously  if you have a calculator with you  raise your hand. Raise your hand. Did your hand go up  Now bring it out  bring it out. Anybody else  I see  I see one way in the back. You sir  that's three. And anybody on this side here  OK  over there on the aisle. Would the four of you please bring out your calculators  then join me up on stage. Let's give them a nice round of applause. That's right. Now  since I haven't had the chance to work with these calculators  I need to make sure that they are all working properly. Would somebody get us started by giving us a two digit number  please  How about a two digit number  Audience    . AB    . And another two digit number  sir  Audience    . AB  Multiply    times     make sure you get        or the calculators are not working. Do all of you get               Volunteer  No. AB     . Let's give three of them a nice round of applause there. Would you like to try a more standard calculator  just in case  OK  great. What I'm going to try and do then    I notice it took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer. That's OK. I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator. There is something called the square of a number  which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself. For instance  five squared would be  Audience    . AB    . The way we can square on most calculators    let me demonstrate with this one    is by taking the number  such as five  hitting  times  and then  equals   and on most calculators that will give you the square. On some of these ancient RPN calculators  you've got an  x squared  button on it  will allow you to do the calculation even faster. What I'm going to try and do now is to square  in my head  four two digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators  even using the shortcut method. What I'll use is the second row this time  and I'll get four of you to each yell out a two digit number  and if you would square the first number  and if you would square the second  the third and the fourth  I will try and race you to the answer. OK  So quickly  a two digit number please. Audience    . Arthur Benjamin     squared  OK. Audience    . AB     squared  OK. Audience    . AB     squared  OK  and finally  Audience    . AB     squared. Would you call out your answers  please  Volunteer      . AB      . Volunteer     . AB     . Volunteer      . AB      . Volunteer      . AB  Thank you very much. Let me try to take this one step further. I'm going to try to square some three digit numbers this time. I won't even write these down    I'll just call them out as they're called out to me. Anyone I point to  call out a three digit number. Anyone on our panel  verify the answer. Just give some indication if it's right. A three digit number  sir  yes  Audience     . AB      squared is        . AB  Yes  Good. Another three digit       another three digit number  sir  Audience     . AB      squared is        .          AB  Yes  OK  another  another three digit number  sir  Audience     . AB      is        .        . Yes  One more three digit number please. Audience  Oh     . AB      is      that's a harder one. Is that          Volunteer  Yes. AB  Yes  Oh  one more  one more three digit number please. Audience     .     squared is       . Volunteer  Yes. Thank you very much. Let me try to take this one step further. I'm going to try to square a four digit number this time. You can all take your time on this  I will not beat you to the answer on this one  but I will try to get the answer right. To make this a little bit more random  let's take the fourth row this time  let's say  one  two  three  four. If each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine  that will be the four digit number that I'll square. Nine. Seven. Five. Eight.        this will take me a little bit of time  so bear with me.    million             Volunteer  Yes  AB  Thank you very much. Now  I would attempt to square a five digit number    and I can    but unfortunately  most calculators cannot. Eight digit capacity    don't you hate that  So  since we've reached the limits of our calculators    what's that  Does yours go higher  Volunteer  I don't know. AB  Oh  yours does  Volunteer  I can probably do it. AB  I'll talk to you later. In the meanwhile  let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier. Let's take the largest number on the board here      . Would you each enter that on your calculator  And instead of squaring it this time  I want you to take that number and multiply it by any three digit number that you want  but don't tell me what you're multiplying by    just multiply it by any random three digit number. So you should have as an answer either a six digit or probably a seven digit number. How many digits do you have  six or seven  Seven  and yours  Seven  Seven  And  uncertain. Seven. Is there any possible way that I could know what seven digit numbers you have  Say  No.  Good  then I shall attempt the impossible    or at least the improbable. What I'd like each of you to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits  any six of them  in any order you'd like. One digit at a time  I shall try and determine the digit you've left out. Starting with your seven digit number  call out any six of them please. Volunteer                  . AB  Did you leave out the number    Good  OK  that's one. You have a seven digit number  call out any six of them please. Volunteer               . I think I only heard five numbers. I    wait             did you leave out the number    Same as she did  OK. You've got a seven digit number    call out any six of them loud and clear. Volunteer                  . I think you left out the number    AB  That's three. The odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in            to the fourth power. OK  any six of them. Really scramble them up this time  please. Volunteer                  . Did you leave out the number    And let's give all four of these people a nice round of applause. Thank you very much. For my next number    while I mentally recharge my batteries  I have one more question for the audience. By any chance  does anybody here happen to know the day of the week that they were born on  If you think you know your birth day  raise your hand. Let's see  starting with    let's start with a gentleman first. What year was it  first of all  That's why I pick a gentleman first. Audience      .       and the month  November what    rd    was that a Monday  Audience  Yes. Good. Somebody else  I haven't seen any women's hands up. OK  how about you  what year        and the month  October what  Fifth    was that a Wednesday  Yes  I'll go way to the back right now  how about you  Yell it out  what year  Audience      .       OK    and the month  Audience  February. February what  Sixth    was that a Friday  Audience  Yes. Good  how about the person behind her  Call out  what year was it  Audience      . AB        and the month  Audience  May. AB  May what  Seventh    would that be a Wednesday  Audience  Yes. AB  Thank you very much. Anybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born  We can do it that way. Of course  I could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know  so I come prepared for that. I brought with me a book of calendars. It goes as far back into the past as       because you never know. I didn't mean to look at you  sir    you were just sitting there. Anyway  Chris  you can help me out here  if you wouldn't mind. This is a book of calendars. Who wanted to know their birth day  What year was it  first of all  Audience      .       turn to the calendar with     . And what month  Audience  April. AB  April what  Audience    th. I believe that was a Sunday. Can you confirm  Chris  Chris Anderson  Yes. AB  I'll tell you what  Chris  as long as you have that book in front of you  do me a favor  turn to a year outside of the     s  either into the     s or way into the     s    that'll be a much greater challenge for me. AB  What year would you like  CA      . AB        OK. AB  And what month  CA  June. AB  June what  CA  Sixth. AB  Was that a Sunday  CA  It was. AB  And it was cloudy. Good  thank you very much. But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation. There was a gentleman up here who had a    digit calculator. Where is he  would you stand up     digit guy  OK  stand up for me just for a second  so I can see where you are. You have a    digit calculator  sir  as well  OK  what I'm going to try and do  is to square in my head a five digit number requiring a    digit calculator. But to make my job more interesting for you  as well as for me  I'm going to do this problem thinking out loud. So you can actually  honestly hear what's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size. Now  I have to apologize to our magician friend Lennart Green. I know as a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets  but I'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week  so    I think we're OK. So  let's see  let's take a different row of people  starting with you. I'll get five digits  one  two  three  four. Oh  I did this row already. Let's do the row before you  starting with you  one  two  three  four  five. Call out a single digit    that will be the five digit number that I will try to square  go ahead. Five. Seven. Six. Eight. Three.           squared. Yuck. Let me explain to you how I'm going to attempt this problem. I'm going to break the problem down into three parts. I'll do        squared  plus     squared  plus        times     times two. Add all those numbers together  and with any luck  arrive at the answer. Now  let me recap. Thank you. While I explain something else       I know  that you can use  right  While I do these calculations  you might hear certain words  as opposed to numbers  creep into the calculation. Let me explain what that is. This is a phonetic code  a mnemonic device that I use  that allows me to convert numbers into words. I store them as words  and later on retrieve them as numbers. I know it sounds complicated  it's not. I don't want you to think you're seeing something out of  Rain Man.  There's definitely a method to my madness    definitely  definitely. Sorry. If you want to talk to me about ADHD afterwards  you can talk to me then. By the way  one last instruction  for my judges with the calculators    you know who you are    there is at least a    percent chance that I will make a mistake here. If I do  don't tell me what the mistake is  just say   you're close   or something like that  and I'll try and figure out the answer    which could be pretty entertaining in itself. If  however  I am right  whatever you do  don't keep it to yourself  OK  Make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right  because this is my big finish  OK. So  without any more stalling  here we go. I'll start the problem in the middle  with    times    .    times    is        plus     is       that's        plus             plus     is       .         double that to get       .        becomes cookie fission  cookie fission is       . That seems right  I'll go on. Cookie fission  OK. Next  I do    squared  which is        so I can say  three billion. Take the      add that to cookie       oops  but I see a carry coming           add that to cookie      plus     is     million    fission  fission  OK  finally  we do     squared  that's     times      plus    squared is          rev up if I need it  rev up  take the      add that to fission  to get  oh gee           . Audience  Yeah  AB  Good. Thank you very much. I hope you enjoyed mathemagics. Thank you.,Mathemagician,200712,6.124809619238475
39,1497,1499,Arthur Benjamin 2009,Arthur Benjamin,male,Teach statistics before calculus!,Jun 2009,153,Now  if President Obama invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics  then I would have a suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country. And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive. The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra. And everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject. And at top of that pyramid  it's calculus. And I'm here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ... that the correct summit    that all of our students  every high school graduate should know    should be statistics  probability and statistics. I mean  don't get me wrong. Calculus is an important subject. It's one of the great products of the human mind. The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus. And every student who studies math  science  engineering  economics  they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college. But I'm here to say  as a professor of mathematics  that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious  meaningful way  in their day to day lives. On the other hand  statistics    that's a subject that you could  and should  use on daily basis. Right  It's risk. It's reward. It's randomness. It's understanding data. I think if our students  if our high school students    if all of the American citizens    knew about probability and statistics  we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today.  Laughter   Applause  Not only    thank you    not only that ... but if it's taught properly  it can be a lot of fun. I mean  probability and statistics  it's the mathematics of games and gambling. It's analyzing trends. It's predicting the future. Look  the world has changed from analog to digital. And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital  from the more classical  continuous mathematics  to the more modern  discrete mathematics    the mathematics of uncertainty  of randomness  of data    that being probability and statistics. In summary  instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus  I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means. And I mean it. Thank you very much.,Mathemagician,200906,6.112916666666668
52,1393,1395,Bill Gates 2009,Bill Gates,male,"Mosquitos, malaria and education",Feb 2009,1189,I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation  sharing some of the problems. And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that    being honest about what was going well  what wasn't  and making it kind of an annual thing. A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems  because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally. That is  the market does not drive the scientists  the communicators  the thinkers  the governments to do the right things. And only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to. So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand. But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist. Any tough problem  I think it can be solved. And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past. Over the past century  average lifespan has more than doubled. Another statistic  perhaps my favorite  is to look at childhood deaths. As recently as           million children were born  and    million of those died before the age of five. Five years ago      million children were born    so  more    and less than    million of them died before the age of five. So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate. It's a phenomenal thing. Each one of those lives matters a lot. And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs  vaccines that were used more widely. For example  measles was four million of the deaths back as recently as      and now is under        . So we really can make changes. The next breakthrough is to cut that    million in half again. And I think that's doable in well under    years. Why  Well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths  diarrhea  pneumonia and malaria. So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning  which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos  Well  what's the history of this disease  It's been a severe disease for thousands of years. In fact  if we look at the genetic code  it's the only disease we can see that people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths. Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the     s. So it was absolutely gigantic. And the disease was all over the world. A terrible disease. It was in the United States. It was in Europe. People didn't know what caused it until the early     s  when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos. So it was everywhere. And two tools helped bring the death rate down. One was killing the mosquitos with DDT. The other was treating the patients with quinine  or quinine derivatives. And so that's why the death rate did come down. Now  ironically  what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones  which is where the rich countries are. So we can see        it's everywhere.       it's still most places.       the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.       you've gotten most of the northern areas. And more recently you can see it's just around the equator. And so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries  it doesn't get much investment. For example  there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria. Now  baldness  it's a terrible thing. And rich men are afflicted. And so that's why that priority has been set. But  malaria    even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact. Over     million people at any one time are suffering from it. It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much. Now  malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos. I brought some here  just so you could experience this. We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit. There's no reason only poor people should have the experience. Those mosquitos are not infected. So we've come up with a few new things. We've got bed nets. And bed nets are a great tool. What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night  so the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them. And when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over    percent. And that's happened now in a number of countries. It's great to see. But we have to be careful because malaria    the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves. So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective. And so you end up with two choices. If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way  you do it vigorously  you can actually get a local eradication. And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking. Or  if you go in kind of half heartedly  for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden  but eventually those tools will become ineffective  and the death rate will soar back up again. And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention. Now we're on the upswing. Bed net funding is up. There's new drug discovery going on. Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months. And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective. So we're going to have these new tools. But that alone doesn't give us the road map. Because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things. It involves communicators to keep the funding high  to keep the visibility high  to tell the success stories. It involves social scientists  so we know how to get not just    percent of the people to use the bed nets  but    percent. We need mathematicians to come in and simulate this  to do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together. Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise. We need rich world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things. And so as these elements come together  I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria. Now let me turn to a second question  a fairly different question  but I'd say equally important. And this is  How do you make a teacher great  It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on  and we'd understand very well. And the answer is  really  that we don't. Let's start with why this is important. Well  all of us here  I'll bet  had some great teachers. We all had a wonderful education. That's part of the reason we're here today  part of the reason we're successful. I can say that  even though I'm a college drop out. I had great teachers. In fact  in the United States  the teaching system has worked fairly well. There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places. So the top    percent of students have gotten a good education. And those top    percent have been the best in the world  if you measure them against the other top    percent. And they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the U.S. at the forefront. Now  the strength for those top    percent is starting to fade on a relative basis  but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting. Not only has that been weak. it's getting weaker. And if you look at the economy  it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education. And we have to change this. We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity. We have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education  like science and mathematics. When I first learned the statistics  I was pretty stunned at how bad things are. Over    percent of kids never finish high school. And that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year. Because they weren't tracking where the kids were before that. But most of the dropouts had taken place before that. They had to raise the stated dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over    percent. For minority kids  it's over    percent. And even if you graduate from high school  if you're low income  you have less than a    percent chance of ever completing a college degree. If you're low income in the United States  you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four year degree. And that doesn't seem entirely fair. So  how do you make education better  Now  our foundation  for the last nine years  has invested in this. There's many people working on it. We've worked on small schools  we've funded scholarships  we've done things in libraries. A lot of these things had a good effect. But the more we looked at it  the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing. And we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers  between  say  the top quartile    the very best    and the bottom quartile. How much variation is there within a school or between schools  And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable. A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class    based on test scores    by over    percent in a single year. What does that mean  That means that if the entire U.S.  for two years  had top quartile teachers  the entire difference between us and Asia would go away. Within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away. So  it's simple. All you need are those top quartile teachers. And so you'd say   Wow  we should reward those people. We should retain those people. We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people.  But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today. What are the characteristics of this top quartile  What do they look like  You might think these must be very senior teachers. And the answer is no. Once somebody has taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter. The variation is very  very small. You might think these are people with master's degrees. They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education. This chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality. That bottom thing  which says there's no effect at all  is a master's degree. Now  the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded. One is seniority. Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension. The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree. But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher. Teach for America  slight effect. For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect. But  overwhelmingly  it's your past performance. There are some people who are very good at this. And we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it  to raise the average capability    or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system. You might say   Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave   The answer is  on average  the slightly better teachers leave the system. And it's a system with very high turnover. Now  there are a few places    very few    where great teachers are being made. A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP. KIPP means Knowledge Is Power. It's an unbelievable thing. They have    schools    mostly middle schools  some high schools    and what goes on is great teaching. They take the poorest kids  and over    percent of their high school graduates go to four year colleges. And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools. They're team teaching. They're constantly improving their teachers. They're taking data  the test scores  and saying to a teacher   Hey  you caused this amount of increase.  They're deeply engaged in making teaching better. When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms  at first it's very bizarre. I sat down and I thought   What is going on   The teacher was running around  and the energy level was high. I thought   I'm in the sports rally or something. What's going on   And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention  which kids were bored  and calling kids rapidly  putting things up on the board. It was a very dynamic environment  because particularly in those middle school years    fifth through eighth grade    keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention  nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there. Everybody needs to be involved. And so KIPP is doing it. How does that compare to a normal school  Well  in a normal school  teachers aren't told how good they are. The data isn't gathered. In the teacher's contract  it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom    sometimes to once per year. And they need advanced notice to do that. So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers  some of them just making crap and the management is told   Hey  you can only come down here once a year  but you need to let us know  because we might actually fool you  and try and do a good job in that one brief moment.  Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it. They don't have the test scores  and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data. For example  New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers. And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction. But I'm optimistic about this  I think there are some clear things we can do. First of all  there's a lot more testing going on  and that's given us the picture of where we are. And that allows us to understand who's doing it well  and call them out  and find out what those techniques are. Of course  digital video is cheap now. Putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all public schools. And so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say   OK  here's a little clip of something I thought I did well. Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly. Advise me    when this kid acted up  how should I have dealt with that   And they could all sit and work together on those problems. You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it  have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff. You can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course  learn from that. If you have a kid who's behind  you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept. And in fact  these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet  but you could make it so that DVDs were always available  and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers. And so by thinking of this as a personnel system  we can do it much better. Now there's a book actually  about KIPP    the place that this is going on    that Jay Matthews  a news reporter  wrote    called   Work Hard  Be Nice.  And I thought it was so fantastic. It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does. I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book. Now  we put a lot of money into education  and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have. In fact we have in the stimulus bill    it's interesting    the House version actually had money in it for these data systems  and it was taken out in the Senate because there are people who are threatened by these things. But I    I'm optimistic. I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is  and it really can make a difference for millions of lives  if we get it right. I only had time to frame those two problems. There's a lot more problems like that    AIDS  pneumonia    I can just see you're getting excited  just at the very name of these things. And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad. You know  the system doesn't naturally make it happen. Governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way. The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things. So it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things  get other people involved    and you're helping to come up with solutions. And with that  I think there's some great things that will come out of it. Thank you.,Philanthropist,200902,6.0336083916083885
53,1634,1636,Bill Gates 2010,Bill Gates,male,Innovating to zero!,Feb 2010,1652,I'm going to talk today about energy and climate. And that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work at the Foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds  about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives. But energy and climate are extremely important to these people    in fact  more important than to anyone else on the planet. The climate getting worse means that many years  their crops won't grow  There will be too much rain  not enough rain  things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support. And that leads to starvation  it leads to uncertainty  it leads to unrest. So  the climate changes will be terrible for them. Also  the price of energy is very important to them. In fact  if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of  to reduce poverty  by far you would pick energy. Now  the price of energy has come down over time. Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy. The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution  and  even in the     s we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity  and that's why we have refrigerators  air conditioning  we can make modern materials and do so many things. And so  we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world. But  as we make it cheaper    and let's go for making it twice as cheap    we need to meet a new constraint  and that constraint has to do with CO . CO  is warming the planet  and the equation on CO  is actually a very straightforward one. If you sum up the CO  that gets emitted  that leads to a temperature increase  and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects  the effects on the weather  perhaps worse  the indirect effects  in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes  and so you get ecosystem collapses. Now  the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO  to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are  there's some uncertainty there  but not very much. And there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be  but they will be extremely bad. I asked the top scientists on this several times  Do we really have to get down to near zero  Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter  And the answer is that until we get near to zero  the temperature will continue to rise. And so that's a big challenge. It's very different than saying  We're a twelve foot high truck trying to get under a ten foot bridge  and we can just sort of squeeze under.  This is something that has to get to zero. Now  we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year  over    billion tons. For each American  it's about    tons  for people in poor countries  it's less than one ton. It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet. And  somehow  we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero. It's been constantly going up. It's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all  so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling  and falling all the way to zero. This equation has four factors  a little bit of multiplication  So  you've got a thing on the left  CO   that you want to get to zero  and that's going to be based on the number of people  the services each person's using on average  the energy on average for each service  and the CO  being put out per unit of energy. So  let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero. Probably  one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero. Now that's back from high school algebra  but let's take a look. First  we've got population. The world today has  .  billion people. That's headed up to about nine billion. Now  if we do a really great job on new vaccines  health care  reproductive health services  we could lower that by  perhaps     or    percent  but there we see an increase of about  . . The second factor is the services we use. This encompasses everything  the food we eat  clothing  TV  heating. These are very good things  getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet. And it's a great thing for this number to go up. In the rich world  perhaps the top one billion  we probably could cut back and use less  but every year  this number  on average  is going to go up  and so  over all  that will more than double the services delivered per person. Here we have a very basic service  Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework  And  in fact  these kids don't  so they're going out and reading their school work under the street lamps. Now  efficiency  E  the energy for each service  here finally we have some good news. We have something that's not going up. Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting  through different types of cars  different ways of building buildings    there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially. Some individual services even bring it down by    percent. There are other services like how we make fertilizer  or how we do air transport  where the rooms for improvement are far  far less. And so  overall here  if we're optimistic  we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even  perhaps  a factor of six. But for these first three factors now  we've gone from    billion to  at best  maybe    billion tons  and that just won't cut it. So let's look at this fourth factor    this is going to be a key one    and this is the amount of CO  put out per each unit of energy. And so the question is  Can you actually get that to zero  If you burn coal  no. If you burn natural gas  no. Almost every way we make electricity today  except for the emerging renewables and nuclear  puts out CO . And so  what we're going to have to do at a global scale  is create a new system. And so  we need energy miracles. Now  when I use the term  miracle   I don't mean something that's impossible. The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle. The Internet and its services are a miracle. So  the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles. Usually  we don't have a deadline  where you have to get the miracle by a certain date. Usually  you just kind of stand by  and some come along  some don't. This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline. Now  I thought   How could I really capture this  Is there some kind of natural illustration  some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here   I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos  and somehow people enjoyed that. It really got them involved in the idea of  you know  there are people who live with mosquitos. So  with energy  all I could come up with is this. I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year. So here we have some natural fireflies. I'm told they don't bite  in fact  they might not even leave that jar. Now  there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one  but they don't really add up to much. We need solutions    either one or several    that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability  and  although there's many directions people are seeking  I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers. I've left out tide  geothermal  fusion  biofuels. Those may make some contribution  and if they can do better than I expect  so much the better  but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five  and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting  because they all have significant challenges. Let's look first at the burning fossil fuels  either burning coal or burning natural gas. What you need to do there  seems like it might be simple  but it's not  and that's to take all the CO   after you've burned it  going out the flue  pressurize it  create a liquid  put it somewhere  and hope it stays there. Now we have some pilot things that do this at the    to    percent level  but getting up to that full percentage  that will be very tricky  and agreeing on where these CO  quantities should be put will be hard  but the toughest one here is this long term issue. Who's going to be sure  Who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things  This is a lot of volume. So that's a tough one. Next would be nuclear. It also has three big problems  Cost  particularly in highly regulated countries  is high  the issue of the safety  really feeling good about nothing could go wrong  that  even though you have these human operators  that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons. And then what do you do with the waste  And  although it's not very large  there are a lot of concerns about that. People need to feel good about it. So three very tough problems that might be solvable  and so  should be worked on. The last three of the five  I've grouped together. These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources. And they actually    although it's great they don't require fuel    they have some disadvantages. One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant. This is energy farming  so you're talking about many square miles  thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant. Also  these are intermittent sources. The sun doesn't shine all day  it doesn't shine every day  and  likewise  the wind doesn't blow all the time. And so  if you depend on these sources  you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it's not available. So  we've got big cost challenges here  we have transmission challenges  for example  say this energy source is outside your country  you not only need the technology  but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere. And  finally  this storage problem. And  to dimensionalize this  I went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made    for cars  for computers  for phones  for flashlights  for everything    and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses  and what I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than    minutes of all the energy. And so  in fact  we need a big breakthrough here  something that's going to be a factor of     better than the approaches we have now. It's not impossible  but it's not a very easy thing. Now  this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source to be above  say     to    percent of what you're using. If you're counting on it for     percent  you need an incredible miracle battery. Now  how we're going to go forward on this    what's the right approach  Is it a Manhattan Project  What's the thing that can get us there  Well  we need lots of companies working on this  hundreds. In each of these five paths  we need at least a hundred people. And a lot of them  you'll look at and say   They're crazy.  That's good. And  I think  here in the TED group  we have many people who are already pursuing this. Bill Gross has several companies  including one called eSolar that has some great solar thermal technologies. Vinod Khosla's investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities  and I'm trying to help back that. Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company that  perhaps surprisingly  is actually taking the nuclear approach. There are some innovations in nuclear  modular  liquid. And innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago  so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising. The idea of TerraPower is that  instead of burning a part of uranium    the one percent  which is the U       we decided   Let's burn the    percent  the U   .  It is kind of a crazy idea. In fact  people had talked about it for a long time  but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not  and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that  yes  with the right material's approach  this looks like it would work. And  because you're burning that    percent  you have greatly improved cost profile. You actually burn up the waste  and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today's reactors. So  instead of worrying about them  you just take that. It's a great thing. It breathes this uranium as it goes along  so it's kind of like a candle. You can see it's a log there  often referred to as a traveling wave reactor. In terms of fuel  this really solves the problem. I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky. This is the leftover  the    percent  where they've taken out the part they burn now  so it's called depleted uranium. That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years. And  simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process  you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet. So  you know  it's got lots of challenges ahead  but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward. So let's think  How should we measure ourselves  What should our report card look like  Well  let's go out to where we really need to get  and then look at the intermediate. For       you've heard many people talk about this    percent reduction. That really is very important  that we get there. And that    percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries  still some agriculture  hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry  cement. So  to get to that    percent  the developed countries  including countries like China  will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether. So  the other grade is  Are we deploying this zero emission technology  have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we're in the process of getting it elsewhere  That's super important. That's a key element of making that report card. So  backing up from there  what should the      report card look like  Well  again  it should have the two elements. We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions  The less we emit  the less that sum will be of CO   and  therefore  the less the temperature. But in some ways  the grade we get there  doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions  is only equally  or maybe even slightly less  important than the other  which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs. These breakthroughs  we need to move those at full speed  and we can measure that in terms of companies  pilot projects  regulatory things that have been changed. There's a lot of great books that have been written about this. The Al Gore book   Our Choice  and the David McKay book   Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air.  They really go through it and create a framework that this can be discussed broadly  because we need broad backing for this. There's a lot that has to come together. So this is a wish. It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology. If you gave me only one wish for the next    years    I could pick who's president  I could pick a vaccine  which is something I love  or I could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no CO  gets invented    this is the wish I would pick. This is the one with the greatest impact. If we don't get this wish  the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible  between the U.S. and China  between poor countries and rich  and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse. So  what do we have to do  What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive  We need to go for more research funding. When countries get together in places like Copenhagen  they shouldn't just discuss the CO . They should discuss this innovation agenda  and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches. We do need the market incentives    CO  tax  cap and trade    something that gets that price signal out there. We need to get the message out. We need to have this dialogue be a more rational  more understandable dialogue  including the steps that the government takes. This is an important wish  but it is one I think we can achieve. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So to understand more about TerraPower  right    I mean  first of all  can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is  Bil Gates  To actually do the software  buy the supercomputer  hire all the great scientists  which we've done  that's only tens of millions  and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly  then you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions. The tough thing is building the pilot reactor  finding the several billion  finding the regulator  the location that will actually build the first one of these. Once you get the first one built  if it works as advertised  then it's just clear as day  because the economics  the energy density  are so different than nuclear as we know it. CA  And so  to understand it right  this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel  of this sort of spent uranium  and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down  BG  That's right. Today  you're always refueling the reactor  so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong  that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out  that's not good. So  if you have very cheap fuel that you can put    years in    just think of it as a log    put it down and not have those same complexities. And it just sits there and burns for the    years  and then it's done. CA  It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution. BG  Yeah. Well  what happens with the waste  you can let it sit there    there's a lot less waste under this approach    then you can actually take that  and put it into another one and burn that. And we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today  that's sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors    that's our fuel to begin with. So  the thing that's been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours  and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you're going through this process. CA  I mean  you're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here. Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this  BG  Well  we haven't picked a particular place  and there's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that's called  nuclear   so we've got a lot of interest  that people from the company have been in Russia  India  China    I've been back seeing the secretary of energy here  talking about how this fits into the energy agenda. So I'm optimistic. You know  the French and Japanese have done some work. This is a variant on something that has been done. It's an important advance  but it's like a fast reactor  and a lot of countries have built them  so anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built. CA  So  in your mind  timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live  BG  Well  we need    for one of these high scale  electro generation things that's very cheap  we have    years to invent and then    years to deploy. That's sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet. And  you know  TerraPower  if things go well    which is wishing for a lot    could easily meet that. And there are  fortunately now  dozens of companies    we need it to be hundreds    who  likewise  if their science goes well  if the funding for their pilot plants goes well  that they can compete for this. And it's best if multiple succeed  because then you could use a mix of these things. We certainly need one to succeed. CA  In terms of big scale possible game changes  is this the biggest that you're aware of out there  BG  An energy breakthrough is the most important thing. It would have been  even without the environmental constraint  but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater. In the nuclear space  there are other innovators. You know  we don't know their work as well as we know this one  but the modular people  that's a different approach. There's a liquid type reactor  which seems a little hard  but maybe they say that about us. And so  there are different ones  but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of  say  coal  and so    if you can deal with the negatives  which are essentially the radiation    the footprint and cost  the potential  in terms of effect on land and various things  is almost in a class of its own. CA  If this doesn't work  then what  Do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable  BG  If you get into that situation  it's like if you've been over eating  and you're about to have a heart attack  Then where do you go  You may need heart surgery or something. There is a line of research on what's called geoengineering  which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us    or    years to get our act together. Now  that's just an insurance policy. You hope you don't need to do that. Some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy  that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you. I'm not sure that's wise  given the importance of the problem  but there's now the geoengineering discussion about    should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster  or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect  CA  Climate skeptics  If you had a sentence or two to say to them  how might you persuade them that they're wrong  BG  Well  unfortunately  the skeptics come in different camps. The ones who make scientific arguments are very few. Are they saying that there's negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things  There are very  very few things that they can even say there's a chance in a million of those things. The main problem we have here  it's kind of like AIDS. You make the mistake now  and you pay for it a lot later. And so  when you have all sorts of urgent problems  the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later  and a somewhat uncertain pain thing    in fact  the IPCC report  that's not necessarily the worst case  and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say   OK  that isn't that big of a deal.  The fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this. But my dream here is that  if you can make it economic  and meet the CO  constraints  then the skeptics say   OK  I don't care that it doesn't put out CO   I kind of wish it did put out CO   but I guess I'll accept it because it's cheaper than what's come before.  CA  And so  that would be your response to the Bjorn Lomborg argument  that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO  problem  it's going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth  it's a stupid waste of the Earth's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do. BG  Well  the actual spending on the R D piece    say the U.S. should spend    billion a year more than it is right now    it's not that dramatic. It shouldn't take away from other things. The thing you get into big money on  and this  reasonable people can disagree  is when you have something that's non economic and you're trying to fund that    that  to me  mostly is a waste. Unless you're very close and you're just funding the learning curve and it's going to get very cheap  I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive. If the trade off you get into is   Let's make energy super expensive   then the rich can afford that. I mean  all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle. The disaster is for that two billion. And even Lomborg has changed. His shtick now is   Why isn't the R D getting more discussed   He's still  because of his earlier stuff  still associated with the skeptic camp  but he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp  and so  he's making the R D point. And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate. The R D piece  it's crazy how little it's funded. CA  Well Bill  I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true. Thank you so much. BG  Thank you.,Philanthropist,201002,5.945418250950572
59,75,77,Blaise Agüera y Arcas 2007,Blaise Agüera y Arcas,male,How PhotoSynth can connect the world's images,May 2007,441,What I'm going to show you first  as quickly as I can  is some foundational work  some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago. This is Seadragon  and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data. We're looking at many  many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in  panning through it  rearranging it in any way we want. And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at  how big these collections are or how big the images are. Most of them are ordinary digital camera photos  but this one  for example  is a scan from the Library of Congress  and it's in the     megapixel range. It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment. It's also very flexible architecture. This is an entire book  so this is an example of non image data. This is  Bleak House  by Dickens. Every column is a chapter. To prove to you that it's really text  and not an image  we can do something like so  to really show that this is a real representation of the text  it's not a picture. Maybe this is an artificial way to read an e book. I wouldn't recommend it. This is a more realistic case  an issue of The Guardian. Every large image is the beginning of a section. And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper  which is an inherently multi scale kind of medium. We've done something with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian. We've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution    much higher than in an ordinary ad    and we've embedded extra content. If you want to see the features of this car  you can see it here. Or other models  or even technical specifications. And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate. We hope that this means no more pop ups and other rubbish like that    shouldn't be necessary. Of course  mapping is one of those obvious applications for a technology like this. And this one I really won't spend any time on  except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well. But those are all the roads in the U.S. superimposed on top of a NASA geospatial image. So let's pull up  now  something else. This is actually live on the Web now  you can go check it out. This is a project called Photosynth  which marries two different technologies. One of them is Seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by Noah Snavely  a graduate student at the University of Washington  co advised by Steve Seitz at U.W. and Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research. A very nice collaboration. And so this is live on the Web. It's powered by Seadragon. You can see that when we do these sorts of views  where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi resolution experience. But the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful. The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots    all taken near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies    all these shots were taken. So you see elements here of stabilized slide show or panoramic imaging  and these things have all been related spatially. I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments. Some are much more spatial. I would like to jump straight to one of Noah's original data sets    this is from an early prototype that we first got working this summer    to show you what I think is really the punch line behind the Photosynth technology  It's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments we've put up on the website. We had to worry about the lawyers and so on. This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from Flickr. You just type Notre Dame into Flickr  and you get some pictures of guys in T shirts  and of the campus and so on. And each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model. And so these are all Flickr images  and they've all been related spatially in this way. We can just navigate in this very simple way. You know  I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft. It's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here. I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras  it's everything from cell phone cameras to professional SLRs  quite a large number of them  stitched together in this environment. If I can find some of the sort of weird ones    So many of them are occluded by faces  and so on. Somewhere in here there is actually a series of photographs    here we go. This is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly. We can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment. What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking data from everybody    from the entire collective memory  visually  of what the Earth looks like    and link all of that together. Those photos become linked  and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts. You have a model that emerges of the entire Earth. Think of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth work. And this is something that grows in complexity as people use it  and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it. Their own photos are getting tagged with meta data that somebody else entered. If somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are  then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data  and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space  into that meta verse  using everybody else's photos  and do a kind of a cross modal and cross user social experience that way. And of course  a by product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth  collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on  but from the collective memory. Thank you so much. Chris Anderson  Do I understand this right  What your software is going to allow  is that at some point  really within the next few years  all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to link together  BAA  Yes. What this is really doing is discovering  creating hyperlinks  if you will  between images. It's doing that based on the content inside the images. And that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information a lot of images have. Like when you do a web search for images  you type in phrases  and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of. What if that picture links to all of your pictures  The amount of semantic interconnection and richness that comes out of that is really huge. It's a classic network effect. CA  Truly incredible. Congratulations.,,200705,6.287761732851987
60,1631,1633,Blaise Agüera y Arcas 2010,Blaise Agüera y Arcas,male,Augmented-reality maps,Feb 2010,468,About a year and a half ago  Stephen Lawler  who also gave a talk here at TED in      on Virtual Earth  brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps  which is Microsoft's online mapping effort. In the past two and a half  we've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online. And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to. So  the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning  which  if you're familiar at all with Seadragon  that's where it comes from. Mapping is  of course  not just about cartography  it's also about imagery. So  as we zoom in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City like virtual view at    degrees. This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the  D structure of the city  all the facades. Now  we see this space  this three dimensional environment  as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out  and map's directions are really just one of them. If you click on this  you'll see some of the ones that we've put out  just in the past couple of months since we've launched. So  for example  a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti  we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky. This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you is taking hyper local blogs in real time and mapping those stories  those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs. It's wonderful. But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff. So  we see the imagery  of course  not stopping at the sky. These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made. I'm not going to dive into them either  but photosynths are integrated into the map. Everything that's cased in blue is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well. And so  when you fly down    Thank you. When you fly down to the ground  and you see this kind of panoramic imagery  the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture  there's just as much three dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three dimensional city from above  so if I click on something to get a closer view of it  then  the fact that that transition looks as it does  is a function of all of that geometry  all of that  D understanding behind this model. Now  I'll show you a fun app that    we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr. This takes Flickr  georegistered imagery and uses photosynth like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery  so    I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up  but    But notice    this is  of course  a popular tourist site  and there are lots of photos around here  and these photos are all taken at different times. So this one was taken around five. So that's the Flickr photo  that's our imagery. So you really see how this kind of crowd sourced imagery is integrating  in a very deep way  into the map itself. Thank you. There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them  of course  is time travel. And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here  but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well. But what's cool about this is that  not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users  but it also is the foundation for augmented reality  and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment. Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting. OK  notice there's now a roof above us. We're inside the Pike Place Market. And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera  so  we're now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars  but we're also imaging inside. And from here  we're able to do the same sorts of registration  not only of still images  but also of video. So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time  live  and this is really  truly  very frightening. OK. All right  guys  are you there  All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play. I'm live. All right. There we go. So  these are our friends in Pike Place Market  the lab. So they're broadcasting this live. OK  George  can you pan back over to the corner market  Because I want to show points of interest. No  no. The other way. Yeah  yeah  back to the corner  back to the corner. I don't want to see you guys yet. OK  OK  back to the corner  back to the corner  back to the corner. OK  never mind. What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way  if you're actually on the spot  you can think about this    this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality. What the hell are you guys    oh  sorry. We're doing two different    OK  I'm hanging up now. We're doing two different things here. One of them is to take that real ... All right  let me just take a moment and thank the team. They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together. I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside. And while I walk outside  I'll just mention that here we're using this for telepresence  but you can equally well use this on the spot  for augmented reality. When you use it on the spot  it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you. So here  we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it. That was being broadcast  by the way  on a  G network from the market. All right  and now there's one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years. And that's Curtis Wong  WorldWide Telescope. So  we're going to head over to the dumpsters  where it's traditional  after a long day at the market  to go out for a break  but also stare up at the sky. This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps. This is the current    thank you    this is the current time. If we scrub the time  then we can see how the sky will look at different times  and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times  different dates  Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky  maybe change the date. I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon. So  this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth. All right now  I've overrun my time  so I've got to stop. Thank you all very much.,,201002,6.240637450199205
64,1855,1857,Brené Brown 2010,Brené Brown,female,The power of vulnerability,Dec 2010,1207,So  I'll start with this  a couple years ago  an event planner called me because I was going to do a speaking event. And she called  and she said   I'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer.  And I thought   Well  what's the struggle   And she said   Well  I saw you speak  and I'm going to call you a researcher  I think  but I'm afraid if I call you a researcher  no one will come  because they'll think you're boring and irrelevant.  And I was like   Okay.  And she said   But the thing I liked about your talk is you're a storyteller. So I think what I'll do is just call you a storyteller.  And of course  the academic  insecure part of me was like   You're going to call me a what   And she said   I'm going to call you a storyteller.  And I was like   Why not 'magic pixie'   I was like   Let me think about this for a second.  I tried to call deep on my courage. And I thought  you know  I am a storyteller. I'm a qualitative researcher. I collect stories  that's what I do. And maybe stories are just data with a soul. And maybe I'm just a storyteller. And so I said   You know what  Why don't you just say I'm a researcher storyteller.  And she went   Ha ha. There's no such thing.  So I'm a researcher storyteller  and I'm going to talk to you today    we're talking about expanding perception    and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that I live and love and work and parent. And this is where my story starts. When I was a young researcher  doctoral student  my first year  I had a research professor who said to us   Here's the thing  if you cannot measure it  it does not exist.  And I thought he was just sweet talking me. I was like   Really   and he was like   Absolutely.  And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor's and a master's in social work  and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work  so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the  life's messy  love it.  And I'm more of the   life's messy  clean it up  organize it and put it into a bento box.  And so to think that I had found my way  to found a career that takes me    really  one of the big sayings in social work is   Lean into the discomfort of the work.  And I'm like  knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A's. That was my mantra. So I was very excited about this. And so I thought  you know what  this is the career for me  because I am interested in some messy topics. But I want to be able to make them not messy. I want to understand them. I want to hack into these things that I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see. So where I started was with connection. Because  by the time you're a social worker for    years  what you realize is that connection is why we're here. It's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives. This is what it's all about. It doesn't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice  mental health and abuse and neglect  what we know is that connection  the ability to feel connected  is    neurobiologically that's how we're wired    it's why we're here. So I thought  you know what  I'm going to start with connection. Well  you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss  and she tells you    things that you do really awesome  and one  opportunity for growth   And all you can think about is that opportunity for growth  right  Well  apparently this is the way my work went as well  because  when you ask people about love  they tell you about heartbreak. When you ask people about belonging  they'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded. And when you ask people about connection  the stories they told me were about disconnection. So very quickly    really about six weeks into this research    I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that I didn't understand or had never seen. And so I pulled back out of the research and thought  I need to figure out what this is. And it turned out to be shame. And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection  Is there something about me that  if other people know it or see it  that I won't be worthy of connection  The things I can tell you about it  It's universal  we all have it. The only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection. No one wants to talk about it  and the less you talk about it  the more you have it. What underpinned this shame  this  I'm not good enough      which  we all know that feeling   I'm not blank enough. I'm not thin enough  rich enough  beautiful enough  smart enough  promoted enough.  The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability. This idea of  in order for connection to happen  we have to allow ourselves to be seen  really seen. And you know how I feel about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability. And so I thought  this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick. I'm going in  I'm going to figure this stuff out  I'm going to spend a year  I'm going to totally deconstruct shame  I'm going to understand how vulnerability works  and I'm going to outsmart it. So I was ready  and I was really excited. As you know  it's not going to turn out well. You know this. So  I could tell you a lot about shame  but I'd have to borrow everyone else's time. But here's what I can tell you that it boils down to    and this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned in the decade of doing this research. My one year turned into six years  Thousands of stories  hundreds of long interviews  focus groups. At one point  people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories    thousands of pieces of data in six years. And I kind of got a handle on it. I kind of understood  this is what shame is  this is how it works. I wrote a book  I published a theory  but something was not okay    and what it was is that  if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness    that's what this comes down to  a sense of worthiness    they have a strong sense of love and belonging    and folks who struggle for it  and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough. There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it. And that was  the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging. That's it. They believe they're worthy. And to me  the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we're not worthy of connection  was something that  personally and professionally  I felt like I needed to understand better. So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness  where I saw people living that way  and just looked at those. What do these people have in common  I have a slight office supply addiction  but that's another talk. So I had a manila folder  and I had a Sharpie  and I was like  what am I going to call this research  And the first words that came to my mind were  whole hearted.  These are whole hearted people  living from this deep sense of worthiness. So I wrote at the top of the manila folder  and I started looking at the data. In fact  I did it first in a four day  very intensive data analysis  where I went back  pulled the interviews  the stories  pulled the incidents. What's the theme  What's the pattern  My husband left town with the kids because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing  where I'm just writing and in my researcher mode. And so here's what I found. What they had in common was a sense of courage. And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute. Courage  the original definition of courage  when it first came into the English language    it's from the Latin word  cor   meaning  heart     and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart. And so these folks had  very simply  the courage to be imperfect. They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others  because  as it turns out  we can't practice compassion with other people if we can't treat ourselves kindly. And the last was they had connection  and    this was the hard part    as a result of authenticity  they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were  which you have to absolutely do that for connection. The other thing that they had in common was this  They fully embraced vulnerability. They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful. They didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable  nor did they really talk about it being excruciating    as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing. They just talked about it being necessary. They talked about the willingness to say   I love you  first ... the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ... the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram. They're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out. They thought this was fundamental. I personally thought it was betrayal. I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research  where our job    you know  the definition of research is to control and predict  to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict. And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting. This led to a little breakdown       which actually looked more like this. And it did. I call it a breakdown  my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening. A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown  but I assure you  it was a breakdown. And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist. Let me tell you something  you know who you are when you call your friends and say   I think I need to see somebody. Do you have any recommendations   Because about five of my friends were like   Wooo  I wouldn't want to be your therapist.  I was like   What does that mean   And they're like   I'm just saying  you know. Don't bring your measuring stick.  I was like   Okay.  So I found a therapist. My first meeting with her  Diana    I brought in my list of the way the whole hearted live  and I sat down. And she said   How are you   And I said   I'm great. I'm okay.  She said   What's going on   And this is a therapist who sees therapists  because we have to go to those  because their B.S. meters are good. And so I said   Here's the thing  I'm struggling.  And she said   What's the struggle   And I said   Well  I have a vulnerability issue. And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness  but it appears that it's also the birthplace of joy  of creativity  of belonging  of love. And I think I have a problem  and I need some help.  And I said   But here's the thing  no family stuff  no childhood shit.   I just need some strategies.  Thank you. So she goes like this. And then I said   It's bad  right   And she said   It's neither good nor bad.   It just is what it is.  And I said   Oh my God  this is going to suck.  And it did  and it didn't. And it took about a year. And you know how there are people that  when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important  that they surrender and walk into it. A  that's not me  and B  I don't even hang out with people like that. For me  it was a yearlong street fight. It was a slugfest. Vulnerability pushed  I pushed back. I lost the fight  but probably won my life back. And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they  the whole hearted  what choices they were making  and what we are doing with vulnerability. Why do we struggle with it so much  Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability  No. So this is what I learned. We numb vulnerability    when we're waiting for the call. It was funny  I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook that says   How would you define vulnerability  What makes you feel vulnerable   And within an hour and a half  I had     responses. Because I wanted to know what's out there. Having to ask my husband for help because I'm sick  and we're newly married  initiating sex with my husband  initiating sex with my wife  being turned down  asking someone out  waiting for the doctor to call back  getting laid off  laying off people. This is the world we live in. We live in a vulnerable world. And one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability. And I think there's evidence    and it's not the only reason this evidence exists  but I think it's a huge cause    We are the most in debt ... obese ... addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S. history. The problem is    and I learned this from the research    that you cannot selectively numb emotion. You can't say  here's the bad stuff. Here's vulnerability  here's grief  here's shame  here's fear  here's disappointment. I don't want to feel these. I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. I don't want to feel these. And I know that's knowing laughter. I hack into your lives for a living. God. You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects  our emotions. You cannot selectively numb. So when we numb those  we numb joy  we numb gratitude  we numb happiness. And then  we are miserable  and we are looking for purpose and meaning  and then we feel vulnerable  so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. And it becomes this dangerous cycle. One of the things that I think we need to think about is why and how we numb. And it doesn't just have to be addiction. The other thing we do is we make everything that's uncertain certain. Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty.  I'm right  you're wrong. Shut up.  That's it. Just certain. The more afraid we are  the more vulnerable we are  the more afraid we are. This is what politics looks like today. There's no discourse anymore. There's no conversation. There's just blame. You know how blame is described in the research  A way to discharge pain and discomfort. We perfect. If there's anyone who wants their life to look like this  it would be me  but it doesn't work. Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks. Which just  I hope in     years  people will look back and go   Wow.  And we perfect  most dangerously  our children. Let me tell you what we think about children. They're hardwired for struggle when they get here. And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand  our job is not to say   Look at her  she's perfect. My job is just to keep her perfect    make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh.  That's not our job. Our job is to look and say   You know what  You're imperfect  and you're wired for struggle  but you are worthy of love and belonging.  That's our job. Show me a generation of kids raised like that  and we'll end the problems  I think  that we see today. We pretend that what we do doesn't have an effect on people. We do that in our personal lives. We do that corporate    whether it's a bailout  an oil spill ... a recall. We pretend like what we're doing doesn't have a huge impact on other people. I would say to companies  this is not our first rodeo  people. We just need you to be authentic and real and say ...  We're sorry. We'll fix it.  But there's another way  and I'll leave you with this. This is what I have found  To let ourselves be seen  deeply seen  vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts  even though there's no guarantee    and that's really hard  and I can tell you as a parent  that's excruciatingly difficult    to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror  when we're wondering   Can I love you this much  Can I believe in this this passionately  Can I be this fierce about this   just to be able to stop and  instead of catastrophizing what might happen  to say   I'm just so grateful  because to feel this vulnerable means I'm alive.  And the last  which I think is probably the most important  is to believe that we're enough. Because when we work from a place  I believe  that says   I'm enough  ... then we stop screaming and start listening  we're kinder and gentler to the people around us  and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves. That's all I have. Thank you.,,201012,5.924987654320985
66,142,144,Brian Greene 2012,Brian Greene,male,Is our universe the only universe?,Apr 2012,1294,A few months ago the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to two teams of astronomers for a discovery that has been hailed as one of the most important astronomical observations ever. And today  after briefly describing what they found  I'm going to tell you about a highly controversial framework for explaining their discovery  namely the possibility that way beyond the Earth  the Milky Way and other distant galaxies  we may find that our universe is not the only universe  but is instead part of a vast complex of universes that we call the multiverse. Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one. I mean  most of us were raised to believe that the word  universe  means everything. And I say most of us with forethought  as my four year old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born. And last year I was holding her and I said   Sophia  I love you more than anything in the universe.  And she turned to me and said   Daddy  universe or multiverse   But barring such an anomalous upbringing  it is strange to imagine other realms separate from ours  most with fundamentally different features  that would rightly be called universes of their own. And yet  speculative though the idea surely is  I aim to convince you that there's reason for taking it seriously  as it just might be right. I'm going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts. In part one  I'm going to describe those Nobel Prize winning results and to highlight a profound mystery which those results revealed. In part two  I'll offer a solution to that mystery. It's based on an approach called string theory  and that's where the idea of the multiverse will come into the story. Finally  in part three  I'm going to describe a cosmological theory called inflation  which will pull all the pieces of the story together. Okay  part one starts back in      when the great astronomer Edwin Hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushing away from us  establishing that space itself is stretching  it's expanding. Now this was revolutionary. The prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales the universe was static. But even so  there was one thing that everyone was certain of  The expansion must be slowing down. That  much as the gravitational pull of the Earth slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward  the gravitational pull of each galaxy on every other must be slowing the expansion of space. Now let's fast forward to the     s when those two teams of astronomers I mentioned at the outset were inspired by this reasoning to measure the rate at which the expansion has been slowing. And they did this by painstaking observations of numerous distant galaxies  allowing them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time. Here's the surprise  They found that the expansion is not slowing down. Instead they found that it's speeding up  going faster and faster. That's like tossing an apple upward and it goes up faster and faster. Now if you saw an apple do that  you'd want to know why. What's pushing on it  Similarly  the astronomers' results are surely well deserving of the Nobel Prize  but they raised an analogous question. What force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever quickening speed  Well the most promising answer comes from an old idea of Einstein's. You see  we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing  pulls objects together. But in Einstein's theory of gravity  his general theory of relativity  gravity can also push things apart. How  Well according to Einstein's math  if space is uniformly filled with an invisible energy  sort of like a uniform  invisible mist  then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive  repulsive gravity  which is just what we need to explain the observations. Because the repulsive gravity of an invisible energy in space    we now call it dark energy  but I've made it smokey white here so you can see it    its repulsive gravity would cause each galaxy to push against every other  driving expansion to speed up  not slow down. And this explanation represents great progress. But I promised you a mystery here in part one. Here it is. When the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up  look at what they found. This number is small. Expressed in the relevant unit  it is spectacularly small. And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number. We want this number to emerge from the laws of physics  but so far no one has found a way to do that. Now you might wonder  should you care  Maybe explaining this number is just a technical issue  a technical detail of interest to experts  but of no relevance to anybody else. Well it surely is a technical detail  but some details really matter. Some details provide windows into uncharted realms of reality  and this peculiar number may be doing just that  as the only approach that's so far made headway to explain it invokes the possibility of other universes    an idea that naturally emerges from string theory  which takes me to part two  string theory. So hold the mystery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as I now go on to tell you three key things about string theory. First off  what is it  Well it's an approach to realize Einstein's dream of a unified theory of physics  a single overarching framework that would be able to describe all the forces at work in the universe. And the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward. It says that if you examine any piece of matter ever more finely  at first you'll find molecules and then you'll find atoms and subatomic particles. But the theory says that if you could probe smaller  much smaller than we can with existing technology  you'd find something else inside these particles    a little tiny vibrating filament of energy  a little tiny vibrating string. And just like the strings on a violin  they can vibrate in different patterns producing different musical notes. These little fundamental strings  when they vibrate in different patterns  they produce different kinds of particles    so electrons  quarks  neutrinos  photons  all other particles would be united into a single framework  as they would all arise from vibrating strings. It's a compelling picture  a kind of cosmic symphony  where all the richness that we see in the world around us emerges from the music that these little  tiny strings can play. But there's a cost to this elegant unification  because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn't quite work. It has internal inconsistencies  unless we allow for something wholly unfamiliar    extra dimensions of space. That is  we all know about the usual three dimensions of space. And you can think about those as height  width and depth. But string theory says that  on fantastically small scales  there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny size so small that we have not detected them. But even though the dimensions are hidden  they would have an impact on things that we can observe because the shape of the extra dimensions constrains how the strings can vibrate. And in string theory  vibration determines everything. So particle masses  the strengths of forces  and most importantly  the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions. So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions  we should be able to calculate these features  calculate the amount of dark energy. The challenge is we don't know the shape of the extra dimensions. All we have is a list of candidate shapes allowed by the math. Now when these ideas were first developed  there were only about five different candidate shapes  so you can imagine analyzing them one by one to determine if any yield the physical features we observe. But over time the list grew as researchers found other candidate shapes. From five  the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands    A large  but still manageable  collection to analyze  since after all  graduate students need something to do. But then the list continued to grow into the millions and the billions  until today. The list of candidate shapes has soared to about    to the    . So  what to do  Well some researchers lost heart  concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions  each giving rise to different physical features  string theory would never make definitive  testable predictions. But others turned this issue on its head  taking us to the possibility of a multiverse. Here's the idea. Maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other. Each is as real as every other  in the sense that there are many universes  each with a different shape  for the extra dimensions. And this radical proposal has a profound impact on this mystery  the amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize winning results. Because you see  if there are other universes  and if those universes each have  say  a different shape for the extra dimensions  then the physical features of each universe will be different  and in particular  the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different. Which means that the mystery of explaining the amount of dark energy we've now measured would take on a wholly different character. In this context  the laws of physics can't explain one number for the dark energy because there isn't just one number  there are many numbers. Which means we have been asking the wrong question. It's that the right question to ask is  why do we humans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we've measured instead of any of the other possibilities that are out there  And that's a question on which we can make headway. Because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours  whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies  the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart and galaxies don't form. And in those universes that have much less dark energy  well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that  again  galaxies don't form. And without galaxies  there are no stars  no planets and no chance for our form of life to exist in those other universes. So we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we've measured simply because our universe has conditions hospitable to our form of life. And that would be that. Mystery solved  multiverse found. Now some find this explanation unsatisfying. We're used to physics giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe. But the point is  if the feature you're observing can and does take on a wide variety of different values across the wider landscape of reality  then thinking one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided. An early example comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler who was obsessed with understanding a different number    why the Sun is    million miles away from the Earth. And he worked for decades trying to explain this number  but he never succeeded  and we know why. Kepler was asking the wrong question. We now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars. So hoping that the laws of physics will explain one particular number     million miles  well that is simply wrongheaded. Instead the right question to ask is  why do we humans find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance  instead of any of the other possibilities  And again  that's a question we can answer. Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun would be so hot that our form of life wouldn't exist. And those planets that are much farther away from the star  well they're so cold that  again  our form of life would not take hold. So we find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form of life. And when it comes to planets and their distances  this clearly is the right kind of reasoning. The point is  when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain  it may also be the right kind of reasoning. One key difference  of course  is we know that there are other planets out there  but so far I've only speculated on the possibility that there might be other universes. So to pull it all together  we need a mechanism that can actually generate other universes. And that takes me to my final part  part three. Because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang. You see  when we speak of the Big Bang  we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward. But there's a little secret. The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important  the Bang. It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang  but gives us no insight into what would have powered the Bang itself. And this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory. It's called inflationary cosmology  which identified a particular kind of fuel that would naturally generate an outward rush of space. The fuel is based on something called a quantum field  but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that it's virtually impossible to use it all up  which means in the inflationary theory  the Big Bang giving rise to our universe is likely not a one time event. Instead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang  but it would also generate countless other Big Bangs  each giving rise to its own separate universe with our universe becoming but one bubble in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes. And now  when we meld this with string theory  here's the picture we're led to. Each of these universes has extra dimensions. The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes. The different shapes yield different physical features. And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because it's only in our universe that the physical features  like the amount of dark energy  are right for our form of life to take hold. And this is the compelling but highly controversial picture of the wider cosmos that cutting edge observation and theory have now led us to seriously consider. One big remaining question  of course  is  could we ever confirm the existence of other universes  Well let me describe one way that might one day happen. The inflationary theory already has strong observational support. Because the theory predicts that the Big Bang would have been so intense that as space rapidly expanded  tiny quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world  yielding a distinctive fingerprint  a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots  across space  which powerful telescopes have now observed. Going further  if there are other universes  the theory predicts that every so often those universes can collide. And if our universe got hit by another  that collision would generate an additional subtle pattern of temperature variations across space that we might one day be able to detect. And so exotic as this picture is  it may one day be grounded in observations  establishing the existence of other universes. I'll conclude with a striking implication of all these ideas for the very far future. You see  we learned that our universe is not static  that space is expanding  that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully examining faint pinpoints of starlight coming to us from distant galaxies. But because the expansion is speeding up  in the very far future  those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast that we won't be able to see them    not because of technological limitations  but because of the laws of physics. The light those galaxies emit  even traveling at the fastest speed  the speed of light  will not be able to overcome the ever widening gulf between us. So astronomers in the far future looking out into deep space will see nothing but an endless stretch of static  inky  black stillness. And they will conclude that the universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit    a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know to be wrong. Now maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era  like ours  attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies. But would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge  Or would they believe in the black  static empty universe that their own state of the art observations reveal  I suspect the latter. Which means that we are living through a remarkably privileged era when certain deep truths about the cosmos are still within reach of the human spirit of exploration. It appears that it may not always be that way. Because today's astronomers  by turning powerful telescopes to the sky  have captured a handful of starkly informative photons    a kind of cosmic telegram billions of years in transit. and the message echoing across the ages is clear. Sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law. Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Brian  thank you. The range of ideas you've just spoken about are dizzying  exhilarating  incredible. How do you think of where cosmology is now  in a sort of historical side  Are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion  BG  Well it's hard to say. When we learn that astronomers of the far future may not have enough information to figure things out  the natural question is  maybe we're already in that position and certain deep  critical features of the universe already have escaped our ability to understand because of how cosmology evolves. So from that perspective  maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them. On the other hand  we now can understand how old the universe is. We can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down   .   billion years ago    and yet  we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches. Holy cow  That's just amazing. So on the one hand  it's just incredible where we've gotten  but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future. CA  You're going to be around for the next few days. Maybe some of these conversations can continue. Thank you. Thank you  Brian.  BG  My pleasure. ,Physicist,201204,6.17985119047619
67,1225,1227,Brian Greene 2008,Brian Greene,male,Making sense of string theory,Apr 2008,1135,In the year       a virtually unknown German mathematician  named Theodor Kaluza suggested a very bold and  in some ways  a very bizarre idea. He proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aware of. That is in addition to left  right  back  forth and up  down  Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don't yet see. Now  when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea  sometimes that's all it is    bold and bizarre  but it has nothing to do with the world around us. This particular idea  however    although we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong  and at the end I'll discuss experiments which  in the next few years  may tell us whether it's right or wrong    this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting edge research. So  I'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions. So where do we go  To begin we need a little bit of back story. Go to     . This is a year when Einstein is basking in the glow of having discovered the special theory of relativity and decides to take on a new project  to try to understand fully the grand  pervasive force of gravity. And in that moment  there are many people around who thought that that project had already been resolved. Newton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late     s that works well  describes the motion of planets  the motion of the moon and so forth  the motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees  hitting people on the head. All of that could be described using Newton's work. But Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story  because even Newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity  he'd been unable to figure out how it really works. How is it that the Sun     million miles away   that  somehow it affects the motion of the Earth  How does the Sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence  And that is a task to which Einstein set himself    to figure out how gravity works. And let me show you what it is that he found. So Einstein found that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself. The idea goes like this  imagine space is a substrate of all there is. Einstein said space is nice and flat  if there's no matter present. But if there is matter in the environment  such as the Sun  it causes the fabric of space to warp  to curve. And that communicates the force of gravity. Even the Earth warps space around it. Now look at the Moon. The Moon is kept in orbit  according to these ideas  because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment that the Sun and the Moon and the Earth can all create by virtue of their presence. We go to a full frame view of this. The Earth itself is kept in orbit because it rolls along a valley in the environment that's curved because of the Sun's presence. That is this new idea about how gravity actually works. Now  this idea was tested in      through astronomical observations. It really works. It describes the data. And this gained Einstein prominence around the world. And that is what got Kaluza thinking. He  like Einstein  was in search of what we call a unified theory. That's one theory that might be able to describe all of nature's forces from one set of ideas  one set of principles  one master equation  if you will. So Kaluza said to himself  Einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of warps and curves in space    in fact  space and time  to be more precise. Maybe I can play the same game with the other known force  which was  at that time  known as the electromagnetic force    we know of others today  but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about. You know  the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attraction and so forth. So Kaluza says  maybe I can play the same game and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves. That raised a question  warps and curves in what  Einstein had already used up space and time  warps and curves  to describe gravity. There didn't seem to be anything else to warp or curve. So Kaluza said  well  maybe there are more dimensions of space. He said  if I want to describe one more force  maybe I need one more dimension. So he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space  not three  and imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves in that fourth dimension. Now here's the thing  when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves in a universe with four space dimensions  not three  he found the old equations that Einstein had already derived in three dimensions    those were for gravity    but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension. And when he looked at that equation  it was none other than the equation that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force. Amazing    it just popped out. He was so excited by this realization that he ran around his house screaming   Victory      that he had found the unified theory. Now clearly  Kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously. He  in fact    there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim  he read a book  a treatise on swimming       then dove into the ocean. This is a man who would risk his life on theory. Now  but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded  two questions immediately arise from his observation. Number one  if there are more dimensions in space  where are they  We don't seem to see them. And number two  does this theory really work in detail  when you try to apply it to the world around us  Now  the first question was answered in      by a fellow named Oskar Klein. He suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties    there might be big  easy to see dimensions  but there might also be tiny  curled up dimensions  curled up so small  even though they're all around us  that we don't see them. Let me show you that one visually. So  imagine you're looking at something like a cable supporting a traffic light. It's in Manhattan. You're in Central Park    it's kind of irrelevant    but the cable looks one dimensional from a distant viewpoint  but you and I all know that it does have some thickness. It's very hard to see it  though  from far away. But if we zoom in and take the perspective of  say  a little ant walking around    little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions    the long dimension  but also this clockwise  counter clockwise direction. And I hope you appreciate this. It took so long to get these ants to do this. But this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts  big and small. And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can easily see  but there might be additional dimensions curled up  sort of like the circular part of that cable  so small that they have so far remained invisible. Let me show you what that would look like. So  if we take a look  say  at space itself    I can only show  of course  two dimensions on a screen. Some of you guys will fix that one day  but anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension  goes smaller  smaller  smaller  and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself  this is the idea  you could have additional curled up dimensions    here is a little shape of a circle    so small that we don't see them. But if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around  you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about    that's like the grid part    but you could also access the tiny curled up dimension that's so small that we can't see it with the naked eye or even with any of our most refined equipment. But deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself  the idea is there could be more dimensions  as we see there. Now that's an explanation about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see. But what about the second question that I asked  does the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world  Well  it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time  and  in detail  it didn't work. In detail  for instance  they couldn't get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory. So many people worked on it  but by the '  s  certainly by the '  s  this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away. Until something wonderful happened in our age. In our era  a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself  many others around the world  it's called superstring theory  as you were indicating. And the wonderful thing is that superstring theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions  but when we study superstring theory  we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling  new form. So  let me just tell you how that goes. Superstring theory    what is it  Well  it's a theory that tries to answer the question  what are the basic  fundamental  indivisible  uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us  The idea is like this. So  imagine we look at a familiar object  just a candle in a holder  and imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of. So we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents. So deep inside    we all know  you go sufficiently far down  you have atoms. We also all know that atoms are not the end of the story. They have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus with neutrons and protons. Even the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks. That is where conventional ideas stop. Here is the new idea of string theory. Deep inside any of these particles  there is something else. This something else is this dancing filament of energy. It looks like a vibrating string    that's where the idea  string theory comes from. And just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello can vibrate in different patterns  these can also vibrate in different patterns. They don't produce different musical notes. Rather  they produce the different particles making up the world around us. So if these ideas are correct  this is what the ultra microscopic landscape of the universe looks like. It's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy  vibrating in different frequencies. The different frequencies produce the different particles. The different particles are responsible for all the richness in the world around us. And there you see unification  because matter particles  electrons and quarks  radiation particles  photons  gravitons  are all built up from one entity. So matter and the forces of nature all are put together under the rubric of vibrating strings. And that's what we mean by a unified theory. Now here is the catch. When you study the mathematics of string theory  you find that it doesn't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space. It doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space  nor five  nor six. Finally  you can study the equations  and show that it works only in a universe that has    dimensions of space and one dimension of time. It leads us right back to this idea of Kaluza and Klein    that our world  when appropriately described  has more dimensions than the ones that we see. Now you might think about that and say  well  OK  you know  if you have extra dimensions  and they're really tightly curled up  yeah  perhaps we won't see them  if they're small enough. But if there's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there  and you make them small enough  and we won't see them either. That is true. One of the other predictions of string theory    no  that's not one of the other predictions of string theory. But it raises the question  are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions  or do they tell us something about the world  In the remaining time  I'd like to tell you two features of them. First is  many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics  theoretical science. And that question is this  when we look around the world  as scientists have done for the last hundred years  there appear to be about    numbers that really describe our universe. These are numbers like the mass of the particles  like electrons and quarks  the strength of gravity  the strength of the electromagnetic force    a list of about    numbers that have been measured with incredible precision  but nobody has an explanation for why the numbers have the particular values that they do. Now  does string theory offer an answer  Not yet. But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions. And the wonderful thing is  if those numbers had any other values than the known ones  the universe  as we know it  wouldn't exist. This is a deep question. Why are those numbers so finely tuned to allow stars to shine and planets to form  when we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers    if I had    dials up here and I let you come up and fiddle with those numbers  almost any fiddling makes the universe disappear. So can we explain those    numbers  And string theory suggests that those    numbers have to do with the extra dimensions. Let me show you how. So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory  it's not one extra dimension  as in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein. This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions. They have a very rich  intertwined geometry. This is an example of something known as a Calabi Yau shape    name isn't all that important. But  as you can see  the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape  interesting structure. And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like  then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales. When you swing your hand  you'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again  but they're so small that we wouldn't know it. So what is the physical implication  though  relevant to those    numbers  Consider this. If you look at the instrument  a French horn  notice that the vibrations of the airstreams are affected by the shape of the instrument. Now in string theory  all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate. So just as those airstreams are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument  strings themselves will be affected by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving. So let me bring some strings into the story. And if you watch these little fellows vibrating around    they'll be there in a second    right there  notice that they way they vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions. So  if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like    we don't yet  but if we did    we should be able to calculate the allowed notes  the allowed vibrational patterns. And if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns  we should be able to calculate those    numbers. And if the answer that we get from our calculations agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined through detailed and precise experimentation  this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is. Now  the second issue that I want to finish up with is  how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly  Is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained features of the world  or can we actually test for these extra dimensions  And we think    and this is  I think  very exciting    that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the existence of these extra dimensions. Here's how it goes. In CERN  Geneva  Switzerland  a machine is being built called the Large Hadron Collider. It's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel  opposite directions  near the speed of light. Every so often those particles will be aimed at each other  so there's a head on collision. The hope is that if the collision has enough energy  it may eject some of the debris from the collision from our dimensions  forcing it to enter into the other dimensions. How would we know it  Well  we'll measure the amount of energy after the collision  compare it to the amount of energy before  and if there's less energy after the collision than before  this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away. And if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate  this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there. Let me show you that idea visually. So  imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton    that's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out  if the extra dimensions are real. But here's how the experiment will go. You take these particles. You slam them together. You slam them together  and if we are right  some of the energy of that collision will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions. So this is the kind of experiment that we'll be looking at in the next five  seven to    years or so. And if this experiment bears fruit  if we see that kind of particle ejected by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions than when we began  this will show that the extra dimensions are real. And to me this is a really remarkable story  and a remarkable opportunity. Going back to Newton with absolute space    didn't provide anything but an arena  a stage in which the events of the universe take place. Einstein comes along and says  well  space and time can warp and curve    that's what gravity is. And now string theory comes along and says  yes  gravity  quantum mechanics  electromagnetism  all together in one package  but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see. And this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime. Amazing possibility. Thank you very much.,Physicist,200804,6.240792951541848
69,897,899,Bruce Aylward 2015,Bruce Aylward,male,Humanity vs. Ebola. How we could win a terrifying war,Feb 2015,1144,When I was invited to give this talk  a couple of months ago  we discussed a number  of titles with the organizers  and a lot of different items were  kicked around and were discussed. But nobody suggested this one  and the reason for that was two months ago  Ebola was escalating exponentially and spreading over wider geographic areas than we had ever seen  and the world was terrified   concerned and alarmed by this disease  in a way we've not  seen in recent history. But today  I can stand here  and I can talk to you about beating Ebola because of people  whom you've never heard of  people like Peter Clement  a Liberian  doctor who's working in Lofa County  a place that many of you have  never heard of  probably  in Liberia. The reason that Lofa County  is so important is because about five months ago  when the epidemic was  just starting to escalate  Lofa County was right at the center   the epicenter of this epidemic. At that time  MSF and the treatment center there  they were seeing dozens of patients  every single day  and these patients  these communities were becoming more and more terrified as time went by  with this disease  and what it was doing to their families  to their communities   to their children  to their relatives. And so Peter Clement was charged with  driving that    hour long rough road from Monrovia  the capital  up to Lofa County  to try and help bring control to the escalating epidemic there. And what Peter found when he arrived was the terror that I just mentioned to you. So he sat down with the local chiefs   and he listened. And what he heard was heartbreaking. He heard about the devastation  and the desperation of people affected by this disease. He heard the heartbreaking stories about not just the damage that Ebola did to people  but what it did to families  and what it did to communities. And he listened to the local chiefs there and what they told him    They said   When our children are sick   when our children are dying  we can't hold them at a time when  we want to be closest to them. When our relatives die  we can't take care of them as our tradition demands. We are not allowed to wash  the bodies to bury them the way our communities and  our rituals demand. And for this reason  they were deeply disturbed  deeply alarmed and the entire epidemic  was unraveling in front of them. People were turning on the healthcare  workers who had come  the heroes who had come to try  and help save the community  to help work with the community  and they were unable to access them. And what happened then was  Peter explained to the leaders. The leaders listened.  They turned the tables. And Peter explained what Ebola was. He explained what the disease was. He explained what it did to their communities. And he explained that Ebola threatened  everything that made us human. Ebola means you can't hold your children the way you would in this situation. You can't bury your dead  the way that you would. You have to trust these people  in these space suits to do that for you. And ladies and gentlemen  what  happened then was rather extraordinary  The community and the health workers   Peter  they sat down together and they put together a new plan  for controlling Ebola in Lofa County. And the reason that this is such  an important story  ladies and gentlemen  is because today  this county  which is  right at the center of this epidemic you've been watching   you've been seeing in the newspapers  you've been seeing on  the television screens  today Lofa County is nearly eight weeks without seeing a single case of Ebola. Now  this doesn't mean that  the job is done  obviously. There's still a huge risk that there will be additional cases there. But what it does teach us  is that Ebola can be beaten. That's the key thing. Even on this scale  even with the rapid kind of growth that we saw in this environment here  we now know Ebola can be beaten. When communities come together  with health care workers  work together  that's when this disease can be stopped. But how did Ebola end up in Lofa County in the first place  Well  for that  we have to go back     months  to the start of this epidemic. And as many of you know   this virus went undetected  it evaded detection for three  or four months when it began. That's because this is not  a disease of West Africa  it's a disease of Central Africa   half a continent away. People hadn't seen the disease before  health workers hadn't seen  the disease before. They didn't know what  they were dealing with  and to make it  even more complicated  the virus itself was causing a symptom  a type of a presentation that wasn't classical of the disease. So people didn't even recognize  the disease  people who knew Ebola. For that reason it evaded detection  for some time  But contrary to public belief  sometimes these days  once the virus was detected   there was a rapid surge in of support. MSF rapidly set up an Ebola treatment  center  as many of you know  in the area. The World Health Organization and the partners that it works with deployed eventually hundreds of people  over the next two months to be able to help track the virus. The problem  ladies and gentlemen  is by then  this virus  well known now as Ebola   had spread too far. It had already outstripped what was  one of the largest responses that had been mounted so far to an Ebola outbreak. By the middle of the year  not just Guinea but now Sierra Leone and Liberia were also infected. As the virus was spreading geographically  the numbers were increasing and at this time  not only were  hundreds of people infected and dying of the disease  but as importantly  the front line responders  the people who had gone to try and help  the health care workers  the other  responders were also sick and dying by the dozens. The presidents of these countries  recognized the emergencies. They met right around that time   they agreed on common action and they put together an emergency  joint operation center in Conakry to try and work together to finish this disease and get it stopped  to implement the strategies we talked about. But what happened then was something  we had never seen before with Ebola. What happened then was the virus   or someone sick with the virus  boarded an airplane   flew to another country  and for the first time  we saw in another distant country the virus pop up again. This time it was in Nigeria  in the teeming metropolis of Lagos     million people. Now the virus was in that environment. And as you can anticipate   there was international alarm  international concern on a scale that  we hadn't seen in recent years caused by a disease like this. The World Health Organization immediately  called together an expert panel  looked at the situation   declared an international emergency. And in doing so  the expectation would be that there would be a huge outpouring of international assistance to help these countries which were in so much trouble and concern at that time. But what we saw was  something very different. There was some great response. A number of countries came to assist    many  many NGOs and others  as you know  but at the same time  the opposite  happened in many places. Alarm escalated  and very soon  these countries found themselves not receiving the support they needed  but increasingly isolated. What we saw was commercial airlines  stopped  flying into these countries and people who hadn't even been exposed to the virus were no longer allowed to travel. This caused not only problems  obviously   for the countries themselves  but also for the response. Those organizations that were  trying to bring people in  to try and help them respond to the outbreak  they could not get  people on airplanes  they could not get them into the  countries to be able to respond. In that situation  ladies and gentleman  a virus like Ebola takes advantage. And what we saw then was something  also we hadn't seen before. Not only did this virus  continue in the places where they'd already become infected  but then it started to escalate and we saw the case numbers that you see here  something we'd never seen before on such a scale  an exponential increase of Ebola cases not just in these countries or the areas  already infected in these countries but also spreading further and  deeper into these countries. Ladies and gentleman  this was one of the most concerning international emergencies in public health we've ever seen. And what happened in these countries then  many of you saw  again  on the television  read about in the newspapers  we saw the health system start to collapse under the weight of this epidemic. We saw the schools begin to close   markets no longer started  no longer functioned the way  that they should in these countries. We saw that misinformation and  misperceptions started to spread even faster through the communities  which became even more alarmed about the situation. They started to recoil from those people  that you saw in those space suits  as they call them   who had come to help them. And then the situation deteriorated even further. The countries had to declare a state of emergency. Large populations needed to be quarantined in some areas  and then riots broke out. It was a very  very terrifying situation. Around the world  many people began to ask  can we ever stop Ebola  when it starts to spread like this  And they started to ask  how well  do we really know this virus  The reality is we don't know  Ebola extremely well. It's a relatively modern disease in terms of what we know about it. We've known the disease only for    years  since it first popped up in Central Africa in     . But despite that  we do know many things  We know that this virus probably survives in a type of a bat. We know that it probably enters  a human population when we come in contact with a wild animal that has been infected with the virus  and probably sickened by it. Then we know that the virus spreads from person to person through contaminated body fluids. And as you've all seen  we know the horrific disease that it then causes in humans  where we see this disease cause severe fevers  diarrhea  vomiting  and then unfortunately  in    percent of the cases or often more  death. This is a very dangerous  debilitating  and deadly disease. But despite the fact that we've not known this disease for a particularly long time  and we don't know everything about it  we do know how to stop this disease. There are four things that are critical to stopping Ebola. First and foremost  the communities  have got to understand this disease  they've got to understand  how it spreads and how to stop it. And then we've got to be able to have  systems that can find every single case  every contact of those cases  and begin to track the transmission chains so that you can stop transmission. We have to have treatment centers  specialized Ebola treatment centers  where the workers can be protected as they try to provide support to the people who are infected  so that they might survive the disease. And then for those who do die  we have to ensure there is a safe  but at the same time dignified  burial process  so that there is no spread  at that time as well. So we do know how to stop Ebola  and these strategies work  ladies and gentlemen. The virus was stopped in Nigeria  by these four strategies and the people implementing  them  obviously. It was stopped in Senegal  where it had spread  and also in the other countries that were affected by this virus   in this outbreak. So there's no question that  these strategies actually work. The big question  ladies and gentlemen  was whether these strategies could work on this scale  in this situation  with so many countries affected with the kind of exponential  growth that you saw. That was the big question that we were  facing just two or three months ago. Today we know the answer to that question. And we know that answer  because of the extraordinary work of an incredible group of NGOs  of governments  of local leaders  of U.N. agencies and many humanitarian  and other organizations that came and joined the fight to try and stop Ebola in West Africa. But what had to be done there  was slightly different. These countries took those strategies  I just showed you  the community engagement  the case finding  contact tracing  etc.  and they turned them on their head. There was so much disease  they approached it differently. What they decided to do was they would  first try and slow down this epidemic by rapidly building as many beds as possible in specialized treatment centers so that they could prevent the disease from spreading from those were infected. They would rapidly build out many  many burial teams so that they could safely deal with the dead  and with that  they would try  and slow this outbreak to see if it could actually then  be controlled using the classic approach of case finding and contact tracing. And when I went to West Africa about three months ago  when I was there what I saw was extraordinary. I saw presidents opening emergency operation centers themselves against Ebola so that they could personally coordinate  and oversee and champion this surge of international support  to try and stop this disease. We saw militaries from within  those countries and from far beyond coming in to help build  Ebola treatment centers that could be used to isolate  those who were sick. We saw the Red Cross movement working with its partner agencies on the ground there to help train the communities so that they could actually safely bury their dead in a dignified manner themselves. And we saw the U.N. agencies   the World Food Program  build a tremendous air bridge that could get responders to every single corner of these countries rapidly to be able to implement the strategies that we just talked about. What we saw  ladies and gentlemen   which was probably most impressive  was this incredible work by the governments  by the leaders in these countries  with the communities  to try to ensure people  understood this disease  understood the extraordinary things they  would have to do to try and stop Ebola. And as a result  ladies and gentlemen  we saw something that we did not know only two or three months earlier  whether or not it would be possible. What we saw was  what you see now in this graph  when we took stock on December  . What we saw was we could  bend that curve  so to speak  change this exponential growth  and bring some hope back to the ability to control this outbreak. And for this reason  ladies and gentlemen  there's absolutely no question now that we can catch up with this outbreak  in West Africa and we can beat Ebola. The big question  though   that many people are asking  even when they saw this curve  they said   Well  hang on a minute    that's great you can slow it down  but can you actually drive it down to zero   We already answered that question  back at the beginning of this talk  when I spoke about Lofa County in Liberia. We told you the story how Lofa County got to a situation where they have not seen Ebola for eight weeks. But there are similar stories from  the other countries as well. From Gueckedou in Guinea  the first area where the first case was actually diagnosed. We've seen very  very few cases in the last couple of months  and here in Kenema  in Sierra Leone   another area in the epicenter  we have not seen the virus for more than a couple of weeks    way too early to declare  victory  obviously  but evidence  ladies and gentlemen  not only can the response  catch up to the disease  but this disease can be driven to zero. The challenge now  of course   is doing this on the scale needed right across these three countries  and that is a huge challenge. Because when you've been at something for this long  on this scale  two other big threats  come in to join the virus. The first of those is complacency  the risk that as this  disease curve starts to bend  the media look elsewhere   the world looks elsewhere. Complacency always a risk. And the other risk  of course  is when you've been working so hard for so long  and slept so few hours  over the past months  people are tired  people become fatigued  and these new risks  start to creep into the response. Ladies and gentlemen  I can tell you today I've just come back from West Africa. The people of these countries  the leaders of these countries  they are not complacent. They want to drive Ebola to zero  in their countries. And these people  yes  they're tired   but they are not fatigued. They have an energy  they have a courage  they have the strength  to get this finished. What they need  ladies and gentlemen  at this point  is the unwavering support of the  international community  to stand with them  to bolster and bring even more support  at this time  to get the job finished. Because finishing Ebola right now  means turning the tables on this virus  and beginning to hunt it. Remember  this virus  this whole crisis   rather  started with one case  and is going to finish with one case. But it will only finish if those countries have got enough epidemiologists  enough health workers  enough logisticians and enough other people working with them to be able to find every one  of those cases  track their contacts and make sure that this disease  stops once and for all. Ladies and gentleman  Ebola can be beaten. Now we need you to take this story out to tell it to the people who will listen and educate them  on what it means to beat Ebola  and more importantly  we need you to advocate with the people who can help us bring the resources we need to these countries  to beat this disease. There are a lot of people out there  who will survive and will thrive  in part because of what you do  to help us beat Ebola. Thank you.,Epidemiologist,201502,5.4901443001443
70,1970,1972,Bruce Aylward 2011,Bruce Aylward,male,How we'll stop polio for good,May 2011,1378,I want to share with you over the next    minutes a pretty incredible idea. Actually  it's a really big idea. But to get us started  I want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try and think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world. Now I bet  in this audience  you're thinking of some really incredible technology  some stuff that I haven't even heard of  I'm absolutely sure. But I'm also sure  pretty sure  that absolutely nobody is thinking of this. This is a polio vaccine. And it's a great thing actually that nobody's had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted. This is a great technology. We can take it completely for granted. But it wasn't always that way. Even here in California  if we were to go back just a few years  it was a very different story. People were terrified of this disease. They were terrified of polio  and it would cause public panic. And it was because of scenes like this. In this scene  people are living in an iron lung. These are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before  and then two days later  they can no longer breathe  and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs  but also their breathing muscles. And they were going to spend the rest of their lives  usually  in this iron lung to breathe for them. This disease was terrifying. There was no cure  and there was no vaccine. The disease was so terrifying that the president of the United States launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it. Twenty years later  they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine. It was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late     s. Finally  a vaccine that could stop this awful disease  and here in the United States it had an incredible impact. As you can see  the virus stopped  and it stopped very  very fast. But this wasn't the case everywhere in the world. And it happened so fast in the United States  however  that even just last month Jon Stewart said this  Because I thought that had been eradicated in the way that smallpox had been eradicated. Bruce Aylward  Oops. Jon  polio's almost been eradicated. But the reality is that polio still exists today. We made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists. This is the picture. There's not very much left in the world. But the reason there's not very much left is because there's been an extraordinary public private partnership working behind the scenes  almost unknown  I'm sure to most of you here today. It's been working for    years to try and eradicate this disease  and it's got it down to these few cases that you can see here on this graphic. But just last year  we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn't good enough with a virus like polio. And this is the reason  in two countries that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade  on opposite sides of the globe  there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks. Hundreds of people were paralyzed. Hundreds of people died    children as well as adults. And in both cases  we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses  and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries. They had come from thousands of miles away. And in one case  it originated on another continent. And not only that  but when they came into these countries  then they got on commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even farther to other places like Russia  where  for the first time in over a decade last year  children were crippled and paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years. Now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you  these are under control now  and it looks like they'll probably stop very  very quickly. But the message was very clear. Polio is still a devastating  explosive disease. It's just happening in another part of the world. And our big idea is that the scientific miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis. So I want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership  the Polio Partnership  is trying to do. We're not trying to control polio. We're not trying to get it down to just a few cases  because this disease is like a root fire  it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely. So what we're looking for is a permanent solution. We want a world in which every child  just like you guys  can take for granted a polio free world. So we're looking for a permanent solution  and this is where we get lucky. This is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary. This virus can only survive in people. It can't live for a very long time in people. It doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all. And we've got pretty good vaccines  as I've just showed you. So we are trying to wipe out this virus completely. What the polio eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on Earth. Now we don't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this  to eradicating diseases. It's been tried six times in the last century  and it's been successful exactly once. And this is because disease eradication  it's still the venture capital of public health. The risks are massive  but the pay off    economic  humanitarian  motivational    it's absolutely huge. One congressman here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the U.S. put into smallpox eradication pays itself off every    days    in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs. And if we can finish polio eradication  the poorest countries in the world are going to save over    billion dollars in the next    years alone. So those are the kind of stakes that we're after. But smallpox eradication was hard  it was very  very hard. And polio eradication  in many ways  is even tougher  and there's a few reasons for that. The first is that  when we started trying to eradicate polio about    years ago  more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with smallpox. And there were more than    times as many people living in these countries. So it was a massive effort. The second challenge we had was    in contrast to the smallpox vaccine  which was very stable  and a single dose protected you for life    the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile. It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we've had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it's exposed to too much heat  and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child    it's not potent  it's not going to protect them. Even then  kids need many doses of the vaccine. But the third challenge we have    and probably even bigger one  the biggest challenge    is that  in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy    every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash. So you could get around the disease  you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off. With polio it's almost completely different. The vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease. So you can't see the enemy most of the time  and as a result  we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with smallpox. We've had to create one of the largest social movements in history. There's over    million people  probably    million people  largely volunteers  who have been working over the last    years in what has now been called the largest internationally coordinated operation in peacetime. These people  these    million people  vaccinate over     million children every single year  multiple times at the peak of our operation. Now giving the polio vaccine is simple. It's just two drops  like that. But reaching     million people is much  much tougher. And these vaccinators  these volunteers  they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest  densest urban slums in the world. They've got to trek under sweltering suns to some of the most remote  difficult to reach places in the world. And they also have to dodge bullets  because we have got to operate during shaky cease fires and truces to try and vaccinate children  even in areas affected by conflict. One reporter who was watching our program in Somalia about five years ago    a place which has eradicated polio  not once  but twice  because they got reinfected. He was sitting outside of the road  watching one of these polio campaigns unfold  and a few months later he wrote   This is foreign aid at its most heroic.  And these heroes  they come from every walk of life  all sorts of backgrounds. But one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International. This is a group whose million strong army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over    years. They're right at the center of the whole thing. Now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication    more than    years  much longer than it should have    but once it was built  the results were striking. Within a couple of years  every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses  with the exception of four countries that you see here. And in each of those  it was only part of the country. And then  by       one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide    proof of concept. And then today  there's been a    percent reduction    greater than    percent reduction    in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease. When we started  over    years ago        children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus. Last year  it was      . And at the same time  the polio eradication program has been working to help with a lot of other areas. It's been working to help control pandemic flu  SARS for example. It's also tried to save children by doing other things    giving vitamin A drops  giving measles shots  giving bed nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns. But the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us  the international community  to reach every single child  every single community  the most vulnerable people in the world  with the most basic of health services  irrespective of geography  poverty  culture and even conflict. So things were looking very exciting  and then about five years ago  this virus  this ancient virus  started to fight back. The first problem we ran into was that  in these last four countries  the strongholds of this virus  we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out. And then to make the matters even worse  the virus started to spread out of these four places  especially northern India and northern Nigeria  into much of Africa  Asia  and even into Europe  causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades. And then  in one of the most important  tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world  we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have. In conditions like this  the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to. Now at that time  there was a great  as you can imagine  frustration    let's call it frustration    it started to grow very  very quickly. And all of a sudden  some very important voices in the world of public health started to say   Hang on. We should abandon this idea of eradication. Let's settle for control    that's good enough.  Now as seductive as the idea of control sounds  it's a false premise. The brutal truth is  if we don't have the will or the skill  or even the money that we need to reach children  the most vulnerable children in the world  with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine  then pretty soon  more than         children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year. There's absolutely no question. These are children like Umar. Umar is seven years old  and he's from northern Nigeria. He lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters. Umar also has polio. Umar was paralyzed for life. His right leg was paralyzed in     . This leg  his right leg  now takes an awful beating because he has to half crawl  because it's faster to move that way to keep up with his friends  keep up with his brothers and sisters  than to get up on his crutches and walk. But Umar is a fantastic student. He's an incredible kid. As you probably can't see the detail here  but this is his report card  and you'll see  he's got perfect scores. He got     percent in all the important things  like nursery rhymes  for example there. But you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with polio these days  but it's not true. Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances. The reality of polio today is something very different. Polio strikes the poorest communities in the world. It leaves their children paralyzed  and it drags their families deeper into poverty  because they're desperately searching and they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have  trying in vain to find a cure for their children. We think children deserve better. And so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago  when people were saying   We should call it off   the Polio Partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find innovative new solutions  new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again. In northern India  we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this  so that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters  so we could get to the millions of children on the Koshi River basin where there are no other health services. In northern Nigeria  the political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders  they got directly involved in the program to help solve the problems of logistics and community confidence. And now they've even started using these devices    speaking of cool technology    these little devices  little GIS trackers like this  which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators. And then they can track them  and at the end of the day  they look and see  did these guys get every single street  every single house. This is the kind of commitment now we're seeing to try and reach all of the children we've been missing. And in Afghanistan  we're trying new approaches    access negotiators. We're working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child. But as we tried these extraordinary things  as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics  we went back to the vaccine    it's a    year old vaccine    and we thought  surely we can make a better vaccine  so that when they finally get to these kids  we can have a better bang for our buck. And this started an incredible collaboration with industry  and within six months  we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted  just two years ago  the last two types of polio in the world. Now June the ninth        we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine  and it turned out to be a game changer. The new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had  and we immediately started using this. Well  in a couple of months we had to get it out of production. And it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world. And we didn't start with the easy places. The first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan  because it's in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from technologies like this. Now here at TED  over the last couple of days  I've seen people challenging the audience again and again to believe in the impossible. So this morning at about seven o'clock  I decided that we'd try to drive Chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from India again  so that you could see something that's just unfolding today  which proves that the impossible is possible. And only two years ago  people were saying that this is impossible. Now remember  northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio. Over         children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio    Uttar Pradesh and Bihar            children every single month. Sanitation is terrible  and our old vaccine  you remember  worked half as well as it should have. And yet  the impossible is happening. Today marks exactly six months    and for the first time in history  not a single child has been paralyzed in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar. India's not unique. In Umar's home country of Nigeria  a    percent reduction in the number of children paralyzed by polio last year. And in the last six months  we've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history. Ladies and gentlemen  with a combination of smart people  smart technology and smart investments  polio can now be eradicated anywhere. We have major challenges  you can imagine  to finish this job  but as you've also seen  it's doable  it has great secondary benefits  and polio eradication is a great buy. And as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus  it's a stark reminder that we are failing  as a society  to reach children with the most basic of services. And for that reason  polio eradication  it's the ultimate in equity and it's the ultimate in social justice. The huge social movement that's been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children. It's ready to reach them with bed nets  with other things. But capitalizing on their enthusiasm  capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started    years ago. Finishing polio is a smart thing to do  and it's the right thing to do. Now we're in tough times economically. But as David Cameron of the United Kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio   There's never a wrong time to do the right thing.  Finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do. And we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last    years. We have a new vaccine  we have new resolve  and we have new tactics. We have the chance to write an entirely new polio free chapter in human history. But if we blink now  we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease. Here's a great idea to spread  End polio now. Help us tell the story. Help us build the momentum so that very soon every child  every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio free life forever. Thank you. Bill Gates  Well Bruce  where do you think the toughest places are going to be  Where would you say we need to be the smartest  BA  The four places where you saw  that we've never stopped    northern Nigeria  northern India  the southern corner of Afghanistan and bordering areas of Pakistan    they're going to be the toughest. But the interesting thing is  of those three  India's looking real good  as you just saw in the data. And Afghanistan  Afghanistan  we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly. It keeps getting reinfected. So the tough ones  going to get the top of Nigeria finished and getting Pakistan finished. They're going to be the tough ones. BG  Now what about the money  Give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year. And is it easy to raise that money  And what's it going to be like the next couple of years  BA  It's interesting. We spend right now about     million to     million dollars a year. That's what it costs to reach     million children. It sounds like a lot of money  it is a lot of money. But when you're reaching     million children multiple times           cents to reach a child    that's not very much money. But right now we don't have enough of that. We have a big gap in that money. We're cutting corners  and every time we cut corners  more places get infected that shouldn't have  and it just slows us down. And that great buy costs us a little bit more. BG  Well  hopefully we'll get the word out  and the governments will keep their generosity up. So good luck. We're all in this with you. Thank you.  BA  Thank you. ,Epidemiologist,201105,5.920763187429861
78,1649,1651,Carl Honoré 2007,Carl Honoré,male,In praise of slowness,Feb 2007,1147,What I'd like to start off with is an observation  which is that if I've learned anything over the last year  it's that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast. I seem to spend most of my time these days zipping from city to city  studio to studio  interview to interview  serving up the book in really tiny bite size chunks. Because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down  but they want to know how to slow down really quickly. So ... so I did a spot on CNN the other day where I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air. And I think that    that's not really surprising though  is it  Because that's kind of the world that we live in now  a world stuck in fast forward. A world obsessed with speed  with doing everything faster  with cramming more and more into less and less time. Every moment of the day feels like a race against the clock. To borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher  which is in my bio there  I'll just toss it out again     These days even instant gratification takes too long.   Laughter  And if you think about how we to try to make things better  what do we do  No  we speed them up  don't we  So we used to dial  now we speed dial. We used to read  now we speed read. We used to walk  now we speed walk. And of course  we used to date and now we speed date. And even things that are by their very nature slow    we try and speed them up too. So I was in New York recently  and I walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course  a new evening course. And it was for  you guessed it  speed yoga. So this    the perfect solution for time starved professionals who want to  you know  salute the sun  but only want to give over about    minutes to it. I mean  these are sort of the extreme examples  and they're amusing and good to laugh at. But there's a very serious point  and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life  we often lose sight of the damage that this roadrunner form of living does to us. We're so marinated in the culture of speed that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives    on our health  our diet  our work  our relationships  the environment and our community. And sometimes it takes a wake up call  doesn't it  to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives  instead of actually living them  that we're living the fast life  instead of the good life. And I think for many people  that wake up call takes the form of an illness. You know  a burnout  or eventually the body says   I can't take it anymore   and throws in the towel. Or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we haven't had the time  or the patience  or the tranquility  to be with the other person  to listen to them. And my wake up call came when I started reading bedtime stories to my son  and I found that at the end of day  I would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down    you know  I'd be speed reading  The Cat In The Hat.  I'd be    you know  I'd be skipping lines here  paragraphs there  sometimes a whole page  and of course  my little boy knew the book inside out  so we would quarrel. And what should have been the most relaxing  the most intimate  the most tender moment of the day  when a dad sits down to read to his son  became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills  a clash between my speed and his slowness. And this went on for some time  until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article with timesaving tips for fast people. And one of them made reference to a series of books called  The One Minute Bedtime Story.  And I wince saying those words now  but my first reaction at the time was very different. My first reflex was to say   Hallelujah    what a great idea  This is exactly what I'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more.  But thankfully  a light bulb went on over my head  and my next reaction was very different  and I took a step back  and I thought   Whoa    you know  has it really come to this  Am I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day   And I put away the newspaper    and I was getting on a plane    and I sat there  and I did something I hadn't done for a long time    which is I did nothing. I just thought  and I thought long and hard. And by the time I got off that plane  I'd decided I wanted to do something about it. I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture  and what it was doing to me and to everyone else. And I had two questions in my head. The first was  how did we get so fast  And the second is  is it possible  or even desirable  to slow down  Now  if you think about how our world got so accelerated  the usual suspects rear their heads. You think of  you know  urbanization  consumerism  the workplace  technology. But I think if you cut through those forces  you get to what might be the deeper driver  the nub of the question  which is how we think about time itself. In other cultures  time is cyclical. It's seen as moving in great  unhurried circles. It's always renewing and refreshing itself. Whereas in the West  time is linear. It's a finite resource  it's always draining away. You either use it  or lose it.  Time is money   as Benjamin Franklin said. And I think what that does to us psychologically is it creates an equation. Time is scarce  so what do we do  Well    well  we speed up  don't we  We try and do more and more with less and less time. We turn every moment of every day into a race to the finish line    a finish line  incidentally  that we never reach  but a finish line nonetheless. And I guess that the question is  is it possible to break free from that mindset  And thankfully  the answer is yes  because what I discovered  when I began looking around  that there is a global backlash against this culture that tells us that faster is always better  and that busier is best. Right across the world  people are doing the unthinkable  they're slowing down  and finding that  although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down  you're road kill  the opposite turns out to be true  that by slowing down at the right moments  people find that they do everything better. They eat better  they make love better  they exercise better  they work better  they live better. And  in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration  lie what a lot of people now refer to as the  International Slow Movement.  Now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy  I'll just give you a very quick overview of what's going on inside the Slow Movement. If you think of food  many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement. Started in Italy  but has spread across the world  and now has         members in    countries. And it's driven by a very simple and sensible message  which is that we get more pleasure and more health from our food when we cultivate  cook and consume it at a reasonable pace. I think also the explosion of the organic farming movement  and the renaissance of farmers' markets  are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable. They want to get back to slower rhythms. And out of the Slow Food movement has grown something called the Slow Cities movement  which has started in Italy  but has spread right across Europe and beyond. And in this  towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape  so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another. So they might curb traffic  or put in a park bench  or some green space. And in some ways  these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts  because I think when a Slow City becomes officially a Slow City  it's kind of like a philosophical declaration. It's saying to the rest of world  and to the people in that town  that we believe that in the   st century  slowness has a role to play. In medicine  I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick fix mentality you find in conventional medicine. And millions of them around the world are turning to complementary and alternative forms of medicine  which tend to tap into sort of slower  gentler  more holistic forms of healing. Now  obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies  and I personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever  you know  gain mainstream approval. But other treatments such as acupuncture and massage  and even just relaxation  clearly have some kind of benefit. And blue chip medical colleges everywhere are starting to study these things to find out how they work  and what we might learn from them. Sex. There's an awful lot of fast sex around  isn't there  I was coming to    well    no pun intended there. I was making my way  let's say  slowly to Oxford  and I went through a news agent  and I saw a magazine  a men's magazine  and it said on the front   How to bring your partner to orgasm in    seconds.  So  you know  even sex is on a stopwatch these days. Now  you know  I like a quickie as much as the next person  but I think that there's an awful lot to be gained from slow sex    from slowing down in the bedroom. You know  you tap into that    those deeper  sort of  psychological  emotional  spiritual currents  and you get a better orgasm with the buildup. You can get more bang for your buck  let's say. I mean  the Pointer Sisters said it most eloquently  didn't they  when they sang the praises of  a lover with a slow hand.  Now  we all laughed at Sting a few years ago when he went Tantric  but you fast forward a few years  and now you find couples of all ages flocking to workshops  or maybe just on their own in their own bedrooms  finding ways to put on the brakes and have better sex. And of course  in Italy where    I mean  Italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure    they've launched an official Slow Sex movement. The workplace. Right across much of the world    North America being a notable exception    working hours have been coming down. And Europe is an example of that  and people finding that their quality of life improves as they're working less  and also that their hourly productivity goes up. Now  clearly there are problems with the    hour workweek in France    too much  too soon  too rigid. But other countries in Europe  notably the Nordic countries  are showing that it's possible to have a kick ass economy without being a workaholic. And Norway  Sweden  Denmark and Finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on Earth  and they work the kind of hours that would make the average American weep with envy. And if you go beyond sort of the country level  down at the micro company level  more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug    to take a lunch break  or to go sit in a quiet room  to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops    you at the back    mobile phones  during the work day or on the weekend  so that they have time to recharge and for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought. It's not just  though  these days  adults who overwork  though  is it  It's children  too. I'm     and my childhood ended in the mid '  s  and I look at kids now  and I'm just amazed by the way they race around with more homework  more tutoring  more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago. And some of the most heartrending emails that I get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout  pleading with me to write to their parents  to help them slow down  to help them get off this full throttle treadmill. But thankfully  there is a backlash there in parenting as well  and you're finding that  you know  towns in the United States are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month  so that people can  you know  decompress and have some family time  and slow down. Homework is another thing. There are homework bans springing up all over the developed world in schools which had been piling on the homework for years  and now they're discovering that less can be more. So there was a case up in Scotland recently where a fee paying  high achieving private school banned homework for everyone under the age of     and the high achieving parents freaked out and said   What are you    you know  our kids will fall     the headmaster said   No  no  your children need to slow down at the end of the day.  And just this last month  the exam results came in  and in math  science  marks went up    percent on average last year. And I think what's very revealing is that the elite universities  who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much  are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling. These kids have wonderful marks  they have CVs jammed with extracurriculars  to the point that would make your eyes water. But they lack spark  they lack the ability to think creatively and think outside    they don't know how to dream. And so what these Ivy League schools  and Oxford and Cambridge and so on  are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit. And in Harvard  for instance  they send out a letter to undergraduates    freshmen    telling them that they'll get more out of life  and more out of Harvard  if they put on the brakes  if they do less  but give time to things  the time that things need  to enjoy them  to savor them. And even if they sometimes do nothing at all. And that letter is called    very revealing  I think     Slow Down      with an exclamation mark on the end. So wherever you look  the message  it seems to me  is the same  that less is very often more  that slower is very often better. But that said  of course  it's not that easy to slow down  is it  I mean  you heard that I got a speeding ticket while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness  and that's true  but that's not all of it. I was actually en route to a dinner held by Slow Food at the time. And if that's not shaming enough  I got that ticket in Italy. And if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway  you'll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going. But why is it so hard to slow down  I think there are various reasons. One is that speed is fun  you know  speed is sexy. It's all that adrenaline rush. It's hard to give it up. I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension    that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger  deeper questions. We fill our head with distraction  with busyness  so that we don't have to ask  am I well  Am I happy  Are my children growing up right  Are politicians making good decisions on my behalf  Another reason    although I think  perhaps  the most powerful reason    why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo that we've erected against slowing down.  Slow  is a dirty word in our culture. It's a byword for  lazy    slacker   for being somebody who gives up. You know   he's a bit slow.  It's actually synonymous with being stupid. I guess what the Slow Movement    the purpose of the Slow Movement  or its main goal  really  is to tackle that taboo  and to say that yes  sometimes slow is not the answer  that there is such a thing as  bad slow.  You know  I got stuck on the M    which is a ring road around London  recently  and spent three and a half hours there. And I can tell you  that's really bad slow. But the new idea  the sort of revolutionary idea  of the Slow Movement  is that there is such a thing as  good slow   too. And good slow is  you know  taking the time to eat a meal with your family  with the TV switched off. Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work. Or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life. Now  one of the things that I found most uplifting about all of this stuff that's happened around the book since it came out  is the reaction to it. And I knew that when my book on slowness came out  it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade  but it's also been taken up  with great gusto  by the corporate world    you know  business press  but also big companies and leadership organizations. Because people at the top of the chain  people like you  I think  are starting to realize that there's too much speed in the system  there's too much busyness  and it's time to find  or get back to that lost art of shifting gears. Another encouraging sign  I think  is that it's not just in the developed world that this idea's been taken up. In the developing world  in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status    China  Brazil  Thailand  Poland  and so on    these countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement  many people in them  and there's a debate going on in their media  on the streets. Because I think they're looking at the West  and they're saying   Well  we like that aspect of what you've got  but we're not so sure about that.  So all of that said  is it  I guess  is it possible  That's really the main question before us today. Is it possible to slow down  And I'm happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding yes. And I present myself as Exhibit A  a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speed aholic. I still love speed. You know  I live in London  and I work as a journalist  and I enjoy the buzz and the busyness  and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things. I play squash and ice hockey  two very fast sports  and I wouldn't give them up for the world. But I've also  over the last year or so  got in touch with my inner tortoise. And what that means is that I no longer overload myself gratuitously. My default mode is no longer to be a rush aholic. I no longer hear time's winged chariot drawing near  or at least not as much as I did before. I can actually hear it now  because I see my time is ticking off. And the upshot of all of that is that I actually feel a lot happier  healthier  more productive than I ever have. I feel like I'm living my life rather than actually just racing through it. And perhaps  the most important measure of the success of this is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper  richer  stronger. And for me  I guess  the litmus test for whether this would work  and what it would mean  was always going to be bedtime stories  because that's sort of where the journey began. And there too the news is rosy. You know  at the end of the day  I go into my son's room. I don't wear a watch. I switch off my computer  so I can't hear the email pinging into the basket  and I just slow down to his pace and we read. And because children have their own tempo and internal clock  they don't do quality time  where you schedule    minutes for them to open up to you. They need you to move at their rhythm. I find that    minutes into a story  you know  my son will suddenly say   You know  something happened in the playground today that really bothered me.  And we'll go off and have a conversation on that. And I now find that bedtime stories used to be a box on my to do list  something that I dreaded  because it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly. It's become my reward at the end of the day  something I really cherish. And I have a kind of Hollywood ending to my talk this afternoon  which goes a little bit like this  a few months ago  I was getting ready to go on another book tour  and I had my bags packed. I was downstairs by the front door  and I was waiting for a taxi  and my son came down the stairs and he'd made a card for me. And he was carrying it. He'd gone and stapled two cards  very like these  together  and put a sticker of his favorite character  Tintin  on the front. And he said to me  or he handed this to me  and I read it  and it said   To Daddy  love Benjamin.  And I thought   Aw  that's really sweet. Is that a good luck on the book tour card   And he said   No  no  no  Daddy    this is a card for being the best story reader in the world.  And I thought   Yeah  you know  this slowing down thing really does work.  Thank you very much.,,200702,6.020080971659925
82,656,658,Catherine Bracy 2014,Catherine Bracy,female,Why good hackers make good citizens,Feb 2014,581,I'm going to talk about hackers. And the image that comes to your mind when I say that word is probably not of Benjamin Franklin  but I'm going to explain to you why it should be. The image that comes to your mind is probably more likely of a pasty kid sitting in a basement doing something mischievous  or of a shady criminal who is trying to steal your identity  or of an international rogue with a political agenda. And mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea that hackers are people that we should be afraid of. But like most things in technology and the technology world  hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil. For every hacker that's trying to steal your identity there's one that's building a tool that will help you find your loved ones after a disaster or to monitor environmental quality after an oil spill. Hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system  and it is a deeply democratic activity. It's about critical thinking. It's about questioning existing ways of doing things. It's the idea that if you see a  problem  you work to fix it  and not just complain about it. And in many ways  hacking is what built America. Betsy Ross was a hacker. The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack. And from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs  hacking has always been at the foundation of American democracy. So if there's one thing I want to leave you here with today  it's that the next time you think about who a hacker is  you think not of this guy but of this guy  Benjamin Franklin  who was one of the greatest hackers of all time. He was one of America's most prolific inventors  though he famously never filed a patent  because he thought that all human knowledge should be freely available. He brought us bifocals and the lightning rod  and of course there was his collaboration on the invention of American democracy. And in Code For America  we really try to embody the spirit of Ben Franklin. He was a tinkerer and a statesman whose conception of citizenship was always predicated on action. He believed that government could be built by the people  and we call those people civic hackers. So it's no wonder that the values that underly a healthy democracy  like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise  are the same values that underly the Internet. And so it's no surprise that many hackers are turning their attention to the problem of government. But before I give you a few examples of what civic hacking looks like  I want to make clear that you don't have to be a programmer to be a civic hacker. You just have to believe that you can bring a   st century tool set to bear on the problems that government faces. And we hear all the time from our community of civic hackers at Code for America that they didn't understand how much nontechnical work actually went into civic hacking projects. So keep that in mind. All of you are potential civic hackers. So what does civic hacking look like  Our team last year in Honolulu  which in this case was three full time fellows who were doing a year of public service  were asked by the city to rebuild the website. And it's a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages which just wasn't going to be possible in the few months that they had. So instead  they decided to build a parallel site that better conformed to how citizens actually want to interact with information on a city website. They're looking for answers to questions  and they want to take action when they're done  which is really hard to do from a site that looks like this. So our team built Honolulu Answers  which is a super simple search interface where you enter a search term or a question and get back plain language answers that drive a user towards action. Now the site itself was easy enough to build  but the team was faced with the challenge of how they populate all of the content. It would have taken the three of them a very long time  especially given that none of  them are actually from Honolulu. And so they did something that's really radical  when you think about how government is used to working. They asked citizens to write the content. So you've heard of a hack a thon. They held a write a thon  where on one Saturday afternoon    Wild pigs are a huge problem  in Honolulu  apparently. In one Saturday afternoon  they were able to populate most of the content for most of the frequently asked questions  but more importantly than that  they created a new way for citizens  to participate in their government. Now  I think this is a really cool story in and of itself  but it gets more awesome. On the National Day of Civic Hacking this past June in Oakland  where I live  the Code For America team in Oakland took the open source code base of Honolulu Answers and turned it into Oakland Answers  and again we held a write a thon where we took the most frequently asked questions and had citizens write the answers to them  and I got into the act. I authored this answer  and a few others. And I'm trying to this day to articulate the sense of empowerment and responsibility that I feel for the place that I live based simply on this small act of participation. And by stitching together my small act with the thousands of other small acts of participation that we're enabling through civic hacking  we think we can reenergize citizenship and restore trust in government. At this point  you may be wondering what city officials think of all this. They actually love it. As most of you guys know  cities are being asked every day to do more with less  and they're always looking for innovative solutions to entrenched problems. So when you give citizens a way to participate beyond attending a town hall meeting  cities can actually capture the capacity in their communities to do the business of government. Now I don't want to leave the impression that civic hacking is just an American phenomenon. It's happening across the globe  and one of my favorite examples is from Mexico City  where earlier this year  the Mexico House of Representatives entered into a contract with a software development firm to build an app that legislators would use to track bills. So this was just for the handful of legislators in the House. And the contract was a two year contract for  .  million dollars. Now a lot of people were really angry about this  especially geeks who knew that  .  million dollars was an absolutely outrageous amount of money for what was a very simple app. But instead of taking to the streets  they issued a challenge. They asked programmers in Mexico to build something better and cheaper  and they offered a prize of       dollars           times cheaper than the government contract  and they gave the entrants    days. And in those    days  they submitted     apps  five of which were presented to Congress and are still in the app store today. And because of this action  that contract was vacated  and now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City which is home to one of our partners  Code for Mexico City. And so what you see in all three of these places  in Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City  are the elements that are at the core of civic hacking. It's citizens who saw things that could be working better and they decided to fix them  and through that work  they're creating a   st century ecosystem of participation. They're creating a whole new set of ways for citizens to be involved  besides voting or signing a petition or protesting. They can actually build government. So back to our friend Ben Franklin  who  one of his lesser known accomplishments was that in      he founded the first volunteer firefighting company in Philadelphia  called a brigade. And it's because he and his friends noticed that the city was having trouble keeping up with all the fires that were happening in the city  so in true civic hacker fashion  they built a solution. And we have our own brigades at Code for America working on the projects that I've just described  and we want to ask you to follow in Ben Franklin's footsteps and come join us. We have    brigades in the U.S. We are pleased to announce today that we're opening up the  brigade to international cities for the first time  starting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland. You can find out if there's a brigade where you live at brigade.codeforamerica.org  and if there's not a brigade where you live  we will help you. We've created a tool kit which also lives at brigade.codeforamerica.org  and we will support you along the way. Our goal is to create a global network of civic hackers who are innovating on the existing system in order to build tools that will solve entrenched problems  that will support local government  and that will empower citizens. So please come hack with us. Thank you.,"Hacker, community manager",201402,6.1707225433526025
86,1606,1608,Charles Leadbeater 2007,Charles Leadbeater,male,The era of open innovation,Jan 2007,1125,What I'm going to do  in the spirit of collaborative creativity  is simply repeat many of the points that the three people before me have already made  but do them    this is called  creative collaboration   it's actually called  borrowing     but do it through a particular perspective  and that is to ask about the role of users and consumers in this emerging world of collaborative creativity that Jimmy and others have talked about. Let me just ask you  to start with  this simple question  who invented the mountain bike  Because traditional economic theory would say  well  the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big R D lab where they were thinking up new projects  and it came out of there. It didn't come from there. Another answer might be  well  it came from a sort of lone genius working in his garage  who  working away on different kinds of bikes  comes up with a bike out of thin air. It didn't come from there. The mountain bike came from users  came from young users  particularly a group in Northern California  who were frustrated with traditional racing bikes  which were those sort of bikes that Eddy Merckx rode  or your big brother  and they're very glamorous. But also frustrated with the bikes that your dad rode  which sort of had big handlebars like that  and they were too heavy. So  they got the frames from these big bikes  put them together with the gears from the racing bikes  got the brakes from motorcycles  and sort of mixed and matched various ingredients. And for the first  I don't know  three to five years of their life  mountain bikes were known as  clunkers.  And they were just made in a community of bikers  mainly in Northern California. And then one of these companies that was importing parts for the clunkers decided to set up in business  start selling them to other people  and gradually another company emerged out of that  Marin  and it probably was  I don't know      maybe even     years  before the big bike companies realized there was a market. Thirty years later  mountain bike sales and mountain bike equipment account for    percent of bike sales in America. That's    billion dollars. This is a category entirely created by consumers that would not have been created by the mainstream bike market because they couldn't see the need  the opportunity  they didn't have the incentive to innovate. The one thing I think I disagree with about Yochai's presentation is when he said the Internet causes this distributive capacity for innovation to come alive. It's when the Internet combines with these kinds of passionate pro am consumers    who are knowledgeable  they've got the incentive to innovate  they've got the tools  they want to    that you get this kind of explosion of creative collaboration. And out of that  you get the need for the kind of things that Jimmy was talking about  which is our new kinds of organization  or a better way to put it  how do we organize ourselves without organizations  That's now possible  you don't need an organization to be organized  to achieve large and complex tasks  like innovating new software programs. So this is a huge challenge to the way we think creativity comes about. The traditional view  still enshrined in much of the way that we think about creativity    in organizations  in government    is that creativity is about special people  wear baseball caps the wrong way round  come to conferences like this  in special places  elite universities  R D labs in the forests  water  maybe special rooms in companies painted funny colors  you know  bean bags  maybe the odd table football table. Special people  special places  think up special ideas  then you have a pipeline that takes the ideas down to the waiting consumers  who are passive. They can say  yes  or  no  to the invention. That's the idea of creativity. What's the policy recommendation out of that if you're in government  or you're running a large company  More special people  more special places. Build creative clusters in cities  create more R D parks  so on and so forth. Expand the pipeline down to the consumers. Well this view  I think  is increasingly wrong. I think it's always been wrong  because I think always creativity has been highly collaborative  and it's probably been largely interactive. But it's increasingly wrong  and one of the reasons it's wrong is that the ideas are flowing back up the pipeline. The ideas are coming back from the consumers  and they're often ahead of the producers. Why is that  Well  one issue is that radical innovation  when you've got ideas that affect a large number of technologies or people  have a great deal of uncertainty attached to them. The payoffs to innovation are greatest where the uncertainty is highest. And when you get a radical innovation  it's often very uncertain how it can be applied. The whole history of telephony is a story of dealing with that uncertainty. The very first landline telephones  the inventors thought that they would be used for people to listen in to live performances from West End theaters. When the mobile telephone companies invented SMS  they had no idea what it was for  it was only when that technology got into the hands of teenage users that they invented the use. So the more radical the innovation  the more the uncertainty  the more you need innovation in use to work out what a technology is for. All of our patents  our entire approach to patents and invention  is based on the idea that the inventor knows what the invention is for  we can say what it's for. More and more  the inventors of things will not be able to say that in advance. It will be worked out in use  in collaboration with users. We like to think that invention is a sort of moment of creation  there is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea. The truth is that most creativity is cumulative and collaborative  like Wikipedia  it develops over a long period of time. The second reason why users are more and more important is that they are the source of big  disruptive innovations. If you want to find the big new ideas  it's often difficult to find them in mainstream markets  in big organizations. And just look inside large organizations and you'll see why that is so. So  you're in a big corporation. You're obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder. Do you go into your board and say   Look  I've got a fantastic idea for an embryonic product in a marginal market  with consumers we've never dealt with before  and I'm not sure it's going to have a big payoff  but it could be really  really big in the future   No  what you do  is you go in and you say   I've got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovation to an existing product we sell through existing channels to existing users  and I can guarantee you get this much return out of it over the next three years.  Big corporations have an in built tendency to reinforce past success. They've got so much sunk in it that it's very difficult for them to spot emerging new markets. Emerging new markets  then  are the breeding grounds for passionate users. Best example  who in the music industry     years ago  would have said   Yes  let's invent a musical form which is all about dispossessed black men in ghettos expressing their frustration with the world through a form of music that many people find initially quite difficult to listen to. That sounds like a winner  we'll go with it.  So what happens  Rap music is created by the users. They do it on their own tapes  with their own recording equipment  they distribute it themselves.    years later  rap music is the dominant musical form of popular culture    would never have come from the big companies. Had to start    this is the third point    with these pro ams. This is the phrase that I've used in some stuff which I've done with a think tank in London called Demos  where we've been looking at these people who are amateurs    i.e.  they do it for the love of it    but they want to do it to very high standards. And across a whole range of fields    from software  astronomy  natural sciences  vast areas of leisure and culture like kite surfing  so on and so forth    you find people who want to do things because they love it  but they want to do these things to very high standards. They work at their leisure  if you like. They take their leisure very seriously  they acquire skills  they invest time  they use technology that's getting cheaper    it's not just the Internet  cameras  design technology  leisure technology  surfboards  so on and so forth. Largely through globalization  a lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper. More knowledgeable consumers  more educated  more able to connect with one another  more able to do things together. Consumption  in that sense  is an expression of their productive potential. Why  we found  people were interested in this  is that at work they don't feel very expressed. They don't feel as if they're doing something that really matters to them  so they pick up these kinds of activities. This has huge organizational implications for very large areas of life. Take astronomy as an example  which Yochai has already mentioned. Twenty years ago     years ago  only big professional astronomers with very big telescopes could see far into space. And there's a big telescope in Northern England called Jodrell Bank  and when I was a kid  it was amazing  because the moon shots would take off  and this thing would move on rails. And it was huge    it was absolutely enormous. Now  six amateur astronomers  working with the Internet  with Dobsonian digital telescopes    which are pretty much open source    with some light sensors developed over the last    years  the Internet    they can do what Jodrell Bank could only do    years ago. So here in astronomy  you have this vast explosion of new productive resources. The users can be producers. What does this mean  then  for our organizational landscape  Well  just imagine a world  for the moment  divided into two camps. Over here  you've got the old  traditional corporate model  special people  special places  patent it  push it down the pipeline to largely waiting  passive consumers. Over here  let's imagine we've got Wikipedia  Linux  and beyond    open source. This is open  this is closed. This is new  this is traditional. Well  the first thing you can say  I think with certainty  is what Yochai has said already    is there is a great big struggle between those two organizational forms. These people over there will do everything they can to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding  because they're threatened by them. And so the debates about copyright  digital rights  so on and so forth    these are all about trying to stifle  in my view  these kinds of organizations. What we're seeing is a complete corruption of the idea of patents and copyright. Meant to be a way to incentivize invention  meant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge  they are increasingly being used by large companies to create thickets of patents to prevent innovation taking place. Let me just give you two examples. The first is  imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist and saying   I've got a fantastic idea. I've invented this brilliant new program that is much  much better than Microsoft Outlook.  Which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture competing with Microsoft  with Microsoft Outlook  No one. That is why the competition with Microsoft is bound to come    will only come    from an open source kind of project. So  there is a huge competitive argument about sustaining the capacity for open source and consumer driven innovation  because it's one of the greatest competitive levers against monopoly. There'll be huge professional arguments as well. Because the professionals  over here in these closed organizations    they might be academics  they might be programmers  they might be doctors  they might be journalists    my former profession    say   No  no    you can't trust these people over here.  When I started in journalism    Financial Times     years ago    it was very  very exciting to see someone reading the newspaper. And you'd kind of look over their shoulder on the Tube to see if they were reading your article. Usually they were reading the share prices  and the bit of the paper with your article on was on the floor  or something like that  and you know   For heaven's sake  what are they doing  They're not reading my brilliant article   And we allowed users  readers  two places where they could contribute to the paper  the letters page  where they could write a letter in  and we would condescend to them  cut it in half  and print it three days later. Or the op ed page  where if they knew the editor    had been to school with him  slept with his wife    they could write an article for the op ed page. Those were the two places. Shock  horror  now  the readers want to be writers and publishers. That's not their role  they're supposed to read what we write. But they don't want to be journalists. The journalists think that the bloggers want to be journalists  they don't want to be journalists  they just want to have a voice. They want to  as Jimmy said  they want to have a dialogue  a conversation. They want to be part of that flow of information. What's happening there is that the whole domain of creativity is expanding. So  there's going to be a tremendous struggle. But  also  there's going to be tremendous movement from the open to the closed. What you'll see  I think  is two things that are critical  and these  I think  are two challenges for the open movement. The first is  can we really survive on volunteers  If this is so critical  do we not need it funded  organized  supported in much more structured ways  I think the idea of creating the Red Cross for information and knowledge is a fantastic idea  but can we really organize that  just on volunteers  What kind of changes do we need in public policy and funding to make that possible  What's the role of the BBC  for instance  in that world  What should be the role of public policy  And finally  what I think you will see is the intelligent  closed organizations moving increasingly in the open direction. So it's not going to be a contest between two camps  but  in between them  you'll find all sorts of interesting places that people will occupy. New organizational models coming about  mixing closed and open in tricky ways. It won't be so clear cut  it won't be Microsoft versus Linux    there'll be all sorts of things in between. And those organizational models  it turns out  are incredibly powerful  and the people who can understand them will be very  very successful. Let me just give you one final example of what that means. I was in Shanghai  in an office block built on what was a rice paddy five years ago    one of the       skyscrapers they've built in Shanghai in the last    years. And I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan. Timothy Chan set up an Internet business in     . Didn't go into the Internet  kept his money  decided to go into computer games. He runs a company called Shanda  which is the largest computer games company in China. Nine thousand servers all over China  has     million subscribers. At any one time  there are four million people playing one of his games. How many people does he employ to service that population      people. Well  how can he service     million people from     employees  Because basically  he doesn't service them. He gives them a platform  he gives them some rules  he gives them the tools and then he kind of orchestrates the conversation  he orchestrates the action. But actually  a lot of the content is created by the users themselves. And it creates a kind of stickiness between the community and the company which is really  really powerful. The best measure of that  so you go into one of his games  you create a character that you develop in the course of the game. If  for some reason  your credit card bounces  or there's some other problem  you lose your character. You've got two options. One option  you can create a new character  right from scratch  but with none of the history of your player. That costs about     dollars. Or you can get on a plane  fly to Shanghai  queue up outside Shanda's offices    cost probably          dollars    and reclaim your character  get your history back. Every morning  there are     people queuing outside their offices to reclaim these characters.  Laughter  So this is about companies built on communities  that provide communities with tools  resources  platforms in which they can share. He's not open source  but it's very  very powerful. So here is one of the challenges  I think  for people like me  who do a lot of work with government. If you're a games company  and you've got a million players in your game  you only need one percent of them to be co developers  contributing ideas  and you've got a development workforce of        people. Imagine you could take all the children in education in Britain  and one percent of them were co developers of education. What would that do to the resources available to the education system  Or if you got one percent of the patients in the NHS to  in some sense  be co producers of health. The reason why    despite all the efforts to cut it down  to constrain it  to hold it back    why these open models will still start emerging with tremendous force  is that they multiply our productive resources. And one of the reasons they do that is that they turn users into producers  consumers into designers. Thank you very much.,Innovation consultant,200701,6.1803042876901815
87,1731,1733,Charles Leadbeater 2010,Charles Leadbeater,male,Education innovation in the slums,Jun 2010,1124,It's a great pleasure to be here. It's a great pleasure to speak after Brian Cox from CERN. I think CERN is the home of the Large Hadron Collider. What ever happened to the Small Hadron Collider  Where is the Small Hadron Collider  Because the Small Hadron Collider once was the big thing. Now  the Small Hadron Collider is in a cupboard  overlooked and neglected. You know when the Large Hadron Collider started  and it didn't work  and people tried to work out why  it was the Small Hadron Collider team who sabotaged it because they were so jealous. The whole Hadron Collider family needs unlocking. The lesson of Brian's presentation  in a way    all those fantastic pictures    is this really  that vantage point determines everything that you see. What Brian was saying was science has opened up successively different vantage points from which we can see ourselves  and that's why it's so valuable. So the vantage point you take determines virtually everything that you will see. The question that you will ask will determine much of the answer that you get. And so if you ask this question  Where would you look to see the future of education  The answer that we've traditionally given to that is very straightforward  at least in the last    years  You go to Finland. Finland is the best place in the world to see school systems. The Finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there's a very high suicide rate  but by golly  they are qualified. And they have absolutely amazing education systems. So we all troop off to Finland  and we wonder at the social democratic miracle of Finland and its cultural homogeneity and all the rest of it  and then we struggle to imagine how we might bring lessons back. Well  so  for this last year  with the help of Cisco who sponsored me  for some balmy reason  to do this  I've been looking somewhere else. Because actually radical innovation does sometimes come from the very best  but it often comes from places where you have huge need    unmet  latent demand    and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work    traditional  high cost solutions  which depend on professionals  which is what schools and hospitals are. So I ended up in places like this. This is a place called Monkey Hill. It's one of the hundreds of favelas in Rio. Most of the population growth of the next    years will be in cities. We'll grow by six cities of    million people a year for the next    years. Almost all of that growth will be in the developed world. Almost all of that growth will be in places like Monkey Hill. This is where you'll find the fastest growing young populations of the world. So if you want recipes to work    for virtually anything    health  education  government politics and education    you have to go to these places. And if you go to these places  you meet people like this. This is a guy called Juanderson. At the age of     in common with many    year olds in the Brazilian education system  he dropped out of school. It was boring. And Juanderson  instead  went into what provided kind of opportunity and hope in the place that he lived  which was the drugs trade. And by the age of     with rapid promotion  he was running the drugs trade in    favelas. He was turning over         dollars a week. He employed     people. He was going to be dead by the age of   . And luckily  he met this guy  who is Rodrigo Baggio  the owner of the first laptop to ever appear in Brazil.       Rodrigo started something called CDI  which took computers donated by corporations  put them into community centers in favelas and created places like this. What turned Juanderson around was technology for learning that made learning fun and accessible. Or you can go to places like this. This is Kibera  which is the largest slum in East Africa. Millions of people living here  stretched over many kilometers. And there I met these two  Azra on the left  Maureen on the right. They just finished their Kenyan certificate of secondary education. That name should tell you that the Kenyan education system borrows almost everything from Britain  circa       but has managed to make it even worse. So there are schools in slums like this. They're places like this. That's where Maureen went to school. They're private schools. There are no state schools in slums. And the education they got was pitiful. It was in places like this. This a school set up by some nuns in another slum called Nakuru. Half the children in this classroom have no parents because they've died through AIDS. The other half have one parent because the other parent has died through AIDS. So the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the kings and queens of Kenya or Britain. They are to stay alive  to earn a living  to not become HIV positive. The one technology that spans rich and poor in places like this is not anything to do with industrial technology. It's not to do with electricity or water. It's the mobile phone. If you want to design from scratch virtually any service in Africa  you would start now with the mobile phone. Or you could go to places like this. This is a place called the Madangiri Settlement Colony  which is a very developed slum about    minutes outside New Delhi  where I met these characters who showed me around for the day. The remarkable thing about these girls  and the sign of the kind of social revolution sweeping through the developing world is that these girls are not married. Ten years ago  they certainly would have been married. Now they're not married  and they want to go on to study further  to have a career. They've been brought up by mothers who are illiterate  who have never ever done homework. All across the developing world there are millions of parents    tens  hundreds of millions    who for the first time are with children doing homework and exams. And the reason they carry on studying is not because they went to a school like this. This is a private school. This is a fee pay school. This is a good school. This is the best you can get in Hyderabad in Indian education. The reason they went on studying was this. This is a computer installed in the entrance to their slum by a revolutionary social entrepreneur called Sugata Mitra who has conducted the most radical experiments  showing that children  in the right conditions  can learn on their own with the help of computers. Those girls have never touched Google. They know nothing about Wikipedia. Imagine what their lives would be like if you could get that to them. So if you look  as I did  through this tour  and by looking at about a hundred case studies of different social entrepreneurs working in these very extreme conditions  look at the recipes that they come up with for learning  they look nothing like school. What do they look like  Well  education is a global religion. And education  plus technology  is a great source of hope. You can go to places like this. This is a school three hours outside of Sao Paulo. Most of the children there have parents who are illiterate. Many of them don't have electricity at home. But they find it completely obvious to use computers  websites  make videos  so on and so forth. When you go to places like this what you see is that education in these settings works by pull  not push. Most of our education system is push. I was literally pushed to school. When you get to school  things are pushed at you  knowledge  exams  systems  timetables. If you want to attract people like Juanderson who could  for instance  buy guns  wear jewelry  ride motorbikes and get girls through the drugs trade  and you want to attract him into education  having a compulsory curriculum doesn't really make sense. That isn't really going to attract him. You need to pull him. And so education needs to work by pull  not push. And so the idea of a curriculum is completely irrelevant in a setting like this. You need to start education from things that make a difference to them in their settings. What does that  Well  the key is motivation  and there are two aspects to it. One is to deliver extrinsic motivation  that education has a payoff. Our education systems all work on the principle that there is a payoff  but you have to wait quite a long time. That's too long if you're poor. Waiting    years for the payoff from education is too long when you need to meet daily needs  when you've got siblings to look after or a business to help with. So you need education to be relevant and help people to make a living there and then  often. And you also need to make it intrinsically interesting. So time and again  I found people like this. This is an amazing guy  Sebastiao Rocha  in Belo Horizonte  in the third largest city in Brazil. He's invented more than     games to teach virtually any subject under the sun. In the schools and communities that Taio works in  the day always starts in a circle and always starts from a question. Imagine an education system that started from questions  not from knowledge to be imparted  or started from a game  not from a lesson  or started from the premise that you have to engage people first before you can possibly teach them. Our education systems  you do all that stuff afterward  if you're lucky  sport  drama  music. These things  they teach through. They attract people to learning because it's really a dance project or a circus project or  the best example of all    El Sistema in Venezuela    it's a music project. And so you attract people through that into learning  not adding that on after all the learning has been done and you've eaten your cognitive greens. So El Sistema in Venezuela uses a violin as a technology of learning. Taio Rocha uses making soap as a technology of learning. And what you find when you go to these schemes is that they use people and places in incredibly creative ways. Masses of peer learning. How do you get learning to people when there are no teachers  when teachers won't come  when you can't afford them  and even if you do get teachers  what they teach isn't relevant to the communities that they serve  Well  you create your own teachers. You create peer to peer learning  or you create para teachers  or you bring in specialist skills. But you find ways to get learning that's relevant to people through technology  people and places that are different. So this is a school in a bus on a building site in Pune  the fastest growing city in Asia. Pune has       building sites. It has        children on those building sites. That's one city. Imagine that urban explosion that's going to take place across the developing world and how many thousands of children will spend their school years on building sites. Well  this is a very simple scheme to get the learning to them through a bus. And they all treat learning  not as some sort of academic  analytical activity  but as that's something that's productive  something you make  something that you can do  perhaps earn a living from. So I met this character  Steven. He'd spent three years in Nairobi living on the streets because his parents had died of AIDS. And he was finally brought back into school  not by the offer of GCSEs  but by the offer of learning how to become a carpenter  a practical making skill. So the trendiest schools in the world  High Tech High and others  they espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity. Here  there isn't really an option. Learning has to be productive in order for it to make sense. And finally  they have a different model of scale  and it's a Chinese restaurant model of how to scale. And I learned it from this guy  who is an amazing character. He's probably the most remarkable social entrepreneur in education in the world. His name is Madhav Chavan  and he created something called Pratham. And Pratham runs preschool play groups for  now     million children in India. It's the largest NGO in education in the world. And it also supports working class kids going into Indian schools. He's a complete revolutionary. He's actually a trade union organizer by background  and that's how he learned the skills to build his organization. When they got to a certain stage  Pratham got big enough to attract some pro bono support from McKinsey. McKinsey came along and looked at his model and said   You know what you should do with this  Madhav  You should turn it into McDonald's. And what you do when you go to any new site is you kind of roll out a franchise. And it's the same wherever you go. It's reliable and people know exactly where they are. And there will be no mistakes.  And Madhav said   Why do we have to do it that way  Why can't we do it more like the Chinese restaurants   There are Chinese restaurants everywhere  but there is no Chinese restaurant chain. Yet  everyone knows what is a Chinese restaurant. They know what to expect  even though it'll be subtly different and the colors will be different and the name will be different. You know a Chinese restaurant when you see it. These people work with the Chinese restaurant model    same principles  different applications and different settings    not the McDonald's model. The McDonald's model scales. The Chinese restaurant model spreads. So mass education started with social entrepreneurship in the   th century. And that's desperately what we need again on a global scale. And what can we learn from all of that  Well  we can learn a lot because our education systems are failing desperately in many ways. They fail to reach the people they most need to serve. They often hit their target but miss the point. Improvement is increasingly difficult to organize  our faith in these systems  incredibly fraught. And this is just a very simple way of understanding what kind of innovation  what kind of different design we need. There are two basic types of innovation. There's sustaining innovation  which will sustain an existing institution or an organization  and disruptive innovation that will break it apart  create some different way of doing it. There are formal settings    schools  colleges  hospitals    in which innovation can take place  and informal settings    communities  families  social networks. Almost all our effort goes in this box  sustaining innovation in formal settings  getting a better version of the essentially Bismarckian school system that developed in the   th century. And as I said  the trouble with this is that  in the developing world there just aren't teachers to make this model work. You'd need millions and millions of teachers in China  India  Nigeria and the rest of developing world to meet need. And in our system  we know that simply doing more of this won't eat into deep educational inequalities  especially in inner cities and former industrial areas. So that's why we need three more kinds of innovation. We need more reinvention. And all around the world now you see more and more schools reinventing themselves. They're recognizably schools  but they look different. There are Big Picture schools in the U.S. and Australia. There are Kunskapsskolan schools in Sweden. Of    of them  only two of them are in schools. Most of them are in other buildings not designed as schools. There is an amazing school in Northen Queensland called Jaringan. And they all have the same kind of features  highly collaborative  very personalized  often pervasive technology  learning that starts from questions and problems and projects  not from knowledge and curriculum. So we certainly need more of that. But because so many of the issues in education aren't just in school  they're in family and community  what you also need  definitely  is more on the right hand side. You need efforts to supplement schools. The most famous of these is Reggio Emilia in Italy  the family based learning system to support and encourage people in schools. The most exciting is the Harlem Children's Zone  which over    years  led by Geoffrey Canada  has  through a mixture of schooling and family and community projects  attempted to transform not just education in schools  but the entire culture and aspiration of about        families in Harlem. We need more of that completely new and radical thinking. You can go to places an hour away  less  from this room  just down the road  which need that  which need radicalism of a kind that we haven't imagined. And finally  you need transformational innovation that could imagine getting learning to people in completely new and different ways. So we are on the verge        of an amazing achievement  the schoolification of the world. Every child up to the age of    who wants a place in school will be able to have one in     . It's an amazing thing. But it is  unlike cars  which have developed so rapidly and orderly  actually the school system is recognizably an inheritance from the   th century  from a Bismarkian model of German schooling that got taken up by English reformers  and often by religious missionaries  taken up in the United States as a force of social cohesion  and then in Japan and South Korea as they developed. It's recognizably   th century in its roots. And of course it's a huge achievement. And of course it will bring great things. It will bring skills and learning and reading. But it will also lay waste to imagination. It will lay waste to appetite. It will lay waste to social confidence. It will stratify society as much as it liberates it. And we are bequeathing to the developing world school systems that they will now spend a century trying to reform. That is why we need really radical thinking  and why radical thinking is now more possible and more needed than ever in how we learn. Thank you.

89,887,889,Chris Anderson 2008,Chris Anderson,male,TED's nonprofit transition,Jan 2008,681,This is your conference  and I think you have a right to know a little bit right now  in this transition period  about this guy who's going to be looking after it for you for a bit. So  I'm just going to grab a chair here. Two years ago at TED  I think    I've come to this conclusion    I think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion. I think that I may have believed unconsciously  then  that I was kind of a business hero. I had this company that I'd spent    years building. It's called Future  it was a magazine publishing company. It had recently gone public and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars  a number I didn't really understand. A magazine I'd recently launched called Business  .  was fatter than a telephone directory  busy pumping hot air into the bubble. And I was the    percent owner of a dotcom that was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more. And all this had come from nothing. Fifteen years earlier  I was a science journalist who people just laughed at when I said   I really would like to start my own computer magazine.  And    years later  there are     of them and       people on staff and it was just such heady times. The date was February     . I thought the little graph of my business life that kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law    ever upward and to the right    it was going to go on forever. I mean  it had to. Right  I was in for quite a surprise. The dotcom  ironically called Snowball  was the very last consumer web company to go public the next month before NASDAQ exploded  and I entered    months of business hell. I watched everything that I'd built crumbling  and it looked like all this stuff was going to die and    years work would have come for nothing. And it was gut wrenching. It took eight years of blood  sweat and tears to reach     employees  something which I was very proud of in the business. February         in one day we laid off     people  and before the bloodshed was finished        people had lost their jobs from my companies. I felt sick. I watched my own net worth falling by about a million dollars a day  every day  for    months. And worse than that  far worse than that  my sense of self worth was kind of evaporating. I was going around with this big sign on my forehead   LOSER.  And I think what disgusts me more than anything  looking back  is how the hell did I let my personal happiness get so tied up with this business thing  Well  in the end  we were able to save Future and Snowball  but I was  at that point  ready to move on. And to cut a long story short  here's where I came to. And the reason I'm telling this story is that I believe  from many conversations  that a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster    emotional rollercoaster    in the last couple years. This has been a big  big transition time  and I believe that this conference can play a big part for all of us in taking us forward to the next stage to whatever's next. The theme next year is re birth. It was at the same TED two years ago when Richard and I reached an agreement on the future of TED. And at about the same time  and I think partly because of that  I started doing something that I'd forgotten about in my business focus  I started to read again. And I discovered that while I'd been busy playing business games  there'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest  cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology to ... all this stuff had changed. And the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much  and it was incredibly exciting. And what was really most exciting    and I think Richard Wurman discovered this at least    years before I did    was that all this stuff is connected. It's connected  it all hooks into each other. We talk about this a lot  and I thought about trying to give an example of this. So  just one example  Madame de Gaulle  the wife of the French president  was famously asked once   What do you most desire   And she answered   A penis.  And when you think about it  it's very true  what we all most desire is a penis    or  happiness  as we say in English. And something ... good luck with that one in the Japanese translation room. But something as basic as happiness  which    years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue  today it turns out that there's dozens of TED like questions that you can ask about it  which are really interesting. You can ask about what causes it biochemically  neuroscience  serotonin  all that stuff. You can ask what are the psychological causes of it  nature  Nurture  Current circumstance  Turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind blowing. You can view it as a computing problem  an artificial intelligence problem  do you need to incorporate some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly  You can view it in sort of geopolitical terms and say  why is it that a billion people on this planet are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness  and whereas almost all the rest of them  regardless of how much money they have    whether it's two dollars a day or whatever    are almost equally happy on average  Or you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing  did our genes invent this as a kind of trick to get us to behave in certain ways  The ant's brain  parasitized  to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate  Are we the victims of a mass delusion  And so on  and so on. To understand even something as important to us as happiness  you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions  and there's nowhere that I've discovered    other than TED    where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions. And so  it's the profound thing that Richard talks about  to understand anything  you just need to understand the little bits  a little bit about everything that surrounds it. And so  gradually over these three days  you start off kind of trying to figure out   Why am I listening to all this irrelevant stuff   And at the end of the four days  your brain is humming and you feel energized  alive and excited  and it's because all these different bits have been put together. It's the total brain experience  we're going to ... it's the mental equivalent of the full body massage. Every mental organ addressed. It really is. Enough of the theory  Chris. Tell us what you're actually going to do  all right  So  I will. Here's the vision for TED. Number one  do nothing. This thing ain't broke  so I ain't gonna fix it. Jeff Bezos kindly remarked to me   Chris  TED is a really great conference. You're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad.  So  I gave myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason  and I will promise you right here and now that the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with. Truth  curiosity  diversity  no selling  no corporate bullshit  no bandwagoning  no platforms. Just the pursuit of interest  wherever it lies  across all the disciplines that are represented here. That's not going to be changed at all. Number two  I am going to put together an incredible line up of speakers for next year. The time scale on which TED operates is just fantastic after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines. There's a year to do this  and already    I hope to show you a bit later    there's    or so terrific speakers signed up for next year. And I'm getting fantastic help from the community  this is just such a great community. And combined  our contacts reach pretty much everyone who's interesting in the country  if not the planet. It's true. Number three  I do want to  if I can  find a way of extending the TED experience throughout the year a little bit. And one key way that we're going to do this is to introduce this book club. Books kind of saved me in the last couple years  and that's a gift that I would like to pass on. So  when you sign up for TED      every six weeks you'll get a care package with a book or two and a reason why they're linked to TED. They may well be by a TED speaker  and so we can get the conversation going during the year and come back next year having had the same intellectual  emotional journey. I think it will be great. And then  fourthly  I want to mention the Sapling Foundation  which is the new owner of TED. What Sapling's ownership means is that all of the proceeds of TED will go towards the causes that Sapling stands for. And more important  I think  the ideas that are exhibited and realized here are ideas that the foundation can use  because there's fantastic synergy. Already  just in the last few days  we've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about  that they're passionate about  that can make a difference in the world  and the idea of getting this group of people together    some of the causes that we believe in  the money that this conference can raise and the ideas    I really believe that that combination will  over time  make a difference. I'm incredibly excited about that. In fact  I don't think  overall  that I've been as excited by anything ever in my life. I'm in this for the long run  and I would be greatly honored and excited if you'll come on this journey with me.,TED Curator,200801,6.1992287917737725
92,1715,1717,"Christopher ""moot"" Poole"" 2010","Christopher ""moot"" Poole""",male,The case for anonymity online,Jun 2010,670,Tom Green  That's a  chan thing. These kids on the Internet  they have this group of kids and they like to say funny words like  barrel roll.  It's a video game move from  Star Fox.   Star Fox       Assistant   Star Fox   .   Tom Green  Yeah. And they've been dogging me for a year. I got to tell you  it's driving me nuts  actually. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I scream    chan   Christopher Poole  When I was     I found this website called Futaba Channel. And it was a Japanese forum and imageboard. That format of forum  at that time  was not well known outside of Japan. And so what I did is I took it  I translated it into English  and I stuck it up for my friends to use. Now  six and a half years later  over seven million people are using it  contributing over         posts per day. And we've gone from one board to    boards. This is what it looks like. So  what's unique about the site is that it's anonymous  and it has no memory. There's no archive  there are no barriers  there's no registration. These things that we're used to with forums don't exist on  chan. And that's led to this discussion that's completely raw  completely unfiltered. What the site's known for  because it has this environment  is it's fostered the creation of a lot of Internet phenomena  viral videos and whatnot  known as  memes.  Two of the largest memes that have come out of this site some of you might be familiar with are these LOLcats    just silly pictures of cats with text. And this resonates with millions of people  apparently  because there are tens of thousands of these  and there is a whole blogging empire now dedicated to pictures like these. And Rick Astley's kind of rebirth these past two years ... Rickroll was this bait and switch  really simple  classic bait and switch. Somebody says they're linking to something interesting  and you get an '  s pop song. That's all it was. And it got big enough to the point where there was a float last year at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade  and Rick Astley pops out  and rickrolls millions of people on television. There are thousands of memes that come out of the site. There are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream  the ones I've just shown you  but every day  every month  people are producing thousands of these. So does a site like this have rules  We do  they're the codified rules that I've come up with  which are more or less ignored by the community. And so they've come up with their own set of rules  the  Rules of the Internet.  And so there are three that I want to show you specifically. Rule one is you don't talk about  b . Two is you do not talk about  b . And this one's kind of interesting   If it exists  there is porn of it. No exceptions.  And I will spare you that slide. I assure you  it is very true.  b  is the first board we started with  and it is  in many ways  the beating heart of the website. It is where a third of all the traffic is going. And  b  is known for  more than anything  not just the memes they've created  but the exploits. And Chris just touched on one of those a second ago  and that was the Time     poll. So somebody at Time  at the magazine  thought it would be fun to nominate me for this thing they did last year. And so they placed me on it  and the Internet got wind of it. My community decided they wanted me to win it. I didn't instruct them to do it  they just decided that that's what they wanted. And so  you know      percent approval rating ain't so bad. So they broke that poll. And I ended up on top. I ended up at this really fancy party. But that's not what's interesting about this. It's that they weren't putting me at the top of this list  they were actually    it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed all of the top    places to spell  mARBLECAKE. ALSO  THE GAME.  The amount of time and effort that went into that is absolutely incredible. And  marble cake  is significant because it is the channel that this group called Anonymous organized. Anonymous is this group of people that protested  very famously  Scientology. The story is  Scientology had this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise. It went up online. They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet. And so these people  over       people  less than one month later  organized in a hundred cities around the globe and    this is L.A.    protested the Church of Scientology  and they have continued to do so  now  two full years after the fact. They are still protesting. So we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group that's come out of the site. And last  I'm going to show you the example  the story of Dusty the cat. Dusty is the name that we've given to this cat. This young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on YouTube. And  you know  this didn't sit well with people  and so there was this outpouring of support for people to do something about this. So what they did is they    I mean  they put CSI to shame here    the Internet detectives came out. They matched  they found his MySpace. They took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video. Within    hours  they had his name  and within    hours  he was arrested. And so  what I think is really intriguing about a community like  chan is just that it's this open place. As I said  it's raw  it's unfiltered. And sites like it are kind of going the way of the dinosaur right now. They're endangered because we're moving towards social networking. We're moving towards persistent identity. We're moving towards  you know  a lack of privacy  really. We're sacrificing a lot of that  and I think in doing so  moving towards those things  we're losing something valuable. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Got a couple questions for you. But if I ask them  is the TED website going to go down  CP  You're lucky that this is not being streamed to them live right now. CA  Well  you never know. Some of them    we've got people in    countries out there watching. Don't tell. But seriously  this issue on anonymity is    I mean  you made the case there. But anonymity basically allows people to say anything  all the rules gone. You've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography. And I'm just curious whether you sometimes lie awake in the night worrying that you've opened Pandora's box. CP  Yes and no. I mean  for as much good that kind of comes out of this environment  there is plenty of bad. There are plenty of downsides. But I think that the greater good is being served here by just allowing people    there are very few places  now  where you can go and not have identity  to be completely anonymous and say whatever you'd like. And saying whatever you like  I think  is powerful. Doing whatever you like is now crossing a line. But I think it's important to have these places. When I get emails  people say   Thank you for giving me this place  this outlet  where I can come after work and be myself.  CA  But words  saying things  you know  can be constructive  it can be really damaging. And if you cut the link between what is said and any attribution back to you  I mean  surely there are huge risks with that. CP  There are  certainly. But    CA  Tell me about what    I mean  I think you asked the board what you might say at TED  right  CP  Yeah  I posted a thread on Sunday. And within    hours  it had over        responses. And the thing is  I didn't make it into that presentation because I can't read to you anything that they said  more or less.    percent of it is just  would have been  you know  bleeped out. But there were some good things that came out of that too. Love and peace were mentioned. CA  Love and peace were mentioned  kind of with quote marks around them  right  CP  Cats and dogs were mentioned too. CA  And that content is all off the board now. Right  it's gone  Or is it still up there  CP  I stuck that thread so it lasted a few days. It went up to about        posts  and now it has been taken off. CA  Okay  well. Now  I'm not sure I would have necessarily recommended everyone at TED to go and check it out anyway. Chris  you yourself  I mean  you're a figure of some intrigue. You've got this surprising semi underground influence  but it's not making you a lot of money  yet. What's the commercial picture here  CP  The commercial picture is that there really isn't much of one  I guess. The site has adult content on it. I mean  obviously  it's got some very offensive  obscene content on it  just in terms of language alone. And when you've got that  you've pretty much sacrificed any hope of making lots of money. CA  But you still live at home  right  CP  I actually moved out recently. CA  That's very cool. CP  I got out of Mom's  and I'm back in school right now. CA  But what conversations did you or do you have with your mother about  chan  CP  At first  very kind of pained  awkward conversations. The content is not dinner table conversation in the least. But my parents    I think part of why they kind of are able to appreciate it is because they don't understand it. CA  And they were probably pleased to see you on top of the Time poll. CP  Yeah. They still didn't know what to think of that though. CA  And so  in    years' time  what do you picture yourself doing  CP  That's a good question. As I said  I just went back to school  and I am considering majoring in urban studies and then going on to urban planning  kind of taking whatever I've learned from online communities and trying to adapt that to a physical community. CA  Chris  thank you. Absolutely fascinating. Thank you for coming to TED.,,201006,6.087201946472019
93,1434,1436,Christopher C. Deam 2009,Christopher C. Deam,male,"The Airstream, restyled",Apr 2009,298,I was asked by Wilsonart International  a plastic laminate company  which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world    they asked me to design a trade show booth for exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York  in     . So looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design  interiors and furniture  we came up with the solution of taking an old Airstream trailer and gutting it  and trying to portray laminate  and a trailer  in kind of a fresh  new contemporary look. When this trailer showed up at my shop in Berkeley  I'd actually never stepped foot in an Airstream trailer  or any other trailer. So I can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if I can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion. I decided I had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of Airstream. What I discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces. In that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight  modern  futuristic  high tech pod for hurtling down the freeway  and the interiors were completely out of sync with that. In fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin. That seemed really like a crisis to me  that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape  and about travel  and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell. We really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an Airstream trailer  and what feels like it has true purpose and utility. We stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell. We took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing. I literally drew on the walls of the trailer  mocked it up in cardboard  we'd come in and cut  decide things were wrong  pull it out  put it back in. The main goal was to smooth out the interior  and begin to speak about motion  and mobility  and independence. The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer. There's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together  where you can change materials and shapes. So that became a challenge. Compounding that  the material of choice  laminate  that I was trying to highlight  only bends in two dimensions. It's a compound curve interior. What I had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell. What I came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell. And what I was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space  so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way  and that the casework wouldn't break up the space. They also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin  so they function as an electrical chase. That's the trailer  pretty much finished. That trailer led to another commission  to participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block. Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo  in October. Teruo Kurosaki  who owns a furniture company called Idee  he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo. He said one he would like to make a real trailer  functioning  and we would sell that one. Trailer number two  you have a blank slate  you can to anything you want. We came up with a fantasy scenario of a DJ traveling around the States  that would collect records and go on tours. This trailer housed two turntables  mixer  wet bar  fridge  integrated sound system. It's got a huge couch  fits quite a few people  and basically we'd had a great time with this. And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel  and escape  in an idiosyncratic sense. A lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for Airstream. This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream. They came to me and said   Well  what can we do to freshen this thing up  And do you think kids  you know  skateboarders  surfers  rock climbers  would use these things   And I said   Well  not in that interior.  Anyway  I went out to Airstream about six times during the process of building this prototype  and it's called the Bambi prototype. I thought   Finally  oh yeah great  big company  I'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding.  And I walked in their prototype facility  and it's exactly like my shop  only bigger    same tools  same things. So the problem became    and they set this dilemma to me    that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology  and there's no money for tooling or molding. The trailers themselves are actually hand built. All the casework is hand scribed in  uniquely  so you can't just cut     parts for     trailers  you have to cut them big  and every single one is hand fit. They didn't want to go to a componentized system. And there it is  that's the Bambi   .,Designer,200904,6.07449438202247
95,1030,1032,Christopher Soghoian 2015,Christopher Soghoian,male,How to avoid surveillance ... with the phone in your pocket,Aug 2015,369,For more than     years  the telephone companies have provided wiretapping assistance to governments. For much of this time  this assistance was manual. Surveillance took place manually and wires were connected by hand. Calls were recorded to tape. But as in so many other industries  computing has changed everything. The telephone companies built surveillance features into the very core of their networks. I want that to sink in for a second  Our telephones and the networks that carry our calls were wired for surveillance first. First and foremost. So what that means is that when you're talking to your spouse  your children  a colleague or your doctor on the telephone  someone could be listening. Now  that someone might be your own government  it could also be another government  a foreign intelligence service  or a hacker  or a criminal  or a stalker or any other party that breaks into the surveillance system  that hacks into the surveillance system of the telephone companies. But while the telephone companies have built surveillance as a priority  Silicon Valley companies have not. And increasingly  over the last couple years  Silicon Valley companies have built strong encryption technology into their communications products that makes surveillance extremely difficult. For example  many of you might have an iPhone  and if you use an iPhone to send a text message to other people who have an iPhone  those text messages cannot easily be wiretapped. And in fact  according to Apple  they're not able to even see the text messages themselves. Likewise  if you use FaceTime to make an audio call or a video call with one of your friends or loved ones  that  too  cannot be easily wiretapped. And it's not just Apple. WhatsApp  which is now owned by Facebook and used by hundreds of millions of people around the world  also has built strong encryption technology into its product  which means that people in the Global South can easily communicate without their governments  often authoritarian  wiretapping their text messages. So  after     years of being able to listen to any telephone call    anytime  anywhere    you might imagine that government officials are not very happy. And in fact  that's what's happening. Government officials are extremely mad. And they're not mad because these encryption tools are now available. What upsets them the most is that the tech companies have built encryption features into their products and turned them on by default. It's the default piece that matters. In short  the tech companies have democratized encryption. And so  government officials like British Prime Minister David Cameron  they believe that all communications    emails  texts  voice calls    all of these should be available to governments  and encryption is making that difficult. Now  look    I'm extremely sympathetic to their point of view. We live in a dangerous time in a dangerous world  and there really are bad people out there. There are terrorists and other serious national security threats that I suspect we all want the FBI and the NSA to monitor. But those surveillance features come at a cost. The reason for that is that there is no such thing as a terrorist laptop  or a drug dealer's cell phone. We all use the same communications devices. What that means is that if the drug dealers' telephone calls or the terrorists' telephone calls can be intercepted  then so can the rest of ours  too. And I think we really need to ask  Should a billion people around the world be using devices that are wiretap friendly  So the scenario of hacking of surveillance systems that I've described    this is not imaginary. In       the surveillance systems that Google and Microsoft built into their networks    the systems that they use to respond to lawful surveillance requests from the police    those systems were compromised by the Chinese government  because the Chinese government wanted to figure out which of their own agents the US government was monitoring. By the same token  in       the surveillance system built into the network of Vodafone Greece    Greece's largest telephone company    was compromised by an unknown entity  and that feature  the surveillance feature  was used to wiretap the Greek Prime Minister and members of the Greek cabinet. The foreign government or hackers who did that were never caught. And really  this gets to the very problem with these surveillance features  or backdoors. When you build a backdoor into a communications network or piece of technology  you have no way of controlling who's going to go through it. You have no way of controlling whether it'll be used by your side or the other side  by good guys  or by bad guys. And so for that reason  I think that it's better to build networks to be as secure as possible. Yes  this means that in the future  encryption is going to make wiretapping more difficult. It means that the police are going to have a tougher time catching bad guys. But the alternative would mean to live in a world where anyone's calls or anyone's text messages could be surveilled by criminals  by stalkers and by foreign intelligence agencies. And I don't want to live in that kind of world. And so right now  you probably have the tools to thwart many kinds of government surveillance already on your phones and already in your pockets  you just might not realize how strong and how secure those tools are  or how weak the other ways you've used to communicate really are. And so  my message to you is this  We need to use these tools. We need to secure our telephone calls. We need to secure our text messages. I want you to use these tools. I want you to tell your loved ones  I want you to tell your colleagues  Use these encrypted communications tools. Don't just use them because they're cheap and easy  but use them because they're secure. Thank you.,Privacy researcher + activist,201508,5.874739583333337
96,60,62,Clay Shirky 2012,Clay Shirky,male,Why SOPA is a bad idea,Jan 2012,823,I'm going to start here. This is a hand lettered sign that appeared in a mom and pop bakery in my old neighborhood in Brooklyn a few years ago. The store owned one of those machines that can print on plates of sugar. And kids could bring in drawings and have the store print a sugar plate for the top of their birthday cake. But unfortunately  one of the things kids liked to draw was cartoon characters. They liked to draw the Little Mermaid  they'd like to draw a smurf  they'd like to draw Micky Mouse. But it turns out to be illegal to print a child's drawing of Micky Mouse onto a plate of sugar. And it's a copyright violation. And policing copyright violations for children's birthday cakes was such a hassle that the College Bakery said   You know what  we're getting out of that business. If you're an amateur  you don't have access to our machine anymore. If you want a printed sugar birthday cake  you have to use one of our prefab images    only for professionals.  So there's two bills in Congress right now. One is called SOPA  the other is called PIPA. SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act. It's from the Senate. PIPA is short for PROTECTIP  which is itself short for Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property    because the congressional aides who name these things have a lot of time on their hands. And what SOPA and PIPA want to do is they want to do this. They want to raise the cost of copyright compliance to the point where people simply get out of the business of offering it as a capability to amateurs. Now the way they propose to do this is to identify sites that are substantially infringing on copyright    although how those sites are identified is never fully specified in the bills    and then they want to remove them from the domain name system. They want to take them out of the domain name system. Now the domain name system is the thing that turns human readable names  like Google.com  into the kinds of addresses machines expect      .   .   .   . Now the problem with this model of censorship  of identifying a site and then trying to remove it from the domain name system  is that it won't work. And you'd think that would be a pretty big problem for a law  but Congress seems not to have let that bother them too much. Now the reason it won't work is that you can still type   .   .   .    into the browser or you can make it a clickable link and you'll still go to Google. So the policing layer around the problem becomes the real threat of the act. Now to understand how Congress came to write a bill that won't accomplish its stated goals  but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects  you have to understand a little bit about the back story. And the back story is this  SOPA and PIPA  as legislation  were drafted largely by media companies that were founded in the   th century. The   th century was a great time to be a media company  because the thing you really had on your side was scarcity. If you were making a TV show  it didn't have to be better than all other TV shows ever made  it only had to be better than the two other shows that were on at the same time    which is a very low threshold of competitive difficulty. Which meant that if you fielded average content  you got a third of the U.S. public for free    tens of millions of users for simply doing something that wasn't too terrible. This is like having a license to print money and a barrel of free ink. But technology moved on  as technology is wont to do. And slowly  slowly  at the end of the   th century  that scarcity started to get eroded    and I don't mean by digital technology  I mean by analog technology. Cassette tapes  video cassette recorders  even the humble Xerox machine created new opportunities for us to behave in ways that astonished the media business. Because it turned out we're not really couch potatoes. We don't really like to only consume. We do like to consume  but every time one of these new tools came along  it turned out we also like to produce and we like to share. And this freaked the media businesses out    it freaked them out every time. Jack Valenti  who was the head lobbyist for the Motion Picture Association of America  once likened the ferocious video cassette recorder to Jack the Ripper and poor  helpless Hollywood to a woman at home alone. That was the level of rhetoric. And so the media industries begged  insisted  demanded that Congress do something. And Congress did something. By the early   s  Congress passed the law that changed everything. And that law was called the Audio Home Recording Act of     . What the Audio Home Recording Act of      said was  look  if people are taping stuff off the radio and then making mixtapes for their friends  that is not a crime. That's okay. Taping and remixing and sharing with your friends is okay. If you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them  that's not okay. But this taping business  fine  let it go. And they thought that they clarified the issue  because they'd set out a clear distinction between legal and illegal copying. But that wasn't what the media businesses wanted. They had wanted Congress to outlaw copying full stop. So when the Audio Home Recording Act of      was passed  the media businesses gave up on the idea of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying because it was clear that if Congress was acting in their framework  they might actually increase the rights of citizens to participate in our own media environment. So they went for plan B. It took them a while to formulate plan B. Plan B appeared in its first full blown form in         something called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. It was a complicated piece of legislation  a lot of moving parts. But the main thrust of the DMCA was that it was legal to sell you uncopyable digital material    except that there's no such things as uncopyable digital material. It would be  as Ed Felton once famously said   Like handing out water that wasn't wet.  Bits are copyable. That's what computers do. That is a side effect of their ordinary operation. So in order to fake the ability to sell uncopyable bits  the DMCA also made it legal to force you to use systems that broke the copying function of your devices. Every DVD player and game player and television and computer you brought home    no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it    could be broken by the content industries  if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content. And to make sure you didn't realize  or didn't enact their capabilities as general purpose computing devices  they also made it illegal for you to try to reset the copyability of that content. The DMCA marks the moment when the media industries gave up on the legal system of distinguishing between legal and illegal copying and simply tried to prevent copying through technical means. Now the DMCA had  and is continuing to have  a lot of complicated effects  but in this one domain  limiting sharing  it has mostly not worked. And the main reason it hasn't worked is the Internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerful than anyone imagined. The mixtape  the fanzine  that was nothing compared to what we're seeing now with the Internet. We are in a world where most American citizens over the age of    share things with each other online. We share written things  we share images  we share audio  we share video. Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've made. Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've found. Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've made out of what we've found  and all of it horrifies those industries. So PIPA and SOPA are round two. But where the DMCA was surgical    we want to go down into your computer  we want to go down into your television set  down into your game machine  and prevent it from doing what they said it would do at the store    PIPA and SOPA are nuclear and they're saying  we want to go anywhere in the world and censor content. Now the mechanism  as I said  for doing this  is you need to take out anybody pointing to those IP addresses. You need to take them out of search engines  you need to take them out of online directories  you need to take them out of user lists. And because the biggest producers of content on the Internet are not Google and Yahoo  they're us  we're the people getting policed. Because in the end  the real threat to the enactment of PIPA and SOPA is our ability to share things with one another. So what PIPA and SOPA risk doing is taking a centuries old legal concept  innocent until proven guilty  and reversing it    guilty until proven innocent. You can't share until you show us that you're not sharing something we don't like. Suddenly  the burden of proof for legal versus illegal falls affirmatively on us and on the services that might be offering us any new capabilities. And if it costs even a dime to police a user  that will crush a service with a hundred million users. So this is the Internet they have in mind. Imagine this sign everywhere    except imagine it doesn't say College Bakery  imagine it says YouTube and Facebook and Twitter. Imagine it says TED  because the comments can't be policed at any acceptable cost. The real effects of SOPA and PIPA are going to be different than the proposed effects. The threat  in fact  is this inversion of the burden of proof  where we suddenly are all treated like thieves at every moment we're given the freedom to create  to produce or to share. And the people who provide those capabilities to us    the YouTubes  the Facebooks  the Twitters and TEDs    are in the business of having to police us  or being on the hook for contributory infringement. There's two things you can do to help stop this    a simple thing and a complicated thing  an easy thing and a hard thing. The simple thing  the easy thing  is this  if you're an American citizen  call your representative  call your senator. When you look at the people who co signed on the SOPA bill  people who've co signed on PIPA  what you see is that they have cumulatively received millions and millions of dollars from the traditional media industries. You don't have millions and millions of dollars  but you can call your representatives  and you can remind them that you vote  and you can ask not to be treated like a thief  and you can suggest that you would prefer that the Internet not be broken. And if you're not an American citizen  you can contact American citizens that you know and encourage them to do the same. Because this seems like a national issue  but it is not. These industries will not be content with breaking our Internet. If they break it  they will break it for everybody. That's the easy thing. That's the simple thing. The hard thing is this  get ready  because more is coming. SOPA is simply a reversion of COICA  which was purposed last year  which did not pass. And all of this goes back to the failure of the DMCA to disallow sharing as a technical means. And the DMCA goes back to the Audio Home Recording Act  which horrified those industries. Because the whole business of actually suggesting that someone is breaking the law and then gathering evidence and proving that  that turns out to be really inconvenient.  We'd prefer not to do that   says the content industries. And what they want is not to have to do that. They don't want legal distinctions between legal and illegal sharing. They just want the sharing to go away. PIPA and SOPA are not oddities  they're not anomalies  they're not events. They're the next turn of this particular screw  which has been going on    years now. And if we defeat these  as I hope we do  more is coming. Because until we convince Congress that the way to deal with copyright violation is the way copyright violation was dealt with with Napster  with YouTube  which is to have a trial with all the presentation of evidence and the hashing out of facts and the assessment of remedies that goes on in democratic societies. That's the way to handle this. In the meantime  the hard thing to do is to be ready. Because that's the real message of PIPA and SOPA. Time Warner has called and they want us all back on the couch  just consuming    not producing  not sharing    and we should say   No.  Thank you.,Social Media Theorist,201201,5.859899396378268
100,1907,1909,Courtney Martin 2011,Courtney Martin,female,This isn't her mother's feminism,Mar 2011,674,So I was born on the last day of the last year of the '  s. I was raised on  Free to be you and me     hip hop    not as many woohoos for hip hop in the house. Thank you. Thank you for hip hop    and Anita Hill. My parents were radicals    who became  well  grown ups. My dad facetiously says   We wanted to save the world  and instead we just got rich.  We actually just got  middle class  in Colorado Springs  Colorado  but you get the picture. I was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy. At this ripe old age of     I've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up in this horrible  beautiful time  and I've decided  for me  it's been a real journey and paradox. The first paradox is that growing up is about rejecting the past and then promptly reclaiming it. Feminism was the water I grew up in. When I was just a little girl  my mom started what is now the longest running women's film festival in the world. So while other kids were watching sitcoms and cartoons  I was watching very esoteric documentaries made by and about women. You can see how this had an influence. But she was not the only feminist in the house. My dad actually resigned from the male only business club in my hometown because he said he would never be part of an organization that would one day welcome his son  but not his daughter. He's actually here today. The trick here is my brother would become an experimental poet  not a businessman  but the intention was really good. In any case  I didn't readily claim the feminist label  even though it was all around me  because I associated it with my mom's women's groups  her swishy skirts and her shoulder pads    none of which had much cachet in the hallways of Palmer High School where I was trying to be cool at the time. But I suspected there was something really important about this whole feminism thing  so I started covertly tiptoeing into my mom's bookshelves and picking books off and reading them    never  of course  admitting that I was doing so. I didn't actually claim the feminist label until I went to Barnard College and I heard Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner speak for the first time. They were the co authors of a book called  Manifesta.  So what very profound epiphany  you might ask  was responsible for my feminist click moment  Fishnet stockings. Jennifer Baumgardner was wearing them. I thought they were really hot. I decided  okay  I can claim the feminist label. Now I tell you this    I tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself  because I think part of the work of feminism is to admit that aesthetics  that beauty  that fun do matter. There are lots of very modern political movements that have caught fire in no small part because of cultural hipness. Anyone heard of these two guys as an example  So my feminism is very indebted to my mom's  but it looks very different. My mom says   patriarchy.  I say   intersectionality.  So race  class  gender  ability  all of these things go into our experiences of what it means to be a woman. Pay equity  Yes. Absolutely a feminist issue. But for me  so is immigration.  Applause  Thank you. My mom says   Protest march.  I say   Online organizing.  I co edit  along with a collective of other super smart  amazing women  a site called Feministing.com. We are the most widely read feminist publication ever  and I tell you this because I think it's really important to see that there's a continuum. Feminist blogging is basically the   st century version of consciousness raising. But we also have a straightforward political impact. Feministing has been able to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of Walmart. We got a misogynist administrator sending us hate mail fired from a Big Ten school. And one of our biggest successes is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of Iowa who say   I Googled Jessica Simpson and stumbled on your site. I realized feminism wasn't about man hating and Birkenstocks.  So we're able to pull in the next generation in a totally new way. My mom says   Gloria Steinem.  I say   Samhita Mukhopadhyay  Miriam Perez  Ann Friedman  Jessica Valenti  Vanessa Valenti  and on and on and on and on.  We don't want one hero. We don't want one icon. We don't want one face. We are thousands of women and men across this country doing online writing  community organizing  changing institutions from the inside out    all continuing the incredible work that our mothers and grandmothers started. Thank you. Which brings me to the second paradox  sobering up about our smallness and maintaining faith in our greatness all at once. Many in my generation    because of well intentioned parenting and self esteem education    were socialized to believe that we were special little snowflakes    who were going to go out and save the world. These are three words many of us were raised with. We walk across graduation stages  high on our overblown expectations  and when we float back down to earth  we realize we don't know what the heck it means to actually save the world anyway. The mainstream media often paints my generation as apathetic  and I think it's much more accurate to say we are deeply overwhelmed. And there's a lot to be overwhelmed about  to be fair    an environmental crisis  wealth disparity in this country unlike we've seen since       and globally  a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity. Xenophobia's on the rise. The trafficking of women and girls. It's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed. I experienced this firsthand myself when I graduated from Barnard College in     . I was fired up  I was ready to make a difference. I went out and I worked at a non profit  I went to grad school  I phone banked  I protested  I volunteered  and none of it seemed to matter. And on a particularly dark night of December of       I sat down with my family  and I said that I had become very disillusioned. I admitted that I'd actually had a fantasy    kind of a dark fantasy    of writing a letter about everything that was wrong with the world and then lighting myself on fire on the White House steps. My mom took a drink of her signature Sea Breeze  her eyes really welled with tears  and she looked right at me and she said   I will not stand for your desperation.  She said   You are smarter  more creative and more resilient than that.  Which brings me to my third paradox. Growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly and being fulfilled by failing really well. There's a writer I've been deeply influenced by  Parker Palmer  and he writes that many of us are often whiplashed  between arrogant overestimation of ourselves and a servile underestimation of ourselves.  You may have guessed by now  I did not light myself on fire. I did what I know to do in desperation  which is write. I wrote the book I needed to read. I wrote a book about eight incredible people all over this country doing social justice work. I wrote about Nia Martin Robinson  the daughter of Detroit and two civil rights activists  who's dedicating her life to environmental justice. I wrote about Emily Apt who initially became a caseworker in the welfare system because she decided that was the most noble thing she could do  but quickly learned  not only did she not like it  but she wasn't really good at it. Instead  what she really wanted to do was make films. So she made a film about the welfare system and had a huge impact. I wrote about Maricela Guzman  the daughter of Mexican immigrants  who joined the military so she could afford college. She was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp and went on to co organize a group called the Service Women's Action Network. What I learned from these people and others was that I couldn't judge them based on their failure to meet their very lofty goals. Many of them are working in deeply intractable systems    the military  congress  the education system  etc. But what they managed to do within those systems was be a humanizing force. And at the end of the day  what could possibly be more important than that  Cornel West says   Of course it's a failure. But how good a failure is it   This isn't to say we give up our wildest  biggest dreams. It's to say we operate on two levels. On one  we really go after changing these broken systems of which we find ourselves a part. But on the other  we root our self esteem in the daily acts of trying to make one person's day more kind  more just  etc. So when I was a little girl  I had a couple of very strange habits. One of them was I used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home  and I would suck the thumb of my left hand and hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand. I was listening to her talk on the phone  which she did a lot. She was talking about board meetings  she was founding peace organizations  she was coordinating carpools  she was consoling friends    all these daily acts of care and creativity. And surely  at three and four years old  I was listening to the soothing sound of her voice  but I think I was also getting my first lesson in activist work. The activists I interviewed had nothing in common  literally  except for one thing  which was that they all cited their mothers as their most looming and important activist influences. So often  particularly at a young age  we look far afield for our models of the meaningful life  and sometimes they're in our own kitchens  talking on the phone  making us dinner  doing all that keeps the world going around and around. My mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory  or certainty  or security even. It's about embracing the paradox. It's about acting in the face of overwhelm. And it's about loving people really well. And at the end of the day  these things make for a lifetime of challenge and reward. Thank you.,,201103,6.15650319829424
101,1703,1705,Craig Venter 2007,Craig Venter,male,Sampling the ocean's DNA,Apr 2007,959,At the break  I was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate. And this will be my only comment on it. And that is  I understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists. What I'm going to tell you about in my    minutes is how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves. It's only    years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free living organism  that of haemophilus influenzae. That took a genome project from    years down to four months. We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours. So in the last decade  a large number of genomes have been added  most human pathogens  a couple of plants  several insects and several mammals  including the human genome. Genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over    years ago was  by the end of this year  we might have between three and five genomes sequenced  it's on the order of several hundred. We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence     genomes this year  as a side project from environmental organisms. So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed. But as we look  what's out there  we've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet. Most people don't realize it  because they're invisible  but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass  whereas all animals only make up about one one thousandth of all the biomass. And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often  but if you ever make it to the sea  and you swallow a mouthful of seawater  keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of    million viruses. Less than       microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago  and so we decided to do something about it. And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition  where we were  as with great oceanographic expeditions  trying to sample the ocean every     miles. We started in Bermuda for our test project  then moved up to Halifax  working down the U.S. East Coast  the Caribbean Sea  the Panama Canal  through to the Galapagos  then across the Pacific  and we're in the process now of working our way across the Indian Ocean. It's very tough duty  we're doing this on a sailing vessel  in part to help excite young people about going into science. The experiments are incredibly simple. We just take seawater and we filter it  and we collect different size organisms on different filters  and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville  where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every    hours. And with doing this  we've made some amazing discoveries. For example  it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes    there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments. It turns out  almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors  and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication. From one site  from one barrel of seawater  we discovered  .  million new genes and as many as        new species. We've extended this to the air now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation. We're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day  particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums. We filter through some simple apparatuses  we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in New York City. And we're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time. Just on the data collection side  just where we are through the Galapagos  we're finding that almost every     miles  we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean. Some of these make logical sense  in terms of different temperature gradients. So this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures    red being warm  blue being cold    and we found there's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples  in terms of abundant species. The other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light  and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence. And these vary tremendously from region to region. Maybe not surprisingly  in the deep ocean  where it's mostly blue  the photoreceptors tend to see blue light. When there's a lot of chlorophyll around  they see a lot of green light. But they vary even more  possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes. Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was  we assembled all the data    including all of ours thus far from the expedition  which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet    and it totaled around    million genes. And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are  Are we just discovering new members of known families  or are we discovering new families  And it turns out we have about        major gene families  but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families. So we're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes  components and life on this planet. When we look at the so called evolutionary tree  we're up on the upper right hand corner with the animals. Of those roughly    million genes  we only have around        in our genome. And if you take all animals together  we probably share less than        and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families. I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution. And we think in a gene centric view    maybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas    than in a genome centric view  which are different constructs of these gene components. Synthetic DNA  the ability to synthesize DNA  has changed at sort of the same pace that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two  and is getting very rapid and very cheap. Our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in       and that from mycoplasma genitalium. And we have really nice T shirts that say  you know   I heart my genitalium.  This is actually just a microorganism. But it has roughly     genes. Haemophilus had       genes. And we simply asked the question  if one species needs      another      is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system  So we started doing transposon mutagenesis. Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code. And if they insert in the middle of the gene  they disrupt its function. So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those  non essential genes.  But it turns out the environment is very critical for this  and you can only define an essential or non essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment. We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of    related organisms  and we tried to compare all of those  to see what they had in common. And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only     genes common to all    organisms. The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite  it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around     or so. So we think that we can expand or contract genomes  depending on your point of view here  to maybe     to     genes from the minimal of    . The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them  and we had to do this in a cassette based fashion. We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult. Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison  my colleagues on this  developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a       base pair virus in only a two week period that was     percent accurate  in terms of its sequence and its biology. It was a quite exciting experiment    when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA  injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden  that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria. This was not the first synthetic virus    a polio virus had been made a year before    but it was only one ten thousandth as active and it took three years to do. This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X    . This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware  and that's the notions that we have with biology. People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare  and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee  and a special committee the U.S. government has set up to review this area. And I think it's important to keep reality in mind  versus what happens with people's imaginations. Basically  any virus that's been sequenced today    that genome can be made. And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox  but the DNA from this organism is not infective. So even if somebody made the smallpox genome  that DNA itself would not cause infections. The real concern that security departments have is designer viruses. And there's only two countries  the U.S. and the former Soviet Union  that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents. If that research is truly discontinued  there should be very little activity on the know how to make designer viruses in the future. I think single cell organisms are possible within two years. And possibly eukaryotic cells  those that we have  are possible within a decade. So we're now making several dozen different constructs  because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome. The key is  how do you put all of the others  We start with these fragments  and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome. This is derived from an organism  deinococcus radiodurans  that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed. It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about    to    hours  after its chromosomes are literally blown apart. This organism is ubiquitous on the planet  and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there. This is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation. The glass started to burn and crack  while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier. Here's an actual picture of what happens  the top of this shows the genome after  .  million rads of radiation. The chromosome is literally blown apart. And here's that same DNA automatically reassembled    hours later. It's truly stunning that these organisms can do that  and we probably have thousands  if not tens of thousands  of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that. After these genomes are synthesized  the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome. So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential  not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues. For example  from the third organism we sequenced  Methanococcus jannaschii    it lives in boiling water temperatures  its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from CO  it captures back from the environment. So we know lots of different pathways  thousands of different organisms now that live off of CO   and can capture that back. So instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes  we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere  converting that into biopolymers or other products. We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide  and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Also  there's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane. And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products. Within a short while  I think there's going to be a new field called  Combinatorial Genomics   because with these new synthesis capabilities  these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination  we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day. And therefore  as with all biology  you get selection through screening  whether you're screening for hydrogen production  or chemical production  or just viability. To understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach. We're trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight. Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen  and we have an oxygen insensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process. We're also combining cellulases  the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol. Pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes. The chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce. I think future engineered species could be the source of food  hopefully a source of energy  environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry. Let me just close with ethical and policy studies. We delayed the start of our experiments in      until we completed a year and a half bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species. Every major religion participated in this. It was actually a very strange study  because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books  and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life  so it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this  but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them. Right now the Sloan Foundation has just funded a multi institutional study on this  to work out what the risk and benefits to society are  and the rules that scientific teams such as my own should be using in this area  and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward. These are complex issues. Except for the threat of bio terrorism  they're very simple issues in terms of  can we design things to produce clean energy  perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes.

102,1706,1708,Craig Venter 2010,Craig Venter,male,"Watch me unveil ""synthetic life""",May 2010,1084,We're here today to announce the first synthetic cell  a cell made by starting with the digital code in the computer  building the chromosome from four bottles of chemicals  assembling that chromosome in yeast  transplanting it into a recipient bacterial cell and transforming that cell into a new bacterial species. So this is the first self replicating species that we've had on the planet whose parent is a computer. It also is the first species to have its own website encoded in its genetic code. But we'll talk more about the watermarks in a minute. This is a project that had its inception    years ago when our team then    we called the institute TIGR    was involved in sequencing the first two genomes in history. We did Haemophilus influenzae and then the smallest genome of a self replicating organism  that of Mycoplasma genitalium. And as soon as we had these two sequences we thought  if this is supposed to be the smallest genome of a self replicating species  could there be even a smaller genome  Could we understand the basis of cellular life at the genetic level  It's been a    year quest just to get to the starting point now to be able to answer those questions  because it's very difficult to eliminate multiple genes from a cell. You can only do them one at a time. We decided early on that we had to take a synthetic route  even though nobody had been there before  to see if we could synthesize a bacterial chromosome so we could actually vary the gene content to understand the essential genes for life. That started our    year quest to get here. But before we did the first experiments  we actually asked Art Caplan's team at the University of Pennsylvania to undertake a review of what the risks  the challenges  the ethics around creating new species in the laboratory were because it hadn't been done before. They spent about two years reviewing that independently and published their results in Science in     . Ham and I took two years off as a side project to sequence the human genome  but as soon as that was done we got back to the task at hand. In       we started a new institute  the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives  where we set out two goals  One  to understand the impact of our technology on the environment  and how to understand the environment better  and two  to start down this process of making synthetic life to understand basic life. In       we published our first success. So Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison developed some new methods for making error free DNA at a small level. Our first task was a       letter code bacteriophage  a virus that attacks only E. coli. So that was the phage phi X      which was chosen for historical reasons. It was the first DNA phage  DNA virus  DNA genome that was actually sequenced. So once we realized that we could make       base pair viral sized pieces  we thought  we at least have the means then to try and make serially lots of these pieces to be able to eventually assemble them together to make this mega base chromosome. So  substantially larger than we even thought we would go initially. There were several steps to this. There were two sides  We had to solve the chemistry for making large DNA molecules  and we had to solve the biological side of how  if we had this new chemical entity  how would we boot it up  activate it in a recipient cell. We had two teams working in parallel  one team on the chemistry  and the other on trying to be able to transplant entire chromosomes to get new cells. When we started this out  we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem  which is why we chose the smallest genome. And some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome to a much larger one. And we can walk through the reasons for that  but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from  whereas the larger  faster growing cell takes only two days. So there's only so many cycles we could go through in a year at six weeks per cycle. And you should know that basically     probably    percent plus of our experiments failed. So this was a debugging  problem solving scenario from the beginning because there was no recipe of how to get there. So  one of the most important publications we had was in     . Carole Lartigue led the effort to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome from one bacteria to another. I think philosophically  that was one of the most important papers that we've ever done because it showed how dynamic life was. And we knew  once that worked  that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those. We didn't know that it was going to take us several years more to get there. In       we reported the complete synthesis of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome  a little over         letters of genetic code  but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome. We think in part  because of its slow growth and  in part  cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms to keep these events from happening. It turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into had a nuclease  an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface  and was happy to eat the synthetic DNA that we gave it and never got transplantations. But at the time  that was the largest molecule of a defined structure that had been made. And so both sides were progressing  but part of the synthesis had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished using yeast  putting the fragments in yeast and yeast would assemble these for us. It's an amazing step forward  but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast. So in addition to doing the transplant  we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome out of the eukaryotic yeast into a form where we could transplant it into a recipient cell. So our team developed new techniques for actually growing  cloning entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast. So we took the same mycoides genome that Carole had initially transplanted  and we grew that in yeast as an artificial chromosome. And we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them. When we did these experiments  though  we could get the chromosome out of yeast but it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell. That little issue took the team two years to solve. It turns out  the DNA in the bacterial cell was actually methylated  and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme  from digesting the DNA. So what we found is if we took the chromosome out of yeast and methylated it  we could then transplant it. Further advances came when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes from the recipient capricolum cell. And once we had done that  now we can take naked DNA out of yeast and transplant it. So last fall when we published the results of that work in Science  we all became overconfident and were sure we were only a few weeks away from being able to now boot up a chromosome out of yeast. Because of the problems with Mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth about a year and a half ago  we decided to synthesize the much larger chromosome  the mycoides chromosome  knowing that we had the biology worked out on that for transplantation. And Dan led the team for the synthesis of this over one million base pair chromosome. But it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end  and it set us back three months because we had one error out of over a million base pairs in that sequence. So the team developed new debugging software  where we could test each synthetic fragment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type DNA. And we found that    out of the            base pair pieces we synthesized were completely accurate and compatible with a life forming sequence. We narrowed it down to one fragment  we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene. So accuracy is essential. There's parts of the genome where it cannot tolerate even a single error  and then there's parts of the genome where we can put in large blocks of DNA  as we did with the watermarks  and it can tolerate all kinds of errors. So it took about three months to find that error and repair it. And then early one morning  at   a.m. we got a text from Dan saying that  now  the first blue colonies existed. So  it's been a long route to get here     years from the beginning. We felt one of the tenets of this field was to make absolutely certain we could distinguish synthetic DNA from natural DNA. Early on  when you're working in a new area of science  you have to think about all the pitfalls and things that could lead you to believe that you had done something when you hadn't  and  even worse  leading others to believe it. So  we thought the worst problem would be a single molecule contamination of the native chromosome  leading us to believe that we actually had created a synthetic cell  when it would have been just a contaminant. So early on  we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the DNA to absolutely make clear that the DNA was synthetic. And the first chromosome we built in         the         base pair one    we simply assigned the names of the authors of the chromosome into the genetic code  but it was using just amino acid single letter translations  which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet. So the team actually developed a new code within the code within the code. So it's a new code for interpreting and writing messages in DNA. Now  mathematicians have been hiding and writing messages in the genetic code for a long time  but it's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists because  if you write long messages with the code that the mathematicians developed  it would more than likely lead to new proteins being synthesized with unknown functions. So the code that Mike Montague and the team developed actually puts frequent stop codons  so it's a different alphabet but allows us to use the entire English alphabet with punctuation and numbers. So  there are four major watermarks all over       base pairs of genetic code. The first one actually contains within it this code for interpreting the rest of the genetic code. So in the remaining information  in the watermarks  contain the names of  I think it's    different authors and key contributors to getting the project to this stage. And we also built in a website address so that if somebody decodes the code within the code within the code  they can send an email to that address. So it's clearly distinguishable from any other species  having    names in it  its own web address. And we added three quotations  because with the first genome we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound than just signing the work. So we won't give the rest of the code  but we will give the three quotations. The first is   To live  to err  to fall  to triumph and to recreate life out of life.  It's a James Joyce quote. The second quotation is   See things not as they are  but as they might be.  It's a quote from the  American Prometheus  book on Robert Oppenheimer. And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote   What I cannot build  I cannot understand.  So  because this is as much a philosophical advance as a technical advance in science  we tried to deal with both the philosophical and the technical side. The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions is that the extensive work that we've done    asking for ethical review  pushing the envelope on that side as well as the technical side    this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community  in the policy community and at the highest levels of the federal government. Even with this announcement  as we did in         that work was funded by the Department of Energy  so the work was reviewed at the level of the White House  trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it. And they came down on the side of open publication  which is the right approach    we've briefed the White House  we've briefed members of Congress  we've tried to take and push the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advances. So with that  I would like to open it first to the floor for questions. Yes  in the back. Reporter  Could you explain  in layman's terms  how significant a breakthrough this is please  Craig Venter  Can we explain how significant this is  I'm not sure we're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is. It's significant to us. Perhaps it's a giant philosophical change in how we view life. We actually view it as a baby step in terms of  it's taken us    years to be able to do the experiment we wanted to do    years ago on understanding life at its basic level. But we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we're already starting in numerous avenues to use this tool. We have  at the Institute  ongoing funding now from NIH in a program with Novartis to try and use these new synthetic DNA tools to perhaps make the flu vaccine that you might get next year. Because instead of taking weeks to months to make these  Dan's team can now make these in less than    hours. So when you see how long it took to get an H N  vaccine out  we think we can shorten that process quite substantially. In the vaccine area  Synthetic Genomics and the Institute are forming a new vaccine company because we think these tools can affect vaccines to diseases that haven't been possible to date  things where the viruses rapidly evolve  such with rhinovirus. Wouldn't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds  Or  more importantly  HIV  where the virus evolves so quickly the vaccines that are made today can't keep up with those evolutionary changes. Also  at Synthetic Genomics  we've been working on major environmental issues. I think this latest oil spill in the Gulf is a reminder. We can't see CO     we depend on scientific measurements for it and we see the beginning results of having too much of it    but we can see pre CO  now floating on the waters and contaminating the beaches in the Gulf. We need some alternatives for oil. We have a program with Exxon Mobile to try and develop new strains of algae that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources  make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries to make normal gasoline and diesel fuel out of CO . Those are just a couple of the approaches and directions that we're taking.,"Biologist, genetics pioneer",201005,6.093161904761901
104,1418,1420,Dan Dennett 2009,Dan Dennett,male,"Cute, sexy, sweet, funny",Mar 2009,444,I m going around the world giving talks about Darwin  and usually what I m talking about is Darwin s strange inversion of reasoning. Now that title  that phrase  comes from a critic  an early critic  and this is a passage that I just love  and would like to read for you.  In the theory with which we have to deal  Absolute Ignorance is the artificer  so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system  that  in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine  it is not requisite to know how to make it. This proposition will be found on careful examination to express  in condensed form  the essential purport of the Theory  and to express in a few words all Mr. Darwin s meaning  who  by a strange inversion of reasoning  seems to think Absolute Ignorance fully qualified to take the place of Absolute Wisdom in the achievements of creative skill.  Exactly. Exactly. And it is a strange inversion. A creationist pamphlet has this wonderful page in it   Test Two  Do you know of any building that didn t have a builder  Yes No. Do you know of any painting that didn t have a painter  Yes No. Do you know of any car that didn t have a maker  Yes No. If you answered 'Yes' for any of the above  give details.  A ha  I mean  it really is a strange inversion of reasoning. You would have thought it stands to reason that design requires an intelligent designer. But Darwin shows that it s just false. Today  though  I m going to talk about Darwin s other strange inversion  which is equally puzzling at first  but in some ways just as important. It stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet. Guys go for girls like this because they are sexy. We adore babies because they re so cute. And  of course  we are amused by jokes because they are funny. This is all backwards. It is. And Darwin shows us why. Let s start with sweet. Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector  because sugar is high energy  and it s just been wired up to the preferer  to put it very crudely  and that s why we like sugar. Honey is sweet because we like it  not  we like it because honey is sweet.  There s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey. If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind  you wouldn t see why they tasted sweet. You have to look in our brains to understand why they re sweet. So if you think first there was sweetness  and then we evolved to like sweetness  you ve got it backwards  that s just wrong. It s the other way round. Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved. And there s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies. And it s a good thing that there isn t  because if there were  then Mother Nature would have a problem  How on earth do you get chimps to mate  Now you might think  ah  there s a solution  hallucinations. That would be one way of doing it  but there s a quicker way. Just wire the chimps up to love that look  and apparently they do. That s all there is to it. Over six million years  we and the chimps evolved our different ways. We became bald bodied  oddly enough  for one reason or another  they didn t. If we hadn t  then probably this would be the height of sexiness. Our sweet tooth is an evolved and instinctual preference for high energy food. It wasn t designed for chocolate cake. Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus. The term is owed to Niko Tinbergen  who did his famous experiments with gulls  where he found that that orange spot on the gull s beak    if he made a bigger  oranger spot the gull chicks would peck at it even harder. It was a hyperstimulus for them  and they loved it. What we see with  say  chocolate cake is it s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring. And there are lots of supernormal stimuli  chocolate cake is one. There's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness. And there's even supernormal stimuli for cuteness. Here s a pretty good example. It s important that we love babies  and that we not be put off by  say  messy diapers. So babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing  and they do. And  by the way  a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby. So nature works on many levels here. But now  if babies didn t look the way they do    if babies looked like this  that s what we would find adorable  that s what we would find    we would think  oh my goodness  do I ever want to hug that. This is the strange inversion. Well now  finally what about funny. My answer is  it s the same story  the same story. This is the hard one  the one that isn t obvious. That s why I leave it to the end. And I won t be able to say too much about it. But you have to think evolutionarily  you have to think  what hard job that has to be done    it s dirty work  somebody s got to do it    is so important to give us such a powerful  inbuilt reward for it when we succeed. Now  I think we've found the answer    I and a few of my colleagues. It s a neural system that s wired up to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job. Our bumper sticker for this view is that this is the joy of debugging. Now I m not going to have time to spell it all out  but I ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward. And what we re doing is we re using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe by switching humor on and off  by turning the knob on a joke    now it s not funny ... oh  now it s funnier ... now we ll turn a little bit more ... now it s not funny    in this way  we can actually learn something about the architecture of the brain  the functional architecture of the brain. Matthew Hurley is the first author of this. We call it the Hurley Model. He s a computer scientist  Reginald Adams a psychologist  and there I am  and we re putting this together into a book.

105,1932,1934,Dan Dennett 2007,Dan Dennett,male,The illusion of consciousness,Apr 2007,1298,So I'm going to speak about a problem that I have and that's that I'm a philosopher. When I go to a party and people ask me what do I do and I say   I'm a professor   their eyes glaze over. When I go to an academic cocktail party and there are all the professors around  they ask me what field I'm in and I say   philosophy     their eyes glaze over. When I go to a philosopher's party and they ask me what I work on and I say   consciousness   their eyes don't glaze over    their lips curl into a snarl. And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think   That's impossible  You can't explain consciousness.  The very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question. My late  lamented friend Bob Nozick  a fine philosopher  in one of his books   Philosophical Explanations   is commenting on the ethos of philosophy    the way philosophers go about their business. And he says  you know   Philosophers love rational argument.  And he says   It seems as if the ideal argument for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion  and if they don't accept the conclusion  they die. Their heads explode.  The idea is to have an argument that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents. But in fact that doesn't change people's minds at all. It's very hard to change people's minds about something like consciousness  and I finally figured out the reason for that. The reason for that is that everybody's an expert on consciousness. We heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games. They all have an idea for a video game  even if they're not experts. But they don't consider themselves experts on video games  they've just got strong opinions. I'm sure that people here who work on  say  climate change and global warming  or on the future of the Internet  encounter people who have very strong opinions about what's going to happen next. But they probably don't think of these opinions as expertise. They're just strongly held opinions. But with regard to consciousness  people seem to think  each of us seems to think   I am an expert. Simply by being conscious  I know all about this.  And so  you tell them your theory and they say   No  no  that's not the way consciousness is  No  you've got it all wrong.  And they say this with an amazing confidence. And so what I'm going to try to do today is to shake your confidence. Because I know the feeling    I can feel it myself. I want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds    that you are  yourselves  authoritative about your own consciousness. That's the order of the day here. Now  this nice picture shows a thought balloon  a thought bubble. I think everybody understands what that means. That's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness. This is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done. It's a Saul Steinberg of course    it was a New Yorker cover. And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque. That reminds him of the word baroque  barrack  bark  poodle  Suzanne R.    he's off to the races. There's a wonderful stream of consciousness here and if you follow it along  you learn a lot about this man. What I particularly like about this picture  too  is that Steinberg has rendered the guy in this sort of pointillist style. Which reminds us  as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday  what we are  what each of us is    what you are  what I am    is approximately     trillion little cellular robots. That's what we're made of. No other ingredients at all. We're just made of cells  about     trillion of them. Not a single one of those cells is conscious  not a single one of those cells knows who you are  or cares. Somehow  we have to explain how when you put together teams  armies  battalions of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells    not so different really from a bacterium  each one of them    the result is this. I mean  just look at it. The content    there's color  there's ideas  there's memories  there's history. And somehow all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons. How is that possible  Many people just think it isn't possible at all. They think   No  there can't be any sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness.  This is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel  who's a professor of religion  actually  at the University of Hawaii  and he's an expert magician  and an expert on the street magic of India  which is what this book is about   Net of Magic.  And there's a passage in it which I would love to share with you. It speaks so eloquently to the problem.  'I'm writing a book on magic ' I explain  and I'm asked  'Real magic ' By 'real magic ' people mean miracles  thaumaturgical acts  and supernatural powers. 'No ' I answer. 'Conjuring tricks  not real magic.' 'Real magic ' in other words  refers to the magic that is not real  while the magic that is real  that can actually be done  is not real magic.  Now  that's the way a lot of people feel about consciousness. Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks. If you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks  then it's not real consciousness  whatever it is. And  as Marvin said  and as other people have said   Consciousness is a bag of tricks.  This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness. So this is the problem. So I have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won't like  for the same reason that you don't like to see a magic trick explained to you. How many of you here  if somebody    some smart aleck    starts telling you how a particular magic trick is done  you sort of want to block your ears and say   No  no  I don't want to know  Don't take the thrill of it away. I'd rather be mystified. Don't tell me the answer.  A lot of people feel that way about consciousness  I've discovered. And I'm sorry if I impose some clarity  some understanding on you. You'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks. But I'm not going to explain it all to you. I'm going to do what philosophers do. Here's how a philosopher explains the sawing the lady in half trick. You know the sawing the lady in half trick  The philosopher says   I'm going to explain to you how that's done. You see  the magician doesn't really saw the lady in half.   He merely makes you think that he does.  And you say   Yes  and how does he do that   He says   Oh  that's not my department  I'm sorry.  So now I'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness. But I'm going to try to also show you that consciousness isn't quite as marvelous    your own consciousness isn't quite as wonderful    as you may have thought it is. This is something  by the way  that Lee Siegel talks about in his book. He marvels at how he'll do a magic show  and afterwards people will swear they saw him do X  Y  and Z. He never did those things. He didn't even try to do those things. People's memories inflate what they think they saw. And the same is true of consciousness. Now  let's see if this will work. All right. Let's just watch this. Watch it carefully. I'm working with a young computer animator documentarian named Nick Deamer  and this is a little demo that he's done for me  part of a larger project some of you may be interested in. We're looking for a backer. It's a feature length documentary on consciousness. OK  now  you all saw what changed  right  How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color  Every one. I'll just show you by running it again. Even when you know that they're all going to change color  it's very hard to notice. You have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all. Now  this is an example    one of many    of a phenomenon that's now being studied quite a bit. It's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my      book   Consciousness Explained   where I said if you did experiments of this sort  you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes. If there's time at the end  I'll show you the much more dramatic case. Now  how can it be that there are all those changes going on  and that we're not aware of them  Well  earlier today  Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades  the way your eye moves around three or four times a second. He didn't mention the speed. Your eye is constantly in motion  moving around  looking at eyes  noses  elbows  looking at interesting things in the world. And where your eye isn't looking  you're remarkably impoverished in your vision. That's because the foveal part of your eye  which is the high resolution part  is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length. That's the detail part. It doesn't seem that way  does it  It doesn't seem that way  but that's the way it is. You're getting in a lot less information than you think. Here's a completely different effect. This is a painting by Bellotto. It's in the museum in North Carolina. Bellotto was a student of Canaletto's. And I love paintings like that    the painting is actually about as big as it is right here. And I love Canalettos  because Canaletto has this fantastic detail  and you can get right up and see all the details on the painting. And I started across the hall in North Carolina  because I thought it was probably a Canaletto  and would have all that in detail. And I noticed that on the bridge there  there's a lot of people    you can just barely see them walking across the bridge. And I thought as I got closer I would be able to see all the detail of most people  see their clothes  and so forth. And as I got closer and closer  I actually screamed. I yelled out because when I got closer  I found the detail wasn't there at all. There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint. And as I walked towards the picture  I was expecting detail that wasn't there. The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes and wagons and all sorts of things  and my brain had taken the suggestion. You're familiar with a more recent technology  which is    There  you can get a better view of the blobs. See  when you get close they're really just blobs of paint. You will have seen something like this    this is the reverse effect. I'll just give that to you one more time. Now  what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion  When an artful blob of paint or two  by an artist  suggests a person    say  one of Marvin Minsky's little society of mind    do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere  I don't think so. Not a chance. But then  how on Earth is it done  Well  remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady  It's the same thing. The brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there. You think the detail's there  but it isn't there. The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all. It's just making you expect the detail. Let's just do this experiment very quickly. Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right  rotated  Yes. How many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind's eye  to see if it matched up with the one on the right  How many of you rotated the one on the right  OK. How do you know that's what you did  There's in fact been a very interesting debate raging for over    years in cognitive science    various experiments started by Roger Shepherd  who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images. Yes  it's possible to do that. But the details of the process are still in significant controversy. And if you read that literature  one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when you're the subject in the experiment  you don't know. You don't know how you do it. You just know that you have certain beliefs. And they come in a certain order  at a certain time. And what explains the fact that that's what you think  Well  that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician. This is a figure that I love  Bradley  Petrie  and Dumais. You may think that I've cheated  that I've put a little whiter than white boundary there. How many of you see that sort of boundary  with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles  Can you see it  Well  you know  in effect  the boundary's really there  in a certain sense. Your brain is actually computing that boundary  the boundary that goes right there. But now  notice there are two ways of seeing the cube  right  It's a Necker cube. Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube  OK. Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube  Because there's another way of seeing it. If you're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles  some black circles  there's another way of seeing it. As a cube  on a black background  as seen through a piece of Swiss cheese. Can you get it  How many of you can't get it  That'll help. Now you can get it. These are two very different phenomena. When you see the cube one way  behind the screen  those boundaries go away. But there's still a sort of filling in  as we can tell if we look at this. We don't have any trouble seeing the cube  but where does the color change  Does your brain have to send little painters in there  The purple painters and the green painters fight over who's going to paint that bit behind the curtain  No. Your brain just lets it go. The brain doesn't need to fill that in. When I first started talking about the Bradley  Petrie  Dumais example that you just saw    I'll go back to it  this one    I said that there was no filling in behind there. And I supposed that that was just a flat truth  always true. But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn't. Now  if you think you see some pale yellow    I'll run this a few more times. Look in the gray areas  and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there    yeah  it's amazing. There's nothing there. It's no trick.   Failure to Detect Changes in Scenes  slide  This is Ron Rensink's work  which was in some degree inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book. Let me just pause this for a second if I can. This is change blindness. What you're going to see is two pictures  one of which is slightly different from the other. You see here the red roof and the gray roof  and in between them there will be a mask  which is just a blank screen  for about a quarter of a second. So you'll see the first picture  then a mask  then the second picture  then a mask. And this will just continue  and your job as the subject is to press the button when you see the change. So  show the original picture for     milliseconds. Blank. Show the next picture for     milliseconds. Blank. And keep going  until the subject presses the button  saying   I see the change.  So now we're going to be subjects in the experiment. We're going to start easy. Some examples. No trouble there. Can everybody see  All right. Indeed  Rensink's subjects took only a little bit more than a second to press the button. Can you see that one   .  seconds. How many don't see it still  What's on the roof of that barn  It's easy. Is it a bridge or a dock  There are a few more really dramatic ones  and then I'll close. I want you to see a few that are particularly striking. This one because it's so large and yet it's pretty hard to see. Can you see it  Audience  Yes. Dan Dennett  See the shadows going back and forth  Pretty big. So   .  seconds is the median time for subjects in his experiment there. I love this one. I'll end with this one  just because it's such an obvious and important thing. How many still don't see it  How many still don't see it  How many engines on the wing of that Boeing  Right in the middle of the picture  Thanks very much for your attention. What I wanted to show you is that scientists  using their from the outside  third person methods  can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of  and that  in fact  you're not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are. And we're really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind. Jeff Hawkins  this morning  was describing his attempt to get theory  and a good  big theory  into the neuroscience. And he's right. This is a problem. Harvard Medical School once    I was at a talk    director of the lab said   In our lab  we have a saying. If you work on one neuron  that's neuroscience. If you work on two neurons  that's psychology.  We have to have more theory  and it can come as much from the top down. Thank you very much.,"Philosopher, cognitive scientist",200704,6.084306358381503
106,1964,1966,Dan Dennett 2006,Dan Dennett,male,Let's teach religion — all religion — in schools,Jul 2006,1476,It's wonderful to be back. I love this wonderful gathering. And you must be wondering   What on earth  Have they put up the wrong slide   No  no. Look at this magnificent beast  and ask the question  Who designed it  This is TED  this is Technology  Entertainment  Design  and there's a dairy cow. It's a quite wonderfully designed animal. And I was thinking  how do I introduce this  And I thought  well  maybe that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer  you know   Poems are made by fools like me  but only God can make a tree.  And you might say   Well  God designed the cow.  But  of course  God got a lot of help. This is the ancestor of cattle. This is the aurochs. And it was designed by natural selection  the process of natural selection  over many millions of years. And then it became domesticated  thousands of years ago. And human beings became its stewards  and  without even knowing what they were doing  they gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it. And then more recently  they really began to do reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what the parts were  how they worked and how they might be optimized    how they might be made better. Now  why am I talking about cows  Because I want to say that much the same thing is true of religions. Religions are natural phenomena    they're just as natural as cows. They have evolved over millennia. They have a biological base  just like the aurochs. They have become domesticated  and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years. This is TED  and I want to talk about design. Because what I've been doing for the last four years    really since the first time you saw me    some of you saw me at TED when I was talking about religion    and in the last four years  I've been working just about non stop on this topic. And you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions. Now that very idea  I think  strikes terror in many people  or anger  or anxiety of one sort or another. And that is the spell that I want to break. I want to say  no  religions are an important natural phenomenon. We should study them with the same intensity that we study all the other important natural phenomena  like global warming  as we heard so eloquently last night from Al Gore. Today's religions are brilliantly designed    brilliantly designed. They are immensely powerful social institutions and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering. And  as with the cow  there's a mixture of evolutionary design    designed by natural selection itself    and intelligent design    more or less intelligent design    and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions. You don't do book talks at TED  but I'm going to have just one slide about my book  because there is one message in it which I think this group really needs to hear. And I would be very interested to get your responses to this. It's the one policy proposal that I make in the book  at this time  when I claim not to know enough about religion to know what other policy proposals to make. And it's one that echoes remarks that you've heard already today. Here's my proposal  I'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it  Education on world religions for all of our children    in primary school  in high school  in public schools  in private schools and in home schooling. So what I'm proposing is  just as we require reading  writing  arithmetic  American history  so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world    about their history  about their creeds  about their texts  their music  their symbolisms  their prohibitions  their requirements. And this should be presented factually  straightforwardly  with no particular spin  to all of the children in the country. And as long as you teach them that  you can teach them anything else you like. That  I think  is maximal tolerance for religious freedom. As long as you inform your children about other religions  then you may    and as early as you like and whatever you like    teach them whatever creed you want them to learn. But also let them know about other religions. Now  why do I say that  Because democracy depends on an informed citizenship. Informed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy. Misinformed consent is not worth it. It's like a coin flip  it doesn't count  really. Democracy depends on informed consent. This is the way we treat people as responsible adults. Now  children below the age of consent are a special case. Parents    I'm going to use a word that Pastor Rick just used    parents are stewards of their children. They don't own them. You can't own your children. You have a responsibility to the world  to the state  to them  to take care of them right. You may teach them whatever creed you think is most important  but I say you have a responsibility to let them be informed about all the other creeds in the world  too. The reason I've taken this time is I've been fascinated to hear some of the reactions to this. One reviewer for a Roman Catholic newspaper called it  totalitarian.  It strikes me as practically libertarian. Is it totalitarian to require reading  writing and arithmetic  I don't think so. All I'm saying is    and facts  facts only  no values  just facts    about all the world's religions. Another reviewer called it  hilarious.  Well  I'm really bothered by the fact that anybody would think that was hilarious. It seems to me to be such a plausible  natural extension of the democratic principles we already have that I'm shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous. I know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths. I don't think that's defensible. But I'd really be pleased to get your answers on that    any reactions to that    later. But now I'm going to move on. Back to the cow. This picture  which I pulled off the web    the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture. That's the steward. Cows couldn't live without human stewards    they're domesticated. They're a sort of ectosymbiont. They depend on us for their survival. And Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep. I'm going to talk about sheep  too. There's a lot of serendipitous convergence here. How clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds  Think of what this got them. They could outsource all their problems  protection from predators  food finding ... ... health maintenance. The only cost in most flocks    not even this    a loss of free mating. What a deal   How clever of sheep   you might say. Except  of course  it wasn't the sheep's cleverness. We all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists    they're not very smart. It wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all. They were clueless. But it was a very clever move. Whose clever move was it  It was the clever move of natural selection itself. Francis Crick  the co discoverer of the structure of DNA with Jim Watson  once joked about what he called Orgel's Second Rule. Leslie Orgel is a molecular biologist  brilliant guy  and Orgel's Second Rule is  Evolution is cleverer than you are. Now  that is not Intelligent Design    not from Francis Crick. Evolution is cleverer than you are. If you understand Orgel's Second Rule  then you understand why the Intelligent Design movement is basically a hoax. The designs discovered by the process of natural selection are brilliant  unbelievably brilliant. Again and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered. But the process itself is without purpose  without foresight  without design. When I was here four years ago  I told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass. And why the ant was doing it was because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce. So it was sort of a spooky story. And I think some people may have misunderstood. Lancet flukes aren't smart. I submit that the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there  somewhere between petunia and carrot. They're not really bright. They don't have to be. The lesson we learn from this is  you don't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary. The design is there in nature  but it's not in anybody's head. It doesn't have to be. That's the way evolution works. Question  Was domestication good for sheep  It was great for their genetic fitness. And here I want to remind you of a wonderful point that Paul MacCready made at TED three years ago. Here's what he said   Ten thousand years ago  at the dawn of agriculture  human population  plus livestock and pets  was approximately a tenth of one percent of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass.  That was just        years ago. Yesterday  in biological terms. What is it today  Does anybody remember what he told us     percent. That is what we have done on this planet. Now  I talked to Paul afterwards    I wanted to check to find out how he'd calculated this  and get the sources and so forth    and he also gave me a paper that he had written on this. And there was a passage in it which he did not present here and I think it is so good  I'm going to read it to you   Over billions of years on a unique sphere  chance has painted a thin covering of life  complex  improbable  wonderful and fragile. Suddenly  we humans    a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature    have grown in population  technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush.  We heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish. Life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet. And we're the ones that hold the paintbrush. And how can we do that  The key to our domination of the planet is culture. And the key to culture is religion. Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth. They would be puzzled by many things. Anybody know what this is  I'll tell you what it is. This is a million people gathering on the banks of the Ganges in       perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever  as seen from satellite photograph. Here's a big crowd. Here's another crowd in Mecca. Martians would be amazed by this. They'd want to know how it originated  what it was for and how it perpetuates itself. Actually  I'm going to pass over this. The ant isn't alone. There's all sorts of wonderful cases of species which    in that case    A parasite gets into a mouse and needs to get into the belly of a cat. And it turns the mouse into Mighty Mouse  makes it fearless  so it runs out in the open  where it'll be eaten by a cat. True story. In other words  we have these hijackers    you've seen this slide before  from four years ago    a parasite that infects the brain and induces even suicidal behavior  on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness. Does that ever happen to us  Yes  it does    quite wonderfully. The Arabic word  Islam  means  submission.  It means  surrender of self interest to the will of Allah.  But I'm not just talking about Islam. I'm talking also about Christianity. This is a parchment music page that I found in a Paris bookstall    years ago. And on it  it says  in Latin   Semen est verbum Dei. Sator autem Christus.  The word of God is the seed and the sower of the seed is Christ. Same idea. Well  not quite. But in fact  Christians  too ... glory in the fact that they have surrendered to God. I'll give you a few quotes.  The heart of worship is surrender. Surrendered people obey God's words  even if it doesn't make sense.  Those words are by Rick Warren. Those are from  The Purpose Driven Life.  And I want to turn now  briefly  to talk about that book  which I've read. You've all got a copy  and you've just heard the man. And what I want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint  because I think it's actually a brilliant book. First of all  the goal    and you heard just now what the goal is    it's to bring purpose to the lives of millions  and he has succeeded. Is it a good goal  In itself  I'm sure we all agree  it is a wonderful goal. He's absolutely right. There are lots of people out there who don't have purpose in their life  and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal. I give him an A  on this. Is the goal achieved  Yes. Thirty million copies of this book. Al Gore  eat your heart out. Just exactly what Al is trying to do  Rick is doing. This is a fantastic achievement. And the means    how does he do it  It's a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes    updating them  quietly dropping obsolete features  putting new interpretations on other features. This is the evolution of religion that's been going on for thousands of years  and he's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it. I don't have to tell you this  you just heard the man. Excellent insights into human psychology  wise advice on every page. Moreover  he invites us to look under the hood. I really appreciated that. For instance  he has an appendix where he explains his choice of translations of different Bible verses. The book is clear  vivid  accessible  beautifully formatted. Just enough repetition. That's really important. Every time you read it or say it  you make another copy in your brain. Every time you read it or say it  you make another copy in your brain. With me  everybody    you make another copy in your brain. Thank you. And now we come to my problem. Because I'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that I said about this book. But I wish it were better. I have some problems with the book. And it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems. I wish he could do this with a revision  a Mark   version of his book.  The truth will set you free.  That's what it says in the Bible  and it's something that I want to live by  too. My problem is  some of the bits in it I don't think are true. Now some of this is a difference of opinion. And that's not my main complaint  that's worth mentioning. Here's a passage    it's very much what he said  anyway   If there was no God we would all be accidents  the result of astronomical random chance in the Universe. You could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance. There would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on Earth.  Now  I just do not believe that. By the way  I find    Homer Groening's film presented a beautiful alternative to that very claim. Yes  there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong. We don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us. But that  as I said  is just a difference of opinion. That's not what I'm really worried about. How about this   God designed this planet's environment just so we could live in it.  I'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean that we don't have to do the sorts of things that Al Gore is trying so hard to get us to do. I am not happy with that sentiment at all. And then I find this   All the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that the cosmos is a specially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose  a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact.  Well  that's Michael Denton. He's a creationist. And here  I think   Wait a minute.  I read this again. I read it three or four times and I think   Is he really endorsing Intelligent Design  Is he endorsing creationism here   And you can't tell. So I'm sort of thinking   Well  I don't know  I don't know if I want to get upset with this yet.  But then I read on  and I read this   First  Noah had never seen rain  because prior to the Flood  God irrigated the earth from the ground up.  I wish that sentence weren't in there  because I think it is false. And I think that thinking this way about the history of the planet  after we've just been hearing about the history of the planet over millions of years  discourages people from scientific understanding. Now  Rick Warren uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way. Here's one   God deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him in a way that makes your ministry unique. He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail that created you.  I think that's false. Now  maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical. Here's another one   For instance  your brain can store     trillion facts. Your mind can handle        decisions a second.  Well  it would be interesting to find the interpretation where I would accept that. There might be some way of treating that as true.  Anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge  hardwired by God into the very fiber of our being    an inbuilt need to connect with God.  Well  the sense of which I agree with him  except I think it has an evolutionary explanation. And what I find deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral  if you want to have meaning in your life  you have to be an Intelligent Designer  you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection. And I think  on the contrary  that it is very important to solving the world's problems that we take evolutionary biology seriously. Whose truth are we going to listen to  Well  this is from  The Purpose Driven Life    The Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life  the compass I rely on for direction  the counsel I listen to for making wise decisions  and the benchmark I use for evaluating everything.  Well maybe  OK  but what's going to follow from this  And here's one that does concern me. Remember I quoted him before with this line   Surrendered people obey God's word  even if it doesn't make sense.  And that's a problem.  Don't ever argue with the Devil. He's better at arguing than you are  having had thousands of years to practice.  Now  Rick Warren didn't invent this clever move. It's an old move. It's a very clever adaptation of religions. It's a wild card for disarming any reasonable criticism.  You don't like my interpretation  You've got a reasonable objection to it  Don't listen  don't listen  That's the Devil speaking.  This discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship it seems to me that we want to have. I've got one more problem  then I'm through. And I'd really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it.  In the Great Commission  Jesus said  'Go to all people of all nations and make them my disciples. Baptize them in the name of the Father  the Son and the Holy Spirit  and teach them to do everything I've told you.'  The Bible says Jesus is the only one who can save the world. We've seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so. Here's one  not as beautiful as the others  it simply shows the religions of the world. Here's one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions. Do we really want to commit ourselves to engulfing all the other religions  when their holy books are telling them   Don't listen to the other side  that's just Satan talking    It seems to me that that's a very problematic ship to get on for the future. I found this sign as I was driving to Maine recently  in front of a church   Good without God becomes zero.  Sort of cute. A very clever little meme. I don't believe it and I think this idea  popular as it is    not in this guise  but in general    is itself one of the main problems that we face. If you are like me  you know many wonderful  committed  engaged atheists  agnostics  who are being very good without God. And you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanctity instead of doing good works. So  I wish we could drop this meme. I wish this meme would go extinct.

107,731,733,Dan Gilbert 2014,Dan Gilbert,male,The psychology of your future self,Jun 2014,401,At every stage of our lives we make decisions that will profoundly influence the lives of the people we're going to become  and then when we become those people  we're not always thrilled with the decisions we made. So young people pay good money to get tattoos removed that teenagers paid good money to get. Middle aged people rushed to divorce people who young adults rushed to marry. Older adults work hard to lose what middle aged adults worked hard to gain. On and on and on. The question is  as a psychologist  that fascinates me is  why do we make decisions that our future selves so often regret  Now  I think one of the reasons    I'll try to convince you today   is that we have a fundamental misconception about the power of time. Every one of you knows that the rate of change slows over the human lifespan  that your children seem to change by the minute but your parents seem to change by the year. But what is the name of this magical point in life where change suddenly goes from a gallop to a crawl  Is it teenage years  Is it middle age  Is it old age  The answer  it turns out  for most people  is now  wherever now happens to be. What I want to convince you today is that all of us are walking around with an illusion  an illusion that history  our personal history  has just come to an end  that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives. Let me give you some data to back up that claim. So here's a study of change in people's personal values over time. Here's three values. Everybody here holds all of them  but you probably know that as you grow  as you age  the balance of these values shifts. So how does it do so  Well  we asked thousands of people. We asked half of them to predict for us how much their values would change in the next    years  and the others to tell us how much their values had changed in the last    years. And this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis  because it allowed us to compare the predictions of people  say     years old  to the reports of people who were     and to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan. Here's what we found. First of all  you are right  change does slow down as we age  but second  you're wrong  because it doesn't slow nearly as much as we think. At every age  from    to    in our data set  people vastly underestimated how much change they would experience over the next    years. We call this the  end of history  illusion. To give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect  you can connect these two lines  and what you see here is that    year olds anticipate changing only as much as    year olds actually do. Now it's not just values. It's all sorts of other things. For example  personality. Many of you know that psychologists now claim that there are five fundamental dimensions of personality  neuroticism  openness to experience  agreeableness  extraversion  and conscientiousness. Again  we asked people how much they expected to change over the next    years  and also how much they had changed over the last    years  and what we found  well  you're going to get used to seeing this diagram over and over  because once again the rate of change does slow as we age  but at every age  people underestimate how much their personalities will change in the next decade. And it isn't just ephemeral things like values and personality. You can ask people about their likes and dislikes  their basic preferences. For example  name your best friend  your favorite kind of vacation  what's your favorite hobby  what's your favorite kind of music. People can name these things. We ask half of them to tell us   Do you think that that will change over the next    years   and half of them to tell us   Did that change over the last    years   And what we find  well  you've seen it twice now  and here it is again  people predict that the friend they have now is the friend they'll have in    years  the vacation they most enjoy now is the one they'll enjoy in    years  and yet  people who are    years older all say   Eh  you know  that's really changed.  Does any of this matter  Is this just a form of mis prediction that doesn't have consequences  No  it matters quite a bit  and I'll give you an example of why. It bedevils our decision making in important ways. Bring to mind right now for yourself your favorite musician today and your favorite musician    years ago. I put mine up on the screen to help you along. Now we asked people to predict for us  to tell us how much money they would pay right now to see their current favorite musician perform in concert    years from now  and on average  people said they would pay     dollars for that ticket. And yet  when we asked them how much they would pay to see the person who was their favorite    years ago perform today  they say only    dollars. Now  in a perfectly rational world  these should be the same number  but we overpay for the opportunity to indulge our current preferences because we overestimate their stability. Why does this happen  We're not entirely sure  but it probably has to do with the ease of remembering versus the difficulty of imagining. Most of us can remember who we were    years ago  but we find it hard to imagine who we're going to be  and then we mistakenly think that because it's hard to imagine  it's not likely to happen. Sorry  when people say  I can't imagine that   they're usually talking about their own lack of imagination  and not about the unlikelihood of the event that they're describing. The bottom line is  time is a powerful force. It transforms our preferences. It reshapes our values. It alters our personalities. We seem to appreciate this fact  but only in retrospect. Only when we look backwards do we realize how much change happens in a decade. It's as if  for most of us  the present is a magic time. It's a watershed on the timeline. It's the moment at which we finally become ourselves. Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they're finished. The person you are right now is as transient  as fleeting and as temporary as all the people you've ever been. The one constant in our life is change.

108,1313,1315,Dan Gilbert 2006,Dan Gilbert,male,The surprising science of happiness,Sep 2006,1269,When you have    minutes to speak  two million years seems like a really long time. But evolutionarily  two million years is nothing. And yet in two million years  the human brain has nearly tripled in mass  going from the one and a quarter pound brain of our ancestor here  Habilis  to the almost three pound meatloaf that everybody here has between their ears. What is it about a big brain that nature was so eager for every one of us to have one  Well  it turns out when brains triple in size  they don't just get three times bigger  they gain new structures. And one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part  called the  frontal lobe.  Particularly  a part called the  pre frontal cortex.  What does a pre frontal cortex do for you that should justify the entire architectural overhaul of the human skull in the blink of evolutionary time  It turns out the pre frontal cortex does lots of things  but one of the most important things it does is an experience simulator. Pilots practice in flight simulators so that they don't make real mistakes in planes. Human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life. This is a trick that none of our ancestors could do  and that no other animal can do quite like we can. It's a marvelous adaptation. It's up there with opposable thumbs and standing upright and language as one of the things that got our species out of the trees and into the shopping mall. All of you have done this. Ben and Jerry's doesn't have liver and onion ice cream  and it's not because they whipped some up  tried it and went   Yuck.  It's because  without leaving your armchair  you can simulate that flavor and say  yuck  before you make it. Let's see how your experience simulators are working. Let's just run a quick diagnostic before I proceed with the rest of the talk. Here's two different futures that I invite you to contemplate. You can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer. One of them is winning the lottery. This is about     million dollars. And the other is becoming paraplegic. Just give it a moment of thought. You probably don't feel like you need a moment of thought. Interestingly  there are data on these two groups of people  data on how happy they are. And this is exactly what you expected  isn't it  But these aren't the data. I made these up  These are the data. You failed the pop quiz  and you're hardly five minutes into the lecture. Because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs  and a year after winning the lotto  lottery winners and paraplegics are equally happy with their lives. Don't feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz  because everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time. The research that my laboratory has been doing  that economists and psychologists around the country have been doing  has revealed something really quite startling to us  something we call the  impact bias   which is the tendency for the simulator to work badly. For the simulator to make you believe that different outcomes are more different than in fact they really are. From field studies to laboratory studies  we see that winning or losing an election  gaining or losing a romantic partner  getting or not getting a promotion  passing or not passing a college test  on and on  have far less impact  less intensity and much less duration than people expect them to have. This almost floors me    a recent study showing how major life traumas affect people suggests that if it happened over three months ago  with only a few exceptions  it has no impact whatsoever on your happiness. Why  Because happiness can be synthesized. Sir Thomas Brown wrote in        I am the happiest man alive. I have that in me that can convert poverty to riches  adversity to prosperity. I am more invulnerable than Achilles  fortune hath not one place to hit me.  What kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head  Well  it turns out it's precisely the same remarkable machinery that all off us have. Human beings have something that we might think of as a  psychological immune system.  A system of cognitive processes  largely non conscious cognitive processes  that help them change their views of the world  so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves. Like Sir Thomas  you have this machine. Unlike Sir Thomas  you seem not to know it. We synthesize happiness  but we think happiness is a thing to be found. Now  you don't need me to give you too many examples of people synthesizing happiness  I suspect. Though I'm going to show you some experimental evidence  you don't have to look very far for evidence. As a challenge to myself  since I say this once in a while in lectures  I took a copy of the New York Times and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness. Here are three guys synthesizing happiness.  I am so much better off physically  financially  emotionally  mentally and almost every other way.   I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience.   I believe it turned out for the best.  Who are these characters who are so damn happy  The first one is Jim Wright. Some of you are old enough to remember  he was the chairman of the House of Representatives and he resigned in disgrace when this young Republican named Newt Gingrich found out about a shady book deal he had done. He lost everything. The most powerful Democrat in the country lost everything. He lost his money  he lost his power. What does he have to say all these years later   I am so much better off physically  financially  mentally and in almost every other way.  What other way would there be to be better off  Vegetably  Minerally  Animally  He's pretty much covered them there. Moreese Bickham is somebody you've never heard of. Moreese Bickham uttered these words upon being released. He was    years old. He'd spent    years in a Louisiana State Penitentiary for a crime he didn't commit.  He was ultimately released for good behavior halfway through his sentence.  What did he say about his experience   I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience.  Glorious  He is not saying   Well  there were some nice guys. They had a gym.   Glorious   a word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience. Harry S. Langerman uttered these words  and he's somebody you might have known but didn't  because in      he read a little article in the paper about a hamburger stand owned by two brothers named McDonalds. And he thought   That's a really neat idea   So he went to find them. They said   We can give you a franchise on this for       bucks.  Harry went back to New York  asked his brother  an investment banker  to loan him the         and his brother's immortal words were   You idiot  nobody eats hamburgers.  He wouldn't lend him the money  and of course  six months later Ray Kroc had exactly the same idea. It turns out people do eat hamburgers  and Ray Kroc  for a while  became the richest man in America. And then finally    you know  the best of all possible worlds    some of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best  who was the original drummer for the Beatles  until they  you know  sent him out on an errand and snuck away and picked up Ringo on a tour. Well  in       when Pete Best was interviewed    yes  he's still a drummer  yes  he's a studio musician    he had this to say   I'm happier than I would have been with the Beatles.  Okay. There's something important to be learned from these people  and it is the secret of happiness. Here it is  finally to be revealed. First  accrue wealth  power  and prestige  then lose it. Second  spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can. Third  make somebody else really  really rich. And finally  never ever join the Beatles. OK. Now I  like Ze Frank  can predict your next thought  which is   Yeah  right.  Because when people synthesize happiness  as these gentlemen seem to have done  we all smile at them  but we kind of roll our eyes and say   Yeah right  you never really wanted the job.   Oh yeah  right. You really didn't have that much in common with her  and you figured that out just about the time she threw the engagement ring in your face.  We smirk because we believe that synthetic happiness is not of the same quality as what we might call  natural happiness.  What are these terms  Natural happiness is what we get when we get what we wanted  and synthetic happiness is what we make when we don't get what we wanted. And in our society  we have a strong belief that synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind. Why do we have that belief  Well  it's very simple. What kind of economic engine would keep churning if we believed that not getting what we want could make us just as happy as getting it  With all apologies to my friend Matthieu Ricard  a shopping mall full of Zen monks is not going to be particularly profitable  because they don't want stuff enough. I want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and enduring as the kind of happiness you stumble upon when you get exactly what you were aiming for. I'm a scientist  so I'm going to do this not with rhetoric  but by marinating you in a little bit of data. Let me first show you an experimental paradigm that is used to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness among regular old folks. And this isn't mine. It's a    year old paradigm called the  free choice paradigm.  It's very simple. You bring in  say  six objects  and you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked. In this case  because this experiment uses them  these are Monet prints. So  everybody can rank these Monet prints from the one they like the most  to the one they like the least. Now we give you a choice   We happen to have some extra prints in the closet. We're going to give you one as your prize to take home. We happen to have number three and number four   we tell the subject. This is a bit of a difficult choice  because neither one is preferred strongly to the other  but naturally  people tend to pick number three because they liked it a little better than number four. Sometime later    it could be    minutes  it could be    days    the same stimuli are put before the subject  and the subject is asked to re rank the stimuli.  Tell us how much you like them now.  What happens  Watch as happiness is synthesized. This is the result that has been replicated over and over again. You're watching happiness be synthesized. Would you like to see it again  Happiness   The one I got is really better than I thought  That other one I didn't get sucks   That's the synthesis of happiness. Now  what's the right response to that   Yeah  right   Now  here's the experiment we did  and I hope this is going to convince you that  Yeah  right   was not the right response. We did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia. These are hospitalized patients. Most of them have Korsakoff's syndrome  a polyneuritic psychosis. They drank way too much  and they can't make new memories. OK  They remember their childhood  but if you walk in and introduce yourself  and then leave the room  when you come back  they don't know who you are. We took our Monet prints to the hospital. And we asked these patients to rank them from the one they liked the most to the one they liked the least. We then gave them the choice between number three and number four. Like everybody else  they said   Gee  thanks Doc  That's great  I could use a new print. I'll take number three.  We explained we would have number three mailed to them. We gathered up our materials and we went out of the room  and counted to a half hour. Back into the room  we say   Hi  we're back.  The patients  bless them  say   Ah  Doc  I'm sorry  I've got a memory problem  that's why I'm here. If I've met you before  I don't remember.   Really  you don't remember  I was just here with the Monet prints    Sorry  Doc  I just don't have a clue.   No problem  Jim. All I want you to do is rank these for me from the one you like the most to the one you like the least.  What do they do  Well  let's first check and make sure they're really amnesiac. We ask these amnesiac patients to tell us which one they own  which one they chose last time  which one is theirs. And what we find is amnesiac patients just guess. These are normal controls  where if I did this with you  all of you would know which print you chose. But if I do this with amnesiac patients  they don't have a clue. They can't pick their print out of a lineup. Here's what normal controls do  they synthesize happiness. Right  This is the change in liking score  the change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked. Normal controls show    that was the magic I showed you  now I'm showing it to you in graphical form     The one I own is better than I thought. The one I didn't own  the one I left behind  is not as good as I thought.  Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing. Think about this result. These people like better the one they own  but they don't know they own it.  Yeah  right  is not the right response  What these people did when they synthesized happiness is they really  truly changed their affective  hedonic  aesthetic reactions to that poster. They're not just saying it because they own it  because they don't know they own it. Now  when psychologists show you bars  you know that they are showing you averages of lots of people. And yet  all of us have this psychological immune system  this capacity to synthesize happiness  but some of us do this trick better than others. And some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively than other situations do. It turns out that freedom    the ability to make up your mind and change your mind    is the friend of natural happiness  because it allows you to choose among all those delicious futures and find the one that you would most enjoy. But freedom to choose  to change and make up your mind  is the enemy of synthetic happiness. And I'm going to show you why. Dilbert already knows  of course. You're reading as I'm talking.  Dogbert's tech support. How may I abuse you    My printer prints a blank page after every document.   Why complain about getting free paper    Free  Aren't you just giving me my own paper    Look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper  Only a fool or a liar would say that they look the same    Now that you mention it  it does seem a little silkier    What are you doing    I'm helping people accept the things they cannot change.  Indeed. The psychological immune system works best when we are totally stuck  when we are trapped. This is the difference between dating and marriage. You go out on a date with a guy  and he picks his nose  you don't go out on another date. You're married to a guy and he picks his nose  He has a heart of gold. Don't touch the fruitcake  You find a way to be happy with what's happened. Now  what I want to show you is that people don't know this about themselves  and not knowing this can work to our supreme disadvantage. Here's an experiment we did at Harvard. We created a black and white photography course  and we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a darkroom. So we gave them cameras  they went around campus  they took    pictures of their favorite professors and their dorm room and their dog  and all the other things they wanted to have Harvard memories of. They bring us the camera  we make up a contact sheet  they figure out which are the two best pictures  and we now spend six hours teaching them about darkrooms. And they blow two of them up  and they have two gorgeous eight by    glossies of meaningful things to them  and we say   Which one would you like to give up   They say   I have to give one up    Yes  we need one as evidence of the class project. So you have to give me one. You have to make a choice. You get to keep one  and I get to keep one.  Now  there are two conditions in this experiment. In one case  the students are told   But you know  if you want to change your mind  I'll always have the other one here  and in the next four days  before I actually mail it to headquarters      yeah   headquarters      I'll be glad to swap it out with you. In fact  I'll come to your dorm room  just give me an email. Better yet  I'll check with you. You ever want to change your mind  it's totally returnable.  The other half of the students are told exactly the opposite   Make your choice  and by the way  the mail is going out  gosh  in two minutes  to England. Your picture will be winging its way over the Atlantic. You will never see it again.  Half of the students in each of these conditions are asked to make predictions about how much they're going to come to like the picture that they keep and the picture they leave behind. Other students are just sent back to their little dorm rooms and they are measured over the next three to six days on their liking  satisfaction with the pictures. And look at what we find. First of all  here's what students think is going to happen. They think they're going to maybe come to like the picture they chose a little more than the one they left behind  but these are not statistically significant differences. It's a very small increase  and it doesn't much matter whether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition. Wrong o. Bad simulators. Because here's what's really happening. Both right before the swap and five days later  people who are stuck with that picture  who have no choice  who can never change their mind  like it a lot  And people who are deliberating     Should I return it  Have I gotten the right one  Maybe this isn't the good one  Maybe I left the good one      have killed themselves. They don't like their picture  and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired  they still don't like their picture. Why  Because the  reversible  condition is not conducive to the synthesis of happiness. So here's the final piece of this experiment. We bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard students and we say   You know  we're doing a photography course  and we can do it one of two ways. We could do it so that when you take the two pictures  you'd have four days to change your mind  or we're doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it. Which course would you like to be in   Duh     percent of the students  two thirds  prefer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind. Hello     percent of the students choose to be in the course in which they will ultimately be deeply dissatisfied with the picture. Because they do not know the conditions under which synthetic happiness grows. The Bard said everything best  of course  and he's making my point here but he's making it hyperbolically   'Tis nothing good or bad   But thinking makes it so.  It's nice poetry  but that can't exactly be right. Is there really nothing good or bad  Is it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to Paris are just the same thing  That seems like a one question IQ test. They can't be exactly the same. In more turgid prose  but closer to the truth  was the father of modern capitalism  Adam Smith  and he said this. This is worth contemplating   The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life seems to arise from overrating the difference between one permanent situation and another    Some of these situations may  no doubt  deserve to be preferred to others  but none of them can deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardor which drives us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice  or to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds  either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly  or by remorse for the horror of our own injustice.  In other words  yes  some things are better than others. We should have preferences that lead us into one future over another. But when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures  we are at risk. When our ambition is bounded  it leads us to work joyfully. When our ambition is unbounded  it leads us to lie  to cheat  to steal  to hurt others  to sacrifice things of real value. When our fears are bounded  we're prudent  we're cautious  we're thoughtful. When our fears are unbounded and overblown  we're reckless  and we're cowardly. The lesson I want to leave you with  from these data  is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown  because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience.

109,1364,1366,Dan Gilbert 2008,Dan Gilbert,male,Why we make bad decisions,Dec 2008,2001,We all make decisions every day  we want to know what the right thing is to do    in domains from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic. And surely  if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times  that would be a tremendous gift. It turns out that  in fact  the world was given this gift in      by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli. And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is  and I also want to explain to you why it is that it hasn't made a damn bit of difference. Now  this is Bernoulli's gift. This is a direct quote. And if it looks like Greek to you  it's because  well  it's Greek. But the simple English translation    much less precise  but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say    was this  The expected value of any of our actions    that is  the goodness that we can count on getting    is the product of two simple things  the odds that this action will allow us to gain something  and the value of that gain to us. In a sense  what Bernoulli was saying is  if we can estimate and multiply these two things  we will always know precisely how we should behave. Now  this simple equation  even for those of you who don't like equations  is something that you're quite used to. Here's an example  if I were to tell you  let's play a little coin toss game  and I'm going to flip a coin  and if it comes up heads  I'm going to pay you    dollars  but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me  most of you would say  sure  I'll take that bet. Because you know that the odds of you winning are one half  the gain if you do is    dollars  that multiplies to five  and that's more than I'm charging you to play. So  the answer is  yes. This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet. Now  the idea is simple when we're applying it to coin tosses  but in fact  it's not very simple in everyday life. People are horrible at estimating both of these things  and that's what I want to talk to you about today. There are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do  and those are errors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed  and errors in estimating the value of their own success. Now  let me talk about the first one first. Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy  there are six sides to a die  two sides to a coin     cards in a deck. You all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades or of flipping a heads. But as it turns out  this is not a very easy idea to apply in everyday life. That's why Americans spend more    I should say  lose more    gambling than on all other forms of entertainment combined. The reason is  this isn't how people do odds. The way people figure odds requires that we first talk a bit about pigs. Now  the question I'm going to put to you is whether you think there are more dogs or pigs on leashes observed in any particular day in Oxford. And of course  you all know that the answer is dogs. And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed in memory the times you've seen dogs and pigs on leashes. It was very easy to remember seeing dogs  not so easy to remember pigs. And each one of you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind  then dogs on leashes are more probable. That's not a bad rule of thumb  except when it is. So  for example  here's a word puzzle. Are there more four letter English words with R in the third place or R in the first place  Well  you check memory very briefly  make a quick scan  and it's awfully easy to say to yourself  Ring  Rang  Rung  and very hard to say to yourself  Pare  Park  they come more slowly. But in fact  there are many more words in the English language with R in the third than the first place. The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind isn't because they're improbable  unlikely or infrequent. It's because the mind recalls words by their first letter. You kind of shout out the sound  S    and the word comes. It's like the dictionary  it's hard to look things up by the third letter. So  this is an example of how this idea that the quickness with which things come to mind can give you a sense of their probability    how this idea could lead you astray. It's not just puzzles  though. For example  when Americans are asked to estimate the odds that they will die in a variety of interesting ways    these are estimates of number of deaths per year per     million U.S. citizens. And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked to guess how many people die from tornado  fireworks  asthma  drowning  etc. Compare these to the actual numbers. Now  you see a very interesting pattern here  which is first of all  two things are vastly over estimated  namely tornadoes and fireworks. Two things are vastly underestimated  dying by drowning and dying by asthma. Why  When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper and the headline was   Boy dies of Asthma   It's not interesting because it's so common. It's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances of news stories or newsreels where we've seen tornadoes devastating cities  or some poor schmuck who's blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July. Drownings and asthma deaths don't get much coverage. They don't come quickly to mind  and as a result  we vastly underestimate them. Indeed  this is kind of like the Sesame Street game of  Which thing doesn't belong   And you're right to say it's the swimming pool that doesn't belong  because the swimming pool is the only thing on this slide that's actually very dangerous. The way that more of you are likely to die than the combination of all three of the others that you see on the slide. The lottery is an excellent example  of course    an excellent test case of people's ability to compute probabilities. And economists    forgive me  for those of you who play the lottery    but economists  at least among themselves  refer to the lottery as a stupidity tax  because the odds of getting any payoff by investing your money in a lottery ticket are approximately equivalent to flushing the money directly down the toilet    which  by the way  doesn't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything. Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery  Well  there are many answers  but one answer surely is  we see a lot of winners. Right  When this couple wins the lottery  or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check    how the hell do you cash things that size  I don't know. We see this on TV  we read about it in the paper. When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost  Indeed  if we required that television stations run a    second interview with each loser every time they interview a winner  the     million losers in the last lottery would require nine and a half years of your undivided attention just to watch them say   Me  I lost.   Me  I lost.  Now  if you watch nine and a half years of television    no sleep  no potty breaks    and you saw loss after loss after loss  and then at the end there's    seconds of   and I won   the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small. Look  I can prove this to you  here's a little lottery. There's    tickets in this lottery. Nine of them have been sold to these individuals. It costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and  if you win  you get    bucks. Is this a good bet  Well  Bernoulli tells us it is. The expected value of this lottery is two dollars  this is a lottery in which you should invest your money. And most people say   OK  I'll play.  Now  a slightly different version of this lottery  imagine that the nine tickets are all owned by one fat guy named Leroy. Leroy has nine tickets  there's one left. Do you want it  Most people won't play this lottery. Now  you can see the odds of winning haven't changed  but it's now fantastically easy to imagine who's going to win. It's easy to see Leroy getting the check  right  You can't say to yourself   I'm as likely to win as anybody   because you're not as likely to win as Leroy. The fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy changes your decision to play  even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds. Now  estimating odds  as difficult as it may seem  is a piece of cake compared to trying to estimate value  trying to say what something is worth  how much we'll enjoy it  how much pleasure it will give us. I want to talk now about errors in value. How much is this Big Mac worth  Is it worth    dollars  Most of you have the intuition that it's not    you wouldn't pay that for it. But in fact  to decide whether a Big Mac is worth    dollars requires that you ask one  and only one question  which is  What else can I do with    dollars  If you've ever gotten on one of those long haul flights to Australia and realized that they're not going to serve you any food  but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened the McDonald's bag  and the smell of golden arches is wafting over the seat  you think  I can't do anything else with this    dollars for    hours. I can't even set it on fire    they took my cigarette lighter  Suddenly     dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal. On the other hand  if you're visiting an underdeveloped country  and    dollars buys you a gourmet meal  it's exorbitant for a Big Mac. Why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no  before I'd even told you anything about the context  Because most of you compared the price of this Big Mac to the price you're used to paying. Rather than asking   What else can I do with my money   comparing this investment to other possible investments  you compared to the past. And this is a systematic error people make. What you knew is  you paid three dollars in the past     is outrageous. This is an error  and I can prove it to you by showing the kinds of irrationalities to which it leads. For example  this is  of course  one of the most delicious tricks in marketing  is to say something used to be higher  and suddenly it seems like a very good deal. When people are asked about these two different jobs  a job where you make   K  then   K  then   K  a job where you're getting a salary cut each year  and one in which you're getting a salary increase  people like the second job better than the first  despite the fact they're all told they make much less money. Why  Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages  even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period. Here's another nice example. Here's a        Hawaiian vacation package  it's now on sale for      . Assuming you wanted to go to Hawaii  would you buy this package  Most people say they would. Here's a slightly different story         Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for     dollars  so you decide to mull it over for a week. By the time you get to the ticket agency  the best fares are gone    the package now costs      . Would you buy it  Most people say  no. Why  Because it used to cost      and there's no way I'm paying       for something that was     last week. This tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words  a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal. Here's another example of how comparing to the past can befuddle our decisions. Imagine that you're going to the theater. You're on your way to the theater. In your wallet you have a ticket  for which you paid    dollars. You also have a    dollar bill. When you arrive at the theater  you discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket. Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it  Most people answer  no. Now  let's just change one thing in this scenario. You're on your way to the theater  and in your wallet you have two    dollar bills. When you arrive you discover you've lost one of them. Would you spend your remaining    dollars on a ticket  Well  of course  I went to the theater to see the play. What does the loss of    dollars along the way have to do  Now  just in case you're not getting it  here's a schematic of what happened  OK  Along the way  you lost something. In both cases  it was a piece of paper. In one case  it had a U.S. president on it  in the other case it didn't. What the hell difference should it make  The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself  I'm not paying twice for the same thing. You compare the cost of the play now       dollars    to the cost that it used to have       dollars    and you say it's a bad deal. Comparing with the past causes many of the problems that behavioral economists and psychologists identify in people's attempts to assign value. But even when we compare with the possible  instead of the past  we still make certain kinds of mistakes. And I'm going to show you one or two of them. One of the things we know about comparison  that when we compare one thing to the other  it changes its value. So in       this fellow  George Bush  for those of us who were kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum  didn't seem like such a great guy. Suddenly  we're almost longing for him to return. The comparison changes how we evaluate him. Now  retailers knew this long before anybody else did  of course  and they use this wisdom to help you    spare you the undue burden of money. And so a retailer  if you were to go into a wine shop and you had to buy a bottle of wine  and you see them here for eight     and    dollars  what would you do  Most people don't want the most expensive  they don't want the least expensive. So  they will opt for the item in the middle. If you're a smart retailer  then  you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf  because suddenly the     wine doesn't look as expensive in comparison. So I'm telling you something you already knew  namely  that comparison changes the value of things. Here's why that's a problem  the problem is that when you get that     bottle of wine home  it won't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to. The comparisons we make when we are appraising value  where we're trying to estimate how much we'll like things  are not the same comparisons we'll be making when we consume them. This problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil our attempts to make rational decisions. Let me just give you an example. I have to show you something from my own lab  so let me sneak this in. These are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions  How much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now  They're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them. For some of the subjects  sitting in the far corner of a room is a box of Godiva chocolates  and for others is a can of Spam. In fact  these items that are sitting in the room change how much the subjects think they're going to enjoy the potato chips. Namely  those who are looking at Spam think potato chips are going to be quite tasty  those who are looking at Godiva chocolate think they won't be nearly so tasty. Of course  what happens when they eat the potato chips  Well  look  you didn't need a psychologist to tell you that when you have a mouthful of greasy  salty  crispy  delicious snacks  what's sitting in the corner of the room makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience. Nonetheless  their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience. You've all experienced this yourself  even if you've never come into our lab to eat potato chips. So here's a question  You want to buy a car stereo. The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for     dollars  but if you drive across town  you can get it for     bucks. So would you drive to get    percent off  saving     dollars  Most people say they would. They can't imagine buying it for twice the price when  with one trip across town  they can get it for half off. Now  let's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo  and the dealer near your house had it for       . But if you drove across town  you could get it for       . Would you drive to get it  At this point   .    savings    the     dollars. Most people say  no  I'm going to schlep across town to save     bucks on the purchase of a car  This kind of thinking drives economists crazy  and it should. Because this     dollars that you save    hello     doesn't know where it came from. It doesn't know what you saved it on. When you go to buy groceries with it  it doesn't go  I'm the money saved on the car stereo  or  I'm the dumb money saved on the car. It's money. And if a drive across town is worth     bucks  it's worth     bucks no matter what you're saving it on. People don't think that way. That's why they don't know whether their mutual fund manager is taking  .  percent or  .   percent of their investment  but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste. Now  you can see  this is the problem of shifting comparisons  because what you're doing is  you're comparing the     bucks to the purchase that you're making  but when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison. You've all had this experience. If you're an American  for example  you've probably traveled in France. And at some point you may have met a couple from your own hometown  and you thought   Oh  my God  these people are so warm. They're so nice to me. I mean  compared to all these people who hate me when I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don't  these people are just wonderful.  And so you tour France with them  and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner  and what do you find  Compared to your regular friends  they are boring and dull  right  Because in this new context  the comparison is very  very different. In fact  you find yourself disliking them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship. Now  you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo. You go to the stereo store  you see two sets of speakers    these big  boxy  monoliths  and these little  sleek speakers  and you play them  and you go  you know  I do hear a difference  the big ones sound a little better. And so you buy them  and you bring them home  and you entirely violate the d cor of your house. And the problem  of course  is that this comparison you made in the store is a comparison you'll never make again. What are the odds that years later you'll turn on the stereo and go   Sounds so much better than those little ones   which you can't even remember hearing. The problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult when these choices are arrayed over time. People have a lot of trouble making decisions about things that will happen at different points in time. And what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered is that by and large people use two simple rules. So let me give you one very easy problem  a second very easy problem and then a third  hard  problem. Here's the first easy problem  You can have    dollars now or    dollars now. Which would you prefer  This is what we call a one item IQ test  OK  All of us  I hope  prefer more money  and the reason is  we believe more is better than less. Here's the second problem  You can have    dollars today or    dollars in a month. Which would you prefer  Again  an easy decision  because we all know that now is better than later. What's hard in our decision making is when these two rules conflict. For example  when you're offered    dollars now or    dollars in a month. This typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain by waiting  but you have to be patient. What do we know  What do people do in these kinds of situations  Well  by and large people are enormously impatient. That is  they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification and wait until next month for the extra    dollars. Maybe that isn't so remarkable  but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing when the delivery of these monetary units will happen. Imagine that you can have    dollars in a year    that's    months    or    dollars in    months. What do we find now  People are gladly willing to wait  as long as they're waiting     they might as well wait   . What makes this dynamic inconsistency happen  Comparison. Troubling comparison. Let me show you. This is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested you would show if I gave you time to respond  which is  people find that the subjective value of    is higher than the subjective value of    when they'll be delivered in now or one month  respectively    a    day delay    but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision off into the future a year. Now  why in the world do you get this pattern of results  These guys can tell us. What you see here are two lads  one of them larger than the other  the fireman and the fiddler. They are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon  and I want you to notice two things. At no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler. No point. However  the difference between them seems to be getting smaller. First it's an inch in your view  then it's a quarter inch  then a half inch  and then finally they go off the edge of the earth. Here are the results of what I just showed you. This is the subjective height    the height you saw of these guys at various points. And I want you to see that two things are true. One  the farther away they are  the smaller they look  and two  the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler. But watch what happens when we make some of them disappear. Right. At a very close distance  the fiddler looks taller than the fireman  but at a far distance their normal  their true  relations are preserved. As Plato said  what space is to size  time is to value. These are the results of the hard problem I gave you     now or    in a month  And these are subjective values  and what you can see is  our two rules are preserved. People always think more is better than less     is always better than     and they always think now is better than later  the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side. Watch what happens when we drop some out. Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us. We have the tendency for people to go for    dollars now over waiting a month  but not if that decision is far in the future. Notice something interesting that this implies    namely  that when people get to the future  they will change their minds. That is  as that month    approaches  you will say  what was I thinking  waiting an extra month for    dollars  I'll take the    dollars now. Well  the question with which I'd like to end is this  If we're so damn stupid  how did we get to the moon  Because I could go on for about two hours with evidence of people's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value. The answer to this question  I think  is an answer you've already heard in some of the talks  and I dare say you will hear again  namely  that our brains were evolved for a very different world than the one in which we are living. They were evolved for a world in which people lived in very small groups  rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves  had rather short lives in which there were few choices and the highest priority was to eat and mate today. Bernoulli's gift  Bernoulli's little formula  allows us  it tells us how we should think in a world for which nature never designed us. That explains why we are so bad at using it  but it also explains why it is so terribly important that we become good  fast. We are the only species on this planet that has ever held its own fate in its hands. We have no significant predators  we're the masters of our physical environment  the things that normally cause species to become extinct are no longer any threat to us. The only thing    the only thing    that can destroy us and doom us are our own decisions. If we're not here in        years  it's going to be because we could not take advantage of the gift given to us by a young Dutch fellow in       because we underestimated the odds of our future pains and overestimated the value of our present pleasures. Thank you. Chris Anderson  That was remarkable. We have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert. One and two. Bill Lyell  Would you say that this mechanism is in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us  and is there some way that we could counteract that  Dan Gilbert  I actually was consulting recently with the Department of Homeland Security  which generally believes that American security dollars should go to making borders safer. I tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name based on people's psychological reaction to a set of events  and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified  rather than    not rather than  but in addition to stopping the atrocities that we're all concerned about. Surely the kinds of play that at least American media give to    and forgive me  but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents. We already know  for example  in the United States  more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes    because they were scared    and driving on highways  than were killed in     . OK  If I told you that there was a plague that was going to kill        Americans next year  you might be alarmed if you didn't find out it was the flu. These are small scale accidents  and we should be wondering whether they should get the kind of play  the kind of coverage  that they do. Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they'll be hurt in these various ways  and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us. CA  Dan  I'd like to hear more on this. So  you're saying that our response to terror is  I mean  it's a form of mental bug  Talk more about it. DG  It's out sized. I mean  look. If Australia disappears tomorrow  terror is probably the right response. That's an awful large lot of very nice people. On the other hand  when a bus blows up and    people are killed  more people than that were killed by not using their seatbelts in the same country. Is terror the right response  CA  What causes the bug  Is it the drama of the event    that it's so spectacular  Is it the fact that it's an intentional attack by  quote  outsiders  What is it  DG  Yes. It's a number of things  and you hit on several of them. First  it's a human agent trying to kill us    it's not a tree falling on us by accident. Second  these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again. People are being killed for no reason instead of good reason    as if there's good reason  but sometimes people think there are. So there are a number of things that together make this seem like a fantastic event  but let's not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it they want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media  who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can. CA  I mean  what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it  DG  Well  go to Israel. You know  go to Israel. And a mall blows up  and then everybody's unhappy about it  and an hour and a half later    at least when I was there  and I was     feet from the mall when it blew up    I went back to my hotel and the wedding that was planned was still going on. And as the Israeli mother said  she said   We never let them win by stopping weddings.  I mean  this is a society that has learned    and there are others too    that has learned to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it  shall I say  as those of us who have not had many terror attacks. CA  But is there a rational fear that actually  the reason we're frightened about this is because we think that the Big One is to come  DG  Yes  of course. So  if we knew that this was the worst attack there would ever be  there might be more and more buses of    people    we would probably not be nearly so frightened. I don't want to say    please  I'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying   Terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed.  That's not my point at all. What I'm saying is that  surely  rationally  our distress about things that happen  about threats  should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come. I think in the case of terrorism  it isn't. And many of the things we've heard about from our speakers today    how many people do you know got up and said  Poverty  I can't believe what poverty is doing to us. People get up in the morning  they don't care about poverty. It's not making headlines  it's not making news  it's not flashy. There are no guns going off. I mean  if you had to solve one of these problems  Chris  which would you solve  Terrorism or poverty  That's a tough one. CA  There's no question. Poverty  by an order of magnitude  a huge order of magnitude  unless someone can show that there's  you know  terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come. The latest I've read  seen  thought is that it's incredibly hard for them to do that. If that turns out to be wrong  we all look silly  but with poverty it's a bit    DG  Even if that were true  still more people die from poverty. CA  We've evolved to get all excited about these dramatic attacks. Is that because in the past  in the ancient past  we just didn't understand things like disease and systems that cause poverty and so forth  and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy into worrying about those things  People died  so be it. But if you got attacked  that was something you could do something about. And so we evolved these responses. Is that what happened  DG  Well  you know  the people who are most skeptical about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything are the evolutionary psychologists themselves. My guess is that there's nothing quite that specific in our evolutionary past. But rather  if you're looking for an evolutionary explanation  you might say that most organisms are neo phobic    that is  they're a little scared of stuff that's new and different. And there's a good reason to be  because old stuff didn't eat you. Right  Any animal you see that you've seen before is less likely to be a predator than one that you've never seen before. So  you know  when a school bus is blown up and we've never seen this before  our general tendency is to orient towards that which is new and novel is activated. I don't think it's quite as specific a mechanism as the one you alluded to  but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it. Jay Walker  You know  economists love to talk about the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect you're making the exact same error you're accusing those people of  which is the error of value. I know  because I've interviewed about       lottery buyers over the years. It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning. That's what you think it is. All right  The average lottery buyer buys about     tickets a year  so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose  and yet she buys     tickets a year. Why is that  It's not because she is stupid or he is stupid. It's because the anticipation of possibly winning releases serotonin in the brain  and actually provides a good feeling until the drawing indicates you've lost. Or  to put it another way  for the dollar investment  you can have a much better feeling than flushing the money down the toilet  which you cannot have a good feeling from. Now  economists tend to       economists tend to view the world through their own lenses  which is  this is just a bunch of stupid people. And as a result  many people look at economists as stupid people. And so fundamentally  the reason we got to the moon is  we didn't listen to the economists. Thank you very much. DG  Well  no  it's a great point. It remains to be seen whether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled by the amount of disappointment after the lottery. Because remember  people who didn't buy tickets don't feel awful the next day either  even though they don't feel great during the drawing. I would disagree that people know they're not going to win. I think they think it's unlikely  but it could happen  which is why they prefer that to the flushing. But certainly I see your point  that there can be some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning. Now  I think there's many good reasons not to listen to economists. That isn't one of them  for me  but there's many others. CA  Last question. Aubrey de Grey  My name's Aubrey de Grey  from Cambridge. I work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills    I work on aging    and I'm interested in doing something about it  as we'll all hear tomorrow. I very much resonate with what you're saying  because it seems to me that the problem with getting people interested in doing anything about aging is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer or heart disease or whatever. Do you have any advice  DG  For you or for them  AdG  In persuading them. DG  Ah  for you in persuading them. Well  it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted. But one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work is to get people to imagine the future more vividly. One of the problems with making decisions about the far future and the near future is that we imagine the near future much more vividly than the far future. To the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail that people put into the mental representations of near and far future  people begin to make decisions about the two in the same way. So  would you like to have an extra         dollars when you're    is a question that's very different than  imagine who you'll be when you're     will you be living  what will you look like  how much hair will you have  who will you be living with. Once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario  suddenly we feel like it might be important to save so that that guy has a little retirement money. But these are tricks around the margins. I think in general you're battling a very fundamental human tendency  which is to say   I'm here today  and so now is more important than later.  CA  Dan  thank you. Members of the audience  that was a fantastic session. Thank you.,Psychologist; happiness expert,200812,5.866845518867929
120,1566,1568,David Deutsch 2009,David Deutsch,male,A new way to explain explanation,Oct 2009,932,I'm sure that  throughout the hundred thousand odd years of our species' existence  and even before  our ancestors looked up at the night sky  and wondered what stars are. Wondering  therefore  how to explain what they saw in terms of things unseen. Okay  so  most people only wondered that occasionally  like today  in breaks from whatever normally preoccupied them. But what normally preoccupied them also involved yearning to know. They wished they knew how to prevent their food supply from sometimes failing  and how they could rest when they were tired without risking starvation  be warmer  cooler  safer  in less pain. I bet those prehistoric cave artists would have loved to know how to draw better. In every aspect of their lives  they wished for progress  just as we do. But they failed  almost completely  to make any. They didn't know how to. Discoveries like fire happened so rarely  that from an individual's point of view  the world never improved. Nothing new was learned. The first clue to the origin of starlight happened as recently as       radioactivity. Within    years  physicists discovered the whole explanation  expressed  as usual  in elegant symbols. But never mind the symbols. Think how many discoveries they represent. Nuclei and nuclear reactions  of course. But isotopes  particles of electricity  antimatter  neutrinos  the conversion of mass to energy    that's E mc      gamma rays  transmutation. That ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists was achieved through these same theories that explained starlight and other ancient mysteries  and new  unexpected phenomena. That all that  discovered in    years  had not been in the previous hundred thousand  was not for lack of thinking about stars  and all those other urgent problems they had. They even arrived at answers  such as myths  that dominated their lives  yet bore almost no resemblance to the truth. The tragedy of that protracted stagnation isn't sufficiently recognized  I think. These were people with brains of essentially the same design that eventually did discover all those things. But that ability to make progress remained almost unused  until the event that revolutionized the human condition and changed the universe. Or so we should hope. Because that event was the Scientific Revolution  ever since which our knowledge of the physical world  and of how to adapt it to our wishes  has been growing relentlessly. Now  what had changed  What were people now doing for the first time that made that difference between stagnation and rapid  open ended discovery  How to make that difference is surely the most important universal truth that it is possible to know. Worryingly  there is no consensus about what it is. So  I'll tell you. But I'll have to backtrack a little first. Before the Scientific Revolution  they believed that everything important  knowable  was already known  enshrined in ancient writings  institutions  and in some genuinely useful rules of thumb    which were  however  entrenched as dogmas  along with many falsehoods. So they believed that knowledge came from authorities that actually knew very little. And therefore progress depended on learning how to reject the authority of learned men  priests  traditions and rulers. Which is why the Scientific Revolution had to have a wider context. The Enlightenment  a revolution in how people sought knowledge  trying not to rely on authority.  Take no one's word for it.  But that can't be what made the difference. Authorities had been rejected before  many times. And that rarely  if ever  caused anything like the Scientific Revolution. At the time  what they thought distinguished science was a radical idea about things unseen  known as empiricism. All knowledge derives from the senses. Well  we've seen that that can't be true. It did help by promoting observation and experiment. But  from the outset  it was obvious that there was something horribly wrong with it. Knowledge comes from the senses. In what language  Certainly not the language of mathematics  in which  Galileo rightly said  the book of nature is written. Look at the world. You don't see equations carved on to the mountainsides. If you did  it would be because people had carved them. By the way  why don't we do that  What's wrong with us  Empiricism is inadequate because  well  scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen. And the unseen  you have to admit  doesn't come to us through the senses. We don't see those nuclear reactions in stars. We don't see the origin of species. We don't see the curvature of space time  and other universes. But we know about those things. How  Well  the classic empiricist answer is induction. The unseen resembles the seen. But it doesn't. You know what the clinching evidence was that space time is curved  It was a photograph  not of space time  but of an eclipse  with a dot there rather than there. And the evidence for evolution  Some rocks and some finches. And parallel universes  Again  dots there  rather than there  on a screen. What we see  in all these cases  bears no resemblance to the reality that we conclude is responsible    only a long chain of theoretical reasoning and interpretation connects them.  Ah   say creationists.  So you admit it's all interpretation. No one has ever seen evolution. We see rocks. You have your interpretation. We have ours. Yours comes from guesswork  ours from the Bible.  But what creationist and empiricists both ignore is that  in that sense  no one has ever seen a bible either  that the eye only detects light  which we don't perceive. Brains only detect nerve impulses. And they don't perceive even those as what they really are  namely electrical crackles. So we perceive nothing as what it really is. Our connection to reality is never just perception. It's always  as Karl Popper put it  theory laden. Scientific knowledge isn't derived from anything. It's like all knowledge. It's conjectural  guesswork  tested by observation  not derived from it. So  were testable conjectures the great innovation that opened the intellectual prison gates  No. Contrary to what's usually said  testability is common  in myths and all sorts of other irrational modes of thinking. Any crank claiming the sun will go out next Tuesday has got a testable prediction. Consider the ancient Greek myth explaining seasons. Hades  God of the Underworld  kidnaps Persephone  the Goddess of Spring  and negotiates a forced marriage contract  requiring her to return regularly  and lets her go. And each year  she is magically compelled to return. And her mother  Demeter  Goddess of the Earth  is sad  and makes it cold and barren. That myth is testable. If winter is caused by Demeter's sadness  then it must happen everywhere on Earth simultaneously. So if the ancient Greeks had only known that Australia is at its warmest when Demeter is at her saddest  they'd have known that their theory is false. So what was wrong with that myth  and with all pre scientific thinking  and what  then  made that momentous difference  I think there is one thing you have to care about. And that implies testability  the scientific method  the Enlightenment  and everything. And here is the crucial thing. There is such a thing as a defect in a story. I don't just mean a logical defect. I mean a bad explanation. What does that mean  Well  explanation is an assertion about what's there  unseen  that accounts for what's seen. Because the explanatory role of Persephone's marriage contract could be played equally well by infinitely many other ad hoc entities. Why a marriage contract and not any other reason for regular annual action  Here is one. Persephone wasn't released. She escaped  and returns every spring to take revenge on Hades  with her Spring powers. She cools his domain with Spring air  venting heat up to the surface  creating summer. That accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth. It's equally testable. Yet what it asserts about reality is  in many ways  the opposite. And that is possible because the details of the original myth are unrelated to seasons  except via the myth itself. This easy variability is the sign of a bad explanation  because  without a functional reason to prefer one of countless variants  advocating one of them  in preference to the others  is irrational. So  for the essence of what makes the difference to enable progress  seek good explanations  the ones that can't be easily varied  while still explaining the phenomena. Now  our current explanation of seasons is that the Earth's axis is tilted like that  so each hemisphere tilts toward the sun for half the year  and away for the other half. Better put that up. That's a good explanation  hard to vary  because every detail plays a functional role. For instance  we know  independently of seasons  that surfaces tilted away from radiant heat are heated less  and that a spinning sphere  in space  points in a constant direction. And the tilt also explains the sun's angle of elevation at different times of year  and predicts that the seasons will be out of phase in the two hemispheres. If they'd been observed in phase  the theory would have been refuted. But now  the fact that it's also a good explanation  hard to vary  makes the crucial difference. If the ancient Greeks had found out about seasons in Australia  they could have easily varied their myth to predict that. For instance  when Demeter is upset  she banishes heat from her vicinity  into the other hemisphere  where it makes summer. So  being proved wrong by observation  and changing their theory accordingly  still wouldn't have got the ancient Greeks one jot closer to understanding seasons  because their explanation was bad  easy to vary. And it's only when an explanation is good that it even matters whether it's testable. If the axis tilt theory had been refuted  its defenders would have had nowhere to go. No easily implemented change could make that tilt cause the same seasons in both hemispheres. The search for hard to vary explanations is the origin of all progress. It's the basic regulating principle of the Enlightenment. So  in science  two false approaches blight progress. One is well known  untestable theories. But the more important one is explanationless theories. Whenever you're told that some existing statistical trend will continue  but you aren't given a hard to vary account of what causes that trend  you're being told a wizard did it. When you are told that carrots have human rights because they share half our genes    but not how gene percentages confer rights    wizard. When someone announces that the nature nurture debate has been settled because there is evidence that a given percentage of our political opinions are genetically inherited  but they don't explain how genes cause opinions  they've settled nothing. They are saying that our opinions are caused by wizards  and presumably so are their own. That the truth consists of hard to vary assertions about reality is the most important fact about the physical world. It's a fact that is  itself  unseen  yet impossible to vary.

131,130,132,David Rockwell 2007,David Rockwell,male,A memorial at Ground Zero,Jun 2007,1451,Kurt Andersen  Like many architects  David is a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent    or at least pretends to be    that he asked me to question him rather than speaking. In fact what we're going to talk about  I think  is in fact a subject that is probably better served by a conversation than an address. And I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede. Dan Rather  Since the September   th attack on the World Trade Center  many people have flocked to downtown New York to see and pay respects at what amounts to the    acre burial ground. Now  as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports  they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene. Jim Axelrod  Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty. There's a new place in New York where the crowds are thickest    Ground Zero. Tourist  I've taken my step daughter here from Indianapolis. This was    out of all the tourist sites in New York City    this was her number one pick. JA  Thousands now line up on lower Broadway. Tourist  I've been wanting to come down here since this happened. JA  Even on the coldest winter days. To honor and remember. Tourist  It's reality  it's us. It happened here. This is ours. JA  So many  in fact  that seeing has become a bit of a problem. Tourist  I think that people are very frustrated that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on. JA  But that is about to change. In record time  a team of architects and construction workers designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration and bring people closer. Man  They'll get an incredible panorama and understand  I think more completely  the sheer totality of the destruction of the place. JA  If you think about it  Ground Zero is unlike most any other tourist site in America. Unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument  people come here to see what's no longer there. David Rockwell  The first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground. JA  The walls are bare by design  so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter. Tourist  From our hearts  it affected us just as much. JA  The ramps are made of simple material    the kind of plywood you see at construction sites    which is really the whole point. In the face of America's worst destruction people are building again. Jim Axelrod  CBS News  New York. KA  This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment  but certainly David you are known as    I know  a phrase you hate    an entertainment architect. Your work is highly sensual  even hedonistic. DR  I like that word. KA  It's about pleasure    casinos and hotels and restaurants. How did the shock that all of us    and especially all of us in New York    felt on the   th of September transmute into your desire to do this thing  DR  Well the truth of the matter is  post September   th  I felt myself in the role originally    first of all as someone who lives in Tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated  and as someone who works less than a mile from there    that I was in the role of forcing     people who work with me in my firm  to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating. In fact we're finishing a book which is called  Pleasure   which is about sensual pleasure in spaces. But I've got to tell you    it became impossible to do that. We were really paralyzed. And I found myself the Friday after September   th    two days afterwards    literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything. We gave the office a few days off. And in discussing this with other architects  we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were    they should rebuild them    stories taller. And I thought it was astonishing to speculate  as if this were a competition  on something that was such a fresh wound. And I had a series of discussions    first with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller  who collaborated with us on this  and several other people    and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something. And that as people who create places  the ultimate way to help wasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios  but to help right now. So we tried to come up with a way  as a group  to have a kind of design SWAT team. And that was the mission that we came up with. KA  Were you conscious of suddenly    as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants    suddenly fulfilling needs  DR  Well what I was aware of was  there was this overwhelming need to act now. And we were asked to participate in a few projects before this. There was a school  PS      that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero. They moved to an abandoned school. We took about    or    architects and designers and artists  and over four days    it was like this urban barn raising    to renovate it  and everyone wanted to help. It was just extraordinary. Tom Otterness contributed  Maira Kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us. KA  And that was done  effectively  by October   or something  DR  Yeah. KA  Obviously  what you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project    and this is only one of four that you've designed to surround the site    you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine  entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be in New York real estate and New York politics. DR  Well  it's a funny thing. We finished PS      and had dinner with a small group. I was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild. And I sat in on several meetings. And there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city. And the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled  and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process. And it wasn't an inclusive group. So we said  what is    KA  It was not an inclusive group  DR  It was not an inclusive group. It was predominantly a white  rich  corporate group that was not representative of the city. KA  Shocking. DR  Yeah  surprising. So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea. The city actually approached us. We first approached the city about Pier   . We saw how PS     worked. The families    the victims of the families    were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing. KA  On the Hudson River  DR  Yeah. And the city actually    through Tim Zagat initially  and then through Christyne Nicholas  then we got to Giuliani    said   You know we don't want to do anything with Pier    right now  but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero that we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families  and a way to protect it from the weather.  So I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin  and I've got to say  it was the most moving experience of my life. It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it  where the families of the victims had left notes to them. And there was no mediation between us and the experience. There was no filter. And I remembered on September   th  on   th Street  the roof of our building    we can see the World Trade Towers prominently    and I saw the first building collapse from a conference room on the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up. And then everyone was up on the roof  so I ran up there. And it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on TV. There was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience. So seeing this in a very simple  dignified way was a very powerful experience. So we went back to the city and said we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform  but we've spent some time down there. At the same time the city had this need. They were looking for a solution to deal with    or    thousand people a day who were going down there  that had nowhere to go. And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site. So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan. There was a way    there had to be a way    to get people to move around the site. KA  But then you've got to figure out a way    we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board    but simply funding this thing. It looks like a fairly simple thing  but this was a half a million dollar project  DR  Well  we knew that if it wasn't privately funded  it wasn't going to happen. And we also  frankly  knew that if it didn't happen by the end of the Giuliani administration  then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT and the Police Department and all of the    we were meeting with    or    people with the city at a time  and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management. This incredible act on their part  because they really wanted this  and they sensed that this needed to happen. KA  And there was therefore this ticking clock  because Giuliani was obviously out three months after that. DR  Yeah. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this    we had to work with the families of the victims  through the city  to make sure that they knew this was happening. Because this didn't want to be a surprise. And we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York  because the key was not raising a lot of objection and sort of working as quietly as possible. We came up with the idea of setting up a foundation  mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this  he would not agree to do this  even if we would pay him the money. There needed to be a foundation in place. So we came up with a foundation  and actually what happened was one major developer in New York    KA  Who shall remain nameless  I guess  DR  Yeah. His initials are JS  and he owns Rockefeller Center  if that helps anyone    volunteered to help. And we met with him. The prices from the contractors were between five to         dollars. And Atlantic Heydt  who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country  volunteered to do it at cost. So this developer said   You know what  we'll underwrite the entire expense.  And we said   That's incredible   And I think this was the   st  and we knew this had to be built and up by the   th. And we had to start construction the next day. We had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice  and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it. KA  Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get the tiny little Stonehenge  I guess  DR  In fact  it was as if this was going to be window washing scaffolding. There was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul    that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified  and a place to reflect and remember. And I've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together  watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul    which is just to the right    and moving around the site. And I live down there  so we spent a lot of time looking at the need. And I think people were amazed at two things    I think they were amazed at the destruction  but I think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving. Just the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers. So we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said   I'm going to lock the door  because this developer will not agree to have you leave till you've signed off on this.  And we said   Well  this is half the size  it doesn't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone    everyone in the city. We'd have to go back to the beginning to do this.  And I convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed. The next day I got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding. So we didn't know what to do  but we decided to cast a very wide net. We emailed out letters to as many people as we could    several people in the audience here    who were very helpful. KA  There was no thought of abandoning ship at that point  DR  No. In fact I told the contractor to go ahead. He had already ordered materials based on my go ahead. We knew that one way or another this was going to happen. And we just felt it had to happen. KA  You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation. Richard  I think very correctly  made the point at the beginning    before all the chair designers came out    about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions on this kind of universal  banal  common problem of sitting. It seems to me with this  that it was the opposite of that. This was an unprecedented  singular design problem. DR  Well here's the issue  we knew that this was not in the sense of    we think about the site  and think about the need for a memorial. It was important that this not be categorized as a memorial. That this was a place for people to reflect  to remember    a kind of quiet place. So it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters between the viewer    as we said about the families' platform    and the experience as possible. It's all incredibly humble material. It's scaffolding and plywood. And it allows    by sort of the procession of the movement  up by Saint Paul's and down the other side    it gives you about     feet to go up    feet from the ground to where you get the     degree view. But the design was driven by a need to be quick  cheap  safe  respectful  flexible. One of the other things is this is designed to be moveable. Because when we looked at the four platforms around the site  one of which is an upgrade of the families' platform  we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions  and the changing definition of what Ground Zero is. KA  Your work    I mean  we've talked about this before    a lot of your work  I think  is informed by your belief in  or your focus on the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things  and a kind of  Eat  drink  and be merry  for tomorrow we die   sort of sense of existence. This is clearly not a work for the ages. You know  a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here. Did that require  as an architect  a new way of thinking about what you were doing  To think of it as this purely temporary installation  DR  No  I don't think so. I think this is  obviously  substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before  just by the nature of it. Where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is  number one    the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done. And Kevin Kennon  Rick Scofidio  Liz Diller and all the people within the city    Norman Lear  who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding  offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it. So the notion of collaboration    I think this reinforces how important that is. And in terms of the temporary nature of it  our goal was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be. I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city  about what's really happening there. And a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address  where he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial. Which was very controversial  but it resonated with a lot of people. And I think regardless of what the position is about how this sacred piece of land is to be used  having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter  I think makes it a more powerful dialogue. And that's what we were interested in. So that  very much  is in the realm of things I've been interested in before. KA  It seems to me  among other things  a lovely piece of civic infrastructure. It enables that conversation to get serious. And six months after the fact    and only a few months away from the site being cleaned    we are very quickly  now  getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious. Do you have    having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project    have any ideas about what should or shouldn't be done  DR  Well  I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate    I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan. The Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings  which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings. KA  But it had some really terrible ideas. DR  And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas  where I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses. And I think there should be a broader    which there's starting to be    the dialogue is really opening up to  what does this site really want to be  And I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out  that it's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion. There's a few discussions right now that I think are very positive  about depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over  so that there's one uninterrupted piece of land. KA  Well  I think that's interesting. And it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate to discuss six months ago  but perhaps isn't now  which is  not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture  as what it had done to this city and that huge plaza. Is this an opportunity  is the silver lining    a silver lining  here    to rebuild some more traditional city grid  or not  DR  I think there's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities. And why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day  I don't think it has much to do with    or    or    or    thousand new office spaces  regardless of what the number is. So yeah  I think there is a chance to re look at how we think about cities. And in fact  there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven. KA  Which was the building just north of the Towers  DR  Right  which the towers fell into. And the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they're not re opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city. I think a public dialogue    I think  you know  I'd like to see an international competition  and a call for ideas for uses. KA  Whether it's arts  whether it's housing  whether it's what amount of shopping  DR  Right. And we're looking for other things. This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help. Including taking a small piece adjacent to the site and inviting    architects who currently don't have a voice in New York to do artist housing. And find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic  single solutions  and more about a multiplicity of things. KA  Before we end  I know you have a piece of digital video of the experience of being on this platform  DR  John Kamen    who's here  actually    put together a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use. So I thought that would be good to end with. DR  We're looking from Fulton Street  west. One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration was I had forgotten how anti graffiti he was. And essentially our structure was designed to be written on. KA  As you say  it's not a memorial. But were you conscious of memorials  The Vietnam Memorial  Those kinds of forms  DR  We certainly did as much research as we could  and we were conscious of other memorials. And also the complexity and length of time they really take to do. It's     people on the committee for Oklahoma City  which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad hoc  spontaneous solution that expanded on Union Square and the places that were ad hoc memorials in the city already. The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de mountable. What's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed  so that what you're aware of is not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero  but all of the buildings around it    and the scars on the building around it  which are enormous. This shows Saint Paul's on the left. KA  I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers for making this happen and getting this done. But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection  and its being there  almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished  is part of its extraordinary    I don't know if beauty is the word    but presence. DR  It was an honor to do. And we were thrilled to be able to show it here.,"Architect, experience designer",200706,6.080798479087449
132,1302,1304,David S. Rose 2008,David S. Rose,male,How to pitch to a VC,Sep 2008,813,Good morning. My name is David Rose. I am a serial entrepreneur turned serial investor. And by the use of pitching PowerPoints to VCs  I have personally raised tens of millions of dollars from VCs through PowerPoint pitches. And then  turning round to the other side of the equation  I have personally supervised the investment of tens of millions of dollars into companies who have been pitching me with PowerPoint presentations. So I think it's safe to say I know a little bit about the process of pitching. So  the very first question that you've all got to figure out is  what is the single most important thing that a VC is looking for when you come to them pitching your new business idea  And there are obviously all kinds of things. There are business models  and there are financials  and there are markets and there is that. Overall  of all the things that you have to do  what is the single most important thing the VC is going to be investing in  Somebody  What  David S. Rose  People  You  That's it    you are the person. And so therefore  the entire purpose of a VC pitch is to convince them that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return. Now  how do you do this  You can't just walk up and say  you know   Hi  I'm a really good guy  and a good girl  and you should really invest in me.  Right  So  in the course of your VC pitch  you have a very few minutes  and most VC pitches    most angel pitches are about    minutes  most VC pitches should be less than half an hour. People's attention span after    minutes begins to drop off  tests have shown. So in that    minutes  or    minutes  or five minutes  you have to convey a whole bunch of different characteristics. You actually have to convey about    different characteristics while you're standing up there. What's the single most important thing you've got to convey  What  DSR  Boy  oh boy  oh boy  And that's a straight line we got right over there. And I didn't even prompt him. You're right  integrity. Because that's the key thing. I would much rather invest in somebody    you know  take a chance on somebody    who I know is straight than somebody where there's any possible question of  you know  who are they looking out for  and what's going on. So the most important thing is integrity. And what's the second most important thing after integrity  Let's see if you can get this one. DSR  Close enough  Passion. Right  so here you want    entrepreneurs by definition are people who are leaving something else  starting a new world over here  creating and putting their lifeblood into this kind of thing. You've got to convey passion. If you're not passionate about your own company  why on Earth should anyone else be passionate  Why should they put more money into your company  if you're not passionate about it  So  integrity and passion  the single most important things out there. Then there are a whole panoply of other things that you've got to do  to wrap up in this package that you're presenting to a VC. Experience. You've got to be able to say   Hey  you know  I've done this before.  And  done this before  is starting an enterprise and creating value  and taking something from beginning to end. So that's why VCs love to fund serial entrepreneurs. Because even if you didn't do it right the first time  you've learned the lessons  which are going to stand you in very good stead the next time. And now along with that  along with the experience of starting an enterprise  or running something    and it doesn't have to be a business. It can be in an organization at school  it can be a not for profit. But they want experience in creating an organization. Next up is knowledge. If you're telling me you're going to be the great developer of the map of the human genome  you'd better know what a human genome is. I mean  I want you to have domain expertise. So I don't want somebody who's saying   Hey  I've got a great idea in a business I know nothing about. I don't know who the players are. I don't know what the market is like.  So you've got to know your market. You've got to know your area. And then you have to have the skills that it takes to get a company going. And those skills include everything from technical skills  if it's a technology business  to marketing  and sales  and management  and so on. But  you know  not everybody has all these skills. There are very few people who have the full set of skills that it takes to run a company. So what else do you require  Well  leadership. You've got to be able to convince us that you either have developed a team that has all those factors in it  or else you can. And you have the charisma and the management style and the ability to get people to follow your lead  to inspire them  to motivate them to be part of your team. All right  then  having done all that  what else do I want to know as a VC  I want to know that you have commitment. That you are going to be here to the end. I want you to say  or I want you to convey  that you are going to die if you have to  with your very last breath  with your fingernails scratching as they drag you out. You're going to keep my money alive and you're going to make more money out of it. So I don't want somebody who's going to cut and run at the first opportunity. Because bad things happen. There's never been an angel  or a venture funded company where bad things didn't happen. So I want to know that you're committed to be there to the very end. You've got to have vision. You've got to be able to see where this is going. I don't want another  me too  product. I want somebody who knows  who can change the world out there. But on top of that  I also need realism. Because I need to know that you know that while changing the world is great  it doesn't always happen. And before you get to change the world  bad things are going to take place. And you've got to be able to deal with that. And you have to have rational projections and stuff. And then finally  you're asking for my money  not just because it's my money  but because it's me. You need to be coachable. So I need to know that you have the ability to listen. We've had a lot of experience. People who are VCs or angels investing in you have had experience and they'd like to know that you want to hear that experience. Okay  so how do you convey all these    things in    minutes without saying any more  You can't say   Hey  I've got high integrity  invest in me   Right  You've got to do a whole pitch that conveys this without conveying it. So think about your pitch as a timeline. It starts off  you walk in the door. They know nothing at all  whatsoever  about you. And you can take them on an emotional    all pitches  or all sales presentations  are emotional at some level. You can go up  you can go down  right  And it goes from beginning to end. You walk in the door. So the first thing you've got to do    the overall  you know  arc of your presentation    it's got to start like a rocket. You've got maybe    seconds    between    and    seconds  depending on how long the pitch is    to get their attention. In my case   I've invested. I have got tens of millions of dollars from PowerPoint pitches. I have invested tens of millions of dollars.  That's it    that should get you right there. This can be a factor  and everybody can be saying it's counterintuitive. It can be a story  it can be experience. But you've got to grab their emotional attention  focused on you  within that first few seconds. And then from there  you've got to take them on a very solid  steady  upward path  right from beginning to end. And everything has got to be reinforcing this. And you've got to get better  and better  and better  and better. And it's revving up to the very end  and then at the very end you've got to    boom     knock them out of the park. You want to be able to get them to such an emotional high that they are ready to write you a check  throw money at you  right there before you leave. Okay  so how do you do that  Well  first of all  logical progression. Any time you go backwards  any time you skip a step    imagine walking up a staircase where some of the treads are missing  or the heights are different heights. You stop  you've got to figure it out. You want a nice logical progression. Start with telling them what the market is. Why are you going to do X  Y or Z. And then you've got to tell me how you're going to do it  and what it is you're going to do. How you're going to do it. And the whole    it's got to flow from beginning to end. You've also got to let me know that there are touchstones. You want to tie in to the rest of the world out there. So  for example  if you reference companies I've heard of  or basic items in your business  I want to know about them. Things that I can relate to  validators  or anything that tells me somebody else has approved this  or there's outside validation. It can be sales  it can be you've got an award for something  it can be  people have done it before  it can be your beta tests are going great. Whatever. I want to know validation  that you're telling me not just what you're telling me  but that somebody else    or something else out there    says this makes sense. And then  because I'm looking for the upside here  I've got to have believable upside. And that's two parts. It's got to be upside  and it's got to be believable. The upside means that if you're telling me that you're going to be out there  five years out  making a million dollars a year    hmm. That's not really upside. Telling me you're going to be out there making a billion dollars a year    that's not believable. So it's got to be both sides. On the other hand  there are a lot of things that drive me down  take the emotional level down  and you've got to recover from those. And those  for example  are anything you tell me that I know is not true.  We have no competition. There's nobody else who's ever made a widget like this.  Odds are I probably know somebody who has made a widget. And the minute you tell me that    boom  You know  I discount half of what you're saying from then on. Anything that makes me think. Anything that I don't understand  where I have to make the leap myself  in my own head  is going to stop the flow of the presentation. So  you've got to take me through like a sixth grader    dub  dub  dub  dub  dub    but without patronizing me. And it's a very tricky path to do it. But if you can do it  it works really  really well. Anything that's inconsistent within the concept of your thing. If you tell me sales of X  Y or Z are    million dollars  and the next slide  or five slides later  they're five million dollars. Well  one may have been gross sales  one may have been net sales  but I want to know that all the numbers make sense together. And then finally  anything that's an error  or a typo  or a stupid mistake  or a line that's in the wrong place. That shows me that    if you can't even do a presentation  how the heck can you run a company  So this all feeds in together. All right  so the best way to do this stuff is to look at our betters  look at people who have done this before. So let's look at the most successful technology executive in the business and see how a presentation goes. Bill Gates' PowerPoint presentation over here. Here's Gates doing a thing for Windows. Is this the way you should do a PowerPoint presentation  What do you think  No. Who do you think we should look at as our role model  Oh  isn't that funny  There's another great one over here. Yes  OK  Steve Jobs. You want absolute    this is the Zen of presentation  right  Here he is. One little guy  black jeans and stuff  on a totally empty stage. What are you focusing on  You're focusing on him  This is Steve Jobs. So  you know  our great    these wonderful long bullet points  a whole list of things  you know    good  No  they're not. The long bullet points are bad. What's good  Short  short bullet points. But you know what  Even better than short bullet points are no bullet points. Just give me the headline over here. And you know what  How many bullet points or headlines does Steve Jobs use  Basically none. What do you do  Best of all  images. Just a simple image. I looked at the image    a picture's worth a thousand words. You look at the image and you see that  and you drop the whole thing. And then  you come back to me. And you're focused on me and why I'm such a great guy  and why you want to invest in me. And why this whole thing makes sense. So with that said  we only have a very  very short time. So let's run through the things you've got to include in your presentation. Well  first of all  start out. None of these big  long titled slides with blah  blah  blah  blah  blah  blah and I'm presenting to so and so  such and such a date. I know the day  I know who I am  I know you're presenting. I don't need all that. Just give me your company logo. I look at the logo  and it sort of ties it to my brain. And then I come back to you. I'm focused on you  OK  You do that  you give me your quick    second or    second intro  grab my attention. And then you want to give me a quick business overview. This is not a five minute pitch. This is  you know  two sentences.  We build widgets for the X  Y  Z market.  Or   We sell services to help somebody do X.  You know  whatever. And that is like the picture on the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box. That lets me know the context. It gives me the armature for the whole thing you're going to be going through. And it lets me put everything else in relation to something you've already told me. So there you go    walk me through  show me who your management team is. It's helpful that you've had experience and you've done this kind of thing before. And I want to know the market    the size of the market. Why is this market worth getting at over here  I want to know your product  and that's very important. Now  this is not a product pitch  not a sales pitch. I don't want to know all the ins and outs  and the gazuntas and the yaddas and stuff. I just want to know    what the heck is it  If it's a website  show me a screenshot of your website. You know  don't do a live demo. No  never do a live demo. Do a canned demo  or do something that lets me know why people are going to buy whatever it is. Then I want to know    now that I know what you're selling  tell me how you make money on it. For every X you sell  you get Y  you do your services of Z. I want to know what the business model is on a sort of per unit basis  or for the actual product that you're selling. I want to know who you're selling this thing to  in terms of customers. And I want to know if you have any relationships that are going to be special to help you. Whether you have a distribution relationship with somebody  you know  you have a producing partner. Or  you know  again  validation. This helps to say you're bigger than just one little thing over here. But then  everybody has competition. There has never been a company that doesn't have competition. Even if the competition is the old way of doing something. I want to know exactly what your competition is  and then that will help me judge how you fit into the whole operation over here. But then  I want to know how you're special. If I know what your competition does  how are you going to prevent your competition from eating your lunch over here  And then all this ties into the financial overview. And you have to have    you can't do a VC pitch without giving me your financials. I want to know three and  you know  a year or two back  or as long as you've been in existence. And I want to know three or four or five years forward. Five is a bit much. Probably four is rational. And I want to know how that business model that you showed me on a product basis is going to translate into a company model. And  you know  how many widgets are you going to sell  You're making X amount per widget. I want to know what the driver is. We're going to have       customers this year  and        next year. And our revenues are going to go this  that and the other thing. And so that gives me the whole picture for the next several years into which I'm investing. And I want to know how the money you're going to get from me is going to help you get there. You're going to open an offshore plant in China  you're going to spend it all on sales and marketing  you're going to go to Tahiti  or whatever out there. But then comes the ask. This is where you tell me how much you actually want to get. You're looking for   million    at what kind of valuation  Two million at        . What's the money in so far  Who invested  I hope you invested personally. Because I'm following on. If you can't invest in your own thing  why should I invest in it  So I like to know if you have friends and family  or angel investors in there  or you've had more VCs before. What's the capital structure up until this point  And then finally  having done all that  you've now told me the whole thing  so now you've got to bring it back to that conclusion. This is that rocket going up. So hopefully everything has been positive  positive  positive  more positive. And everything  everything you say clicks with me  and it all makes sense. And I'm thinking   This is really  really great.  And then you take me back to your logo. Just your logo on the screen. And I look at the logo    okay  good. Now I come back to you. Nothing else to look at  right  And now  you've got to wrap it up and tie it up here. You've got to give me the final  you know    boom     the final pitch that's going to send me into space. Now  in the process of doing this over here  how do you remember the sequences and doers  You've noticed here that I'm not looking at the screen  right  The screen is  actually  in this room  is set up so it's in front of me. So  I couldn't even see if I wanted to. So now  how do I know what's going on here  Well  I've got a laptop in front of me  but you're looking at me. And you're looking at this. What do you think I'm looking at  You think that I'm looking at that  No  I'm looking actually at a special version of PowerPoint over here  which shows me the slides ahead  the slides behind  my notes from here  so I can see what's going on. PowerPoint has this built into every copy of PowerPoint that's shipped. If you use Apple's Keynote  it's got an even better version in Keynote. And then there's another program  called Ovation  you can get from Adobe  that they just bought last summer. Which actually helps you run the whole timers  and it lets you figure out what's going on. So  here's my wrap up to take you to the moon  right  David's    I usually do a top     we don't have time for top   s. So David's top five presentation tips. Number one  always use presenter mode  or Ovation  or presenter tools  because it lets you know exactly where you're going. It helps you pace yourself  it gives you a timer so we end on time and the whole bit. Number four  always use remote control. Have you seen me touch the computer  No  you haven't. Why not  Because I'm using remote control over here. Always use remote control. Number three  the handouts you give are not your presentation. If you follow my suggestions  you're going to have a very spare  very Zen like presentation  which is great for conveying who you are and getting people emotionally involved. But it's not really good as a handout. You want to have a handout that gives a lot more information  because the handout has to stand without you over here. Number three  don't read your speech. Can you imagine   Well  you should invest in my company because it's really good.  It doesn't work  right  Don't read your speech. And the number one presentation tip  never  ever look at the screen. You're making a connection with your audience over here  and you always want to do a one on one connection. The screen should come up visually behind you  and supplement what you're doing instead of replace you. And that is how to pitch to a VC.,Angel Investor,200809,6.153449048152297
135,1321,1323,Dean Ornish 2008,Dean Ornish,male,Healing through diet,Oct 2008,966,This session is on natural wonders  and the bigger conference is on the pursuit of happiness. I want to try to combine them all  because to me  healing is really the ultimate natural wonder. Your body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing itself  and much more quickly than people had once realized  if you simply stop doing what s causing the problem. And so  really  so much of what we do in medicine and life in general is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet. I love doing this work  because it really gives many people new hope and new choices that they didn t have before  and it allows us to talk about things that    not just diet  but that happiness is not    we're talking about the pursuit of happiness  but when you really look at all the spiritual traditions  what Aldous Huxley called the  perennial wisdom   when you get past the named and forms and rituals that really divide people  it s really about    our nature is to be happy  our nature is to be peaceful  our nature is to be healthy. And so it s not something    happiness is not something you get  health is generally not something that you get. But rather all of these different practices    you know  the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns didn t develop these techniques to just manage stress or lower your blood pressure  unclog your arteries  even though it can do all those things. They re powerful tools for transformation  for quieting down our mind and bodies to allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy  to be peaceful  to be joyful and to realize that it s not something that you pursue and get  but rather it s something that you have already until you disturb it. I studied yoga for many years with a teacher named Swami Satchidananda and people would say   What are you  a Hindu   He d say   No  I m an undo.  And it s really about identifying what s causing us to disturb our innate health and happiness  and then to allow that natural healing to occur. To me  that s the real natural wonder. So  within that larger context  we can talk about diet  stress management    which are really these spiritual practices    moderate exercise  smoking cessation  support groups and community    which I ll talk more about    and some vitamins and supplements. And it s not a diet. You know  when most people think about the diet I recommend  they think it s a really strict diet. For reversing disease  that s what it takes  but if you re just trying to be healthy  you have a spectrum of choices. And to the degree that you can move in a healthy direction  you re going to live longer  you re going to feel better  you re going to lose weight  and so on. And in our studies  what we ve been able to do is to use very expensive  high tech  state of the art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low tech and low cost    and in many ways  ancient    interventions  can be. We first began by looking at heart disease  and when I began doing this work    or    years ago  it was thought that once you have heart disease it can only get worse. And what we found was that  instead of getting worse and worse  in many cases it could get better and better  and much more quickly than people had once realized. This is a representative patient who at the time was       totally needed to have a bypass  decided to do this instead. We used quantitative arteriography  showing the narrowing. This is one of the arteries that feed the heart  one of the main arteries  and you can see the narrowing here. A year later  it s not as clogged  normally  it goes the other direction. These minor changes in blockages caused a     percent improvement in blood flow  and using cardiac positron emission tomography  or  PET   scans  blue and black is no blood flow  orange and white is maximal. Huge differences can occur without drugs  without surgery. Clinically  he literally couldn t walk across the street without getting severe chest pain  within a month  like most people  was pain free  and within a year  climbing more than     floors a day on a Stairmaster. This is not unusual  and it s part of what enables people to maintain these kinds of changes  because it makes such a big difference in their quality of life. Overall  if you looked at all the arteries in all the patients  they got worse and worse  from one year to five years  in the comparison group. This is the natural history of heart disease  but it s really not natural because we found it could get better and better  and much more quickly than people had once thought. We also found that the more people change  the better they got. It wasn t a function of how old or how sick they were    it was mainly how much they changed  and the oldest patients improved as much as the young ones. I got this as a Christmas card a few years ago from two of the patients in one of our programs. The younger brother is     the older one s     they wanted to show me how much more flexible they were. And the following year they sent me this one  which I thought was kind of funny. You just never know. And what we found was that    percent of the patients start to reverse the progression of their heart disease. Now I thought  you know  if we just did good science  that would change medical practice. But  that was a little naive. It s important  but not enough. Because we doctors do what we get paid to do  and we get trained to do what we get paid to do  so if we change insurance  then we change medical practice and medical education. Insurance will cover the bypass  it ll cover the angioplasty  it won t  until recently  cover diet and lifestyle. So  we began through our nonprofit institute's training hospitals around the country  and we found that most people could avoid surgery  and not only was it medically effective  it was also cost effective. And the insurance companies found that they began to save almost        dollars per patient  and Medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project where they re paying for       people to go through the program on the sites that we train. The fortuneteller says   I give smokers a discount because there s not as much to tell.   Laughter  I like this slide  because it s a chance to talk about what really motivates people to change  and what doesn t. And what doesn t work is fear of dying  and that s what s normally used. Everybody who smokes knows it s not good for you  and still    percent of Americans smoke       percent in some parts of the world. Why do people do it  Well  because it helps them get through the day. And I ll talk more about this  but the real epidemic isn t just heart disease or obesity or smoking    it s loneliness and depression. As one woman said   I ve got    friends in this package of cigarettes  and they re always there for me and nobody else is. You re going to take away my    friends  What are you going to give me   Or they eat when they get depressed  or they use alcohol to numb the pain  or they work too hard  or watch too much TV. There are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain  but the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem. And the pain is not the problem  it s the symptom. And telling people they re going to die is too scary to think about  or  they re going to get emphysema or heart attack is too scary  and so they don t want to think about it  so they don t. The most effective anti smoking ad was this one. You ll notice the limp cigarette hanging out of his mouth  and  impotence     the headline is   Impotent     it s not emphysema. What was the biggest selling drug of all time when it was introduced a few years ago  Viagra  right  Why  Because a lot of guys need it. It s not like you say   Hey Joe  I m having erectile dysfunction  how about you   And yet  look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold. It s not so much psychological  it s vascular  and nicotine makes your arteries constrict. So does cocaine  so does a high fat diet  so does emotional stress. So the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture are the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired  lethargic  depressed and impotent  and that s not much fun. But when you change those behaviors  your brain gets more blood  you think more clearly  you have more energy  your heart gets more blood in ways I ve shown you. Your sexual function improves. And these things occur within hours. This is a study  a high fat meal  and within one or two hours blood flow is measurably less    and you ve all experienced this at Thanksgiving. When you eat a big fatty meal  how do you feel  You feel kind of sleepy afterwards. On a low fat meal  the blood flow doesn t go down    it even goes up. Many of you have kids  and you know that s a big change in your lifestyle  and so people are not afraid to make big changes in lifestyle if they re worth it. And the paradox is that when you make big changes  you get big benefits  and you feel so much better so quickly. For many people  those are choices worth making    not to live longer  but to live better. I want to talk a little bit about the obesity epidemic  because it really is a problem. Two thirds of adults are overweight or obese  and diabetes in kids and    year olds has increased    percent in the last    years. It s no joke  it s real. And just to show you this  this is from the CDC. These are not election returns  these are the percentage of people who are overweight. And if you see from '   to '   to '    '    '    '    '      you get a new category     to    percent  '    '    '    '    '    '      you get a new category  '    '          and     . Mississippi  more than    percent of people are overweight. Why is this  Well  this is one way to lose weight that works very well ... but it doesn t last  which is the problem. Now  there s no mystery in how you lose weight  you either burn more calories by exercise or you eat fewer calories. Now  one way to eat fewer calories is to eat less food  which is why you can lose weight on any diet if you eat less food  or if you restrict entire categories of foods. But the problem is  you get hungry  so it s hard to keep it off. The other way is to change the type of food. And fat has nine calories per gram  whereas protein and carbs only have four. So  when you eat less fat  you eat fewer calories without having to eat less food. So you can eat the same amount of food  but you ll be getting fewer calories because the food is less dense in calories. And it s the volume of food that affects satiety  rather than the type of food. You know  I don t like talking about the Atkins diet  but I get asked about it every day  and so I just thought I d spend a few minutes on that. The myth that you hear about is  Americans have been told to eat less fat  the percent of calories from fat is down  Americans are fatter than ever  therefore fat doesn t make you fat. It s a half truth. Actually  Americans are eating more fat than ever  and even more carbs. And so the percentage is lower  the actual amount is higher  and so the goal is to reduce both. Dr. Atkins and I debated each other many times before he died  and we agreed that Americans eat too many simple carbs  the  bad carbs   and these are things like       sugar  white flour  white rice  alcohol. And you get a double whammy  you get all these calories that don t fill you up because you ve removed the fiber  and they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up. Your pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down  which is good. But insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat. So  the goal is not to go to pork rinds and bacon and sausages    these are not health foods    but to go from  bad carbs  to what are called  good carbs.  And these are things like whole foods  or unrefined carbs  fruits  vegetables  whole wheat flour  brown rice  in their natural forms  are rich in fiber. And the fiber fills you up before you get too many calories  and it slows the absorption so you don t get that rapid rise in blood sugar. So  and you get all the disease protective substances. It s not just what you exclude from your diet  but also what you include that s protective. Just as all carbs are not bad for you  all fats are not bad for you. There are good fats. And these are predominantly what are called the Omega   fatty acids. You find these  for example  in fish oil. And the bad fats are things like trans fatty acids and processed food and saturated fats  which we find in meat. If you don t remember anything else from this talk  three grams a day of fish oil can reduce your risk of a heart attack and sudden death by    to    percent. Three grams a day. They come in one gram capsules  more than that just gives you extra fat you don t need. It also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers like breast  prostate and colon cancer. Now  the problem with the Atkins diet  everybody knows people who have lost weight on it  but you can lose weight on amphetamines  you know  and fen phen. I mean  there are lots of ways of losing weight that aren t good for you. You want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health rather than the one that harms it. And the problem is that it s based on this half truth  which is that Americans eat too many simple carbs  so if you eat fewer simple carbs you re going to lose weight. You ll lose even more weight if you go to whole foods and less fat  and you ll enhance your health rather than harming it. He says   I ve got some good news. While your cholesterol level has remained the same  the research findings have changed.  Now  what happens to your heart when you go on an Atkins diet  The red is good at the beginning  and a year later    this is from a study done in a peer reviewed journal called Angiology    there s more red after a year on a diet like I would recommend  there s less red  less blood flow after a year on an Atkins type diet. So  yes  you can lose weight  but your heart isn t happy. Now  one of the studies funded by the Atkins Center found that    percent of the people were constipated     percent had bad breath     percent had headaches   this is not a healthy way to eat. And so  you might start to lose weight and start to attract people towards you  but when they get too close it s going to be a problem. And more seriously  there are case reports now of    year old girls who died after a few weeks on the Atkins diet    of bone disease  kidney disease  and so on. And that s how your body excretes waste  is through your breath  your bowels and your perspiration. So when you go on these kinds of diet  they begin to smell bad. So  an optimal diet is low in fat  low in the bad carbs  high in the good carbs and enough of the good fats. And then  again  it s a spectrum  when you move in this direction  you re going to lose weight  you re going to feel better and you re going to gain health. Now  there are ecological reasons for eating lower on the food chain too  whether it s the deforestation of the Amazon  or making more protein available  to the four billion people who live on a dollar a day    not to mention whatever ethical concerns people have. So  there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health. Now  we re about to publish the first study looking at the effects of this program on prostate cancer  and  in collaboration with Sloane Kettering and with UCSF. We took    men who had biopsy proven prostate cancer and who had elected  for reasons unrelated to the study  not to have surgery. We could randomly divide them into two groups  and then we could have one group that is a non intervention control group to compare to  which we can t do with  say  breast cancer  because everyone gets treated. What we found was that  after a year  none of the experimental group patients who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment  whereas six of the control group patients needed surgery or radiation. When we looked at their PSA levels    which is a marker for prostate cancer    they got worse in the control group  but they actually got better in the experimental group  and these differences were highly significant. And then I wondered  was there any relationship between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle    whichever group they were in    and the changes in PSA  And sure enough  we found a dose response relationship  just like we found in the arterial blockages in our cardiac studies. And in order for the PSA to go down  they had to make pretty big changes. I then wondered  well  maybe they re just changing their PSA  but it s not really affecting the tumor growth. So we took some of their blood serum and sent it down to UCLA  they added it to a standard line of prostate tumor cells growing in tissue culture  and it inhibited the growth seven times more in the experimental group than in the control group       versus   percent. And finally  I said  I wonder if there s any relationship between how much people change and how it inhibited their tumor growth  whichever group they happened to be in. And this really got me excited because again  we found the same pattern  the more people change  the more it affected the growth of their tumors. And finally  we did MRI and MR spectroscopy scans on some of these patients  and the tumor activity is shown in red in this patient  and you can see clearly it s better a year later  along with the PSA going down. So  if it s true for prostate cancer  it ll almost certainly be true for breast cancer as well. And whether or not you have conventional treatment  in addition  if you make these changes  it may help reduce the risk of recurrence. The last thing I want to talk about  apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness  is that study after study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed    and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture    are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely  in part because  as we talked about  they re more likely to smoke and overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on. But also  through mechanisms that we don t fully understand  people who are lonely and depressed are many times    three to five to ten times  in some studies    more likely to get sick and die prematurely. And depression is treatable. We need to do something about that. Now  on the other hand  anything that promotes intimacy is healing. It can be sexual intimacy   I happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing. Friendship  altruism  compassion  service   all the perennial truths that we talked about that are part of all religion and all cultures    once you stop trying to see the differences  these are the things in our own self interest  because they free us from our suffering and from disease. And it s in a sense the most selfish thing that we can do. Just take a look at one study. This was done by David Spiegel at Stanford. He took women with metastatic breast cancer  randomly divided them into two groups. One group of people just met for an hour and a half once a week in a support group. It was a nurturing  loving environment  where they were encouraged to let down their emotional defenses and talk about how awful it is to have breast cancer with people who understood  because they were going through it too. They just met once a week for a year. Five years later  those women lived twice as long  and you can see that the people    and that was the only difference between the groups. It was a randomized control study published in The Lancet. Other studies have shown this as well. So  these simple things that create intimacy are really healing  and even the word healing  it comes from the root  to make whole.  The word yoga comes from the Sanskrit  meaning  union  to yoke  to bring together.  And the last slide I want to show you is from    I was    again  this swami that I studied with for so many years  and I did a combined oncology and cardiology Grand Rounds at the University of Virginia medical school a couple of years ago. And at the end of it  somebody said   Hey  Swami  what s the difference between wellness and illness   And so he went up on the board and he wrote the word  illness   and circled the first letter  and then wrote the word  wellness   and circled the first two letters ... To me  it s just shorthand for what we re talking about  that anything that creates a sense of connection and community and love is really healing. And then we can enjoy our lives more fully without getting sick in the process. Thank you.  Applause ,"Physician, author",200810,5.720152905198782
136,1496,1498,Dean Ornish 2006,Dean Ornish,male,The killer American diet that's sweeping the planet,Dec 2006,182,With all the legitimate concerns about AIDS and avian flu    and we'll hear about that from the brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today    I want to talk about the other pandemic  which is cardiovascular disease  diabetes  hypertension    all of which are completely preventable for at least    percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle. And what's happening is that there's a globalization of illness occurring  that people are starting to eat like us  and live like us  and die like us. And in one generation  for example  Asia's gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest. And in Africa  cardiovascular disease equals the HIV and AIDS deaths in most countries. So there's a critical window of opportunity we have to make an important difference that can affect the lives of literally millions of people  and practice preventive medicine on a global scale. Heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people    not only in this country  but also worldwide    than everything else combined  and yet it's completely preventable for almost everybody. It's not only preventable  it's actually reversible. And for the last almost    years  we've been able to show that by simply changing diet and lifestyle  using these very high tech  expensive  state of the art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low tech and low cost interventions can be like    quantitative arteriography  before and after a year  and cardiac PET scans. We showed a few months ago    we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle  and    percent regression in the tumor growth  or inhibition of the tumor growth  compared to only nine percent in the control group. And in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here  the prostate tumor activity is shown in red    you can see it diminishing after a year. Now there is an epidemic of obesity  two thirds of adults and    percent of kids. What's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased    percent in the past    years  and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do. That's pitiful  and it's preventable. Now these are not election returns  these are the people    the number of the people who are obese by state  beginning in '    '    '      these are from the CDC website    '    '    '    '      you get a new category    '    '    '    '    '    '    '    '                  it gets worse. We're kind of devolving.  Laughter  Now what can we do about this  Well  you know  the diet that we've found that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an Asian diet. But the people in Asia are starting to eat like we are  which is why they're starting to get sick like we are. So I've been working with a lot of the big food companies. They can make it fun and sexy and hip and crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods  like    I chair the advisory boards to McDonald's  and PepsiCo  and ConAgra  and Safeway  and soon Del Monte  and they're finding that it's good business. The salads that you see at McDonald's came from the work    they're going to have an Asian salad. At Pepsi  two thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods. And so if we can do that  then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for preventing avian flu.

145,493,495,"Diana Reiss, Peter Gabriel, Neil Gershenfeld and Vint Cerf 2013","Diana Reiss, Peter Gabriel, Neil Gershenfeld and Vint Cerf",both,The interspecies internet? An idea in progress,Jul 2013,11,Diana Reiss  You may think you're looking through a window at a dolphin spinning playfully  but what you're actually looking through is a two way mirror at a dolphin looking at itself spinning playfully. This is a dolphin that is self aware. This dolphin has self awareness. It's a young dolphin named Bayley. I've been very interested in understanding the nature of the intelligence of dolphins for the past    years. How do we explore intelligence in this animal that's so different from us  And what I've used is a very simple research tool  a mirror  and we've gained great information  reflections of these animal minds. Dolphins aren't the only animals  the only non human animals  to show mirror self recognition. We used to think this was a uniquely human ability  but we learned that the great apes  our closest relatives  also show this ability. Then we showed it in dolphins  and then later in elephants. We did this work in my lab with the dolphins and elephants  and it's been recently shown in the magpie. Now  it's interesting  because we've embraced this Darwinian view of a continuity in physical evolution  this physical continuity. But we've been much more reticent  much slower at recognizing this continuity in cognition  in emotion  in consciousness in other animals. Other animals are conscious. They're emotional. They're aware. There have been multitudes of studies with many species over the years that have given us exquisite evidence for thinking and consciousness in other animals  other animals that are quite different than we are in form. We are not alone. We are not alone in these abilities. And I hope  and one of my biggest dreams  is that  with our growing awareness about the consciousness of others and our relationship with the rest of the animal world  that we'll give them the respect and protection that they deserve. So that's a wish I'm throwing out here for everybody  and I hope I can really engage you in this idea. Now  I want to return to dolphins  because these are the animals that I feel like I've been working up closely and personal with for over    years. And these are real personalities. They are not persons  but they're personalities in every sense of the word. And you can't get more alien than the dolphin. They are very different from us in body form. They're radically different. They come from a radically different environment. In fact  we're separated by    million years of divergent evolution. Look at this body. And in every sense of making a pun here  these are true non terrestrials. I wondered how we might interface with these animals. In the     s  I developed an underwater keyboard. This was a custom made touch screen keyboard. What I wanted to do was give the dolphins choice and control. These are big brains  highly social animals  and I thought  well  if we give them choice and control  if they can hit a symbol on this keyboard    and by the way  it was interfaced by fiber optic cables from Hewlett Packard with an Apple II computer. This seems prehistoric now  but this was where we were with technology. So the dolphins could hit a key  a symbol  they heard a computer generated whistle  and they got an object or activity. Now here's a little video. This is Delphi and Pan  and you're going to see Delphi hitting a key  he hears a computer generated whistle     Whistle     and gets a ball  so they can actually ask for things they want. What was remarkable is  they explored this keyboard on their own. There was no intervention on our part. They explored the keyboard. They played around with it. They figured out how it worked. And they started to quickly imitate the sounds they were hearing on the keyboard. They imitated on their own. Beyond that  though  they started learning associations between the symbols  the sounds and the objects. What we saw was self organized learning  and now I'm imagining  what can we do with new technologies  How can we create interfaces  new windows into the minds of animals  with the technologies that exist today  So I was thinking about this  and then  one day  I got a call from Peter. Peter Gabriel  I make noises for a living. On a good day  it's music  and I want to talk a little bit about the most amazing music making experience I ever had. I'm a farm boy. I grew up surrounded by animals  and I would look in these eyes and wonder what was going on there  So as an adult  when I started to read about the amazing breakthroughs with Penny Patterson and Koko  with Sue Savage Rumbaugh and Kanzi  Panbanisha  Irene Pepperberg  Alex the parrot  I got all excited. What was amazing to me also was they seemed a lot more adept at getting a handle on our language than we were on getting a handle on theirs. I work with a lot of musicians from around the world  and often we don't have any common language at all  but we sit down behind our instruments  and suddenly there's a way for us to connect and emote. So I started cold calling  and eventually got through to Sue Savage Rumbaugh  and she invited me down. I went down  and the bonobos had had access to percussion instruments  musical toys  but never before to a keyboard. At first they did what infants do  just bashed it with their fists  and then I asked  through Sue  if Panbanisha could try with one finger only. Sue Savage Rumbaugh  Can you play a grooming song  I want to hear a grooming song. Play a real quiet grooming song. PG  So groom was the subject of the piece. So I'm just behind  jamming  yeah  this is what we started with. Sue's encouraging her to continue a little more. She discovers a note she likes  finds the octave. She'd never sat at a keyboard before. Nice triplets. SSR  You did good. That was very good. PG  She hit good. So that night  we began to dream  and we thought  perhaps the most amazing tool that man's created is the Internet  and what would happen if we could somehow find new interfaces  visual audio interfaces that would allow these remarkable sentient beings that we share the planet with access  And Sue Savage Rumbaugh got excited about that  called her friend Steve Woodruff  and we began hustling all sorts of people whose work related or was inspiring  which led us to Diana  and led us to Neil. Neil Gershenfeld  Thanks  Peter. PG  Thank you. NG  So Peter approached me. I lost it when I saw that clip. He approached me with a vision of doing these things not for people  for animals. And then I was struck in the history of the Internet. This is what the Internet looked like when it was born and you can call that the Internet of middle aged white men  mostly middle aged white men. Vint Cerf   Laughs  NG  Speaking as one. Then  when I first came to TED  which was where I met Peter  I showed this. This is a    web server  and at the time that was radical. And the possibility of making a web server for a dollar grew into what became known as the Internet of Things  which is literally an industry now with tremendous implications for health care  energy efficiency. And we were happy with ourselves. And then when Peter showed me that  I realized we had missed something  which is the rest of the planet. So we started up this interspecies Internet project. Now we started talking with TED about how you bring dolphins and great apes and elephants to TED  and we realized that wouldn't work. So we're going to bring you to them. So if we could switch to the audio from this computer  we've been video conferencing with cognitive animals  and we're going to have each of them just briefly introduce them. And so if we could also have this up  great. So the first site we're going to meet is Cameron Park Zoo in Waco  with orangutans. In the daytime they live outside. It's nighttime there now. So can you please go ahead  Terri Cox  Hi  I'm Terri Cox with the Cameron Park Zoo in Waco  Texas  and with me I have KeraJaan and Mei  two of our Bornean orangutans. During the day  they have a beautiful  large outdoor habitat  and at night  they come into this habitat  into their night quarters  where they can have a climate controlled and secure environment to sleep in. We participate in the Apps for Apes program Orangutan Outreach  and we use iPads to help stimulate and enrich the animals  and also help raise awareness for these critically endangered animals. And they share    percent of our DNA and are incredibly intelligent  so it's so exciting to think of all the opportunities that we have via technology and the Internet to really enrich their lives and open up their world. We're really excited about the possibility of an interspecies Internet  and K.J. has been enjoying the conference very much. NG  That's great. When we were rehearsing last night  he had fun watching the elephants. Next user group are the dolphins at the National Aquarium. Please go ahead. Allison Ginsburg  Good evening. Well  my name is Allison Ginsburg  and we're live in Baltimore at the National Aquarium. Joining me are three of our eight Atlantic bottlenose dolphins     year old Chesapeake  who was our first dolphin born here  her four year old daughter Bayley  and her half sister     year old Maya. Now  here at the National Aquarium we are committed to excellence in animal care  to research  and to conservation. The dolphins are pretty intrigued as to what's going on here tonight. They're not really used to having cameras here at   o'clock at night. In addition  we are very committed to doing different types of research. As Diana mentioned  our animals are involved in many different research studies. NG  Those are for you. Okay  that's great  thank you. And the third user group  in Thailand  is Think Elephants. Go ahead  Josh. Josh Plotnik  Hi  my name is Josh Plotnik  and I'm with Think Elephants International  and we're here in the Golden Triangle of Thailand with the Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation elephants. And we have    elephants here  and our research is focused on the evolution of intelligence with elephants  but our foundation Think Elephants is focused on bringing elephants into classrooms around the world virtually like this and showing people how incredible these animals are. So we're able to bring the camera right up to the elephant  put food into the elephant's mouth  show people what's going on inside their mouths  and show everyone around the world how incredible these animals really are. NG  Okay  that's great. Thanks Josh. And once again  we've been building great relationships among them just since we've been rehearsing. So at that point  if we can go back to the other computer  we were starting to think about how you integrate the rest of the biomass of the planet into the Internet  and we went to the best possible person I can think of  which is Vint Cerf  who is one of the founders who gave us the Internet. Vint  VC  Thank you  Neil. A long time ago in a galaxy   oops  wrong script. Forty years ago  Bob Kahn and I did the design of the Internet. Thirty years ago  we turned it on. Just last year  we turned on the production Internet. You've been using the experimental version for the last    years. The production version  it uses IP version  . It has  .  times    to the   th possible terminations. That's a number only that Congress can appreciate. But it leads to what is coming next. When Bob and I did this design  we thought we were building a system to connect computers together. What we very quickly discovered is that this was a system for connecting people together. And what you've seen tonight tells you that we should not restrict this network to one species  that these other intelligent  sentient species should be part of the system too. This is the system as it looks today  by the way. This is what the Internet looks like to a computer that's trying to figure out where the traffic is supposed to go. This is generated by a program that's looking at the connectivity of the Internet  and how all the various networks are connected together. There are about         networks  interconnected  run independently by         different operating agencies  and the only reason this works is that they all use the same standard TCP IP protocols. Well  you know where this is headed. The Internet of Things tell us that a lot of computer enabled appliances and devices are going to become part of this system too  appliances that you use around the house  that you use in your office  that you carry around with yourself or in the car. That's the Internet of Things that's coming. Now  what's important about what these people are doing is that they're beginning to learn how to communicate with species that are not us but share a common sensory environment. We're beginning to explore what it means to communicate with something that isn't just another person. Well  you can see what's coming next. All kinds of possible sentient beings may be interconnected through this system  and I can't wait to see these experiments unfold. What happens after that  Well  let's see. There are machines that need to talk to machines and that we need to talk to  and so as time goes on  we're going to have to learn how to communicate with computers and how to get computers to communicate with us in the way that we're accustomed to  not with keyboards  not with mice  but with speech and gestures and all the natural human language that we're accustomed to. So we'll need something like C PO to become a translator between ourselves and some of the other machines we live with. Now  there is a project that's underway called the interplanetary Internet. It's in operation between Earth and Mars. It's operating on the International Space Station. It's part of the spacecraft that's in orbit around the Sun that's rendezvoused with two planets. So the interplanetary system is on its way  but there's a last project  which the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  which funded the original ARPANET  funded the Internet  funded the interplanetary architecture  is now funding a project to design a spacecraft to get to the nearest star in     years' time. What that means is that what we're learning with these interactions with other species will teach us  ultimately  how we might interact with an alien from another world. I can hardly wait. June Cohen  So first of all  thank you  and I would like to acknowledge that four people who could talk to us for full four days actually managed to stay to four minutes each  and we thank you for that. I have so many questions  but maybe a few practical things that the audience might want to know. You're launching this idea here at TED   PG  Today. JC  Today. This is the first time you're talking about it. Tell me a little bit about where you're going to take the idea. What's next  PG  I think we want to engage as many people here as possible in helping us think of smart interfaces that will make all this possible. NG  And just mechanically  there's a     c     and web infrastructure and all of that  but it's not quite ready to turn on  so we'll roll that out  and contact us if you want the information on it. The idea is this will be    much like the Internet functions as a network of networks  which is Vint's core contribution  this will be a wrapper around all of these initiatives  that are wonderful individually  to link them globally. JC  Right  and do you have a web address that we might look for yet  NG  Shortly. JC  Shortly. We will come back to you on that. And very quickly  just to clarify. Some people might have looked at the video that you showed and thought  well  that's just a webcam. What's special about it  If you could talk for just a moment about how you want to go past that  NG  So this is scalable video infrastructure  not for a few to a few but many to many  so that it scales to symmetrical video sharing and content sharing across these sites around the planet. So there's a lot of back end signal processing  not for one to many  but for many to many. JC  Right  and then on a practical level  which technologies are you looking at first  I know you mentioned that a keyboard is a really key part of this. DR  We're trying to develop an interactive touch screen for dolphins. This is sort of a continuation of some of the earlier work  and we just got our first seed money today towards that  so it's our first project. JC  Before the talk  even. DR  Yeah. JC  Wow. Well done. All right  well thank you all so much for joining us. It's such a delight to have you on the stage. DR  Thank you. VC  Thank you.,,201307,6.376068027210884
147,600,602,Diébédo Francis Kéré 2013,Diébédo Francis Kéré,male,How to build with clay ... and community,Dec 2013,717,I would like to show you how architecture has helped to change the life of my community and has opened opportunities to hope. I am a native of Burkina Faso. According to the World Bank  Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world  but what does it look like to grow up in a place like that  I am an example of that. I was born in a little village called Gando. In Gando  there was no electricity  no access to clean drinking water  and no school. But my father wanted me to learn how to read and write. For this reason  I had to leave my family when I was seven and to stay in a city far away from my village with no contact with my family. In this place I sat in a class like that with more than     other kids  and for six years. In this time  it just happened to me to come to school to realize that my classmate died. Today  not so much has changed. There is still no electricity in my village. People still are dying in Burkina Faso  and access to clean drinking water is still a big problem. I had luck. I was lucky  because this is a fact of life when you grow up in a place like that. But I was lucky. I had a scholarship. I could go to Germany to study. So now  I suppose  I don't need to explain to you how great a privilege it is for me to be standing before you today. From Gando  my home village in Burkina Faso  to Berlin in Germany to become an architect is a big  big step. But what to do with this privilege  Since I was a student  I wanted to open up better opportunities to other kids in Gando. I just wanted to use my skills and build a school. But how do you do it when you're still a student and you don't have money  Oh yes  I started to make drawings and asked for money. Fundraising was not an easy task. I even asked my classmates to spend less money on coffee and cigarettes  but to sponsor my school project. In real wonder  two years later  I was able to collect        U.S. dollars. When I came home to Gando to bring the good news  my people were over the moon  but when they realized that I was planning to use clay  they were shocked.  A clay building is not able to stand a rainy season  and Francis wants us to use it and build a school. Is this the reason why he spent so much time in Europe studying instead of working in the field with us   My people build all the time with clay  but they don't see any innovation with mud. So I had to convince everybody. I started to speak with the community  and I could convince everybody  and we could start to work. And the women  the men  everybody from the village  was part of this building process. I was allowed to use even traditional techniques. So clay floor for example  the young men come and stand like that  beating  hours for hours  and then their mothers came  and they are beating in this position  for hours  giving water and beating. And then the polishers come. They start polishing it with a stone for hours. And then you have this result  very fine  like a baby bottom. It's not photoshopped.  Laughter  This is the school  built with the community. The walls are totally made out of compressed clay blocks from Gando. The roof structure is made with cheap steel bars normally hiding inside concrete. And the classroom  the ceiling is made out of both of them used together. In this school  there was a simple idea  to create comfort in a classroom. Don't forget  it can be    degrees in Burkina Faso  so with simple ventilation  I wanted to make the classroom good for teaching and learning. And this is the project today     years old  still in best condition. And the kids  they love it. And for me and my community  this project was a huge success. It has opened up opportunities to do more projects in Gando. So I could do a lot of projects  and here I am going to share with you only three of them. The first one is the school extension  of course. How do you explain drawings and engineering to people who are neither able to read nor write  I started to build a prototype like that. The innovation was to build a clay vault. So then  I jumped on the top like that  with my team  and it works. The community is looking. It still works. So we can build.  Laughter  And we kept building  and that is the result. The kids are happy  and they love it. The community is very proud. We made it. And even animals  like these donkeys  love our buildings. The next project is the library in Gando. And see now  we tried to introduce different ideas in our buildings  but we often don't have so much material. Something we have in Gando are clay pots. We wanted to use them to create openings. So we just bring them like you can see to the building site. we start cutting them  and then we place them on top of the roof before we pour the concrete  and you have this result. The openings are letting the hot air out and light in. Very simple. My most recent project in Gando is a high school project. I would like to share with you this. The innovation in this project is to cast mud like you cast concrete. How do you cast mud  We start making a lot of mortars  like you can see  and when everything is ready  when you know what is the best recipe and the best form  you start working with the community. And sometimes I can leave. They will do it themselves. I came to speak to you like that. Another factor in Gando is rain. When the rains come  we hurry up to protect our fragile walls against the rain. Don't confound with Christo and Jeanne Claude. It is simply how we protect our walls. The rain in Burkina comes very fast  and after that  you have floods everywhere in the country. But for us  the rain is good. It brings sand and gravel to the river we need to use to build. We just wait for the rain to go. We take the sand  we mix it with clay  and we keep building. That is it. The Gando project was always connected to training the people  because I just wanted  one day when I fall down and die  that at least one person from Gando keeps doing this work. But you will be surprised. I'm still alive. And my people now can use their skills to earn money themselves. Usually  for a young man from Gando to earn money  you have to leave the country to the city  sometimes leave the country and some never come back  making the community weaker. But now they can stay in the country and work on different building sites and earn money to feed their family. There's a new quality in this work. Yes  you know it. I have won a lot of awards through this work. For sure  it has opened opportunities. I have become myself known. But the reason why I do what I do is my community. When I was a kid  I was going to school  I was coming back every holiday to Gando. By the end of every holidays  I had to say goodbye to the community  going from one compound to another one. All women in Gando will open their clothes like that and give me the last penny. In my culture  this is a symbol of deep affection. As a seven year old guy  I was impressed. I just asked my mother one day   Why do all these women love me so much   She just answered   They are contributing to pay for your education hoping that you will be successful and one day come back and help improve the quality of life of the community.  I hope now that I was able to make my community proud through this work  and I hope I was able to prove you the power of community  and to show you that architecture can be inspiring for communities to shape their own future. Merci beaucoup.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause ,,201312,6.332820512820506
149,1660,1662,E.O. Wilson 2007,E.O. Wilson,male,My wish: Build the Encyclopedia of Life,Apr 2007,1288,I have all my life wondered what  mind boggling  meant. After two days here  I declare myself boggled  and enormously impressed  and feel that you are one of the great hopes    not just for American achievement in science and technology  but for the whole world. I've come  however  on a special mission on behalf of my constituency  which are the    to the   th power    that's a million trillion    insects and other small creatures  and to make a plea for them. If we were to wipe out insects alone  just that group alone  on this planet    which we are trying hard to do    the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land. And within a few months. Now  how did I come to this particular position of advocacy  As a little boy  and through my teenage years  I became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life. I had a butterfly period  a snake period  a bird period  a fish period  a cave period and finally and definitively  an ant period. By my college years  I was a devoted myrmecologist  a specialist on the biology of ants  but my attention and research continued to make journeys across the great variety of life on Earth in general    including all that it means to us as a species  how little we understand it and how pressing a danger that our activities have created for it. Out of that broader study has emerged a concern and an ambition  crystallized in the wish that I'm about to make to you. My choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment that began with growing up on the Gulf Coast of Alabama  on the Florida peninsula. As far back as I can remember  I was enchanted by the natural beauty of that region and the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there. One day when I was only seven years old and fishing  I pulled a  pinfish   they're called  with sharp dorsal spines  up too hard and fast  and I blinded myself in one eye. I later discovered I was also hard of hearing  possibly congenitally  in the upper registers. So in planning to be a professional naturalist    I never considered anything else in my entire life    I found that I was lousy at bird watching and couldn't track frog calls either. So I turned to the teeming small creatures that can be held between the thumb and forefinger  the little things that compose the foundation of our ecosystems  the little things  as I like to say  who run the world. In so doing  I reached a frontier of biology so strange  so rich  that it seemed as though it exists on another planet. In fact  we live on a mostly unexplored planet. The great majority of organisms on Earth remain unknown to science. In the last    years  thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology  biologists have  for example  added a full one third of the known frog and other amphibian species  to bring the current total to        and more continue to pour in. Two new kinds of whales have been discovered  along with two new antelopes  dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant    and even a distinct kind of gorilla. At the extreme opposite end of the size scale  the class of marine bacteria  the Prochlorococci    that will be on the final exam    although discovered only in       are now recognized as likely the most abundant organisms on Earth  and moreover  responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean. These bacteria were not uncovered sooner because they are also among the smallest of all Earth's organisms    so minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy. Yet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures. These examples are just the first glimpse of our ignorance of life on this planet. Consider the fungi    including mushrooms  rusts  molds and many disease causing organisms.        species are known to science  but more than  .  million have been estimated to exist. Consider the nematode roundworm  the most abundant of all animals. Four out of five animals on Earth are nematode worms    if all solid materials except nematode worms were to be eliminated  you could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms. About        species of nematode worms have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists  there could be hundreds of thousands of them  even millions  still unknown. This vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further by the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria  which within just the last several years still were known from only about       species of bacteria worldwide. But that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil  just a little handful of soil  in the    billion bacteria that would be there. It's been estimated that a single ton of soil    fertile soil    contains approximately four million species of bacteria  all unknown. So the question is  what are they all doing  The fact is  we don't know. We are living on a planet with a lot of activities  with reference to our living environment  done by faith and guess alone. Our lives depend upon these creatures. To take an example close to home  there are over     species of bacteria now known    friendly bacteria    living symbiotically in your mouth and throat probably necessary to your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria. At this point I think we have a little impressionistic film that was made especially for this occasion. And I'd like to show it. Assisted in this by Billie Holiday. And that may be just the beginning  The viruses  those quasi organisms among which are the prophages  the gene weavers that promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria  are a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology  a world unto themselves. What constitutes a viral species is still unresolved  although they're obviously of enormous importance to us. But this much we can say  the variety of genes on the planet in viruses exceeds  or is likely to exceed  that in all of the rest of life combined. Nowadays  in addressing microbial biodiversity  scientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the Pacific Ocean. But that is changing rapidly with the aid of new genomic technology. Already it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hours. Soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs    to hunt bacteria in tiny crevices of the habitat's surface in the way you go watching for birds with binoculars. What will we find as we map the living world  as  finally  we get this underway seriously  As we move past the relatively gigantic mammals  birds  frogs and plants to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world enveloped and living within humanity  Already what were thought to be bacteria for generations have been found to compose  instead  two great domains of microorganisms  true bacteria and one celled organisms the archaea  which are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota  the group that we belong to. Some serious biologists  and I count myself among them  have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms  one might    just might    find aliens among them. True aliens  stocks that arrived from outer space. They've had billions of years to do it  but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet. We do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin are capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature and other harsh changes in environment  including hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the Pyrex vessels around the growing population of bacteria. There may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically and the species that compose it as a great flux of entities hardly worth distinguishing one from the other. But each of these species  even the tiniest Prochlorococci  are masterpieces of evolution. Each has persisted for thousands to millions of years. Each is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives  interlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend in ways we have not begun even to imagine. We will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them at the peril of our own existence    and unfortunately we are destroying them with ingenuity and ceaseless energy. My own epiphany as a conservationist came in       while a Harvard graduate student  searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of Cuba  ants that shine in the sunlight    metallic green or metallic blue  according to species  and one species  I discovered  metallic gold. I found my magical ants  but only after a tough climb into the mountains where the last of the native Cuban forests hung on  and were then    and still are    being cut back. I realized then that these species and a large part of the other unique  marvelous animals and plants on that island    and this is true of practically every part of the world    which took millions of years to evolve  are in the process of disappearing forever. And so it is everywhere one looks. The human juggernaut is permanently eroding Earth's ancient biosphere by a combination of forces that can be summarized by the acronym  HIPPO   the animal hippo. H is for habitat destruction  including climate change forced by greenhouse gases. I is for the invasive species like the fire ants  the zebra mussels  broom grasses and pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country  and at an exponential rate    that's the I. The P  the first one in  HIPPO   is for pollution. The second is for continued population  human population expansion. And the final letter is O  for over harvesting    driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing. The HIPPO juggernaut we have created  if unabated  is destined    according to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research    to reduce half of Earth's still surviving animal and plant species to extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century. Human forced climate change alone    again  if unabated    could eliminate a quarter of surviving species during the next five decades. What will we and all future generations lose if much of the living environment is thus degraded  Huge potential sources of scientific information yet to be gathered  much of our environmental stability and new kinds of pharmaceuticals and new products of unimaginable strength and value    all thrown away. The loss will inflict a heavy price in wealth  security and yes  spirituality for all time to come  because previous cataclysms of this kind    the last one  that ended the age of dinosaurs    took  normally  five to    million years to repair. Sadly  our knowledge of biodiversity is so incomplete that we are at risk of losing a great deal of it before it is even discovered. For example  even in the United States  the         species known currently actually has been found to be only partial in coverage  it is mostly unknown to us in basic biology. Only about    percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status. Of the    percent evaluated     percent are classified as  in peril   that is  in danger of extinction. That's in the United States. We are  in short  flying blind into our environmental future. We urgently need to change this. We need to have the biosphere properly explored so that we can understand and competently manage it. We need to settle down before we wreck the planet. And we need that knowledge. This should be a big science project equivalent to the Human Genome Project. It should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable. So this brings me to my wish for TEDsters  and to anyone else around the world who hears this talk. I wish we will work together to help create the key tools that we need to inspire preservation of Earth's biodiversity. And let us call it the  Encyclopedia of Life.  What is the  Encyclopedia of Life   A concept that has already taken hold and is beginning to spread and be looked at seriously  It is an encyclopedia that lives on the Internet and is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world. Amateurs can do it also. It has an indefinitely expandable page for each species. It makes all key information about life on Earth accessible to anyone  on demand  anywhere in the world. I've written about this idea before  and I know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it in the past. But what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form  science has advanced. Technology has moved forward. Today  the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia  regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it  are within reach. Indeed  in the past year  a group of influential scientific institutions have begun mobilizing to realize this dream. I wish you would help them. Working together  we can make this real. The encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications. It will address transcendent qualities in the human consciousness  and sense of human need. It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity. And most of all  it can inspire a new generation of biologists to continue the quest that started  for me personally     years ago  to search for life  to understand it and finally  above all  to preserve it. That is my wish. Thank you.,Biologist,200704,6.170155038759682
150,1962,1964,Ed Boyden 2011,Ed Boyden,male,A light switch for neurons,May 2011,1095,Think about your day for a second. You woke up  felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door  encountered new colleagues and had great discussions  and felt in awe when you found something new. But I bet there's something you didn't think about today    something so close to home that you probably don't think about it very often at all. And that's that all the sensations  feelings  decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called the brain. Now the brain may not look like much from the outside    a couple pounds of pinkish gray flesh  amorphous    but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain  and to see the intricacy of what lies within. And they've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons. Now unlike a human designed computer  where there's a fairly small number of different parts    we know how they work  because we humans designed them    the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells  maybe tens of thousands. They come in different shapes  they're made out of different molecules. And they project and connect to different brain regions  and they also change different ways in different disease states. Let's make it concrete. There's a class of cells  a fairly small cell  an inhibitory cell  that quiets its neighbors. It's one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia. It's called the basket cell. And this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about. New ones are being discovered everyday. As just a second example  these pyramidal cells  large cells  they can span a significant fraction of the brain. They're excitatory. And these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy. Every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device. They receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs  which then  if they pass a certain threshold  will go to thousands of downstream partners. And this process  which takes just a millisecond or so  happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your     billion cells  as long as you live and think and feel. So how are we going to figure out what this circuit does  Ideally  we could go through the circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies. If we could activate cells  we could see what powers they can unleash  what they can initiate and sustain. If we could turn them off  then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for. And that's a story I'm going to tell you about today. And honestly  where we've gone through over the last    years  through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain on and off  both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans. Now before I tell you about the technology  the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room  if we live long enough  will encounter  perhaps  a brain disorder. Already  a billion people have had some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them  and the numbers don't do it justice though. These disorders    schizophrenia  Alzheimer's  depression  addiction    they not only steal our time to live  they change who we are. They take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people. Now in the   th century  there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders  and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders  practically none of them can be considered to be cured. And part of that's because we're bathing the brain in the chemical. This elaborate circuit made out of thousands of different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance. That's also why  perhaps  most of the drugs  and not all  on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too. Now some people have gotten some solace from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain. And for Parkinson's disease  Cochlear implants  these have indeed been able to bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder. But electricity also will go in all directions    the path of least resistance  which is where that phrase  in part  comes from. And it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix. So again  we're sent back to the idea of ultra precise control. Could we dial in information precisely where we want it to go  So when I started in neuroscience    years ago  I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist  and the first thing I thought about was  if these neurons are electrical devices  all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance. If we could turn on the electricity in one cell  but not its neighbors  that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells  figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they're embedded. And also it would allow us to have the ultra precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone awry. Now how are we going to do that  Well there are many molecules that exist in nature  which are able to convert light into electricity. You can think of them as little proteins that are like solar cells. If we can install these molecules in neurons somehow  then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light. And their neighbors  which don't have the molecule  would not. There's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen  and that's the ability to get light into the brain. And to do that    the brain doesn't feel pain    you can put    taking advantage of all the effort that's gone into the Internet and communications and so on    optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate  in animal models for example  in pre clinical studies  these neurons and to see what they do. So how do we do this  Around       in collaboration with Gerhard Nagel and Karl Deisseroth  this vision came to fruition. There's a certain alga that swims in the wild  and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally. And it senses light with a little eye spot  which works not unlike how our eye works. In its membrane  or its boundary  it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity. So these molecules are called channelrhodopsins. And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about. When blue light hits it  it opens up a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eye spot  and that allows this eye spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery. So what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons. And because it's a protein  it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism. So all we've got to do is take that DNA  put it into a gene therapy vector  like a virus  and put it into neurons. So it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy  and lots of viruses were coming along. So this turned out to be very simple to do. And early in the morning one day in the summer of       we gave it a try  and it worked on the first try. You take this DNA and you put it into a neuron. The neuron uses its natural protein making machinery to fabricate these little light sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell  like putting solar panels on a roof  and the next thing you know  you have a neuron which can be activated with light. So this is very powerful. One of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors. And you can do that  you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others. And there's other genetic tricks you can play in order to get light activated cells. This field has now come to be known as optogenetics. And just as one example of the kind of thing you can do  you can take a complex network  use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network. And then when you shine light on the entire network  just that cell type will be activated. So for example  lets sort of consider that basket cell I told you about earlier    the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory. If we can deliver that gene to these cells    and they're not going to be altered by the expression of the gene  of course    and then flash blue light over the entire brain network  just these cells are going to be driven. And when the light turns off  these cells go back to normal  so they don't seem to be averse against that. Not only can you use this to study what these cells do  what their power is in computing in the brain  but you can also use this to try to figure out    well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells  if indeed they're atrophied. Now I want to tell you a couple of short stories about how we're using this  both at the scientific  clinical and pre clinical levels. One of the questions we've confronted is  what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward  Because if you could find those  those would be some of the signals that could drive learning. The brain will do more of whatever got that reward. And also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction. So if we could figure out what cells they are  we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or screened against  or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability. So to do that  we came up with a very simple paradigm in collaboration with the Fiorella group  where one side of this little box  if the animal goes there  the animal gets a pulse of light in order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light. So if these cells can mediate reward  the animal should go there more and more. And so that's what happens. This animal's going to go to the right hand side and poke his nose there  and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that. And he'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times. These are the dopamine neurons  which some of you may have heard about  in some of the pleasure centers in the brain. Now we've shown that a brief activation of these is enough  indeed  to drive learning. Now we can generalize the idea. Instead of one point in the brain  we can devise devices that span the brain  that can deliver light into three dimensional patterns    arrays of optical fibers  each coupled to its own independent miniature light source. And then we can try to do things in vivo that have only been done to date in a dish    like high throughput screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen. Or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders. And one story I want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post traumatic stress disorder    a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear. And one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear. This goes back to the Pavlovian days. It's called Pavlovian fear conditioning    where a tone ends with a brief shock. The shock isn't painful  but it's a little annoying. And over time    in this case  a mouse  which is a good animal model  commonly used in such experiments    the animal learns to fear the tone. The animal will react by freezing  sort of like a deer in the headlights. Now the question is  what targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear  So what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear. But we activate targets in the brain  different ones  using that optical fiber array I told you about in the previous slide  in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear. And so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we're working on now. This is an area in the prefrontal cortex  a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states. And the animal's going to hear a tone    and a flash of light occurred there. There's no audio on this  but you can see the animal's freezing. This tone used to mean bad news. And there's a little clock in the lower left hand corner  so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this. And now this next clip is just eight minutes later. And the same tone is going to play  and the light is going to flash again. Okay  there it goes. Right now. And now you can see  just    minutes into the experiment  that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this fear memory. Now over the last couple of years  we've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off. If we could do that  this could be extremely powerful. If you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds  you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circuits in which they're embedded. And we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life    every kingdom of life except for animals  we see slightly differently. And we found all sorts of molecules  they're called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins  that respond to green and yellow light. And they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before with the blue light activator channelrhodopsin. Let's give an example of where we think this is going to go. Consider  for example  a condition like epilepsy  where the brain is overactive. Now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment  one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain. But that's obviously irreversible  and there could be side effects. What if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time  until the seizure dies away  and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state    sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable state. So this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light  and we beam light in  and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure  we're hoping to be able to turn it off. And so we don't have data to show you on this front  but we're very excited about this. Now I want to close on one story  which we think is another possibility    which is that maybe these molecules  if you can do ultra precise control  can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic  an optical prosthetic. I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon. Seventy five thousand people have Parkinson's deep brain stimulators implanted. Maybe         people have Cochlear implants  which allow them to hear. There's another thing  which is you've got to get these genes into cells. And new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the adeno associated virus  which probably most of us around this room have  and it doesn't have any symptoms  which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body. And so far  there have not been serious adverse events associated with the virus. There's one last elephant in the room  the proteins themselves  which come from algae and bacteria and fungi  and all over the tree of life. Most of us don't have fungi or algae in our brains  so what is our brain going to do if we put that in  Are the cells going to tolerate it  Will the immune system react  In its early days    these have not been done on humans yet    but we're working on a variety of studies to try and examine this  and so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to the illumination of the brain with light. So it's early days  to be upfront  but we're excited about it. I wanted to close with one story  which we think could potentially be a clinical application. Now there are many forms of blindness where the photoreceptors  our light sensors that are in the back of our eye  are gone. And the retina  of course  is a complex structure. Now let's zoom in on it here  so we can see it in more detail. The photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top  and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors are transformed by various computations until finally that layer of cells at the bottom  the ganglion cells  relay the information to the brain  where we see that as perception. In many forms of blindness  like retinitis pigmentosa  or macular degeneration  the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed. Now how could you repair this  It's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored  because there's nothing for the drug to bind to. On the other hand  light can still get into the eye. The eye is still transparent and you can get light in. So what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules and install them on some of these other spare cells and convert them into little cameras. And because there's so many of these cells in the eye  potentially  they could be very high resolution cameras. So this is some work that we're doing. It's being led by one of our collaborators  Alan Horsager at USC  and being sought to be commercialized by a start up company Eos Neuroscience  which is funded by the NIH. And what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze. It's a six arm maze. And there's a bit of water in the maze to motivate the mouse to move  or he'll just sit there. And the goal  of course  of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that's under the lit top port. Now mice are smart  so this mouse solves the maze eventually  but he does a brute force search. He's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform. So he's not using vision to do it. These different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans. And so we're being careful in trying to look at these different models so we come up with a generalized approach. So how are we going to solve this  We're going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide. We're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera    just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive. Light is converted to electricity on them. So this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus. And now you can see  the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to this little platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again. And to point out the power of this  these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives. So this pre clinical study  I think  bodes hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future. To close  I want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurotechnology. We're developing these tools  but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world  so people can study and try to treat different disorders. And our hope is that  by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them  we can take some of these intractable disorders that I told you about earlier  practically none of which are cured  and in the   st century make them history. Thank you. Juan Enriquez  So some of the stuff is a little dense. But the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs  and being able to target those specifically is a first step. The second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors  like an on off switch. Ed Boyden  That's right. JE  Which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code. EB  Right  yeah. So with blue light  we can drive information  and it's in the form of a one. And by turning things off  it's more or less a zero. So our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in people with disabilities. JE  And in theory  that means that  as a mouse feels  smells  hears  touches  you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros. EB  Sure  yeah. We're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings  and use that to understand more about the brain. JE  Does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe upload them  EB  Well that's something we're starting to work on very hard. We're now working on some work where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too. So we can record information and then drive information back in    sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing. JE  Well  that might change a couple things. Thank you.  EB  Thank you. ,Neuroengineer,201105,5.969650872817949
153,566,568,Eleni Gabre-Madhin 2007,Eleni Gabre-Madhin,female,A commodities exchange for Ethiopia,Oct 2007,1223,You know  there's a small country nestled in the Himalayan Mountains  far from these beautiful mountains  where the people of the Kingdom of Bhutan have decided to do something different  which is to measure their gross national happiness rather than their gross national product. And why not  After all  happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few  but a fundamental human right for all. And what is happiness  Happiness is the freedom of choice. The freedom to chose where to live  what to do  what to buy  what to sell  from whom  to whom  when and how. Where does choice come from  And who gets to express it  and how do we express it  Well  one way to express choice is through the market. Well functioning markets provide choices  and ultimately  the ability to express one's pursuit for happiness. The great Indian economist  Amartya Sen  was awarded the Nobel prize for demonstrating that famine is not so much about the availability of food supply  but rather the ability to acquire or entitle oneself to that food through the market. In       in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity  nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth  Ethiopia. Not because there was not enough food    because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country    but because in the north  people could not access or entitle themselves to that food. That was a turning point for my life. Most Africans today  by far  are farmers. And most of Africa's farmers are  by and large  small farmers in terms of land that they operate  and very  very small farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal. African agriculture today is among  or is  the most under capitalized in the world. Only seven percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated  compared to    percent in Asia. African farmers only use some    kilograms of fertilizer per hectare  compared to     in Asia. Road density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa. There are eight times more tractors in Latin America  and three times more tractors in Asia  than in Africa. The small farmer in Africa today lives a life without much choice  and therefore without much freedom. His livelihood is predetermined by the conditions of grinding poverty. He comes to the market when prices are lowest  with the meager fruits of his hard labor  just after the harvest  because he has no choice. She comes back to the market some months later  when prices are highest  in what we call the lean season    when food is scarce    because she has to feed her family and has no choice. The real question is  how can markets be developed in rural Africa to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship that we know exists  Another notable economist  Theodore Schultz  in      won the Nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers are efficient  but poor. Meaning  in fact  that farmers are rational and profit minded just like everybody else. Well  we don't need  now  any more Nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake at the market and want to make money  just like everyone else. And one thing is clear  which is at least now we know that Africa is open for business. And that business is agriculture. Over two decades ago  the world insisted to Africa that markets must be liberalized  that economies must be structurally adjusted. This meant that governments were to remove themselves from the business of buying and selling    which they did rather inefficiently    and let the private market do its magic. Well  what happened over the last    years  Did Africa feed itself  Did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors  I think we're all in this room  probably  because we know that  in fact  Africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next    years  where the food import bill is now double what it was    years ago  where food production per capita has stagnated  and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased. So why didn't agriculture markets perform to expectations  The market reforms prompted by the West    and I've spent some    years traveling around the continent doing research on agricultural markets  and have interviewed traders in    to    countries in this continent  hundreds of traders    trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform. And it seems to me that the reforms might have thrown the baby out with the bath water. Like its agriculture  Africa's markets are highly under capitalized and inefficient. We know from our work around the continent that transaction costs of reaching the market  and the risks of transacting in rural  agriculture markets  are extremely high. In fact  only one third of agricultural output produced in Africa even reaches the market. Africa's markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure in terms of roads and telecommunications  but also because of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions  such as market information  grades and standards  and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers. Because of this  commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles  in narrow networks of people they know and trust. And because of that  as grain changes hands    and I've measured that it changes hands four  five times in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer    every time it changes hands    and I've seen this all over rural Africa    it also changes sacks. And I thought that was incredibly peculiar. And really realized that that was because    as traders would tell me over and over    that's the only way people know what they're getting in terms of the quantity and the product quality. And that actually has huge implications for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals  and situations where there are deficits  for example. It also has very high cost implications. I have measured that    percent of the marketing margin is simply due to the fact that  because of the absence of grades and standards and market information  sacks have to be constantly changed. And this leads to very high handling costs. For their part  small farmers  who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in Africa  come to the market with virtually no information at all    blind    trusting that they're going to have some sort of demand for their produce  and completely at the mercy of the merchants in the only market  the nearest local market they know    where they're unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk. Speaking of risk  we have seen that price volatility of food crops in Africa is the highest in the world. In Africa  small farmers bear the brunt of this risk. In fact  in my view  there is no region of the world and no period in history that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk that Africa's farmers have to bear. And in my view  there is simply no place in the world that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk that our farmers in Africa today face. In Ethiopia  for example  the variation in maize prices from year to year is as much as    percent annually. This kind of market risk is mind boggling  and has direct implications for not only the incentives of farmers to invest in higher productivity technology  such as modern seeds and fertilizers  but also direct implications for food security. To give you an example  between      and       Ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest. That in turn  because of the weak marketing system  led to an    percent collapse in maize prices in the country. This made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields. And we calculated that some         tons of grain was left in the fields to rot in early     . Not six months later  in July       Ethiopia announced a major food crisis  to the same proportions as          million people at risk of starvation. What also happened that year is in the areas where there were good rains  and where farmers had previously produced surplus grain  farmers had decided to withdraw from the fertilizer market  not use fertilizer and actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by    percent. This is a tragic example of arrested development  or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks. And this is not just specific to Ethiopia  but happens over and over  all over Africa. Well  I'm not here today to lament about the situation  or wring my hands. I am here to tell you that change is in the air. Africa today is not the Africa waiting for aid solutions  or cookie cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions. Africa has learned  or is learning somewhat slowly  that markets don't happen by themselves. In the     s  it was very fashionable to talk about getting prices right. There was a very influential book about that  which was mainly about getting governments out of the market. We now recognize that getting markets right is about not just price incentives  but also investing in the right infrastructure and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market. When conditions are right  we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa  just like anywhere else. Nearly three years ago  I decided to leave my comfortable job as a World Bank senior economist in Washington and come back to my country of birth  Ethiopia  after nearly    years abroad. I did so for a simple reason. After having spent more than a decade understanding  studying  and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with Africa's agricultural markets  I decided it was time to do something about it. I currently lead  in Ethiopia  an exciting new initiative to establish the first Ethiopia Commodity Exchange  or ECX. Now  the commodity exchange itself  that concept  is not new to the world. In fact  in          grain merchants and farmers got together in a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves. That was  of course  the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade  which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world. The Chicago Board of Trade was established then for precisely the same reasons that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange. In the American Midwest  farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the Chicago market. But once it arrived  if no buyer was to be found  or if prices suddenly dropped  farmers would incur tremendous losses. And in fact  would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan  rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms. Well  the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses led to the birth of the futures market  and the underlying system of grading grain and receipting    issuing warehouse receipts on the basis of which trade could be done. From there  the greatest innovation of all came about in this market  which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain without actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain. That meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances  and even across time    as far forward as    months into the future. This innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture  and the rise of Chicago to a global market  agricultural market  superpower from where it was  a small regional town. Now  over the last century  we tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purview of Western industrialized countries  and that the reference prices for cotton  coffee  cocoa    products produced mainly in the south    are actually a reference price  or a price discovered in these organized commodity exchanges in the northern countries. But that is actually changing. And we're seeing a shift    powered mainly because of information technology    a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets. And over the last decade  you see that the share of Western exchanges    and this is the U.S. share of exchanges in the world    has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade. Similarly  there's been explosive growth in India  for example  where rural farmers are using exchanges    growing here over the last three years by     percent a year. This is powered by low cost VSAT technology  aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market. China's Dalian Commodity Exchange  three years ago        overtook the Chicago Board of Trade to become the second largest commodity exchange in the world. Now  in Ethiopia  we're in the process of designing the first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange. We're not trying to cut and paste the Chicago model or the India model  but creating a system uniquely tailored to Ethiopia's needs and realities  Ethiopia's small farmers. So  the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia. We're creating a system that serves all market actors  that creates integrity  trust  efficiency  transparency and enables small farmers to manage the risks that I have described. In the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia  we've done something rather unique  which is to take the approach of an integrated perspective  or what we call the ECX Edge. The ECX Edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem in which the market will develop itself. And this is because one of the things we've learned over the last decade of studying market development in Africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work. You've got one donor trying to develop market information  another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards  another ICT  and yet another on warehousing  or warehouse receipts. In our approach in Ethiopia  we've decided to put together the entire ecosystem  or environment  in which trade takes place. That means that the exchange will operate a trading system  which will initially start as an open outcry  because we don't think the country's ready for full electronic trading. But at the same time  we'll do something which I think no exchange in the world has ever done  which is itself to operate something like an Internet cafe in the rural areas. So that farmers and small traders can actually come to a terminal center    what we call the remote access terminal centers    and actually  without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of those things  simply see the trading that's happening on the Addis Ababa trading floor. At the same time  what's very fundamental to this market is that    and again  an innovation that we've designed for our exchange    is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country  in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done. And in turn  we'll operate an in house clearing system  to assure that payment is done appropriately  in the right amount and at the right time  so that basically  we create trust and integrity in the system. Obviously  we work with exchange actors  and as we're developing the exchange market itself  we're also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework  the overarching legal framework for making this market work. So  in fact  our proclamation is going to parliament next month. What's really important is that the ECX will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country  using VSAT technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers. What this does is transforms  fundamentally  the farmers' relationship to the market. Whereas before the farmer used to think local    meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market  eight to    kilometers away on average  and sell whatever they happened to have  without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was    now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market. And they start to think national  and even global. They start to make not only commercial marketing decisions  but also planting decisions  on the basis of information coming from the futures price market. And they come to the market knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price premium. So all of this will transform farmers. It will also transform the way traders do business. It will stop them from doing simple  back to back  limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from  surplus regions  to  deficit areas . Can Ethiopia do this  It seems very ambitious. But it will create new opportunities. We believe that this initiative requires great political will  and we'll have to align the financial sector  as well as the ICT sector  and really even the underlying legal framework. We believe that the winds of change are here  and that we can do it. ECX is the market for Ethiopia's new millennium  which starts in about eight months. The last parliament of our century opened with our president announcing to the country that this was the most important economic initiative for the country today. We believe that the stakes are high  but that the returns will be even greater. ECX  moreover  can become a trading platform for a pan African market in agricultural commodities. Ethiopia's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value. And we feel that over the next five years  if Ethiopia can capture even    percent  just    percent  of the domestic market  and add just    percent value to that market  the value of the market doubles. Ethiopia's agricultural market is    percent higher than South Africa's grain production  and  in fact  Ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in Africa. So the potential is there. The will is there. The commitment is there. So we feel that we have a winning value proposition to transform farmers' choices  to grow our agriculture  and to change Africa. So  we are in the business of finding our happiness. Thank you very much.,Economist,200710,6.085665294924551
169,1300,1302,Eve Ensler 2008,Eve Ensler,female,What security means to me,Sep 2008,768,I think it'll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others that I'm not going to talk about vaginas today. I began  The Vagina Monologues  because I was worried about vaginas. I'm very worried today about this notion  this world  this prevailing kind of force of security. I see this word  hear this word  feel this word everywhere. Real security  security checks  security watch  security clearance. Why has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure  What does anyone mean when they talk about real security  And why have we  as Americans particularly  become a nation that strives for security above all else  In fact  I think that security is elusive. It's impossible. We all die. We all get old. We all get sick. People leave us. People change us. Nothing is secure. And that's actually the good news. This is  of course  unless your whole life is about being secure. I think that when that is the focus of your life  these are the things that happen. You can't travel very far or venture too far outside a certain circle. You can't allow too many conflicting ideas into your mind at one time  as they might confuse you or challenge you. You can't open yourself to new experiences  new people  new ways of doing things    they might take you off course. You can't not know who you are  so you cling to hard matter identity. You become a Christian  Muslim  Jew. You're an Indian  Egyptian  Italian  American. You're a heterosexual or a homosexual  or you never have sex. Or at least  that's what you say when you identify yourself. You become part of an  us.  In order to be secure  you defend against  them.  You cling to your land because it is your secure place. You must fight anyone who encroaches upon it. You become your nation. You become your religion. You become whatever it is that will freeze you  numb you and protect you from doubt or change. But all this does  actually  is shut down your mind. In reality  it does not really make you safer. I was in Sri Lanka  for example  three days after the tsunami  and I was standing on the beaches and it was absolutely clear that  in a matter of five minutes  a    foot wave could rise up and desecrate a people  a population and lives. All this striving for security  in fact  has made you much more insecure because now you have to watch out all the time. There are people not like you    people who you now call enemies. You have places you cannot go  thoughts you cannot think  worlds that you can no longer inhabit. And so you spend your days fighting things off  defending your territory and becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking. Your days become devoted to protecting yourself. This becomes your mission. That is all you do. Ideas get shorter. They become sound bytes. There are evildoers and saints  criminals and victims. There are those who  if they're not with us  are against us. It gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what's inside them. It gets easier to lock them up  force them to be naked  humiliate them  occupy them  invade them and kill them  because they are only obstacles now to your security. In six years  I've had the extraordinary privilege through V Day  a global movement against  violence against  women  to travel probably to    countries  and spend a great deal of time in different portions. I've met women and men all over this planet  who through various circumstances    war  poverty  racism  multiple forms of violence    have never known security  or have had their illusion of security forever devastated. I've spent time with women in Afghanistan under the Taliban  who were essentially brutalized and censored. I've been in Bosnian refugee camps. I was with women in Pakistan who have had their faces melted off with acid. I've been with girls all across America who were date raped  or raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night. One of the amazing things that I've discovered in my travels is that there is this emerging species. I loved when he was talking about this other world that's right next to this world. I've discovered these people  who  in V Day world  we call Vagina Warriors. These particular people  rather than getting AK   s  or weapons of mass destruction  or machetes  in the spirit of the warrior  have gone into the center  the heart of pain  of loss. They have grieved it  they have died into it  and allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine. They have used the fuel of their pain to begin to redirect that energy towards another mission and another trajectory. These warriors now devote themselves and their lives to making sure what happened to them doesn't happen to anyone else. There are thousands if not millions of them on the planet. I venture there are many in this room. They have a fierceness and a freedom that I believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm. They have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator. Their own personal security is not their end goal  and because of that  because  rather than worrying about security  because the transformation of suffering is their end goal  I actually believe they are creating real safety and a whole new idea of security. I want to talk about a few of these people that I've met. Tomorrow  I am going to Cairo  and I'm so moved that I will be with women in Cairo who are V Day women  who are opening the first safe house for battered women in the Middle East. That will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up and put themselves on the line  and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt  and were willing to be attacked and criticized. And through their work over the last years  this is not only happening that this house is opening  but it's being supported by many factions of the society who never would have supported it. Women in Uganda this year  who put on  The Vagina Monologues  during V Day  actually evoked the wrath of the government. And  I love this story so much. There was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents to talk about whether  Vaginas  could come to Uganda. And in this meeting    it went on for weeks in the press  two weeks where there was huge discussion. The government finally made a decision that  The Vagina Monologues  could not be performed in Uganda. But the amazing news was that because they had stood up  these women  and because they had been willing to risk their security  it began a discussion that not only happened in Uganda  but all of Africa. As a result  this production  which had already sold out  every single person in that     seat audience  except for    people  made a decision to keep the money. They raised        dollars on a production that never occurred. There's a young woman named Carrie Rethlefsen in Minnesota. She's a high school student. She had seen  The Vagina Monologues  and she was really moved. And as a result  she wore an  I heart my vagina  button to her high school in Minnesota. She was basically threatened to be expelled from school. They told her she couldn't love her vagina in high school  that it was not a legal thing  that it was not a moral thing  that it was not a good thing. So she really struggled with this  what to do  because she was a senior and she was doing well in her school and she was threatened expulsion. So what she did is she got all her friends together    I believe it was          students all wore  I love my vagina  T shirts  and the boys wore  I love her vagina  T shirts to school. Now this seems like a fairly  you know  frivolous  but what happened as a result of that  is that that school now is forming a sex education class. It's beginning to talk about sex  it's beginning to look at why it would be wrong for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly or to say that she loved her vagina publicly. I know I've talked about Agnes here before  but I want to give you an update on Agnes. I met Agnes three years ago in the Rift Valley. When she was a young girl  she had been mutilated against her will. That mutilation of her clitoris had actually obviously impacted her life and changed it in a way that was devastating. She made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard  but to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls. For eight years  she walked through the Rift Valley. She had this amazing box that she carried and it had a torso of a woman's body in it  a half a torso  and she would teach people  everywhere she went  what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like. In the years that she walked  she educated parents  mothers  fathers. She saved       girls from being cut. When V Day met her  we asked her how we could support her and she said   Well  if you got me a Jeep  I could get around a lot faster.  So  we bought her a Jeep. In the year she had the Jeep  she saved       girls from being cut. So  we said  what else could we do  She said   If you help me get money  I could open a house.  Three years ago  Agnes opened a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation. When she began her mission eight years ago  she was reviled  she was detested  she was completely slandered in her community. I am proud to tell you that six months ago  she was elected the deputy mayor of Narok. I think what I'm trying to say here is that if your end goal is security  and if that's all you're focusing on  what ends up happening is that you create not only more insecurity in other people  but you make yourself far more insecure. Real security is contemplating death  not pretending it doesn't exist. Not running from loss  but entering grief  surrendering to sorrow. Real security is not knowing something  when you don't know it. Real security is hungering for connection rather than power. It cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs. It is deeper  it is a process  it is acute awareness that we are all utterly inter bended  and one action by one being in one tiny town has consequences everywhere. Real security is not only being able to tolerate mystery  complexity  ambiguity  but hungering for them and only trusting a situation when they are present. Something happened when I began traveling in V Day  eight years ago. I got lost. I remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa  and I had no idea where I was. I didn't know where I was going  where I'd come from  and I panicked. I had a total anxiety attack. And then I suddenly realized that it absolutely didn't matter where I was going  or where I had come from because we are all essentially permanently displaced people. All of us are refugees. We come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time  moving towards a new place. Freedom means I may not be identified as any one group  but that I can visit and find myself in every group. It does not mean that I don't have values or beliefs  but it does mean I am not hardened around them. I do not use them as weapons. In the shared future  it will be just that  shared. The end goal will  be  becoming vulnerable  realizing the place of our connection to one another  rather than becoming secure  in control and alone. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  And how are you doing  Are you exhausted  On a typical day  do you wake up with hope or gloom  Eve Ensler  You know  I think Carl Jung once said that in order to survive the twentieth century  we have to live with two existing thoughts  opposite thoughts  at the same time. And I think part of what I'm learning in this process is that one must allow oneself to feel grief. And I think as long as I keep grieving  and weeping  and then moving on  I'm fine. When I start to pretend that what I'm seeing isn't impacting me  and isn't changing my heart  then I get in trouble. Because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place  country to country  and city to city  the degree to which women  for example  are violated  and the epidemic of it  and the kind of ordinariness of it  is so devastating to one's soul that you have to take the time  or I have to take the time now  to process that. CA  There are a lot of causes out there in the world that have been talked about  you know  poverty  sickness and so on. You spent eight years on this one. Why this one  EE  I think that if you think about women  women are the primary resource of the planet. They give birth  we come from them  they are mothers  they are visionaries  they are the future. If you think that the U.N. now says that one out of three women on the planet will be raped or beaten in their lifetime  we're talking about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet  we're talking about the place where we come from  we're talking about parenting. Imagine that you've been raped and you're bringing up a boy child. How does it impact your ability to work  or envision a future  or thrive  as opposed to just survive  What I believe is if we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women  it would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself.,"Playwright, activist",200809,5.820660792951534
170,2022,2024,Eve Ensler 2011,Eve Ensler,female,"Suddenly, my body",Aug 2011,764,For a long time  there was me  and my body. Me was composed of stories  of cravings  of strivings  of desires of the future. Me was trying not to be an outcome of my violent past  but the separation that had already occurred between me and my body was a pretty significant outcome. Me was always trying to become something  somebody. Me only existed in the trying. My body was often in the way. Me was a floating head. For years  I actually only wore hats. It was a way of keeping my head attached. It was a way of locating myself. I worried that  if  I took my hat off I wouldn't be here anymore. I actually had a therapist who once said to me   Eve  you've been coming here for two years  and  to be honest  it never occurred to me that you had a body.  All this time I lived in the city because  to be honest  I was afraid of trees. I never had babies because heads cannot give birth. Babies actually don't come out of your mouth. As I had no reference point for my body  I began to ask other women about their bodies    in particular  their vaginas  because I thought vaginas were kind of important. This led to me writing  The Vagina Monologues   which led to me obsessively and incessantly talking about vaginas everywhere I could. I did this in front of many strangers. One night on stage  I actually entered my vagina. It was an ecstatic experience. It scared me  it energized me  and then I became a driven person  a driven vagina. I began to see my body like a thing  a thing that could move fast  like a thing that could accomplish other things  many things  all at once. I began to see my body like an iPad or a car. I would drive it and demand things from it. It had no limits. It was invincible. It was to be conquered and mastered like the Earth herself. I didn't heed it  no  I organized it and I directed it. I didn't have patience for my body  I snapped it into shape. I was greedy. I took more than my body had to offer. If I was tired  I drank more espressos. If I was afraid  I went to more dangerous places. Oh sure  sure  I had moments of appreciation of my body  the way an abusive parent can sometimes have a moment of kindness. My father was really kind to me on my   th birthday  for example. I heard people murmur from time to time that I should love my body  so I learned how to do this. I was a vegetarian  I was sober  I didn't smoke. But all that was just a more sophisticated way to manipulate my body    a further disassociation  like planting a vegetable field on a freeway. As a result of me talking so much about my vagina  many women started to tell me about theirs    their stories about their bodies. Actually  these stories compelled me around the world  and I've been to over    countries. I heard thousands of stories  and I have to tell you  there was always this moment where the women shared with me that particular moment when she separated from her body    when she left home. I heard about women being molested in their beds  flogged in their burqas  left for dead in parking lots  acid burned in their kitchens. Some women became quiet and disappeared. Other women became mad  driven machines like me. In the middle of my traveling  I turned    and I began to hate my body  which was actually progress  because at least my body existed enough to hate it. Well my stomach    it was my stomach I hated. It was proof that I had not measured up  that I was old and not fabulous and not perfect or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape. My stomach was proof that I had failed  that it had failed me  that it was broken. My life became about getting rid of it and obsessing about getting rid of it. In fact  it became so extreme I wrote a play about it. But the more I talked about it  the more objectified and fragmented my body became. It became entertainment  it became a new kind of commodity  something I was selling. Then I went somewhere else. I went outside what I thought I knew. I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo. And I heard stories that shattered all the other stories. I heard stories that got inside my body. I heard about a little girl who couldn't stop peeing on herself because so many grown soldiers had shoved themselves inside her. I heard an    year old woman whose legs were broken and pulled out of her sockets and twisted up on her head as the soldiers raped her like that. There are thousands of these stories  and many of the women had holes in their bodies    holes  fistula    that were the violation of war    holes in the fabric of their souls. These stories saturated my cells and nerves  and to be honest  I stopped sleeping for three years. All the stories began to bleed together. The raping of the Earth  the pillaging of minerals  the destruction of vaginas    none of these were separate anymore from each other or me. Militias were raping six month old babies so that countries far away could get access to gold and coltan for their iPhones and computers. My body had not only become a driven machine  but it was responsible now for destroying other women's bodies in its mad quest to make more machines to support the speed and efficiency of my machine. Then I got cancer    or I found out I had cancer. It arrived like a speeding bird smashing into a windowpane. Suddenly  I had a body  a body that was pricked and poked and punctured  a body that was cut wide open  a body that had organs removed and transported and rearranged and reconstructed  a body that was scanned and had tubes shoved down it  a body that was burning from chemicals. Cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection. I suddenly understood that the crisis in my body was the crisis in the world  and it wasn't happening later  it was happening now. Suddenly  my cancer was a cancer that was everywhere  the cancer of cruelty  the cancer of greed  the cancer that gets inside people who live down the streets from chemical plants    and they're usually poor    the cancer inside the coal miner's lungs  the cancer of stress for not achieving enough  the cancer of buried trauma  the cancer in caged chickens and polluted fish  the cancer in women's uteruses from being raped  the cancer that is everywhere from our carelessness. In his new and visionary book   New Self  New World   the writer Philip Shepherd says   If you are divided from your body  you are also divided from the body of the world  which then appears to be other than you or separate from you  rather than the living continuum to which you belong.  Before cancer  the world was something other. It was as if I was living in a stagnant pool and cancer dynamited the boulder that was separating me from the larger sea. Now I am swimming in it. Now I lay down in the grass and I rub my body in it  and I love the mud on my legs and feet. Now I make a daily pilgrimage to visit a particular weeping willow by the Seine  and I hunger for the green fields in the bush outside Bukavu. And when it rains hard rain  I scream and I run in circles. I know that everything is connected  and the scar that runs the length of my torso is the markings of the earthquake. And I am there with the three million in the streets of Port au Prince. And the fire that burned in me on day three through six of chemo is the fire that is burning in the forests of the world. I know that the abscess that grew around my wound after the operation  the    ounces of puss  is the contaminated Gulf of Mexico  and there were oil drenched pelicans inside me and dead floating fish. And the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication made me scream out the way the Earth cries out from the drilling. In my second chemo  my mother got very sick and I went to see her. And in the name of connectedness  the only thing she wanted before she died was to be brought home by her beloved Gulf of Mexico. So we brought her home  and I prayed that the oil wouldn't wash up on her beach before she died. And gratefully  it didn't. And she died quietly in her favorite place. And a few weeks later  I was in New Orleans  and this beautiful  spiritual friend told me she wanted to do a healing for me. And I was honored. And I went to her house  and it was morning  and the morning New Orleans sun was filtering through the curtains. And my friend was preparing this big bowl  and I said   What is it   And she said   It's for you. The flowers make it beautiful  and the honey makes it sweet.  And I said   But what's the water part   And in the name of connectedness  she said   Oh  it's the Gulf of Mexico.  And I said   Of course it is.  And the other women arrived and they sat in a circle  and Michaela bathed my head with the sacred water. And she sang    I mean her whole body sang. And the other women sang and they prayed for me and my mother. And as the warm Gulf washed over my naked head  I realized that it held the best and the worst of us. It was the greed and recklessness that led to the drilling explosion. It was all the lies that got told before and after. It was the honey in the water that made it sweet  it was the oil that made it sick. It was my head that was bald    and comfortable now without a hat. It was my whole self melting into Michaela's lap. It was the tears that were indistinguishable from the Gulf that were falling down my cheek. It was finally being in my body. It was the sorrow that's taken so long. It was finding my place and the huge responsibility that comes with connection. It was the continuing devastating war in the Congo and the indifference of the world. It was the Congolese women who are now rising up. It was my mother leaving  just at the moment that I was being born. It was the realization that I had come very close to dying    in the same way that the Earth  our mother  is barely holding on  in the same way that    percent of the planet are hardly scraping by  in the same way that there is a recipe for survival. What I learned is it has to do with attention and resources that everybody deserves. It was advocating friends and a doting sister. It was wise doctors and advanced medicine and surgeons who knew what to do with their hands. It was underpaid and really loving nurses. It was magic healers and aromatic oils. It was people who came with spells and rituals. It was having a vision of the future and something to fight for  because I know this struggle isn't my own. It was a million prayers. It was a thousand hallelujahs and a million oms. It was a lot of anger  insane humor  a lot of attention  outrage. It was energy  love and joy. It was all these things. It was all these things. It was all these things in the water  in the world  in my body.,"Playwright, activist",201108,5.6477217741935455
183,1891,1893,Geert Chatrou 2011,Geert Chatrou,male,A whistleblower you haven't heard,Feb 2011,708,Thank you. Thank you very much. That was whistling. I'm trying to do this in English. What is a chubby  curly haired guy from Holland    why is he whistling  Well actually  I've  been  whistling since the age of four  about four. My dad was always whistling around the house  and I just thought that's part of communication in my family. So I whistled along with him. And actually  till I was     I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling  because  to be honest  my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior. I whistled alone. I whistled in the classroom. I whistled on  my  bike. I whistled everywhere. And I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party with my family in law. And they had some  in my opinion  terrible Christmas music. And when I hear music that I don't like  I try to make it better. So  Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer     you know it  But it can also sound like this. But during a Christmas party    at dinner actually    it's very annoying. So my sister in law asked me a few times   Please stop whistling.  And I just couldn't. And at one point    and I had some wine  I have to admit that    at one point I said   If there was a contest  I would join.  And two weeks later I received a text message   You're going to America.  So  okay  I'm going to America. I would love to  but why  So I immediately called her up  of course. She Googled  and she found this World Whistling Championship in America  of course. She didn't expect me to go there. And I would have lost my face. I don't know if that's correct English. But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean. I lost my face. And she thought   He will never go there.  But actually I did. So I went to Louisburg  North Carolina  southeast United States  and I entered the world of whistling. And I also entered the world championship  and I won there in     . That was great fun  of course. And to defend my title    like judokas do and sportsmen    I thought  well let's go back in       and I won again. Then I couldn't participate for a few years. And in      I entered again in Japan  Tokyo  and I won again. So what happened now is I'm standing here in Rotterdam  in the beautiful city  on a big stage  and I'm talking about whistling. And actually I earn my money whistling at the moment. So I quit my day job as a nurse. And I try to live my dream    well  actually  it was never my dream  but it sounds so good. Okay  I'm not the only one whistling here. You say   Huh  what do you mean   Well actually  you are going to whistle along. And then always the same thing happens  people are watching each other and think   Oh  my God. Why  Can I go away   No  you can't. Actually it's very simple. The track that I will whistle is called  F te de la Belle.  It's about    minutes long. No  no  no. It's four minutes long. And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling. So I whistle the tone. Sorry. I forgot one thing. You whistle the same tone as me. I heard a wide variety of tones. This is very promising. This is very promising. I'll ask the technicians to start the music. And if it's started  I just point where you whistle along  and we will see what happens. Oh  hah. I'm so sorry  technicians. I'm so used to that. I start it myself. Okay  here it is. Okay. It's easy  isn't it  Now comes the solo. I propose I do that myself. Max Westerman  Geert Chatrou  the World Champion  of  Whistling. Geert Chatrou  Thank you. Thank you.,Whistler,201102,6.181413043478263
187,743,745,Gever Tulley 2007,Gever Tulley,male,5 dangerous things you should let your kids do,Dec 2007,552,Welcome to  Five Dangerous Things You Should Let Your Children Do.  I don't have children. I borrow my friends' children  so    take all this advice with a grain of salt. I'm Gever Tulley. I'm a contract computer scientist by trade  but I'm the founder of something called the Tinkering School. It's a summer program which aims to help kids learn how to build the things that they think of. So we build a lot of things  and I do put power tools into the hands of second graders. So if you're thinking about sending your kid to Tinkering School  they do come back bruised  scraped and bloody. You know  we live in a world that's subjected to ever more stringent child safety regulations. There doesn't seem to be any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get. We put suffocation warnings on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States  or for sale with an item in the United States. We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot. And we seem to think that any item sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of   . So where does this trend stop  When we round every corner and eliminate every sharp object  every pokey bit in the world  then the first time that kids come in contact with anything sharp  or not made out of round plastic  they'll hurt themselves with it. So  as the boundaries of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller  we cut off our children from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact with the world around them. And despite all of our best efforts and intentions  kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous thing they can  in whatever environment they can. So despite the provocative title  this presentation is really about safety  and about some simple things that we can do to raise our kids to be creative  confident and in control of the environment around them. And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress. The book is called     Dangerous Things.  This is  Five Dangerous Things.  Thing number one  Play with fire. Learning to control one of the most elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment in any child's personal history. Whether we remember it or not  it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things. These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity to play with it. So  playing with fire. This is like one of the great things we ever discovered  fire. From playing with it  they learn some basic principles about fire  about intake  combustion  exhaust. These are the three working elements of fire that you have to have for a good  controlled fire. And you can think of the open pit fire as a laboratory. You don't know what they're going to learn from playing with it. Let them fool around with it on their own terms and trust me  they're going to learn things that you can't get out of playing with Dora the Explorer toys. Number two  Own a pocketknife. Pocketknives are kind of drifting out of our cultural consciousness  which I think is a terrible thing. Your first pocketknife is like the first universal tool that you're given. You know  it's a spatula  it's a pry bar  it's a screwdriver and it's a blade  yeah. And it's a powerful and empowering tool. And in a lot of cultures they give knives    like  as soon as they're toddlers  they have knives. These are Inuit children cutting whale blubber. I first saw this in a Canadian Film Board film when I was     and it left a lasting impression  to see babies playing with knives. And it shows that kids can develop an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age. You lay down a couple of very simple rules    always cut away from your body  keep the blade sharp  never force it    and these are things kids can understand and practice with. And yeah  they're going to cut themselves. I have some terrible scars on my legs from where I stabbed myself. But you know  they're young. They heal fast. Number three  Throw a spear. It turns out that our brains are actually wired for throwing things  and like muscles  if you don't use parts of your brain  they tend to atrophy over time. But when you exercise them  any given muscle adds strength to the whole system  and that applies to your brain  too. So practicing throwing things has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes  which have to do with visual acuity   D understanding  and structural problem solving  so it helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability. And throwing is a combination of analytical and physical skill  so it's very good for that kind of whole body training. These kinds of target based practices also help kids develop attention and concentration skills  so those are great. Number  four   Deconstruct appliances. There is a world of interesting things inside your dishwasher. Next time you're about to throw out an appliance  don't throw it out. Take it apart with your kid  or send him to my school  and we'll take it apart with them. Even if you don't know what the parts are  puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense that they can take things apart  and no matter how complex they are  they can understand parts of them. And that means that eventually  they can understand all of them. It's a sense of knowability  that something is knowable. So these black boxes that we live with and take for granted are actually complex things made by other people  and you can understand them. Number five  Two parter. Break the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit how we can interact with the things that we own    in this case  digital media. It's a very simple exercise  Buy a song on iTunes  write it to a CD  then rip the CD to an MP   and play it on your very same computer. You've just broken a law. Technically  the RIAA could come and prosecute you. It's an important lesson for kids to understand  that some of these laws get broken by accident  and that laws have to be interpreted. That's something we often talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things and breaking them open  and taking them apart and using them for other things. And also when we go out and drive a car. Driving a car is a really empowering act for a young child  so this is the alternate    For those of you who aren't comfortable actually breaking the law  you can drive a car with your child. This is a great stage for a kid. This happens about the same time that they get latched onto things like dinosaurs  these big things in the outside world  that they're trying to get a grip on. A car is a similar object  and they can get in a car and drive it. And that really gives them a handle on a world in a way that they don't often have access to. And it's perfectly legal. Find a big empty lot  make sure there's nothing in it  and that it's on private property  and let them drive your car. It's very safe actually. And it's fun for the whole family. Let's see  I think that's it. That's number five and a half. OK.,Tinkerer,200712,6.094012158054713
188,1498,1500,Gever Tulley 2009,Gever Tulley,male,Life lessons through tinkering,Jun 2009,233,This is the exact moment that I started creating something called Tinkering School. Tinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks and hammers and other dangerous objects  and be trusted. Trusted not to hurt themselves  and trusted not to hurt others. Tinkering School doesn't follow a set curriculum  and there are no tests. We're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing. When the kids arrive they're confronted with lots of stuff  wood and nails and rope and wheels  and lots of tools  real tools. It's a six day immersive experience for the kids. And within that context  we can offer the kids time    something that seems in short supply in their over scheduled lives. Our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived  and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around. Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever. And the kids soon learn that all projects go awry    and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success  or gleeful calamity. We start from doodles and sketches. And sometimes we make real plans. And sometimes we just start building. Building is at the heart of the experience  hands on  deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand. Robin and I  acting as collaborators  keep the landscape of the projects tilted towards completion. Success is in the doing  and failures are celebrated and analyzed. Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear. When faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities  a really interesting behavior emerges  decoration. Decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation. From these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before. All materials are available for use. Even those mundane  hateful  plastic grocery bags can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined. And the things that they build amaze even themselves.

194,844,846,Haas&Hahn 2014,Haas&Hahn,they (male and male),How painting can transform communities,Nov 2014,678,Dre Urhahn  This theater  is built on Copacabana  which is the most famous  beach in the world  but    kilometers away from here in the North Zone of Rio lies a community called Vila Cruzeiro  and roughly        people live there. Now  the people here in Rio mostly know Vila Cruzeiro from the news  and unfortunately  news  from Vila Cruzeiro often is not good news. But Vila Cruzeiro is also the place where our story begins. Jeroen Koolhaas  Ten years  ago  we first came to Rio to shoot a documentary  about life in the favelas. Now  we learned that favelas  are informal communities. They emerged over the years when immigrants from the countryside came to the cities looking for work  like cities within the cities  known for problems like crime  poverty  and the violent drug war between police and the drug gangs. So what struck us was that these were communities that the people who lived there had built  with their own hands  without a master plan and like a giant work in progress. Where we're from  in Holland  everything is planned. We even have rules for  how to follow the rules. DU  So the last day of  filming  we ended up in Vila Cruzeiro  and  we were sitting down and we had a drink  and we were overlooking this hill with all these houses  and most of these houses looked unfinished  and they had walls of bare brick  but we saw some of these houses which were plastered and painted  and suddenly we had this idea  what would it look like if all these houses would be plastered and painted  And then we imagined one big design  one big work of art. Who would expect something like that in a place like this  So we thought  would that even be possible  So first we started to count the houses  but we soon lost count. But somehow the idea stuck. JK  We had a friend. He ran an NGO in Vila Cruzeiro. His name was Nanko  and he also liked the idea. He said   You know  everybody here would pretty much love  to have their houses plastered and painted. It's when a house is finished.  So he introduced us to the right people  and Vitor and Maurinho became our crew. We picked three houses in the center of the community and we start here. We made a few designs  and everybody liked this design of a boy flying a kite the best. So we started painting   and the first thing we did was to paint everything blue  and we thought that looked  already pretty good. But they hated it. The people who lived there really hated it. They said   What did you do  You painted our house in  exactly the same color as the police station.  In a favela  that is not a good thing. Also the same color as the prison cell. So we quickly went ahead  and we painted the boy  and then we thought we were finished  we were really happy  but still  it wasn't good because the little kids started coming up to us  and they said   You know   there's a boy flying the kite  but where is his kite   We said   Uh  it's art. You know  you have to imagine the kite.  And they said   No  no  no   we want to see the kite.  So we quickly installed a kite way up high on the hill  so that you could see  the boy flying the kite and you could actually see a kite. So the local news started writing about it  which was great  and then even The Guardian wrote about it   Notorious slum becomes open air gallery.  JK  So  encouraged by this success  we went back to Rio for a second project  and we stumbled upon this street. It was covered in concrete  to prevent mudslides  and somehow we saw a sort of river in it  and we imagined this river to be a river in Japanese style with koi carp swimming upstream. So we decided to paint that river  and we invited Rob Admiraal  who is a tattoo artist  and he specialized in the Japanese style. So little did we know that we would spend almost an entire year painting that river  together with Geovani and Robinho and Vitor  who lived nearby. And we even moved into the neighborhood when one of the guys that  lived on the street  Elias  told us that we could come  and live in his house  together with his family  which was fantastic. Unfortunately  during that time  another war broke out between the police and the drug gangs. We learned that during those times  people in communities  really stick together during these times of hardship  but we also learned a  very important element  the importance of barbecues.   Laughter  Because  when you throw a barbecue  it turns you from a guest into a host  so we decided to throw one almost every other week  and we got to know everybody  in the neighborhood. JK  We still had this  idea of the hill  though. DU  Yeah  yeah  we were talking about the scale of this  because this painting was incredibly big  and it was insanely detailed  and this process almost drove us completely insane ourselves. But we figured that maybe   during this process  all the time that we had  spent in the neighborhood was maybe actually even more important than the painting itself. JK  So after all that time  this hill  this idea was still there  and we started to make sketches  models  and we figured something out. We figured that our ideas  our designs had to be a little bit more simple than that last project so that we could paint with more people and cover more houses at the same time. And we had an opportunity to try that out in a community in the central part of Rio  which is called Santa Marta  and we made a design for this place which looked like this  and then we got people to go along with it because turns out that if  your idea is ridiculously big  it's easier to get people to  go along with this.  Laughter  And the people of Santa Marta got together and in a little over a month they turned that square into this. And this image somehow  went all over the world. DU  So then we received  an unexpected phone call from the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program  and they had this question if this idea  our approach  if this would actually  work in North Philly  which is one of the poorest neighborhoods in the United States. So we immediately said yes. We had no idea how  but it seemed like a very  interesting challenge  so we did exactly the  same as we did in Rio  and we moved into the neighborhood and started barbecuing. So the project took almost two years to complete  and we made individual designs for every single house on  the avenue that we painted  and we made these designs together with the local store owners   the building owners  and a team of about a dozen  young men and women. They were hired  and then they were trained as painters  and together they transformed their own neighborhood  the whole street  into a  giant patchwork of color. And at the end  the city of Philadelphia thanked every single one of them and gave them a merit for their accomplishment. JK  So now we had painted a whole street. How about we do this whole hill now  We started looking for funding  but instead  we just ran into questions  like  how many houses  are you going to paint  How many square meters is that  How much paint are you going to use  and how many people are you going to employ  And we did try for years to write plans for the funding and answer  all those questions  but then we thought  in order to answer all those questions  you have to know exactly  what you're going to do before you actually get there and start. And maybe it's a mistake  to think like that. It would lose some of the  magic that we had learned about that if you go somewhere and you spend time there  you can let the project grow organically and have a life of its own. DU  So what we did is we decided to take this  plan and strip it away from all the numbers and all the ideas and presumptions and just go back to the base idea  which was to transform this hill into a giant work of art. And instead of looking for funding  we started a crowdfunding campaign  and in a little over a month  more than       people put together and donated over         dollars. So for us  this was an amazing  moment  because now   because now we finally had the freedom to use all the lessons that we had learned and create a project that was built the same way that the favela was built  from the ground on up  bottom up  with no master plan. JK  So we went back   and we employed Angelo  and he's a local artist from Vila Cruzeiro  very talented guy  and he knows almost everybody there  and then we employed Elias  our former landlord who invited us into his house  and he's a master of construction. Together with them  we decided where to start. We picked this spot in Vila Cruzeiro  and houses are being plastered as we speak. And the good thing about them is that they are deciding which houses go next. They're even printing t shirts  they're putting up banners explaining everything to everybody  and talking to the press. This article about Angelo appeared. DU  So while this is happening  we are bringing this  idea all over the world. So  like the project we  did in Philadelphia  we are also invited to do workshops  for instance in Cura ao  and right now we're planning  a huge project in Haiti. JK  So the favela was not only the place where this idea started  it was also the place that made it possible to work without a master plan  because these communities are informal   this was the inspiration   and in a communal effort   together with the people  you can almost work like in an orchestra  where you can have a hundred instruments playing together to create a symphony. DU  So we want to thank everybody who wanted to become part of this dream and supported us along the way  and we are looking at continuing. JK  Yeah. And so one day pretty soon  when the colors start  going up on these walls  we hope more people will join us  and join this big dream  and maybe one day  the  whole of Vila Cruzeiro will be painted. DU  Thank you.,Favela painters,201411,6.225921568627447
195,1844,1846,Halla Tomasdottir 2010,Halla Tomasdottir,female,A feminine response to Iceland's financial crash,Dec 2010,572,It sure used to be a lot easier to be from Iceland  because until a couple of years ago  people knew hardly anything about us  and I could basically come out here and say only good things about us. But in the last couple of years we've become infamous for a couple of things. First  of course  the economic meltdown. It actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay. Ninety nine pence was the starting price and no reserve. Then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends  including President Obama. By the way  the pronunciation is  Eyjafjallajokull.  None of your media got it right. But I'm not here to share these stories about these two things exactly. I'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital  which is a financial firm founded by me and Kristin    who you see in the picture    in the spring of       just over a year before the economic collapse hit. Why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm  Well let it suffice to say that we felt a bit overwhelmed with testosterone. And I'm not here to say that men are to blame for the crisis and what happened in my country. But I can surely tell you that in my country  much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere  men were at the helm of the game of the financial sector  and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems. So we decided  a bit fed up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn't sustainable  to found a financial services firm based on our values  and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance. Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland. We weren't known as the typical  women  women in Iceland up until then. So it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then. And we got a great group of people to join us    principled people with great skills  and investors with a vision and values to match ours. And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients. And although I want to thank the talented people of our company foremost for that    and also there's a factor of luck and timing    we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values. So let me share with you our values. We believe in risk awareness. What does that mean  We believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking  and we will not invest in things we don't understand. Not a complicated thing. But in       at the height of the sub prime and all the complicated financial structures  it was quite opposite to the reckless risk taking behaviors that we saw on the market. We also believe in straight talking  telling it as it is  using simple language that people understand  telling people about the downsides as well as the potential upsides  and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter  like our lack of belief in the sustainability of the Icelandic financial sector that already we had months before the collapse hit us. And  although we do work in the financial sector  where Excel is king  we believe in emotional capital. And we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence. It is actually people that make money and lose money  not Excel spreadsheets. Last  but not least  we believe in profit with principles. We care how we make our profit. So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers  we are willing to do it with a long term view  and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter. So we like to see profits  plus positive social and environmental benefits  when we invest. But it wasn't just about the values  although we are convinced that they matter. It was also about a business opportunity. It's the female trend  and it's the sustainability trend  that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come. The whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men  it is actually about women being different from men  bringing different values and different ways to the table. So what do you get  You get better decision making  and you get less herd behavior  and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results. But one has to wonder  now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland    and by the way  Europe looks pretty bad right now  and many would say that you in America are heading for some more trouble as well. Now that we've had all that happen  and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision making tables  will we see business and finance change  Will government change  Well I'll give you my straight talk about this. I have days that I believe  but I have days that I'm full of doubt. Have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us  Einstein said that this was the definition of insanity    to do the same things over and over again  hoping for a different outcome. So I guess the world is insane  because I see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again  hoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us. I want to see more revolutionary thinking  and I remain hopeful. Like TED  I believe in people. And I know that consumers are becoming more conscious  and they are going to start voting with their wallets  and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside  if they don't do it from the inside. But I'm more of the revolutionary  and I should be  I'm from Iceland. We have a long history of strong  courageous  independent women  ever since the Viking age. And I want to tell you when I first realized that women matter to the economy and to the society  I was seven    it happened to be my mother's birthday    October         . Women in Iceland took the day off. From work or from home  they took the day off  and nothing worked in Iceland. They marched into the center of Reykjavik  and they put women's issues onto the agenda. And some say this was the start of a global movement. For me it was the start of a long journey  but I decided that day to matter. Five years later  Iceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president    first female to become head of state  single mom  a breast cancer survivor who had had one of her breasts removed. And at one of the campaign sessions  she had one of her male contenders allude to the fact that she couldn't become president    she was a woman  and even half a woman. That night she won the election  because she came back    not just because of his crappy behavior    but she came back and said   Well  I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation  I'm going to lead it.  So I've had incredibly many women role models that have influenced who I am and where I am today. But in spite of that  I went through the first    or    years of my career mostly in denial of being a woman. Started in corporate America  and I was absolutely convinced that it was just about the individual  that women and men would have just the same opportunities. But I've come to conclude lately that it isn't like that. We are not the same  and it's great. Because of our differences  we create and sustain life. So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge. The final thought I want to leave with you is that I'm fed up with this tyranny of either or choices in life    either it's men or it's women. We need to start embracing the beauty of balance. So let's move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there  and let's start thinking about doing good business. That's how we change the world. That's the only sustainable future.

196,1924,1926,Handspring Puppet Co. 2011,Handspring Puppet Co.,male,The genius puppetry behind War Horse,Mar 2011,1074,Adrian Kohler  Well  we're here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse. Basil Jones  But actually we're going to start this evolution with a hyena. AK  The ancestor of the horse. Okay  we'll do something with it. Hahahaha. The hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called  Faustus in Africa   a Handspring Production from       where it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy. This production was directed by South African artist and theater director  William Kentridge. So it needed a very articulate front paw. But  like all puppets  it has other attributes. BJ  One of them is breath  and it kind of breathes. AK  Haa haa haaa. BJ  Breath is really important for us. It's the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage. It's the thing that distinguishes the puppet    AK  Oops. BJ  From an actor. Puppets always have to try to be alive. It's their kind of ur story onstage  that desperation to live. AK  Yeah  it's basically a dead object  as you can see  and it only lives because you make it. An actor struggles to die onstage  but a puppet has to struggle to live. And in a way that's a metaphor for life. BJ  So every moment it's on the stage  it's making the struggle. So we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up to the minute   th century technology    to turn nouns into verbs. AK  Well actually I prefer to say that it's an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life. BJ  Okay so. AK  It has ears that move passively when the head goes. BJ  And it has these bulkheads made out of plywood  covered with fabric    curiously similar  in fact  to the plywood canoes that Adrian's father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop. AK  In Port Elizabeth  the village outside Port Elizabeth in South Africa. BJ  His mother was a puppeteer. And when we met at art school and fell in love in       I hated puppets. I really thought they were so beneath me. I wanted to become an avant garde artist    and Punch and Judy was certainly not where I wanted to go. And  in fact  it took about    years to discover the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa  where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry  to learn a renewed  or a new  respect for this art form. AK  So in       I persuaded Basil and some friends of mine to form a puppet company. And    years later  miraculously  we collaborated with a company from Mali  the Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako  where we made a piece about a tall giraffe. It was just called  Tall Horse   which was a life sized giraffe. BJ  And here again  you see the same structure. The bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane  but it's ultimately the same structure. It's got two people inside it on stilts  which give them the height  and somebody in the front who's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head. AK  The person in the hind legs is also controlling the tail  a bit like the hyena    same mechanism  just a bit bigger. And he's controlling the ear movement. BJ  So this production was seen by Tom Morris of the National Theatre in London. And just around that time  his mother had said   Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo called 'War Horse'   AK  It's about a boy who falls in love with a horse. The horse is sold to the First World War  and he joins up to find his horse. BJ  So Tom gave us a call and said   Do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the National Theatre   AK  It seemed a lovely idea. BJ  But it had to ride. It had to have a rider. AK  It had to have a rider  and it had to participate in cavalry charges. A play about early   th century plowing technology and cavalry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the National Theatre in London. But they agreed to go along with it for a while. So we began with a test. BJ  This is Adrian and Thys Stander  who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse  and our next door neighbor Katherine  riding on a ladder. The weight is really difficult when it's up above your head. AK  And once we put Katherine through that particular brand of hell  we knew that we might be able to make a horse  which could be ridden. So we made a model. This is a cardboard model  a little bit smaller than the hyena. You'll notice that the legs are plywood legs and the canoe structure is still there. BJ  And the two manipulators are inside. But we didn't realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipulator  because we couldn't manipulate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time. AK  We started work on the prototype after the model was approved  and the prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated. We had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones. And we had a crate built for it. It had to be shipped to London. We were going to test drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town  and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet. BJ  So we got a camera  and we posed the puppet in various galloping stances. And we sent it off to the National Theatre  hoping that they believed that we created something that worked. AK  A month later  we were there in London with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us. BJ  About    people. AK  We were terrified. We opened the lid  we took the horse out  and it did work  it walked and it was able to be ridden. Here I have an    second clip of the very first walk of the prototype. This is in the National Theatre studio  the place where they cook new ideas. It had by no means got the green light yet. The choreographer  Toby Sedgwick  invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse  which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs  grew up into the big horse. And Nick Starr  the director of the National Theatre  saw that particular moment  he was standing next to me    he nearly wet himself. And so the show was given the green light. And we went back to Cape Town and redesigned the horse completely. Here is the plan. And here is our factory in Cape Town where we make horses. You can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there. The horses are completely handmade. There is very little   th century technology in them. We used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood and some of the aluminum pieces. But because they have to be light and flexible  and each one of them is different  they can't be mass produced  unfortunately. So here are some half finished horses ready to be worked in London. And now we would like to introduce you to Joey. Joey boy  you there  Joey. Joey. Joey  come here. No  no  I haven't got it. He's got it  it's in his pocket. BJ  Joey. AK  Joey  Joey  Joey  Joey. Come here. Stand here where people can see you. Move around. Come on. I'd just like to describe    I won't talk too loud. He might get irritated. Here  Craig is working the head. He has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand. Each one of them operates either an ear  separately  or the head  up and down. But he also controls the head directly by using his hand. The ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse. When they point right back  the horse is fearful or angry  depending upon what's going on in front of him  around him. Or  when he's more relaxed  the head comes down and the ears listen  either side. Horses' hearing is very important. It's almost more important than their eyesight. Over here  Tommy's got what you call the heart position. He's working the leg. You see the string tendon from the hyena  the hyena's front leg  automatically pulls the hoop up. Horses are so unpredictable. The way a hoof comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it's a convincing horse action. The hind legs have got the same action. BJ  And Mikey also has  in his fingers  the ability to move the tail from left to right  and up and down with the other hand. And together  there's quite a complex possibility of tail expression. AK  You want to say something about the breathing  BJ  We had a big challenge with breathing. Adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two and make it breathe like that    because that's how a horse would breathe  with an expanded chest. But we realized that  if that were to be happening  you wouldn't  as an audience  see the breath. So he made a channel in here  and the chest moves up and down in that channel. So it's anti naturalistic really  the up and down movement  but it feels like breath. And it's very  very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees. AK  Other emotional stuff. If I were to touch the horse here on his skin  the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside and get the skin to quiver. You'll notice  of course  that the puppet is made out of cane lines. And I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice  that I was making a three dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space. But of course  it was the cane is light  the cane is flexible  the cane is durable and the cane is moldable. And so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane. The skin itself is made out of a see through nylon mesh  which  if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear  she can light the background and the horse becomes ghostlike. You see the skeletal structure of it. Or if you light it from above  it becomes more solid. Again  that was a practical consideration. The guys inside the horse have to be able to see out. They have to be able to act along with their fellow actors in the production. And it's very much an in the moment activity that they're engaged in. It's three heads making one character. But now we would like you to put Joey through some paces. And plant. Thank you. And now just    All the way from sunny California we have Zem Joaquin who's going to ride the horse for us. So we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly. BJ  Not being able to talk to one another while they're onstage because they're mic'd. The sound that that very large chest makes  of the horse    the whinnying and the nickering and everything    that starts usually with one performer  carries on with a second person and ends with a third. AK  Mikey Brett from Leicestershire. Mikey Brett  Craig  Leo  Zem Joaquin and Basil and me. Thank you. Thank you.,,201103,6.18480487804878
197,1464,1466,Hans Rosling 2009,Hans Rosling,male,"Insights on HIV, in stunning data visuals",May 2009,583,AIDS was discovered       the virus      . These Gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was in      in the world  or how we estimate that it was. What we are showing here is    on this axis here  I'm showing percent of infected adults. And on this axis  I'm showing dollars per person in income. And the size of these bubbles  the size of the bubbles here  that shows how many are infected in each country  and the color is the continent. Now  you can see United States  in       had a very low percentage infected  but due to the big population  still a sizable bubble. There were quite many people infected in the United States. And  up there  you see Uganda. They had almost five percent infected  and quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country  then. And they were probably the most infected country in the world. Now  what has happened  Now you have understood the graph and now  in the next    seconds  we will play the HIV epidemic in the world. But first  I have a new invention here. I have solidified the beam of the laser pointer. So  ready  steady  go  First  we have the fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe. They went upwards like this. In Asia  the first country to be heavily infected was Thailand    they reached one to two percent. Then  Uganda started to turn back  whereas Zimbabwe skyrocketed  and some years later South Africa had a terrible rise of HIV frequency. Look  India got many infected  but had a low level. And almost the same happens here. See  Uganda coming down  Zimbabwe coming down  Russia went to one percent. In the last two to three years  we have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world.    years it took. But  steady state doesn't mean that things are getting better  it's just that they have stopped getting worse. And it has    the steady state is  more or less  one percent of the adult world population is HIV infected. It means    to    million people  the whole of California    every person  that's more or less what we have today in the world. Now  let me make a fast replay of Botswana. Botswana    upper middle income country in southern Africa  democratic government  good economy  and this is what happened there. They started low  they skyrocketed  they peaked up there in       and now they are down. But they are falling only slowly  because in Botswana  with good economy and governance  they can manage to treat people. And if people who are infected are treated  they don't die of AIDS. These percentages won't come down because people can survive    to    years. So there's some problem with these metrics now. But the poorer countries in Africa  the low income countries down here  there the rates fall faster  of the percentage infected  because people still die. In spite of PEPFAR  the generous PEPFAR  all people are not reached by treatment  and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries  only    percent are left on treatment after two years. It's not realistic with lifelong treatment for everyone in the poorest countries. But it's very good that what is done is being done. But focus now is back on prevention. It is only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it. Drugs is too costly    had we had the vaccine  or when we will get the vaccine  that's something more effective    but the drugs are very costly for the poor. Not the drug in itself  but the treatment and the care which is needed around it. So  when we look at the pattern  one thing comes out very clearly  you see the blue bubbles and people say HIV is very high in Africa. I would say  HIV is very different in Africa. You'll find the highest HIV rate in the world in African countries  and yet you'll find Senegal  down here    the same rate as United States. And you'll find Madagascar  and you'll find a lot of African countries about as low as the rest of the world. It's this terrible simplification that there's one Africa and things go on in one way in Africa. We have to stop that. It's not respectful  and it's not very clever to think that way. I had the fortune to live and work for a time in the United States. I found out that Salt Lake City and San Francisco were different. And so it is in Africa    it's a lot of difference. So  why is it so high  Is it war  No  it's not. Look here. War torn Congo is down there    two  three  four percent. And this is peaceful Zambia  neighboring country       percent. And there's good studies of the refugees coming out of Congo    they have two  three percent infected  and peaceful Zambia    much higher. There are now studies clearly showing that the wars are terrible  that rapes are terrible  but this is not the driving force for the high levels in Africa. So  is it poverty  Well if you look at the macro level  it seems more money  more HIV. But that's very simplistic  so let's go down and look at Tanzania. I will split Tanzania in five income groups  from the highest income to the lowest income  and here we go. The ones with the highest income  the better off    I wouldn't say rich    they have higher HIV. The difference goes from    percent down to four percent  and it is even bigger among women. There's a lot of things that we thought  that now  good research  done by African institutions and researchers together with the international researchers  show that that's not the case. So  this is the difference within Tanzania. And  I can't avoid showing Kenya. Look here at Kenya. I've split Kenya in its provinces. Here it goes. See the difference within one African country    it goes from very low level to very high level  and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest. So  what is it then  Why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries  Well  it is more common with multiple partners  there is less condom use  and there is age disparate sex    that is  older men tend to have sex with younger women. We see higher rates in younger women than younger men in many of these highly affected countries. But where are they situated  I will swap the bubbles to a map. Look  the highly infected are four percent of all population and they hold    percent of the HIV infected. HIV exists all over the world. Look  you have bubbles all over the world here. Brazil has many HIV infected. Arab countries not so much  but Iran is quite high. They have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran. India has many because they are many. Southeast Asia  and so on. But  there is one part of Africa    and the difficult thing is  at the same time  not to make a uniform statement about Africa  not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this  on one hand. On the other hand  try to say that this is not the case  because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now. UNAIDS have done good data available  finally  about the spread of HIV. It could be concurrency. It could be some virus types. It could be that there is other things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency. After all  if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex  the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in      . Don't jump to conclusions now on how to behave tonight and so on. But    and if you are in an unfavorable situation  more sexually transmitted diseases  it can be one in    . But what we think is that it could be concurrency. And what is concurrency  In Sweden  we have no concurrency. We have serial monogamy. Vodka  New Year's Eve    new partner for the spring. Vodka  Midsummer's Eve    new partner for the fall. Vodka    and it goes on like this  you know  And you collect a big number of exes. And we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic    terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years. HIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection and therefore  having more than one partner in the same month is much more dangerous for HIV than others. Probably  it's a combination of this. And what makes me so happy is that we are moving now towards fact when we look at this. You can get this chart  free. We have uploaded UNAIDS data on the Gapminder site. And we hope that when we act on global problems in the future we will not only have the heart  we will not only have the money  but we will also use the brain.

198,1522,1524,Hans Rosling 2009,Hans Rosling,male,Let my dataset change your mindset,Aug 2009,1127,I'm going to talk about your mindset. Does your mindset correspond to my dataset  If not  one or the other needs upgrading  isn't it  When I talk to my students about global issues  and I listen to them in the coffee break  they always talk about  we  and  them.  And when they come back into the lecture room I ask them   What do you mean with  we  and  them    Oh  it's very easy. It's the western world and it's the developing world   they say.  We learned it in college.  And what is the definition then   The definition  Everyone knows   they say. But then you know  I press them like this. So one girl said  very cleverly   It's very easy. Western world is a long life in a small family. Developing world is a short life in a large family.  And I like that definition  because it enabled me to transfer their mindset into the dataset. And here you have the dataset. So  you can see that what we have on this axis here is size of family. One  two  three  four  five children per woman on this axis. And here  length of life  life expectancy            . Exactly what the students said was their concept about the world. And really this is about the bedroom. Whether the man and woman decide to have small family  and take care of their kids  and how long they will live. It's about the bathroom and the kitchen. If you have soap  water and food  you know  you can live long. And the students were right. It wasn't that the world consisted    the world consisted here  of one set of countries over here  which had large families and short life. Developing world. And we had one set of countries up there which was the western world. They had small families and long life. And you are going to see here the amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime. Then the developing countries applied soap and water  vaccination. And all the developing world started to apply family planning. And partly to USA who help to provide technical advice and investment. And you see all the world moves over to a two child family  and a life with    to    years. But some countries remain back in this area here. And you can see we still have Afghanistan down here. We have Liberia. We have Congo. So we have countries living there. So the problem I had is that the worldview that my students had corresponds to reality in the world the year their teachers were born. And we  in fact  when we have played this over the world. I was at the Global Health Conference here in Washington last week  and I could see the wrong concept even active people in United States had  that they didn't realize the improvement of Mexico there  and China  in relation to United States. Look here when I move them forward. Here we go. They catch up. There's Mexico. It's on par with United States in these two social dimensions. There was less than five percent of the specialists in Global Health that was aware of this. This great nation  Mexico  has the problem that arms are coming from North  across the borders  so they had to stop that  because they have this strange relationship to the United States  you know. But if I would change this axis here  I would instead put income per person. Income per person. I can put that here. And we will then see a completely different picture. By the way  I'm teaching you how to use our website  Gapminder World  while I'm correcting this  because this is a free utility on the net. And when I now finally got it right  I can go back     years in history. And I can find United States up there. And I can let the other countries be shown. And now I have income per person on this axis. And United States only had some  one  two thousand dollars at that time. And the life expectancy was    to    years  on par with Afghanistan today. And what has happened in the world  I will show now. This is instead of studying history for one year at university. You can watch me for one minute now and you'll see the whole thing. You can see how the brown bubbles  which is west Europe  and the yellow one  which is the United States  they get richer and richer and also start to get healthier and healthier. And this is now     years ago  where the rest of the world remains behind. Here we come. And that was the influenza. That's why we are so scared about flu  isn't it  It's still remembered. The fall of life expectancy. And then we come up. Not until independence started. Look here You have China over there  you have India over there  and this is what has happened. Did you note there  that we have Mexico up there  Mexico is not at all on par with the United States  but they are quite close. And especially  it's interesting to see China and the United States during     years  because I have my oldest son now working for Google  after Google acquired this software. Because in fact  this is child labor. My son and his wife sat in a closet for many years and developed this. And my youngest son  who studied Chinese in Beijing. So they come in with the two perspectives I have  you know  And my son  youngest son who studied in Beijing  in China  he got a long term perspective. Whereas when my oldest son  who works for Google  he should develop by quarter  or by half year. Or Google is quite generous  so he can have one or two years to go. But in China they look generation after generation because they remember the very embarrassing period  for     years  when they went backwards. And then they would remember the first part of last century  which was really bad  and we could go by this so called Great Leap Forward. But this was     . Mao Tse Tung eventually brought health to China  and then he died  and then Deng Xiaoping started this amazing move forward. Isn't it strange to see that the United States first grew the economy  and then gradually got rich  Whereas China could get healthy much earlier  because they applied the knowledge of education  nutrition  and then also benefits of penicillin and vaccines and family planning. And Asia could have social development before they got the economic development. So to me  as a public health professor  it's not strange that all these countries grow so fast now. Because what you see here  what you see here is the flat world of Thomas Friedman  isn't it. It's not really  really flat. But the middle income countries    and this is where I suggest to my students  stop using the concept  developing world.  Because after all  talking about the developing world is like having two chapters in the history of the United States. The last chapter is about present  and president Obama  and the other is about the past  where you cover everything from Washington to Eisenhower. Because Washington to Eisenhower  that is what we find in the developing world. We could actually go to Mayflower to Eisenhower  and that would be put together into a developing world  which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way  which have great entrepreneurs  but also have the collapsing countries. So  how could we make better sense about this  Well  one way of trying is to see whether we could look at income distribution. This is the income distribution of peoples in the world  from   . This is where you have food to eat. These people go to bed hungry. And this is the number of people. This is      whether you have a public or a private health service system. This is where you can provide health service for your family and school for your children  and this is OECD countries  Green  Latin America  East Europe. This is East Asia  and the light blue there is South Asia. And this is how the world changed. It changed like this. Can you see how it's growing  And how hundreds of millions and billions is coming out of poverty in Asia  And it goes over here  And I come now  into projections  but I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there  you know  because    that's where the projections are not valid any longer. Probably the world will do this. and then it will continue forward like this. But more or less  this is what will happen  and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided. We have the high income countries here  with the United States as a leading power  we have the emerging economies in the middle  which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout  and we have the low income countries here. Yeah  this is a fact that from where the money comes  they have been saving  you know  over the last decade. And here we have the low income countries where entrepreneurs are. And here we have the countries in collapse and war  like Afghanistan  Somalia  parts of Congo  Darfur. We have all this at the same time. That's why it's so problematic to describe what has happened in the developing world. Because it's so different  what has happened there. And that's why I suggest a slightly different approach of what you would call it. And you have huge differences within countries also. I heard that your departments here were by regions. Here you have Sub Saharan Africa  South Asia  East Asia  Arab states  East Europe  Latin America  and OECD. And on this axis  GDP. And on this  heath  child survival  and it doesn't come as a surprise that Africa south of Sahara is at the bottom. But when I split it  when I split it into country bubbles  the size of the bubbles here is the population. Then you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius  completely different. There is such a difference within Sub Saharan Africa. And I can split the others. Here is the South Asian  Arab world. Now all your different departments. East Europe  Latin America  and OECD countries. And here were are. We have a continuum in the world. We cannot put it into two parts. It is Mayflower down here. It is Washington here  building  building countries. It's Lincoln here  advancing them. It's Eisenhower bringing modernity into the countries. And then it's United States today  up here. And we have countries all this way. Now  this is the important thing of understanding how the world has changed. At this point I decided to make a pause. And it is my task  on behalf of the rest of the world  to convey a thanks to the U.S. taxpayers  for Demographic Health Survey. Many are not aware of    no  this is not a joke. This is very serious. It is due to USA's continuous sponsoring during    years of the very good methodology for measuring child mortality that we have a grasp of what's happening in the world. And it is U.S. government at its best  without advocacy  providing facts  that it's useful for the society. And providing data free of charge on the internet  for the world to use. Thank you very much. Quite the opposite of the World Bank  who compiled data with government money  tax money  and then they sell it to add a little profit  in a very inefficient  Gutenberg way. But the people doing that at the World Bank are among the best in the world. And they are highly skilled professionals. It's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies to deal with the world in the modern way  as we do. And when it comes to free data and transparency  United States of America is one of the best. And that doesn't come easy from the mouth of a Swedish public health professor. And I'm not paid to come here  no. I would like to show you what happens with the data  what we can show with this data. Look here. This is the world. With income down there and child mortality. And what has happened in the world  Since       during the last    years we have had a fall in child mortality. And it is the DHS that makes it possible to know this. And we had an increase in income. And the blue former developing countries are mixing up with the former industrialized western world. We have a continuum. But we still have  of course  Congo  up there. We still have as poor countries as we have had  always  in history. And that's the bottom billion  where we've heard today about a completely new approach to do it. And how fast has this happened  Well  MDG  . The United States has not been so eager to use MDG  . But you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it  because it's the only child mortality that we can measure. And we used to say that it should fall four percent per year. Let's see what Sweden has done. We used to boast about fast social progress. That's where we were      .       Sweden was there. Same child mortality as Bangladesh had        though they had lower income. They started very well. They used the aid well. They vaccinated the kids. They get better water. And they reduced child mortality  with an amazing  .  percent per year. They beat Sweden. I run Sweden the same    year period. Second round  it's Sweden        against Egypt      . Here we go. Once again the USA is part of the reason here. They get safe water  they get food for the poor  and they get malaria eradicated.  .  percent. They are faster than the millennium development goal. And third chance for Sweden  against Brazil here. Brazil here has amazing social improvement over the last    years  and they go faster than Sweden. This means that the world is converging. The middle income countries  the emerging economy  they are catching up. They are moving to cities  where they also get better assistance for that. Well the Swedish students protest at this point. They say   This is not fair  because these countries had vaccines and antibiotics that were not available for Sweden. We have to do real time competition.  Okay. I give you Singapore  the year I was born. Singapore had twice the child mortality of Sweden. It's the most tropical country in the world  a marshland on the equator. And here we go. It took a little time for them to get independent. But then they started to grow their economy. And they made the social investment. They got away malaria. They got a magnificent health system that beat both the U.S. and Sweden. We never thought it would happen that they would win over Sweden  All these green countries are achieving millennium development goals. These yellow are just about to be doing this. These red are the countries that doesn't do it  and the policy has to be improved. Not simplistic extrapolation. We have to really find a way of supporting those countries in a better way. We have to respect the middle income countries on what they are doing. And we have to fact base the whole way we look at the world. This is dollar per person. This is HIV in the countries. The blue is Africa. The size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected. You see the tragedy in South Africa there. About    percent of the adult population are infected. And in spite of them having quite a high income  they have a huge number of HIV infected. But you also see that there are African countries down here. There is no such thing as an HIV epidemic in Africa. There's a number  five to    countries in Africa that has the same level as Sweden and United States. And there are others who are extremely high. And I will show you that what has happened in one of the best countries  with the most vibrant economy in Africa and a good governance  Botswana. They have a very high level. It's coming down. But now it's not falling  because there  with help from PEPFAR  it's working with treatment. And people are not dying. And you can see it's not that easy  that it is war which caused this. Because here  in Congo  there is war. And here  in Zambia  there is peace. And it's not the economy. Richer country has a little higher. If I split Tanzania in its income  the richer    percent in Tanzania has more HIV than the poorest one. And it's really different within each country. Look at the provinces of Kenya. They are very different. And this is the situation you see. It's not deep poverty. It's the special situation  probably of concurrent sexual partnership among part of the heterosexual population in some countries  or some parts of countries  in south and eastern Africa. Don't make it Africa. Don't make it a race issue. Make it a local issue. And do prevention at each place  in the way it can be done there. So to just end up  there are things of suffering in the one billion poorest  which we don't know. Those who live beyond the cellphone  those who have yet to see a computer  those who have no electricity at home. This is the disease  Konzo  I spent    years elucidating in Africa. It's caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation. It's similar to the pellagra epidemic in Mississippi in the '  s. It's similar to other nutritional diseases. It will never affect a rich person. We have seen it here in Mozambique. This is the epidemic in Mozambique. This is an epidemic in northern Tanzania. You never heard about the disease. But it's much more than Ebola that has been affected by this disease. Cause crippling throughout the world. And over the last two years        people has been crippled in the southern tip of Bandundu region. That used to be the illegal diamond trade  from the UNITA dominated area in Angola. That has now disappeared  and they are now in great economic problem. And one week ago  for the first time  there were four lines on the Internet. Don't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies and the great capacity of people in the middle income countries and in peaceful low income countries. There is still mystery in one billion. And we have to have more concepts than just developing countries and developing world. We need a new mindset. The world is converging  but    but    but not the bottom billion. They are still as poor as they've ever been. It's not sustainable  and it will not happen around one superpower. But you will remain one of the most important superpowers  and the most hopeful superpower  for the time to be. And this institution will have a very crucial role  not for United States  but for the world. So you have a very bad name  State Department. This is not the State Department. It's the World Department. And we have a high hope in you. Thank you very much.,Global health expert; data visionary,200908,6.1688721804511335
199,1743,1745,Hans Rosling 2010,Hans Rosling,male,"Global population growth, box by box",Jul 2010,587,I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people  and that was in     . I'm going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future  but I will not use digital technology  as I've done during my first five TEDTalks. Instead  I have progressed  and I am  today  launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKEA  this box. This box contains one billion people. And our teacher told us that the industrialized world        had one billion people. In the developing world  she said  they had two billion people. And they lived away then. There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world. In the industrialized world  people were healthy  educated  rich  and they had small families. And their aspiration was to buy a car. And in       all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this. This was the economic level at which Sweden was. But in contrast to this  in the developing world  far away  the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day. They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes. There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up. And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world  which we still use linguistically when we talk about  the West  and  the Developing World.  But the world has changed  and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world  and to understand it. And that's what I'm going to show you  because since      what has happened in the world up to      is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population. Just look how many. The world population has doubled since I went to school. And of course  there's been economic growth in the West. A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy  so the Western population moved over to here. And now their aspiration is not only to have a car. Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly. So this is where they are today. And the most successful of the developing countries  they have moved on  you know  and they have become emerging economies  we call them. They are now buying cars. And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company  Geely  they acquired the Volvo company  and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world. So there they are. And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes  they are still almost as poor as they were    years ago. The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions  the three billions here  which are also becoming emerging economies  because they are quite healthy  relatively well educated  and they already also have two to three children per woman  as those  richer also  have. And their aspiration now is  of course  to buy a bicycle  and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also. But this is the world we have today  no longer any gap. But the distance from the poorest here  the very poorest  to the very richest over here is wider than ever. But there is a continuous world from walking  biking  driving  flying    there are people on all levels  and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle. This is the new world we have today in     . And what will happen in the future  Well  I'm going to project into     . I was in Shanghai recently  and I listened to what's happening in China  and it's pretty sure that they will catch up  just as Japan did. All the projections  say that  this one  billion  will  only  grow with one to two or three percent.  But this second  grows with seven  eight percent  and then they will end up here. They will start flying. And these lower or middle income countries  the emerging income countries  they will also forge forwards economically. And if  but only if  we invest in the right green technology    so that we can avoid severe climate change  and energy can still be relatively cheap    then they will move all the way up here. And they will start to buy electric cars. This is what we will find there. So what about the poorest two billion  What about the poorest two billion here  Will they move on  Well  here population  growth  comes in because there  among emerging economies  we already have two to three children per woman  family planning is widely used  and population growth is coming to an end. Here  among the poorest   population is growing. So these  poorest  two billion will  in the next decades  increase to three billion  and they will thereafter increase to four billion. There is nothing    but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen    that can stop this  growth  from happening. Because we already have this  growth  in process. But if  and only if   the poorest  get out of poverty  they get education  they get improved child survival  they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come  to live  here  then population growth will stop in     . We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth. And let me show you why by converting back to the old time digital technology. Here I have on the screen my country bubbles. Every bubble is a country. The size is population. The colors show the continent. The yellow on there is the Americas  dark blue is Africa  brown is Europe  green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia. That's India and this is China. Size is population. Here I have children per woman  two children  four children  six children  eight children    big families  small families. The year is     . And down here  child survival  the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school     percent     percent     percent      and almost     percent  as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries. But look  this is the world my teacher talked about in       one billion Western world here    high child survival  small families    and all the rest  the rainbow of developing countries  with very large families and poor child survival. What has happened  I start the world. Here we go. Can you see  as the years pass by  child survival is increasing  They get soap  hygiene  education  vaccination  penicillin and then family planning. Family size is decreasing.  When  they get up to    percent child survival  then families decrease  and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there  to small families . Look  Bangladesh catching up with India. The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size  but we still have the poorest billion. Can you see the poorest billion  those  two  boxes I had over here  They are still up here. And they still have a child survival of only    to    percent  meaning that if you have six children born  there will be at least four who survive to the next generation. And the population will double in one generation. So the only way of really getting world population  growth  to stop is to continue to improve child survival to    percent. That's why investments by Gates Foundation  UNICEF and aid organizations  together with national government in the poorest countries  are so good  because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world. We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things. Child survival is the new green. It's only by child survival that we will stop population growth. And will it happen  Well  I'm not an optimist  neither am I a pessimist. I'm a very serious  possibilist.  It's a new category where we take emotion apart  and we just work analytically with the world. It can be done. We can have a much more just world. With green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty  and global governance  the world can become like this. And look at the position of the old West. Remember when this blue box was all alone  leading the world  living its own life. This will not happen  again . The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world    nothing more  nothing less. But it's a very important role. Do it well and get used to it. Thank you very much.,Global health expert; data visionary,201007,6.297132352941179
200,1801,1803,Hans Rosling 2010,Hans Rosling,male,The good news of the decade? We're winning the war against child mortality,Oct 2010,913,We are here today because  the  United Nations have defined goals for the progress of countries. They're called Millennium Development Goals. And the reason I really like these goals is that there are eight of them. And by specifying eight different goals  the United Nations has said that there are so many things needed to change in a country in order to get the good life for people. Look here    you have to end poverty  education  gender  child and maternal health  control infections  protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspect from aid to trade. There's a second reason I like these development goals  and that is because each and every one is measured. Take child mortality  the aim here is to reduce child mortality by two thirds  from      to     . That's a four percent reduction per year    and this  with measuring. That's what makes the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing  a better life for people. And what I'm so happy about with this is that we have already documented that there are many countries in Asia  in the Middle East  in Latin America and East Europe that  are  reducing with this rate. And even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year  and Turkey with seven percent per year. So there's good news. But then I hear people saying   There is no progress in Africa. And there's not even statistics on Africa to know what is happening.  I'll prove them wrong on both points. Come with me to the wonderful world of statistics. I bring you to the webpage  ChildMortality.org  where you can take deaths in children below five years of age for all countries    it's done by U.N. specialists. And I will take Kenya as an example. Here you see the data. Don't panic    don't panic now  I'll help you through this. It looks nasty  like in college when you didn't like statistics. But first thing  when you see dots like this  you have to ask yourself  from where do the data come  What is the origin of the data  Is it so that in Kenya  there are doctors and other specialists who write the death certificate at the death of the child and it's sent to the statistical office  No    low income countries like Kenya still don't have that level of organization. It exists  but it's not complete because so many deaths occur in the home with the family  and it's not registered. What we rely on is not an incomplete system. We have interviews  we have surveys. And this is highly professional female interviewers who sit down for one hour with a woman and ask her about  her  birth history. How many children did you have  Are they alive  If they died  at what age and what year  And then this is done in a representative sample of thousands of women in the country and put together in what used to be called a demographic health survey report. But these surveys are costly  so they can only be done  in  three  to five year intervals. But they have good quality. So this is a limitation. And all these colored lines here are results  each color is one survey. But that's too complicated for today  so I'll simplify it for you  and I give you one average point for each survey. This was                   '   and     . And when the experts in the U.N. have got these surveys in place in their database  then they use advanced mathematical formulas to produce a trend line  and the trend line looks like this. See here    it's the best fit they can get of this point. But watch out    they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing. And they estimated that in       Kenya had per child mortality of    . And I was sad  because we could see this reversal in Kenya with an increased child mortality in the   s. It was so tragic. But in June  I got a mail in my inbox from Demographic Health Surveys  and it showed good news from Kenya. I was so happy. This was the estimate of the new survey. Then it just took another three months for  the  U.N. to get it into their server  and on Friday we got the new trend line    it was down here. Isn't it nice    isn't it nice  yeah  I was actually  on Friday  sitting in front of my computer  and I saw the death rate fall from     to    just that morning. So we celebrated. But now  when you have this trend line  how do we measure progress  I'm going into some details here  because  the  U.N. do it like this. They start  in          they measure to     . They say    .  percent  no progress.  That's unfair. As a professor  I think I have the right to propose something differently. I would say  at least do this       years is enough to follow the trend. It's two surveys  and you can see what's happening now. They have  .  percent. Had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya  I may have joined these two points. So what I'm telling you is that we know the child mortality. We have a decent trend. It's coming into some tricky things then when we are measuring MDGs. And the reason here for Africa is especially important  because '  s was a bad decade  not only in Kenya  but across Africa. The HIV epidemic peaked. There was resistance for the old malaria drugs  until we got the new drugs. We got  later  the mosquito netting. And there was socio economic problems  which are now being solved at a much better scale. So look at the average here    this is the average for all of sub Saharan Africa. And  the  U.N. says it's a reduction with  .  percent. Now this sounds a little theoretical  but it's not so theoretical. You know  these economists  they love money  they want more and more of it  they want it to grow. So they calculate the percent annual growth rate of  the  economy. We in public health  we hate child death  so we want less and less and less of child deaths. So we calculate the percent reduction per year  but it's sort of the same percentage. If your economy grows with four percent  you ought to reduce child mortality four percent  if it's used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want it. So is this fair now to measure this over    years  An economist would never do that. I have just divided it into two periods. In the   s  only  .  percent  only  .  percent. Whereas now  second gear    it's like Africa had first gear  now they go into second gear. But even this is not a fair representation of Africa  because it's an average  it's an average speed of reduction in Africa. And look here when I take you into my bubble graphs. Still here  child death per       on that axis. Here we have  the  year. And I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG. I start    years ago when Africa celebrated independence in most countries. I give you Congo  which was high  Ghana    lower. And Kenya    even lower. And what has happened over the years since then  Here we go. You can see  with independence  literacy improved and vaccinations started  smallpox was eradicated  hygiene was improved  and things got better. But then  in the '  s  watch out here. Congo got into civil war  and they leveled off here. Ghana got very ahead  fast. This was the backlash in Kenya  and Ghana bypassed  but then Kenya and Ghana go down together    still a standstill in Congo. That's where we are today. You can see it doesn't make sense to make an average of this zero improvement and this very fast improvement. Time has come to stop thinking about sub Saharan Africa as one place. Their countries are so different  and they merit to be recognized in the same way  as we don't talk about Europe as one place. I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different    everyone knows that. And they are judged  each country  on how they are doing. So let me show the wider picture. My country  Sweden        we were up there. What a strange personality disorder we must have  counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate. It's very strange. It's sort of embarrassing. But we had that habit in Sweden  you know  that we counted all the child deaths  even if we didn't do anything about it. And then  you see  these were famine years. These were bad years  and people got fed up with Sweden. My ancestors moved to the United States. And eventually  soon they started to get better and better here. And here we got better education  and we got health service  and child mortality came down. We never had a war  Sweden was in peace all this time. But look  the rate of lowering in Sweden was not fast. Sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early. We had primary school actually started in     . And then you get that wonderful effect when we got female literacy one generation later. You have to realize that the investments we do in progress are long term investments. It's not about just five years    it's long term investments. And Sweden never reached  the  Millennium Development Goal rate   .  percent when I calculated. So we are off track    that's what Sweden is. But you don't talk about it so much. We want others to be better than we were  and indeed  others have been better. Let me show you Thailand  see what a success story  Thailand from the     s    how they went down here and reached almost the same child mortality levels as Sweden. And I'll give you another story    Egypt  the most hidden  glorious success in public health. Egypt was up here in       higher than Congo. The Nile Delta was a misery for children with diarrheal disease and malaria and a lot of problems. And then they got the Aswan Dam. They got electricity in their homes  they increased education and they got primary health care. And down they went  you know. And they got safer water  they eradicated malaria. And isn't it a success story. Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality is fully possible. And the good thing is that Ghana today is going with the same rate as Egypt did at its fastest. Kenya is now speeding up. Here we have a problem. We have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill. Now  let me now bring you to a wider picture  a wider picture of child mortality. I'm going to show you the relationship between child mortality on this axis here    this axis here is child mortality    and here I have the family size. The relationship between child mortality and family size. One  two  three  four children per woman  six  seven  eight children per woman. This is  once again             years ago. Each bubble is a country    the color  you can see  a continent. The dark blue here is sub Saharan Africa. And the size of the bubble is the population. And these are the so called  developing  countries. They had high  or very high  child mortality and family size  six to eight. And the ones over there  they were so called Western countries. They had low child mortality and small families. What has happened  What I want you  to do  now is to see with your own eyes the relation between fall in child mortality and decrease in family size. I just want not to have any room for doubt    you have to see that for yourself. This is what happened. Now I start the world. Here we come down with the eradication of smallpox  better education  health service. It got down there    China comes into the Western box here. And here Brazil is in the Western Box. India is approaching. The first African countries coming into the Western box  and we get a lot a new neighbors. Welcome to a decent life. Come on. We want everyone down there. This is the vision we have  isn't it. And look now  the first African countries here are coming in. There we are today. There is no such thing as a  Western world  and  developing world.  This is the report from  the  U.N.  which came out on Friday. It's very good     Levels and Trends in Child Mortality     except this page. This page is very bad  it's a categorization of countries. It labels  developing countries      I can read from the list here    developing countries  Republic of Korea    South Korea. Huh  They get Samsung  how can they be  a  developing country  They have here Singapore. They have the lowest child mortality in the world  Singapore. They bypassed Sweden five years ago  and they are labeled a developing country. They have here Qatar. It's the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera. How the heck could they be  a  developing country  This is crap. The rest here is good    the rest is good. We have to have a modern concept  which fits to the data. And we have to realize that we are all going to into this  down to here. What is the importance now with the relations here. Look    even if we look in Africa    these are the African countries. You can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality and decreasing family size  even within Africa. It's very clear that this is what happens. And a very important piece of research came out on Friday from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle showing that almost    percent of the fall in child mortality can be attributed to female education. That is  when we get girls in school  we'll get an impact    to    years later  which is a secular trend which is very strong. That's why we must have that long term perspective  but we must measure the impact over    year periods. It's fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down in the corner where we all would like to live together. And of course  lowering child mortality is a matter of utmost importance from humanitarian aspects. It's a decent life for children  we are talking about. But it is also a strategic investment in the future of all mankind  because it's about the environment. We will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don't stabilize the world population. Let's be clear about that. And the way to do that  that is to get child mortality down  get access to family planning and behind that drive female education. And that is fully possible. Let's do it. Thank you very much.,Global health expert; data visionary,201010,6.056787974683541
206,1240,1242,Helen Fisher 2006,Helen Fisher,female,"Why we love, why we cheat",Sep 2006,1399,I'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century  and perhaps in the next        years. But I want to start with my work on romantic love  because that's my most recent work. What I and my colleagues did was put    people  who were madly in love  into a functional MRI brain scanner.    who were madly in love and their love was accepted  and    who were madly in love and they had just been dumped. And so I want to tell you about that first  and then go on into where I think love is going.  What 'tis to love   Shakespeare said. I think our ancestors    I think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago. I started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was by looking at the last    years of the psychological research and as it turns out  there's a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love. The first thing that happens is  a person begins to take on what I call   special meaning.  As a truck driver once said to me   The world had a new center  and that center was Mary Anne.  George Bernard Shaw said it differently.  Love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another.  And indeed  that's what we do. And then you just focus on this person. You can list what you don't like about them  but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do. As Chaucer said   Love is blind.  In trying to understand romantic love  I decided I would read poetry from all over the world  and I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth century China  because it's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman. It's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot    their car is different from every other car in the parking lot. Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party. And in this case  a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat. And it goes like this. It's by a guy called Yuan Zhen.  I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat. The night I brought you home  I watched you roll it out.  He became hooked on a sleeping mat  probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain  just like with you and me. But anyway  not only does this person take on special meaning  you focus your attention on them. You aggrandize them. But you have intense energy. As one Polynesian said   I felt like jumping in the sky.  You're up all night. You're walking till dawn. You feel intense elation when things are going well  mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly. Real dependence on this person. As one businessman in New York said to me   Anything she liked  I liked.  Simple. Romantic love is very simple. You become extremely sexually possessive. You know  if you're just sleeping with somebody casually  you don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else. But the moment you fall in love  you become extremely sexually possessive of them. I think there's a Darwinian purpose to this. The whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team. But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving  an intense craving to be with a particular person  not just sexually  but emotionally. It would be nice to go to bed with them  but you want them to call you on the telephone  to invite you out  etc.  to tell you that they love you. The other main characteristic is motivation. The motor in the brain begins to crank  and you want this person. And last but not least  it is an obsession. Before I put these people in the MRI machine  I would ask them all kinds of questions. But my most important question was always the same. It was   What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person   And indeed  they would say   All day. All night. I can never stop thinking about him or her.  And then  the very last question    I would always have to work myself up to this question  because I'm not a psychologist. I don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation. My final question was always the same. I would say   Would you die for him or her   And  indeed  these people would say  Yes   as if I had asked them to pass the salt. I was just staggered by it. So we scanned their brains  looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph  with a distraction task in between. So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state. And we found activity in a lot of brain regions. In fact  one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine. And indeed  that's exactly what happens. I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion. In fact  I had always thought it was a series of emotions  from very high to very low. But actually  it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind  the wanting part of the mind  the craving part of the mind. The kind of part of the mind when you're reaching for that piece of chocolate  when you want to win that promotion at work. The motor of the brain. It's a drive. And in fact  I think it's more powerful than the sex drive. You know  if you ask somebody to go to bed with you  and they say   No  thank you   you certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression. But certainly  around the world  people who are rejected in love will kill for it. People live for love. They kill for love. They die for love. They have songs  poems  novels  sculptures  paintings  myths  legends. In over     societies  people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system. I have come to think it's one of the most powerful brain systems on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow. And I've also come to think that it's one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction. One is the sex drive  the craving for sexual gratification. W.H. Auden called it an  intolerable neural itch   and indeed  that's what it is. It keeps bothering you a little bit  like being hungry. The second of these three brain systems is romantic love  that elation  obsession of early love. And the third brain system is attachment  that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long term partner. And I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there  looking for a whole range of partners. You can feel it when you're just driving along in your car. It can be focused on nobody. I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time  thereby conserving mating time and energy. And I think that attachment  the third brain system  evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being at least long enough to raise a child together as a team. So with that preamble  I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends. One of the last        years and the other  certainly of the last    years  that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems  lust  romantic love and deep attachment to a partner. The first is women working  moving into the workforce. I've looked at     societies through the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations. Everywhere in the world      out of     of them  women are not only moving into the job market    sometimes very  very slowly  but they are moving into the job market    and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women in terms of economic power  health and education. It's very slow. For every trend on this planet  there's a counter trend. We all know of them  but nevertheless    the Arabs say   The dogs may bark  but the caravan moves on.  And  indeed  that caravan is moving on. Women are moving back into the job market. And I say back into the job market  because this is not new. For millions of years  on the grasslands of Africa  women commuted to work to gather their vegetables. They came home with    to    percent of the evening meal. The double income family was the standard. And women were regarded as just as economically  socially and sexually powerful as men. In short  we're really moving forward to the past. Then  women's worst invention was the plow. With the beginning of plow agriculture  men's roles became extremely powerful. Women lost their ancient jobs as collectors  but then with the industrial revolution and the post industrial revolution they're moving back into the job market. In short  they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago         years ago          years ago. We are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal. And it's going to have an impact. I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community. I'll say just a couple of things  and then go on to sex and love. There's a lot of gender differences  anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child. I don't know why they want to think that men and women are alike. There's much we have in common  but there's a whole lot that we do not have in common. We are    in the words of Ted Hughes   I think that we are like two feet. We need each other to get ahead.  But we did not evolve to have the same brain. And we're finding more and more gender differences in the brain. I'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love. One of them is women's verbal ability. Women can talk. Women's ability to find the right word rapidly  basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle  when estrogen levels peak. But even at menstruation  they're better than the average man. Women can talk. They've been doing it for a million years  words were women's tools. They held that baby in front of their face  cajoling it  reprimanding it  educating it with words. And  indeed  they're becoming a very powerful force. Even in places like India and Japan  where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market  they're moving into journalism. And I think that the television is like the global campfire. We sit around it and it shapes our minds. Almost always  when I'm on TV  the producer who calls me  who negotiates what we're going to say  is a woman. In fact  Solzhenitsyn once said   To have a great writer is to have another government.  Today    percent of people who are writers in America are women. It's one of many  many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market. They've got incredible people skills  negotiating skills. They're highly imaginative. We now know the brain circuitry of imagination  of long term planning. They tend to be web thinkers. Because the female parts of the brain are better connected  they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think  put them into more complex patterns  see more options and outcomes. They tend to be contextual  holistic thinkers  what I call web thinkers. Men tend to    and these are averages    tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous  focus on what they do  and move in a more step by step thinking pattern. They're both perfectly good ways of thinking. We need both of them to get ahead. In fact  there's many more male geniuses in the world. And there's also many more male idiots in the world. When the male brain works well  it works extremely well. And what I really think that we're doing is  we're moving towards a collaborative society  a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued and employed. But in fact  women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life. Foremost  women are starting to express their sexuality. I'm always astonished when people come to me and say   Why is it that men are so adulterous    Why do you think more men are adulterous than women    Well  men are more adulterous   And I say   Who do you think these men are sleeping with   And    basic math  Anyway. In the Western world  women start sooner at sex  have more partners  express less remorse for the partners that they do  marry later  have fewer children  leave bad marriages in order to get good ones. We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression. And  indeed  once again we're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago  because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today. We're also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality. They're now saying that the   st century is going to be the century of what they call the  symmetrical marriage   or the  pure marriage   or the  companionate marriage.  This is a marriage between equals  moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit. We're also seeing a rise of romantic love.    percent of American women and    percent of American men would not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner  if they were not in love with that person. People around the world  in a study of    societies  want to be in love with the person that they marry. Indeed  arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life. I even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend. The first one being women moving into the job market  the second one being the aging world population. They're now saying that in America  that middle age should be regarded as up to age   . Because in that highest age category of    to     as much as    percent of people have nothing really wrong with them. So we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age. For one of my books  I looked at divorce data in    societies. And as it turns out  the older you get  the less likely you are to divorce. So the divorce rate right now is stable in America  and it's actually beginning to decline. It may decline some more. I would even say that with Viagra  estrogen replacement  hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women    women have never been as interesting as they are now. Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated  so interesting  so capable. And so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages  that time is now. However  there's always kinds of complications in this. These three brain systems    lust  romantic love and attachment    don't always go together. They can go together  by the way. That's why casual sex isn't so casual. With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine. Dopamine's associated with romantic love  and you can just fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with. With orgasm  then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin    those are associated with attachment. This is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you've made love to them. But these three brain systems  lust  romantic love and attachment  aren't always connected to each other. You can feel deep attachment to a long term partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else  while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners. In short  we're capable of loving more than one person at a time. In fact  you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else. It's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do. So I don't think  honestly  we're an animal that was built to be happy  we are an animal that was built to reproduce. I think the happiness we find  we make. And I think  however  we can make good relationships with each other. So I want to conclude with two things. I want to conclude with a worry  and with a wonderful story. The worry is about antidepressants. Over     million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the United States. And these drugs are going generic. They are seeping around the world. I know one girl who's been on these antidepressants  SSRIs  serotonin enhancing antidepressants    since she was   . She's   . She's been on them ever since she was   . I've got nothing against people who take them short term  when they're going through something horrible. They want to commit suicide or kill somebody else. I would recommend it. But more and more people in the United States are taking them long term. And indeed  what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin. And by raising levels of serotonin  you suppress the dopamine circuit. Everybody knows that. Dopamine is associated with romantic love. Not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit  but they kill the sex drive. And when you kill the sex drive  you kill orgasm. And when you kill orgasm  you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment. The things are connected in the brain. And when you tamper with one brain system  you're going to tamper with another. I'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place. So now    Thank you. I want to end with a story. And then  just a comment. I've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for    years. I'm an identical twin  I am interested in why we're all alike. Why you and I are alike  why the Iraqis and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River are all alike. And about a year ago  an Internet dating service  Match.com  came to me and asked me if I would design a new dating site for them. I said   I don't know anything about personality. You know  I don't know. Do you think you've got the right person   They said   Yes.  It got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another. That's my current project  it will be my next book. There's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another. Timing is important. Proximity is important. Mystery is important. You fall in love with somebody who's somewhat mysterious  in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain  probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love. You fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your  love map   an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up. And I also think that you gravitate to certain people  actually  with somewhat complementary brain systems. And that's what I'm now contributing to this. But I want to tell you a story  to illustrate. I've been carrying on here about the biology of love. I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it  too  the magic of it. It's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one    probably a true story. It was a graduate student    I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues    Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook. That's where we put our people in the MRI machine. And this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student  and she was not in love with him. And they were all at a conference in Beijing. And he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody  you can drive up the dopamine in the brain  and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love. So he decided he'd put science to work. And he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him. And sure enough    I've never been in one  but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and it's crazy and it's noisy and it's exciting. He figured that this would drive up the dopamine  and she'd fall in love with him. So off they go and she's squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time. An hour later they get down off of the rickshaw  and she throws her hands up and she says   Wasn't that wonderful   And   Wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome   There's magic to love  But I will end by saying that millions of years ago  we evolved three basic drives  the sex drive  romantic love and attachment to a long term partner. These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain. They're going to survive as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called  this mortal coil.  Thank you.

207,657,659,Henry Lin 2014,Henry Lin,male,"What we can learn from galaxies far, far away",Feb 2014,393,Here are some images of clusters of galaxies. They're exactly what they sound like. They are these huge collections of galaxies  bound together by their mutual gravity. So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars  but collections of stars  or galaxies. Now  by showing you some of these images  I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects  but more than that  I think galaxy clusters are mysterious  they are surprising  and they're useful. Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories. And as laboratories  to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them. And I think there are four major types  and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big. So  how big  Well  here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent  it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster. And  in fact  if you look very carefully you'll be able to see rings around this cluster. Now  to give you a number  this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns. It's just mind boggling how  massive these systems can get. But more than their mass  they have this additional feature. They are essentially isolated systems  so if we like  we can think of them as a scaled down version of the entire universe. And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales  such as  how does gravity work  might be answered by studying these systems. So that was very big. The second things is very hot. Okay  if I take an image of a galaxy cluster  and I subtract away all of the starlight  what I'm left with is this big  blue blob. This is in false color. It's actually X ray light that we're seeing. And the question is  if it's not galaxies  what is emitting this light  The answer is hot gas  million degree gas    in fact  it's plasma. And the reason why it's so hot goes back to the previous slide. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds  and great speeds means great temperatures. So this is the main idea  but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us  still puzzle us  and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot. Third thing  probing the very small. Now  to explain this  I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something  very  very mysterious  which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that  doesn't like to interact very much  except through gravity  and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist  you want to know what happens  when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception. Well  how do we do this  To answer that question  I'm going to have to ask another one  which is  what happens when galaxy clusters collide  Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe  scaled down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter  and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas  and  of course  you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge  huge scale. And this is very important  because what it means is that very  very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab  might be compounded and compounded into something that we could  possibly observe in nature. So  it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter  the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small  is precisely because they are so very big. Fourth thing  the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay  if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air  I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever increasing rate. Similarly  cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding. They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name  and they call it dark energy. And  again  we want to learn more about it. So  one particular question that we have is  how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales  Depending on how strong it is  maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well  the problem with the large scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well  I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic  the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly  I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. So  as I come to a close  you might feel slightly cheated. I mean  I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful  and I've given some reasons  but what is their use really  Well  to answer this  I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say   If I had asked people what they wanted  they would have said faster horses.  Today  we as a society are faced with many  many difficult problems. And the solutions to these  problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity. So  yes  we need to focus  yes  we need to concentrate  but we also need to remember that innovation  ingenuity  inspiration    these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us. Thanks.,Student scientist,201402,6.052090163934425

224,1671,1673,James Nachtwey 2007,James Nachtwey,male,My wish: Let my photographs bear witness,Apr 2007,1281,As someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible  standing in front of an audience is a cross between an out of body experience and a deer caught in the headlights  so please forgive me for violating one of the TED commandments by relying on words on paper  and I only hope I'm not struck by lightning bolts before I'm done. I'd like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me to become a documentary photographer. I was a student in the '  s  a time of social upheaval and questioning  and on a personal level  an awakening sense of idealism. The war in Vietnam was raging  the Civil Rights Movement was under way  and pictures had a powerful influence on me. Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing  and photographers were telling us another. I believed the photographers  and so did millions of other Americans. Their images fueled resistance to the war and to racism. They not only recorded history  they helped change the course of history. Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and  as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience  change became not only possible  but inevitable. I saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism  specifically visual journalism  can bring into focus both the benefits and the cost of political policies. It can give credit to sound decision making  adding momentum to success. In the face of poor political judgment or political inaction  it becomes a kind of intervention  assessing the damage and asking us to reassess our behavior. It puts a human face on issues which from afar can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact. What happens at ground level  far from the halls of power  happens to ordinary citizens one by one. And I understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view. It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice. And as a reaction  it stimulates public opinion and gives impetus to public debate  thereby preventing the interested parties from totally controlling the agenda  much as they would like to. Coming of age in those days made real the concept that the free flow of information is absolutely vital for a free and dynamic society to function properly. The press is certainly a business  and in order to survive it must be a successful business  but the right balance must be found between marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility. Society's problems can't be solved until they're identified. On a higher plane  the press is a service industry  and the service it provides is awareness. Every story does not have to sell something. There's also a time to give. That was a tradition I wanted to follow. Seeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution    I wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer. But I was driven by an inherent sense that a picture that revealed the true face of war would almost by definition be an anti war photograph. I'd like to take you on a visual journey through some of the events and issues I've been involved in over the past    years. In       I went to Northern Ireland.    IRA prisoners were in the process of starving themselves to death in protest against conditions in jail. The reaction on the streets was violent confrontation. I saw that the front lines of contemporary wars are not on isolated battlefields  but right where people live. During the early '  s  I spent a lot of time in Central America  which was engulfed by civil wars that straddled the ideological divide of the Cold War. In Guatemala  the central government    controlled by a oligarchy of European decent    was waging a scorched Earth campaign against an indigenous rebellion  and I saw an image that reflected the history of Latin America  conquest through a combination of the Bible and the sword. An anti Sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded as Commander Zero attacked a town in Southern Nicaragua. A destroyed tank belonging to Somoza's national guard was left as a monument in a park in Managua  and was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child. At the same time  a civil war was taking place in El Salvador  and again  the civilian population was caught up in the conflict. I've been covering the Palestinian Israeli conflict since     . This is a moment from the beginning of the second intifada  in       when it was still stones and Molotovs against an army. In       the uprising escalated into an armed conflict  and one of the major incidents was the destruction of the Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank town of Jenin. Without the political will to find common ground  the continual friction of tactic and counter tactic only creates suspicion and hatred and vengeance  and perpetuates the cycle of violence. In the '  s  after the breakup of the Soviet Union  Yugoslavia fractured along ethnic fault lines  and civil war broke out between Bosnia  Croatia and Serbia. This is a scene of house to house fighting in Mostar  neighbor against neighbor. A bedroom  the place where people share intimacy  where life itself is conceived  became a battlefield. A mosque in northern Bosnia was destroyed by Serbian artillery and was used as a makeshift morgue. Dead Serbian soldiers were collected after a battle and used as barter for the return of prisoners or Bosnian soldiers killed in action. This was once a park. The Bosnian soldier who guided me told me that all of his friends were there now. At the same time in South Africa  after Nelson Mandela had been released from prison  the black population commenced the final phase of liberation from apartheid. One of the things I had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my anger. I had to use it  channel its energy  turn it into something that would clarify my vision  instead of clouding it. In Transkei  I witnessed a rite of passage into manhood  of the Xhosa tribe. Teenage boys lived in isolation  their bodies covered with white clay. After several weeks  they washed off the white and took on the full responsibilities of men. It was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic of the political struggle that was changing the face of South Africa. Children in Soweto playing on a trampoline. Elsewhere in Africa there was famine. In Somalia  the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out. Farmers were driven off their land  and crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen. Starvation was being used as a weapon of mass destruction    primitive but extremely effective. Hundreds of thousands of people were exterminated  slowly and painfully. The international community responded with massive humanitarian relief  and hundreds of thousands of more lives were saved. American troops were sent to protect the relief shipments  but they were eventually drawn into the conflict  and after the tragic battle in Mogadishu  they were withdrawn. In southern Sudan  another civil war saw similar use of starvation as a means of genocide. Again  international NGOs  united under the umbrella of the U.N.  staged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved. I'm a witness  and I want my testimony to be honest and uncensored. I also want it to be powerful and eloquent  and to do as much justice as possible to the experience of the people I'm photographing. This man was in an NGO feeding center  being helped as much as he could be helped. He literally had nothing. He was a virtual skeleton  yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move. He had not given up  and if he didn't give up  how could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope  In       after three months of covering the South African election  I saw the inauguration of Nelson Mandela  and it was the most uplifting thing I've ever seen. It exemplified the best that humanity has to offer. The next day I left for Rwanda  and it was like taking the express elevator to hell. This man had just been liberated from a Hutu death camp. He allowed me to photograph him for quite a long time  and he even turned his face toward the light  as if he wanted me to see him better. I think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the world. This time  maybe confused or discouraged by the military disaster in Somalia  the international community remained silent  and somewhere around         people were slaughtered by their own countrymen    sometimes their own neighbors    using farm implements as weapons. Perhaps because a lesson had been learned by the weak response to the war in Bosnia and the failure in Rwanda  when Serbia attacked Kosovo  international action was taken much more decisively. NATO forces went in  and the Serbian army withdrew. Ethnic Albanians had been murdered  their farms destroyed and a huge number of people forcibly deported. They were received in refugee camps set up by NGOs in Albania and Macedonia. The imprint of a man who had been burned inside his own home. The image reminded me of a cave painting  and echoed how primitive we still are in so many ways. Between      and '    I covered the first two wars in Chechnya from inside Grozny. This is a Chechen rebel on the front line against the Russian army. The Russians bombarded Grozny constantly for weeks  killing mainly the civilians who were still trapped inside. I found a boy from the local orphanage wandering around the front line. My work has evolved from being concerned mainly with war to a focus on critical social issues as well. After the fall of Ceausescu  I went to Romania and discovered a kind of gulag of children  where thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions. Ceausescu had imposed a quota on the number of children to be produced by each family  thereby making women's bodies an instrument of state economic policy. Children who couldn't be supported by their families were raised in government orphanages. Children with birth defects were labeled incurables  and confined for life to inhuman conditions. As reports began to surface  again international aid went in. Going deeper into the legacy of the Eastern European regimes  I worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution  where there had been no regard for the environment or the health of either workers or the general population. An aluminum factory in Czechoslovakia was filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust  and four out of five workers came down with cancer. After the fall of Suharto in Indonesia  I began to explore conditions of poverty in a country that was on its way towards modernization. I spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a railway embankment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident. When the story was published  unsolicited donations poured in. A trust fund was established  and the family now lives in a house in the countryside and all their basic necessities are taken care of. It was a story that wasn't trying to sell anything. Journalism had provided a channel for people's natural sense of generosity  and the readers responded. I met a band of homeless children who'd come to Jakarta from the countryside  and ended up living in a train station. By the age of    or     they'd become beggars and drug addicts. The rural poor had become the urban poor  and in the process  they'd become invisible. These heroin addicts in detox in Pakistan reminded me of figures in a play by Beckett  isolated  waiting in the dark  but drawn to the light. Agent Orange was a defoliant used during the Vietnam War to deny cover to the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese army. The active ingredient was dioxin  an extremely toxic chemical that was sprayed in vast quantities  and whose effects passed through the genes to the next generation. In       I began documenting global health issues  concentrating first on AIDS in Africa. I tried to tell the story through the work of caregivers. I thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped  whether by international NGOs or by local grassroots organizations. So many children have been orphaned by the epidemic that grandmothers have taken the place of parents  and a lot of children had been born with HIV. A hospital in Zambia. I began documenting the close connection between HIV AIDS and tuberculosis. This is an MSF hospital in Cambodia. My pictures can play a supporting role to the work of NGOs by shedding light on the critical social problems they're trying to deal with. I went to Congo with MSF  and contributed to a book and an exhibition that focused attention on a forgotten war in which millions of people have died  and exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon. A malnourished child being measured as part of the supplemental feeding program. In the fall of      I went to Darfur. This time I was on assignment for a magazine  but again worked closely with MSF. The international community still hasn't found a way to create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide. An MSF hospital in a camp for displaced people. I've been working on a long project on crime and punishment in America. This is a scene from New Orleans. A prisoner on a chain gang in Alabama was punished by being handcuffed to a post in the midday sun. This experience raised a lot of questions  among them questions about race and equality and for whom in our country opportunities and options are available. In the yard of a chain gang in Alabama. I didn't see either of the planes hit  and when I glanced out my window  I saw the first tower burning  and I thought it might have been an accident. A few minutes later when I looked again and saw the second tower burning  I knew we were at war. In the midst of the wreckage at Ground Zero  I had a realization. I'd been photographing in the Islamic world since         not only in the Middle East  but also in Africa  Asia and Europe. At the time I was photographing in these different places  I thought I was covering separate stories  but on      history crystallized  and I understood I'd actually been covering a single story for more than    years  and the attack on New York was its latest manifestation. The central commercial district of Kabul  Afghanistan at the end of the civil war  shortly before the city fell to the Taliban. Land mine victims being helped at the Red Cross rehab center being run by Alberto Cairo. A boy who lost a leg to a leftover mine. I'd witnessed immense suffering in the Islamic world from political oppression  civil war  foreign invasions  poverty  famine. I understood that in its suffering  the Islamic world had been crying out. Why weren't we listening  A Taliban fighter shot during a battle as the Northern Alliance entered the city of Kunduz. When war with Iraq was imminent  I realized the American troops would be very well covered  so I decided to cover the invasion from inside Baghdad. A marketplace was hit by a mortar shell that killed several members of a single family. A day after American forces entered Baghdad  a company of Marines began rounding up bank robbers and were cheered on by the crowds    a hopeful moment that was short lived. For the first time in years  Shi'ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage to Karbala to observe Ashura  and I was amazed by the sheer number of people and how fervently they practiced their religion. A group of men march through the streets cutting themselves with knives. It was obvious that the Shi'ites were a force to be reckoned with  and we would do well to understand them and learn how to deal with them. Last year I spent several months documenting our wounded troops  from the battlefield in Iraq all the way home. This is a helicopter medic giving CPR to a soldier who had been shot in the head. Military medicine has become so efficient that the percentage of troops who survive after being wounded is much higher in this war than in any other war in our history. The signature weapon of the war is the IED  and the signature wound is severe leg damage. After enduring extreme pain and trauma  the wounded face a grueling physical and psychological struggle in rehab. The spirit they displayed was absolutely remarkable. I tried to imagine myself in their place  and I was totally humbled by their courage and determination in the face of such catastrophic loss. Good people had been put in a very bad situation for questionable results. One day in rehab someone  started talking about surfing and all these guys who'd never surfed before said   Hey  let's go.  And they went surfing. Photographers go to the extreme edges of human experience to show people what's going on. Sometimes they put their lives on the line  because they believe your opinions and your influence matter. They aim their pictures at your best instincts  generosity  a sense of right and wrong  the ability and the willingness to identify with others  the refusal to accept the unacceptable. My TED wish  there's a vital story that needs to be told  and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era. Thank you very much.,Photojournalist,200704,5.4393146417445335
237,2044,2046,Jean-Baptiste Michel + Erez Lieberman Aiden 2011,Jean-Baptiste Michel + Erez Lieberman Aiden,male,What we learned from 5 million books,Sep 2011,839,Erez Lieberman Aiden  Everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words. But we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true. So we assembled a team of experts  spanning Harvard  MIT  The American Heritage Dictionary  The Encyclopedia Britannica and even our proud sponsors  the Google. And we cogitated about this for about four years. And we came to a startling conclusion. Ladies and gentlemen  a picture is not worth a thousand words. In fact  we found some pictures that are worth     billion words. Jean Baptiste Michel  So how did we get to this conclusion  So Erez and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history  change over time. So many books actually have been written over the years. So we were thinking  well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books. Now of course  if there's a scale for how awesome that is  that has to rank extremely  extremely high. Now the problem is there's an X axis for that  which is the practical axis. This is very  very low. Now people tend to use an alternative approach  which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully. This is extremely practical  but not so awesome. What you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical part of this space. So it turns out there was a company across the river called Google who had started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach. They have digitized millions of books. So what that means is  one could use computational methods to read all of the books in a click of a button. That's very practical and extremely awesome. ELA  Let me tell you a little bit about where books come from. Since time immemorial  there have been authors. These authors have been striving to write books. And this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago. Since then  the authors have won on     million distinct occasions  publishing books. Now if those books are not lost to history  then they are somewhere in a library  and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the libraries and digitized by Google  which has scanned    million books to date. Now when Google digitizes a book  they put it into a really nice format. Now we've got the data  plus we have metadata. We have information about things like where was it published  who was the author  when was it published. And what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data. What we're left with is a collection of five million books      billion words  a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome    a text which  when written out  would stretch from here to the Moon and back    times over    a veritable shard of our cultural genome. Of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole ... was what any self respecting researchers would have done. We took a page out of XKCD  and we said   Stand back. We're going to try science.  JM  Now of course  we were thinking  well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it. Now we're thinking  what data can we release  Well of course  you want to take the books and release the full text of these five million books. Now Google  and Jon Orwant in particular  told us a little equation that we should learn. So you have five million  that is  five million authors and five million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit. So  although that would be really  really awesome  again  that's extremely  extremely impractical. Now again  we kind of caved in  and we did the very practical approach  which was a bit less awesome. We said  well instead of releasing the full text  we're going to release statistics about the books. So take for instance  A gleam of happiness.  It's four words  we call that a four gram. We're going to tell you how many times a particular four gram appeared in books in                   all the way up to     . That gives us a time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time. We do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books  and that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing. ELA  So those two billion lines  we call them two billion n grams. What do they tell us  Well the individual n grams measure cultural trends. Let me give you an example. Let's suppose that I am thriving  then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did. And so I might say   Yesterday  I throve.  Alternatively  I could say   Yesterday  I thrived.  Well which one should I use  How to know  As of about six months ago  the state of the art in this field is that you would  for instance  go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair  and you'd say   Steve  you're an expert on the irregular verbs. What should I do   And he'd tell you   Well most people say thrived  but some people say throve.  And you also knew  more or less  that if you were to go back in time     years and ask the following statesman with equally fabulous hair   Tom  what should I say   He'd say   Well  in my day  most people throve  but some thrived.  So now what I'm just going to show you is raw data. Two rows from this table of two billion entries. What you're seeing is year by year frequency of  thrived  and  throve  over time. Now this is just two out of two billion rows. So the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide. JM  Now there are many other pictures that are worth     billion words. For instance  this one. If you just take influenza  you will see peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were killing people around the globe. ELA  If you were not yet convinced  sea levels are rising  so is atmospheric CO  and global temperature. JM  You might also want to have a look at this particular n gram  and that's to tell Nietzsche that God is not dead  although you might agree that he might need a better publicist. ELA  You can get at some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing. For instance  let me tell you the history of the year     . Pretty much for the vast majority of history  no one gave a damn about     . In       in       in       no one cared. Through the   s and   s  no one cared. Suddenly  in the mid   s  there started to be a buzz. People realized that      was going to happen  and it could be big. But nothing got people interested in      like the year     . People were walking around obsessed. They couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in       all the things they were planning to do in       all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in     . In fact       was so fascinating that for years thereafter  people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened  in '    '    '  . Finally in       someone woke up and realized that      had gotten somewhat pass . And just like that  the bubble burst. And the story of      is the story of every year that we have on record  with a little twist  because now we've got these nice charts. And because we have these nice charts  we can measure things. We can say   Well how fast does the bubble burst   And it turns out that we can measure that very precisely. Equations were derived  graphs were produced  and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year. We are losing interest in the past more rapidly. JM  Now a little piece of career advice. So for those of you who seek to be famous  we can learn from the    most famous political figures  authors  actors and so on. So if you want to become famous early on  you should be an actor  because then fame starts rising by the end of your   s    you're still young  it's really great. Now if you can wait a little bit  you should be an author  because then you rise to very great heights  like Mark Twain  for instance  extremely famous. But if you want to reach the very top  you should delay gratification and  of course  become a politician. So here you will become famous by the end of your   s  and become very  very famous afterward. So scientists also tend to get famous when they're much older. Like for instance  biologists and physics tend to be almost as famous as actors. One mistake you should not do is become a mathematician. If you do that  you might think   Oh great. I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my   s.  But guess what  nobody will really care. ELA  There are more sobering notes among the n grams. For instance  here's the trajectory of Marc Chagall  an artist born in     . And this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person. He gets more and more and more famous  except if you look in German. If you look in German  you see something completely bizarre  something you pretty much never see  which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets  going through a nadir between      and       before rebounding afterward. And of course  what we're seeing is the fact Marc Chagall was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany. Now these signals are actually so strong that we don't need to know that someone was censored. We can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing. Here's a simple way to do it. Well  a reasonable expectation is that somebody's fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their fame before and their fame after. So that's sort of what we expect. And we compare that to the fame that we observe. And we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index. If the suppression index is very  very  very small  then you very well might be being suppressed. If it's very large  maybe you're benefiting from propaganda. JM  Now you can actually look at the distribution of suppression indexes over whole populations. So for instance  here    this suppression index is for       people picked in English books where there's no known suppression    it would be like this  basically tightly centered on one. What you expect is basically what you observe. This is distribution as seen in Germany    very different  it's shifted to the left. People talked about it twice less as it should have been. But much more importantly  the distribution is much wider. There are many people who end up on the far left on this distribution who are talked about    times fewer than they should have been. But then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit from propaganda. This picture is the hallmark of censorship in the book record. ELA  So culturomics is what we call this method. It's kind of like genomics. Except genomics is a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome. Culturomics is similar. It's the application of massive scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture. Here  instead of through the lens of a genome  through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record. The great thing about culturomics is that everyone can do it. Why can everyone do it  Everyone can do it because three guys  Jon Orwant  Matt Gray and Will Brockman over at Google  saw the prototype of the Ngram Viewer  and they said   This is so fun. We have to make this available for people.  So in two weeks flat    the two weeks before our paper came out    they coded up a version of the Ngram Viewer for the general public. And so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its n gram immediately    also browse examples of all the various books in which your n gram appears. JM  Now this was used over a million times on the first day  and this is really the best of all the queries. So people want to be their best  put their best foot forward. But it turns out in the   th century  people didn't really care about that at all. They didn't want to be their best  they wanted to be their beft. So what happened is  of course  this is just a mistake. It's not that strove for mediocrity  it's just that the S used to be written differently  kind of like an F. Now of course  Google didn't pick this up at the time  so we reported this in the science article that we wrote. But it turns out this is just a reminder that  although this is a lot of fun  when you interpret these graphs  you have to be very careful  and you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences. ELA  People have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes. Actually  we're not going to have to talk  we're just going to show you all the slides and remain silent. This person was interested in the history of frustration. There's various types of frustration. If you stub your toe  that's a one A  argh.  If the planet Earth is annihilated by the Vogons to make room for an interstellar bypass  that's an eight A  aaaaaaaargh.  This person studies all the  arghs   from one through eight A's. And it turns out that the less frequent  arghs  are  of course  the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating    except  oddly  in the early   s. We think that might have something to do with Reagan. JM  There are many usages of this data  but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized. Google has started to digitize    million books. That's    percent of all the books that have ever been published. It's a sizable chunk of human culture. There's much more in culture  there's manuscripts  there newspapers  there's things that are not text  like art and paintings. These all happen to be on our computers  on computers across the world. And when that happens  that will transform the way we have to understand our past  our present and human culture. Thank you very much.,,201109,6.314831261101237
238,1965,1967,Jeff Bezos 2007,Jeff Bezos,male,The electricity metaphor for the web's future,Apr 2007,993,When you think about resilience and technology it's actually much easier. You're going to see some other speakers today  I already know  who are going to talk about breaking bones stuff  and  of course  with technology it never is. So it's very easy  comparatively speaking  to be resilient. I think that  if we look at what happened on the Internet  with such an incredible last half a dozen years  that it's hard to even get the right analogy for it. A lot of how we decide  how we're supposed to react to things and what we're supposed to expect about the future depends on how we bucket things and how we categorize them. And so I think the tempting analogy for the boom bust that we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush. It's easy to think of this analogy as very different from some of the other things you might pick. For one thing  both were very real. In       in that Gold Rush  they took over      million worth of gold out of California. It was very real. The Internet was also very real. This is a real way for humans to communicate with each other. It's a big deal. Huge boom. Huge boom. Huge bust. Huge bust. You keep going  and both things are lots of hype. I don't have to remind you of all the hype that was involved with the Internet    like GetRich.com. But you had the same thing with the Gold Rush.  Gold. Gold. Gold.  Sixty eight rich men on the Steamer Portland. Stacks of yellow metal. Some have      . Many have more. A few bring out         dollars each. People would get very excited about this when they read these articles.  The Eldorado of the United States of America  the discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in California.  And the parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly. So many people left what they were doing. And what would happen is    and the Gold Rush went on for years. People on the East Coast in       when they first started to get the news  they thought   Ah  this isn't real.  But they keep hearing about people getting rich  and then in      they still hear that. And they think it's not real. By about       they're thinking   Am I the stupidest person on Earth by not rushing to California   And they start to decide they are. These are community affairs  by the way. Local communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams of        people would caravan across the United States  and they would form companies. These were typically not solitary efforts. But no matter what  if you were a lawyer or a banker  people dropped what they were doing  no matter what skill set they had  to go pan for gold. This guy on the left  Dr. Richard Beverley Cole  he lived in Philadelphia and he took the Panama route. They would take a ship down to Panama  across the isthmus  and then take another ship north. This guy  Dr. Toland  went by covered wagon to California. This has its parallels  too. Doctors leaving their practices. These are both very successful    a physician in one case  a surgeon in the other. Same thing happened on the Internet. You get DrKoop.com. In the Gold Rush  people literally jumped ship. The San Francisco harbor was clogged with     ships at the peak because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon to go search for gold. So there were literally     captains and     ships. They turned the ships into hotels  because they couldn't sail them anywhere. You had dotcom fever. And you had gold fever. And you saw some of the excesses that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened. The fort in San Francisco at the time had about       soldiers. Half of them deserted to go look for gold. And they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half because they were afraid they wouldn't come back. And one of the soldiers wrote home  and this is the sentence that he put   The struggle between right and six dollars a month and wrong and    dollars a day is a rather severe one.  They had bad burn rate in the Gold Rush. A very bad burn rate. This is actually from the Klondike Gold Rush. This is the White Pass Trail. They loaded up their mules and their horses. And they didn't plan right. And they didn't know how far they would really have to go  and they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff. In fact it was so bad that most of the horses died before they could get where they were going. It got renamed the  Dead Horse Trail.  And the Canadian Minister of the Interior wrote this at the time   Thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way  sometimes in bunches under the cliffs  with pack saddles and packs where they've fallen from the rock above  sometimes in tangled masses  filling the mud holes and furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march  often  I regret to say  exhausted  but still alive  a fact we were unaware of  until after the miserable wretches turned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade. The eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere account for the myriads of ravens along the road. The inhumanity which this trail has been witness to  the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone  cannot be imagined. They certainly cannot be described.  And you know  without the smell that would have accompanied that  we had the same thing on the Internet  very bad burn rate calculations. I'll just play one of these and you'll remember it. This is a commercial that was played on the Super Bowl in the year     . Bride     Then why does she have my invitation  Announcer  What may be a little thing to some ... Bride     You are mine  little man. Announcer  Could be a really big deal to you. Husband     Is that your wife  Husband     Not for another    minutes. Announcer  After all  it's your special day. OurBeginning.com. Life's an event. Announce it to the world. Jeff Bezos  It's very difficult to figure out what that ad is for. But they spent three and a half million dollars in the      Super Bowl to air that ad  even though  at the time  they only had a million dollars in annual revenue. Now  here's where our analogy with the Gold Rush starts to diverge  and I think rather severely. And that is  in a gold rush  when it's over  it's over. Here's this guy   There are many men in Dawson at the present time who feel keenly disappointed. They've come thousands of miles on a perilous trip  risked life  health and property  spent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform and at length with expectations raised to the highest pitch have reached the coveted goal only to discover the fact that there is nothing here for them.  And that was  of course  the very common story. Because when you take out that last piece of gold    and they did incredibly quickly. I mean  if you look at the      Gold Rush    the entire American river region  within two years    every stone had been turned. And after that  only big companies who used more sophisticated mining technologies started to take gold out of there. So there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic and that analogy is the electric industry. And there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry. With the electric industry you actually have to    one of them is that they're both sort of thin  horizontal  enabling layers that go across lots of different industries. It's not a specific thing. But electricity is also very  very broad  so you have to sort of narrow it down. You know  it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power. It's an incredible means of coordinating  in a very fine grained way  information flows. There's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity. And the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on is sort of the golden age of appliances. The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb. So the light bulb is what wired the world. And they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world. They were really thinking about    they weren't putting electricity into the home  they were putting lighting into the home. And  but it really    it got the electricity. It took a long time. This was a huge    as you would expect    a huge capital build out. All the streets had to be torn up. This is work going on down in lower Manhattan where they built some of the first electric power generating stations. And they're tearing up all the streets. The Edison Electric Company  which became Edison General Electric  which became General Electric  paid for all of this digging up of the streets. It was incredibly expensive. But that is not the    and that's not the part that's really most similar to the Web. Because  remember  the Web got to stand on top of all this heavy infrastructure that had been put in place because of the long distance phone network. So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure    I'm going back now to  sort of  the explosive part of the Web in       when it was growing       percent a year. How could it grow at       percent a year in      when people weren't really investing in the Web  Well  it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down. So the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure  and then home appliances started coming into being. And this was huge. The first one was the electric fan    this was the      electric fan. And the appliances  the golden age of appliances really lasted    it depends how you want to measure it    but it's anywhere from    to    years. It goes on a long time. It starts about     . And the electric fan was a big success. The electric iron  also very big. By the way  this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit. There's asbestos under that handle there. This is the first vacuum cleaner  the      Skinner Vacuum  from the Hoover Company. And this one weighed    pounds and took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car. So it wasn't a big seller. This was truly  truly an early adopter product    the      Skinner Vacuum. But three years later  by       it weighed    pounds. Now  not all these things were highly successful. This is the electric tie press  which never really did catch on. People  I guess  decided that they would not wrinkle their ties. These never really caught on either  the electric shoe warmer and drier. Never a big seller. This came in  like  six different colors. I don't know why. But I thought  you know  sometimes it's just not the right time for an invention  maybe it's time to give this one another shot. So I thought we could build a Super Bowl ad for this. We'd need the right partner. And I thought that really    I thought that would really work  to give that another shot. Now  the toaster was huge because they used to make toast on open fires  and it took a lot of time and attention. I want to point out one thing. This is    you guys know what this is. They hadn't invented the electric socket yet. So this was    remember  they didn't wire the houses for electricity. They wired them for lighting. So your    your appliances would plug in. They would    each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top. And you'd plug it in there. In fact  if you've seen the Carousel of Progress at Disney World  you've seen this. Here are the cables coming up into this light fixture. All the appliances plug in there. And you would just unscrew your light bulb if you wanted to plug in an appliance. The next thing that really was a big  big deal was the washing machine. Now  this was an object of much envy and lust. Everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines. On the left hand side  this was the soapy water. And there's a rotor there    that this motor is spinning. And it would clean your clothes. This is the clean rinse water. So you'd take the clothes out of here  put them in here  and then you'd run the clothes through this electric ringer. And this was a big deal. You'd keep this on your porch. It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain. And you'd run a long cord into the house where you could screw it into your light socket. And that's actually kind of an important point in my presentation  because they hadn't invented the off switch. That was to come much later    the off switch on appliances    because it didn't make any sense. I mean  you didn't want this thing clogging up a light socket. So you know  when you were done with it  you unscrewed it. That's what you did. You didn't turn it off. And as I said before  they hadn't invented the electric outlet either  so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device. And there are    when you research this  there are gruesome descriptions of people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices. And they couldn't yank the cord out because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house. And there was no off switch  so it wasn't very good. And you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors to be plugging things into a light socket like this. But  you know  before I get too far into condemning our ancestors  I thought I'd show you  this is my conference room. This is a total kludge  if you ask me. First of all  this got installed upside down. This light socket    and so the cord keeps falling out  so I taped it in. This is supposed    don't even get me started. But that's not the worst one. This is what it looks like under my desk. I took this picture just two days ago. So we really haven't progressed that much since     . It's a total  total mess. And  you know  we think it's getting better  but have you tried to install    .   yourself  I challenge you to try. It's very hard. I know Ph.D.s in Computer Science    this process has brought them to tears  absolute tears.  Laughter  And that's assuming you already have DSL in your house. Try to get DSL installed in your house. The engineers who do it everyday can't do it. They have to    typically  they come three times. And one friend of mine was telling me a story  not only did they get there and have to wait  but then the engineers  when they finally did get there  for the third time  they had to call somebody. And they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone because then they had to wait on hold for an hour to talk to somebody to give them an access code after they got there. So we're not    we're pretty kludge y ourselves. By the way  DSL is a kludge. I mean  this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed for the purpose it's being put to    you know it's the whole thing    we're very  very primitive. And that's kind of the point. Because  you know  resilience    if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush  then you'd be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be gone. But the good thing is  with innovation  there isn't a last nugget. Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities. And if you believe that  then you believe that where we are    this is what I think    I believe that where we are with the incredible kludge    and I haven't even talked about user interfaces on the Web    but there's so much kludge  so much terrible stuff    we are at the      Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet. That's where we are. We don't get our hair caught in it  but that's the level of primitiveness of where we are. We're in     . And if you believe that  then stuff like this doesn't bother you. This is        All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble.         Amazon.toast.  In        Amazon.bomb.  My mom hates this picture. She    but you know  if you really do believe that it's the very  very beginning  if you believe it's the      Hurley washing machine  then you're incredibly optimistic. And I do think that that's where we are. And I do think there's more innovation ahead of us than there is behind us. And in       Sears    I want to get this exactly right. This was the advertisement that they ran in     . It says   Use your electricity for more than light.  And I think that's where we are. We're very  very early. Thank you very much.,Online commerce pioneer,200704,5.958824427480908
242,557,559,Jeff Speck 2013,Jeff Speck,male,The walkable city,Oct 2013,1003,So I'm a city planner  an urban designer  former arts advocate  trained in architecture and art history  and I want to talk to you today not about design but about America and how America can be more economically resilient  how America can be healthier  and how America can be more environmentally sustainable. And I realize this is a global forum  but I think I need to talk about America because there is a history  in some places  not all  of American ideas being appropriated  being emulated  for better or for worse  around the world. And the worst idea we've ever had is suburban sprawl. It's being emulated in many places as we speak. By suburban sprawl  I refer to the reorganization of the landscape and the creation of the landscape around the requirement of automobile use  and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom has become a gas belching  time wasting and life threatening prosthetic device that many of us need just to  most Americans  in fact  need  just to live their daily lives. And there's an alternative. You know  we say  half the world is living in cities. Well  in America  that living in cities  for many of them  they're living in cities still where they're dependent on that automobile. And what I work for  and to do  is to make our cities more walkable. But I can't give design arguments for that that will have as much impact as the arguments that I've learned from the economists  the epidemiologists and the environmentalists. So these are the three arguments that I'm going to give you quickly today. When I was growing up in the '  s  the typical American spent one tenth of their income  American family  on transportation. Since then  we've doubled the number of roads in America  and we now spend one fifth of our income on transportation. Working families  which are defined as earning between        and        dollars a year in America are spending more now on transportation than on housing  slightly more  because of this phenomenon called  drive till you qualify   finding homes further and further and further from the city centers and from their jobs  so that they're locked in this  two  three hours  four hours a day of commuting. And these are the neighborhoods  for example  in the Central Valley of California that weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst and when the price of gas went up  they were decimated. And in fact  these are many of the half vacant communities that you see today. Imagine putting everything you have into your mortgage  it goes underwater  and you have to pay twice as much for all the driving that you're doing. So we know what it's done to our society and all the extra work we have to do to support our cars. What happens when a city decides it's going to set other priorities  And probably the best example we have here in America is Portland  Oregon. Portland made a bunch of decisions in the     s that began to distinguish it from almost every other American city. While most other cities were growing an undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl  they instituted an urban growth boundary. While most cities were reaming out their roads  removing parallel parking and trees in order to flow more traffic  they instituted a skinny streets program. And while most cities were investing in more roads and more highways  they actually invested in bicycling and in walking. And they spent    million dollars on bike facilities  which seems like a lot of money  but it was spent over about    years  so two million dollars a year    not that much    and half the price of the one cloverleaf that they decided to rebuild in that city. These changes and others like them changed the way that Portlanders live  and their vehicle miles traveled per day  the amount that each person drives  actually peaked in       has been dropping ever since  and they now drive    percent less than the rest of the country. The typical Portland citizen drives four miles less  and    minutes less per day than they did before. The economist Joe Cortright did the math and he found out that those four miles plus those    minutes adds up to fully three and a half percent of all income earned in the region. So if they're not spending that money on driving    and by the way     percent of the money we spend on driving leaves the local economy    if they're not spending that money on driving  what are they spending it on  Well  Portland is reputed to have the most roof racks per capita  the most independent bookstores per capita  the most strip clubs per capita. These are all exaggerations  slight exaggerations of a fundamental truth  which is Portlanders spend a lot more on recreation of all kinds than the rest of America. Actually  Oregonians spend more on alcohol than most other states  which may be a good thing or a bad thing  but it makes you glad they're driving less. But actually  they're spending most of it in their homes  and home investment is about as local an investment as you can get. But there's a whole other Portland story  which isn't part of this calculus  which is that young  educated people have been moving to Portland in droves  so that between the last two censuses  they had a    percent increase in college educated millennials  which is five times what you saw anywhere else in the country  or  I should say  of the national average. So on the one hand  a city saves money for its residents by being more walkable and more bikeable  but on the other hand  it also is the cool kind of city that people want to be in these days. So the best economic strategy you can have as a city is not the old way of trying to attract corporations and trying to have a biotech cluster or a medical cluster  or an aerospace cluster  but to become a place where people want to be. And millennials  certainly  these engines of entrepreneurship     percent of whom decide first where they want to live  then they move there  then they look for a job  they will come to your city. The health argument is a scary one  and you've probably heard part of this argument before. Again  back in the '  s  a lot's changed since then  back in the '  s  one in    Americans was obese. Now one out of three Americans is obese  and a second third of the population is overweight. Twenty five percent of young men and    percent of young women are too heavy to enlist in our own military forces. According to the Center for Disease Control  fully one third of all children born after      will get diabetes. We have the first generation of children in America who are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents. I believe that this American healthcare crisis that we've all heard about is an urban design crisis  and that the design of our cities lies at the cure. Because we've talked a long time about diet  and we know that diet impacts weight  and weight of course impacts health. But we've only started talking about inactivity  and how inactivity born of our landscape  inactivity that comes from the fact that we live in a place where there is no longer any such thing as a useful walk  is driving our weight up. And we finally have the studies  one in Britain called  Gluttony versus sloth  that tracked weight against diet and tracked weight against inactivity  and found a much higher  stronger correlation between the latter two. Dr. James Levine at  in this case  the aptly named Mayo Clinic put his test subjects in electronic underwear  held their diet steady  and then started pumping the calories in. Some people gained weight  some people didn't gain weight. Expecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work  they were shocked to learn that the only difference between the subjects that they could figure out was the amount they were moving  and that in fact those who gained weight were sitting  on average  two hours more per day than those who didn't. So we have these studies that tie weight to inactivity  but even more  we now have studies that tie weight to where you live. Do you live in a more walkable city or do you live in a less walkable city  or where in your city do you live  In San Diego  they used Walk Score    Walk Score rates every address in America and soon the world in terms of how walkable it is    they used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods and less walkable neighborhoods. Well guess what  If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood  you were    percent likely to be overweight. If you lived in a less walkable neighborhood  you were    percent likely to be overweight. So we have study after study now that's tying where you live to your health  particularly as in America  the biggest health crisis we have is this one that's stemming from environmental induced inactivity. And I learned a new word last week. They call these neighborhoods  obesageneric.  I may have that wrong  but you get the idea. Now that's one thing  of course. Briefly mentioning  we have an asthma epidemic in this country. You probably haven't thought that much about it. Fourteen Americans die each day from asthma  three times what it was in the '  s  and it's almost all coming from car exhaust. American pollution does not come from factories anymore  it comes from tailpipes  and the amount that people are driving in your city  your urban VMT  is a good prediction of the asthma problems in your city. And then finally  in terms of driving  there's the issue of the single largest killer of healthy adults  and one of the largest killers of all people  is car crashes. And we take car crashes for granted. We figure it's a natural risk of being on the road. But in fact  here in America     people out of every         die every year from car crashes. We're pretty safe here. Well  guess what  In England  it's seven per        . It's Japan  it's four per        . Do you know where it's three per          New York City. San Francisco  the same thing. Portland  the same thing. Oh  so cities make us safer because we're driving less  Tulsa     per        . Orlando     per        . It's not whether you're in the city or not  it's how is your city designed  Was it designed around cars or around people  Because if your city is designed around cars  it's really good at smashing them into each other. That's part of a much larger health argument. Finally  the environmental argument is fascinating  because the environmentalists turned on a dime about    years ago. The environmental movement in America has historically been an anti city movement from Jefferson on.  Cities are pestilential to the health  to the liberties  to the morals of man. If we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities  as they do in Europe  we shall become as corrupt as they are in Europe and take to eating one another as they do there.  He apparently had a sense of humor. And then the American environmental movement has been a classically Arcadian movement. To become more environmental  we move into the country  we commune with nature  we build suburbs. But  of course  we've seen what that does. The carbon mapping of America  where is the CO  being emitted  for many years only hammered this argument in more strongly. If you look at any carbon map  because we map it per square mile  any carbon map of the U.S.  it looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S.  hottest in the cities  cooler in the suburbs  dark  peaceful in the countryside. Until some economists said  you know  is that the right way to measure CO   There are only so many people in this country at any given time  and we can choose to live where perhaps we would have a lighter impact. And they said  let's measure CO  per household  and when they did that  the maps just flipped  coolest in the center city  warmer in the suburbs  and red hot in these exurban  drive till you qualify  neighborhoods. So a fundamental shift  and now you have environmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser saying we are a destructive species. If you love nature  the best thing you can do is stay the heck away from it  move to a city  and the denser the better  and the denser cities like Manhattan are the cities that perform the best. So the average Manhattanite is consuming gasoline at the rate the rest of the nation hasn't seen since the '  s  consuming half of the electricity of Dallas. But of course  we can do better. Canadian cities  they consume half the gasoline of American cities. European cities consume half as much again. So obviously  we can do better  and we want to do better  and we're all trying to be green. My final argument in this topic is that I think we're trying to be green the wrong way  and I'm one of many people who believes that this focus on gadgets  on accessorizing    What can I add to my house  what can I add to what I've already got to make my lifestyle more sustainable     has kind of dominated the discussion. So I'm not immune to this. My wife and I built a new house on an abandoned lot in Washington  D.C.  and we did our best to clear the shelves of the sustainability store. We've got the solar photovoltaic system  solar hot water heater  dual flush toilets  bamboo floors. A log burning in my German high tech stove apparently  supposedly  contributes less carbon to the atmosphere than were it left alone to decompose in the forest. Yet all of these innovations    That's what they said in the brochure. All of these innovations together contribute a fraction of what we contribute by living in a walkable neighborhood three blocks from a metro in the heart of a city. We've changed all our light bulbs to energy savers  and you should do the same thing  but changing all your light bulbs to energy savers saves as much energy in a year as moving to a walkable city does in a week. And we don't want to have this argument. Politicians and marketers are afraid of marketing green as a  lifestyle choice.  You don't want to tell Americans  God forbid  that they have to change their lifestyle. But what if lifestyle was really about quality of life and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more  something that would be better than what we have right now  Well  the gold standard of quality of life rankings  it's called the Mercer Survey. You may have heard of it. They rank hundreds of nations worldwide according to    criteria that they believe add up to quality of life  health  economics  education  housing  you name it. There's six more. Short talk. And it's very interesting to see that the highest ranking American city  Honolulu  number     is followed by kind of the usual suspects of Seattle and Boston and all walkable cities. The driving cities in the Sun Belt  the Dallases and the Phoenixes and  sorry  Atlanta  these cities are not appearing on the list. But who's doing even better  The Canadian cities like Vancouver  where again  they're burning half the fuel. And then it's usually won by cities where they speak German  like Dusseldorf or Vienna  where they're burning  again  half as much fuel. And you see this alignment  this strange alignment. Is being more sustainble what gives you a higher quality of life  I would argue the same thing that makes you more sustainble is what gives you a higher quality of life  and that's living in a walkable neighborhood. So sustainability  which includes our wealth and our health may not be a direct function of our sustainability. But particularly here in America  we are polluting so much because we're throwing away our time and our money and our lives on the highway  then these two problems would seem to share the same solution  which is to make our cities more walkable. Doing so isn't easy  but it can be done  it has been done  and it's being done now in more than a few cities  around the globe and in our country. I take some solace from Winston Churchill  who put it this way   The Americans can be counted on to do the right thing once they have exhausted the alternatives.

Do you guys know about that movie  The Secret   It makes  What the Bleep Do We Know  seem like a doctoral dissertation from Harvard on quantum mechanics    that's how bad it is. It makes  The DaVinci Code  seem like  War and Peace.  That movie is so horrible. It promotes such awful pseudoscience. And the basic idea is that there's this law of attraction  and your thoughts have this vibrating energy that goes out into the universe and then you attract good things to happen to you. On a scientific basis  it's more than just  Power of Positive Thinking     it has a horrible  horrible dark side. Like if you get ill  it's because you've just been thinking negative thoughts. Yeah  stuff like that was in the movie and she's promoting it. And all I'm saying is that I really wish that Murray Gell Mann would go on Oprah and just explain to her that the law of attraction is  in fact  not a law. So that's what I have to say.   Sobule  I sing. Sweeney  I tell stories. Together  The Jill and Julia Show.     Sobule  Sometimes it works. Sweeney  Sometimes it doesn't.     Together  The Jill and Julia  the Jill and Julia  the Jill and Julia Show.  ,,200802,5.8307142857142855
252,1444,1446,JoAnn Kuchera-Morin 2009,JoAnn Kuchera-Morin,female,Stunning data visualization in the AlloSphere,Apr 2009,338,The AlloSphere  it's a three story metal sphere in an echo free chamber. Think of the AlloSphere as a large  dynamically varying digital microscope that's connected to a supercomputer.    researchers can stand on a bridge suspended inside of the sphere  and be completely immersed in their data. Imagine if a team of physicists could stand inside of an atom and watch and hear electrons spin. Imagine if a group of sculptors could be inside of a lattice of atoms and sculpt with their material. Imagine if a team of surgeons could fly into the brain  as though it was a world  and see tissues as landscapes  and hear blood density levels as music. This is some of the research that you're going to see that we're undertaking at the AlloSphere. But first a little bit about this group of artists  scientists  and engineers that are working together. I'm a composer  orchestrally trained  and the inventor of the AlloSphere. With my visual artist colleagues  we map complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space  visually and sonically. Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information. And our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world for this kind of data exploration. I'm going to fly you into five research projects in the AlloSphere that are going to take you from biological macroscopic data all the way down to electron spin. This first project is called the AlloBrain. And it's our attempt to quantify beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful. You're flying through the cortex of my colleague's brain. Our narrative here is real fMRI data that's mapped visually and sonically. The brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with. You see    intelligent computer agents  the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you. They're mining blood density levels. And they're reporting them back to you sonically. Higher density levels mean more activity in that point of the brain. They're actually singing these densities to you with higher pitches mapped to higher densities. We're now going to move from real biological data to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature in our next artistic and scientific installation. In this artistic and scientific installation  biogenerative algorithms are helping us to understand self generation and growth  very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences. For artists  we're making new worlds that we can uncover and explore. These generative algorithms grow over time  and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects. Our researchers are interacting with this data by injecting bacterial code  which are computer programs  that allow these creatures to grow over time. We're going to move now from the biological and the macroscopic world  down into the atomic world  as we fly into a lattice of atoms. This is real AFM    Atomic Force Microscope    data from my colleagues in the Solid State Lighting and Energy Center. They've discovered a new bond  a new material for transparent solar cells. We're flying through       lattice of atoms    oxygen  hydrogen and zinc. You view the bond in the triangle. It's four blue zinc atoms bonding with one white hydrogen atom. You see the electron flow with the streamlines we as artists have generated for the scientists. This is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms. We think it makes a beautiful structural art. The sound that you're hearing are the actual emission spectrums of these atoms. We've mapped them into the audio domain  so they're singing to you. Oxygen  hydrogen and zinc have their own signature. We're going to actually move even further down as we go from this lattice of atoms to one single hydrogen atom. We're working with our physicist colleagues that have given us the mathematical calculations of the n dimensional Schr dinger equation in time. What you're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom. You're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines. The white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three orbital configuration. In a minute we're going to move to a two orbital configuration  and you're going to notice a pulsing. And you're going to hear an undulation between the sound. This is actually a light emitter. As the sound starts to pulse and contract  our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted. They're starting to find new mathematical structures in these calculations. And they're understanding more about quantum mathematics. We're going to move even further down  and go to one single electron spin. This will be the final project that I show you. Our colleagues in the Center for Quantum Computation and Spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers decoherence in a single electron spin. We've taken this information and we've made a mathematical model out of it. You're actually seeing and hearing quantum information flow. This is very important for the next step in simulating quantum computers and information technology. So these brief examples that I've shown you give you an idea of the kind of work that we're doing at the University of California  Santa Barbara  to bring together  arts  science and engineering into a new age of math  science and art. We hope that all of you will come to see the AlloSphere. Inspire us to think of new ways that we can use this unique instrument that we've created at Santa Barbara. Thank you very much.,Composer,200904,6.370985915492956
259,186,188,John Hodgman 2012,John Hodgman,male,"Design, explained.",Jun 2012,367,Today I'm going to unpack for you three examples of iconic design  and it makes perfect sense that I should be the one to do it because I have a Bachelor's degree in Literature. But I'm also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of Design Within Reach catalogs  so I pretty much know everything there is. Now  I'm sure you recognize this object  many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at Los Angeles International Airport over the past couple of days. This is known as the Theme Building  that is its name for reasons that are still very murky. And it is perhaps the best example we have in Los Angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture. It was first excavated in      as they were building LAX  although scientists believe that it dates back to the year      Before Common Era  when it was used as a busy transdimensional space port by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revolving restaurants. It is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located  of course  at Stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design  the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously  the much better access to parking. When it was uncovered  it ushered in a new era of streamlined  archaically futuristic design called Googie  which came to be synonymous with the Jet Age  a misnomer. After all  the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often  preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls. Ah yes  a table. We use these every day. And on top of it  the juicy salif. This is a design by Philippe Starck  who I believe is in the audience at this very moment. And you can tell it is a Starck design by its precision  its playfulness  its innovation and its promise of imminent violence. It is a design that challenges your intuition    it is not what you think it is when you first see it. It is not a fork designed to grab three hors d'oeuvres at a time  which would be useful out in the lobby  I would say. And despite its obvious influence by the ancient astronauts and its space agey ness and tripodism  it is not something designed to attach to your brain and suck out your thoughts. It is in fact a citrus juicer and when I say that  you never see it as anything else again. It is also not a monument to design  it is a monument to design's utility. You can take it home with you  unlike the Theme Building  which will stay where it is forever. This is affordable and can come home with you and  as such  it can sit on your kitchen counter    it can't go in your drawers  trust me  I found that out the hard way    and make your kitchen counter into a monument to design. One other thing about it  if you do have one at home  let me tell you one of the features you may not know  when you fall asleep  it comes alive and it walks around your house and goes through your mail and watches you as you sleep. Okay  what is this object  I have no idea. I don't know what that thing is. It looks terrible. Is it a little hot plate  I don't get it. Does anyone know  Chi  It's an ... iPhone. iPhone. Oh yes  that's right  I remember those  I had my whole bathroom tiles redone with those back in the good old days. No  I have an iPhone. Of course I do. Here is my well loved iPhone. I do so many things on this little device. I like to read books on it. More than that  I like to buy books on it that I never have to feel guilty about not reading because they go in here and I never look at them again and it's perfect. I use it every day to measure the weight of an ox  for example. Every now and then  I admit that I complete a phone call on it occasionally. And yet I forget about it all the time. This is a design that once you saw it  you forgot about it. It is easy to forget the gasp inducement that occurred in      when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life. Unlike the Theme Building  this is not alien technology. Or I should say  what it did was it took technology which  unlike people in this room  to many other people in the world  still feels very alien  and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate. And unlike the juicy salif  it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain  rather  it simply attaches itself to your brain. And you didn't even notice it happened. So there you go. My name is John Hodgman. I just explained design. Thank you very much.,Expert,201206,6.095714285714287
260,1322,1324,John Hodgman 2008,John Hodgman,male,"Aliens, love — where are they?",Oct 2008,984,You all know this story. In the summer of       Enrico Fermi  the Italian American physicist and atomic pile builder  went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory and joined some colleagues there  and asked them a question   Where is everybody   This confused his colleagues  obviously  because they were sitting right there with him. And then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them. He was talking about the space aliens. You see  this was only a few years after the supposed flying saucer crash at Roswell  New Mexico. And even though that turned out to be nothing  nothing at all    merely a downed weather balloon piloted by small hairless men with slits for mouths ... Still  America had gone saucer mad  even famous scientists who were eating lunch. Fermi's reasoning  if I may paraphrase badly  is that the universe is so vast that it stands to reason  there should be other intelligent life out there. And the universe is so old that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve  we should have some evidence of their existence by now. And yet  to the best of our knowledge  we are alone.  Where is everybody   asked Fermi  and his colleagues had no answer. Fermi then went on with the same blunt logic to disprove fairies  Sasquatch  God  the possibility of love    and thereafter  as you know  Enrico Fermi ate alone. Now  I am not a scientist. I have never built an atomic pile. Although  I might argue that  technically  every pile is atomic. However  with respect  I might point out two possibilities that Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider. One is that the aliens might be very far away. Perhaps  I dare say  even on other planets. The other possibility    is  perhaps  Enrico Fermi himself was an alien. Think about it. Isn't it a little convenient that in the midst of the World War  out of nowhere  suddenly an Italian scientist showed up with an amazing new technology that would transform everything in the world and darken the history of the human species forever after  And isn't it a little strange that he required no payment for this  That he asked for only one thing    a gift of two healthy sperm whales  That's    that's not true. But it is strange. And if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien  wouldn't he be the first to have tried to convince his fellow scientists that the space aliens are not already here  For it is given in certain UFO ology or UFOlogy circles  that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia  that they have walked among us in disguise  observing us  guiding our evolution from ape to man    if you believe in that sort of thing    and  occasionally  kidnapping us in their flying saucers and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids. It's a difficult theory to discount  I think you'll agree. For even in my own life  there are memories I have that are difficult to explain    happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird  that it is difficult to imagine they were not the result of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life. For how else will you explain the amazing and absolutely true close encounters that I had and will describe to you now  Encounter one  Ocean City  New Jersey      . This was the summer when the special edition of  Close Encounters of the Third Kind  was released. And I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore. Within    hours  I was horribly sunburned  just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie. And so I spent the rest of the vacation largely sitting outside our little rental house at night  the sidewalk still warm from the sun  watching the skies for UFOs. What did I see  Stars  satellites  blinking airplanes    typical sky junk. Occasionally  kids would come and join me and watch  but their necks soon got sore  and they would go off to the boardwalk to play video games and mingle with humans. I was pretty good at the video games. I was not very good at the other part  so I stayed alone with the cosmos. And that's when it happened. An elderly couple came walking down the street. I would say they were in their late seventies  and I would say that they were on a date  because he was wearing a very neat little suit with a yellow tie    a brown suit. And she was wearing a cardigan  because it was now fully night and a chill was coming in off the ocean. I remember  for some reason  that they were exactly the same height. And then they stopped  and the man turned to me and said   What are you looking for  flying saucers   You have to admit  that's a pretty boss piece of detective work for an old man on a date. But what was stranger still    and even I realized it at the time  as a nine year old child    was that they stopped at all. That this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll with his sweetheart with the precise reason of making fun of a child.  Oh   he said   little green men.  And then his girlfriend joined in  too.  There's no such thing as space men   she said.  There's no such thing.  And then they both laughed.  Ha  ha  ha.  I looked around. The street was entirely empty. I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean. It was as though time had stopped. I did not know why they were teasing me. I looked into their strangely angry faces  and I remember wondering  are they wearing rubber masks  And what would be behind those rubber masks  if they were  Giant  almond shaped  unblinking eyes  Slits for mouths  The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun  and then he made laser sounds.  Kew  kew  kew    watch out.  And they turned at once and walked away. The old man reached out his knobbly claw for the woman's hand  and found it  and left me alone. Now  you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding    a strange encounter among humans. Maybe it was swamp gas  but    I know what I saw. Close encounter two  Brookline  Massachusetts      . I went to see the movie  Dune   and a girl talked to me. Now  on its face    this is impossible on its face  I realize    but it is absolutely true. It was opening night  naturally. I went with my friend Tim McGonigal  who sat on my left. On my right was the girl in question. She had long  curly black hair  a blue jean jacket. I remember  she had some sort of injury to her ankle  an Ace bandage  and she had crutches. She was very tall  I would say. I was starting high school at the time. I would say she was a junior  but I had never seen her before. She didn't go to my school. I didn't know her name  and I never will. She was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother  and they were talking about the novel   Dune.  They were both big fans  mother and daughter    very unusual. They were talking about how their favorite characters were the giant sandworms. And then it got stranger. That's when she turned to me and said   Are you looking forward to seeing the movie   First of all  I was embarrassed because I had not read the novel  Dune  at that time. I was merely a connoisseur of movies featuring desert planets  as I still am. But it was also the tone of how she asked the question  apropos of nothing  like she didn't even care about the answer  as though she just wanted to talk to me. I did not know what to say. I said   Yes.  I did not even turn my head. The movie began. I need not remind you that this was David Lynch's version of  Dune   in which all of the characters were sexy and deformed at the same time. There was a character called the Third Stage Guild Navigator  which was a kind of giant  floating fetus creature that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist of psychedelic spice swirling around him  allowing him to bend space and time. He could never leave the tank or interact with the outside world. He had become  in his isolation  so deformed and so sexy  that he had to talk through a kind of old timey radio to the outside world  and could never touch them. I mean  I liked him a lot better than the sandworms. The sandworms were fine  but your favorite character  Please. When the movie ended  everyone seemed very happy to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible. Except for the girl. As I walked out  her pace slowed. Perhaps it was the crutches  but it seemed    it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again. When I say it out loud  it sounds so ridiculous  but I can only come to the conclusion that it was what  in the alien abductee community  they call a  screen memory   a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain to cover up some trauma    say  of being kidnapped and flown off to a sex pyramid. And so I sure am glad I did not slow down to talk to her. I sure am glad I never saw her again. Close encounter three  Philadelphia  Pennsylvania      . In the mid to late '  s  the novelist Whitley Strieber wrote a book called  Communion   in which he described his own lifelong experiences being abducted by aliens. And he also described the phenomenon known in this community as  lost time   where Whitley Strieber would suddenly become aware that he could not remember the previous ten minutes  or the previous ten hours  or the previous ten days. And would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens were taking him and giving him rectal probes. This book became  naturally  an enormous best seller. This image by Ted Joseph was from that book  and was his  sort of  police sketch of what the creatures looked like that Whitley Strieber had described to him. And it was so successful that they made it into a movie. And in       the way I remember it  I was in Philadelphia visiting my girlfriend  and we decided  apropos of nothing  to go see this movie. And the way I remember it  the movie featured these details. One  Whitley Strieber was played by Christopher Walken. Two  the alien was played by a rubber puppet. Three  there was a surprisingly long sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet gives Christopher Walken a rectal probe. Four  this was being shown in a regular movie theater in Center City  Philadelphia. Five  all of which is to say  they made a movie out of the book   Communion   and it starred Christopher Walken. Does something seem strange about this to you  Something odd  Something off  Something wrong with this picture  Think about it. Yes. The answer is  I had a girlfriend. What  How did this happen  When did this happen  I remember walking out of the theater and becoming suddenly aware of this fact  as we walked hand in hand  and pondering these very same questions. And to this day  I have no answer for you. Close encounter four  the Algarve  Portugal      . Some years later  I and this woman    we'll call her  Catherine Fletcher     went traveling through the south of Portugal together. We stayed in old  crumbling  walled cities  in tiny little hotels  and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde and watch the sun set and play checkers. What  Did we do this  Really  Does anyone do this  We went to some topless beaches. Excuse me  No  not in my life. For what it's worth  we went to Sagres  which was considered  at the time  to be the end of the world. And there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock  and the lead dog bit me on the ass  requiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinic and receive an ass shot. Make of that what you will. Our last day in Portugal  we were in the district capital of Faro  and Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach one last time. Now  Faro is a bustling little city  and to get to the beach  she explained  you would have to take a bus and then a boat. And did I want to come with  But I was exhausted and dog bitten  and so I said   No.  I remember what she looked like before she left. The freckles had grown and multiplied on her face and shoulders  clustering into a kind of a tan. A tan  we were both tan    is this true  Her eyes were extra bright and extra blue  as a result. She was smiling. She was a single woman about to go alone into a country  not even speaking the language  to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen. I loved her  and then she went out into that strange  alien land. It took me some time to come to my senses. I had my own  lost time  moment  where I woke up and suddenly realized it was very late in the day  almost dinnertime  and she had not come back. Nervous  I went down to the street to look for her. Now  I did not speak Portuguese. I did not know where the beach was. I could not call her on a cell phone because this was       and the aliens had not given us that technology yet. I realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes  either Catherine would come back to the hotel  or she would never come back to the hotel. And so I sat down to wait. I did not watch the skies  but the very end of the street where the buses and cars and pedestrians and little scooters were moving along. And I watched those constellations shift  hoping that they would part and I would see her face. It was at that moment  in that very small town of        or so  that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe and the searching we might do in it. And that's when the Liberians came along. Five young men    all laughing  happy  traveling together  coming back to this hotel where they were staying. One of them was named Joseph  and he asked me what was I doing  and I explained. And he said   Don't worry.  He was sure that Catherine would be safe. But he did not seem so very sure  for he sat down to wait with me. And for the next two hours  they all waited with me  taking turns  going up to their room  coming back  telling me jokes  distracting me. Two hours  they gave me a message. We are not alone. And then  in the middle of a sentence  at the very birth of twilight  I turned and looked down the street. The stars aligned  and she came back. She was smiling. She did not understand why I was so worried. Neither did the Liberians  although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter as they clapped us on the back  and went back up to their room and left us alone in the street  holding hands. An event like this leaves a scar on the memory  much like a piece of alien technology that has been inserted into your buttocks by a  Portuguese doctor.  And even now  a decade and a half later  even now that we are married  I look for her still  whenever she is not in the room. And even though  I think you'll agree  it is probable that during the time she was away  she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone  I love her and wait for her still. Thank you for your kind attention.,Expert,200810,6.003895071542129
263,457,459,John Maeda 2007,John Maeda,male,Designing for simplicity,Sep 2007,925,On simplicity. What a great way to start. First of all  I've been watching this trend where we have these books like such and such  For Dummies.  Do you know these books  these such and such  For Dummies   My daughters pointed out that I'm very similar looking  so this is a bit of a problem. But I was looking online at Amazon.com for other books like this. You know  there's also something called the  Complete Idiot's Guide   There's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense. We like to have technology make us feel bad  for some strange reason. But I really like that  so I wrote a book called  The Laws of Simplicity.  I was in Milan last week  for the Italian launch. It's kind of a book about questions  questions about simplicity. Very few answers. I'm also wondering myself  what is simplicity  Is it good  Is it bad  Is complexity better  I'm not sure. After I wrote  The Laws of Simplicity   I was very tired of simplicity  as you can imagine. And so in my life  I've discovered that vacation is the most important skill for any kind of over achiever. Because your companies will always take away your life  but they can never take away your vacation    in theory. So  I went to the Cape last summer to hide from simplicity  and I went to the Gap  because I only have black pants. So I went and bought khaki shorts or whatever  and unfortunately  their branding was all about  Keep It Simple.  I opened up a magazine  and Visa's branding was   Business Takes Simplicity.  I develop photographs  and Kodak said   Keep It Simple.  So  I felt kind of weird that simplicity was sort of following me around. So  I turned on the TV  and I don't watch TV very much  but you know this person  This is Paris Hilton  apparently. And she has this show   The Simple Life.  So I watched this. It's not very simple  a little bit confusing. So  I looked for a different show to watch. So  I opened up this TV Guide thing  and on the E  channel  this  Simple Life  show is very popular. They'll play it over  and over  and over. So it was traumatizing  actually. So  I wanted to escape again  so I went out to my car. And Cape Cod  there are idyllic roads  and all of us can drive in this room. And when you drive  these signs are very important. It's a very simple sign  it says   road  and  road approaching.  So I'm mostly driving along  okay  and then I saw this sign. So  I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly  so I thought   Ah  simplicity. Very important.  But then I thought   Oh  simplicity. What would that be like on a beach  What if the sky was    percent gray  Wouldn't that be the perfect sky   I mean that simplicity sky. But in reality  the sky looked like this. It was a beautiful  complex sky. You know  with the pinks and blues. We can't help but love complexity. We're human beings  we love complex things. We love relationships    very complex. So we love this kind of stuff. I'm at this place called the Media Lab. Maybe some of you guys have heard of this place. It's designed by I. M. Pei  one of the premier modernist architects. Modernism means white box  and it's a perfect white box. And some of you guys are entrepreneurs  etc.  whatever. Last month  I was at Google  and  boy  that cafeteria  man. You guys have things here in Silicon Valley like stock options. See  in academia  we get titles  lots of titles. Last year at TED  these were all my titles. I had a lot of titles. I have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters. This year at TED  I'm happy to report that I have new titles  in addition to my previous titles. Another  Associate Director of Research.  And this also happened  so I have five daughters now. That's my baby Reina.  Applause  Thank you. And so  my life is much more complex because of the baby  actually  but that's okay. We will still stay married  I think. But looking way back  when I was a child    you see  I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle. Many of you may not like tofu because you haven't had good tofu  but tofu's a good food. It's a very simple kind of food. It's very hard work to make tofu. As a child  we used to wake up at   a.m. and work till   p.m.  six days a week. My father was kind of like Andy Grove  paranoid of the competition. So often  seven days a week. Family business equals child labor. We were a great model. So  I loved going to school. School was great  and maybe going to school helped me get to this Media Lab place  I'm not sure. Thank you. But the Media Lab is an interesting place  and it's important to me because as a student  I was a computer science undergrad  and I discovered design later on in my life. And there was this person  Muriel Cooper. Who knows Muriel Cooper  Muriel Cooper  Wasn't she amazing  Muriel Cooper. She was wacky. And she was a TEDster  exactly  and she showed us  she showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again. And she's very important in my life  because she's the one that told me to leave MIT and go to art school. It was the best advice I ever got. So I went to art school  because of her. She passed away in       and I was hired back to MIT to try to fill her shoes  but it's so hard. This amazing person  Muriel Cooper. When I was in Japan    I went to an art school in Japan    I had a nice sort of situation  because somehow I was connected to Paul Rand. Some of you guys know Paul Rand  the greatest graphic designer    I'm sorry    out there. The great graphic designer Paul Rand designed the IBM logo  the Westinghouse logo. He basically said   I've designed everything.  And also Ikko Tanaka was a very important mentor in my life    the Paul Rand of Japan. He designed most of the major icons of Japan  like Issey Miyake's brand and also Muji. When you have mentors    and yesterday  Kareem Abdul Jabbar talked about mentors  these people in your life    the problem with mentors is that they all die. This is a sad thing  but it's actually a happy thing in a way  because you can remember them in their pure form. I think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us. When you get older  and you're all freaked out  whatever  the mentors calm us down. And I'm grateful for my mentors  and I'm sure all of you are too. Because the human thing is very hard when you're at MIT. The T doesn't stand for  human   it stands for  technology.  And because of that  I always wondered about this human thing. So  I've always been Googling this word   human   to find out how many hits I get. And in       I had    million hits  and for  computer   because computers are against humans a bit  I have    million hits. Let me do an Al Gore here. So  if you sort of compare that  like this  you'll see that computer versus human    I've been tracking this for the last year    computer versus human over the last year has changed. It used to be kind of two to one. Now  humans are catching up. Very good  us humans  We're catching up with the computers. In the simplicity realm  it's also interesting. So if you compare complexities to simplicity  it's also catching up in a way  too. So  somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined  I think. I have a confession  I'm not a man of simplicity. I spent my entire early career making complex stuff. Lots of complex stuff. I wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this. I had clients in Japan to make really complex stuff like this. And I've always felt bad about it  in a sense. So  I hid in a time dimension. I built things in a time graphics dimension. I did this series of calendars for Shiseido. This is a floral theme calendar in       and this is a firework calendar. So  you launch the number into space  because the Japanese believe that when you see fireworks  you're cooler for some reason. This is why they have fireworks in the summer. A very extreme culture. Lastly  this is a fall based calendar  because I have so many leaves in my yard. So this is the leaves in my yard  essentially. And so I made a lot of these types of things. I've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things  and so I made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes. I feel kind of bad about that. Tomorrow  Paola Antonelli is speaking. I love Paola. She has this show right now at MoMA  where some of these early works are here on display at MoMA  on the walls. If you're in New York  please go and see that. But I've had a problem  because I make all this flying stuff and people say   Oh  I know your work. You're the guy that makes eye candy.  And when you're told this  you feel kind of weird.  Eye candy     sort of pejorative  don't you think  So  I say   No  I make eye meat   instead. And eye meat is something different  something more fibrous  something more powerful  perhaps. But what could that be  eye meat  I've been interested in computer programs all my life  actually. Computer programs are essentially trees  and when you make art with a computer program  there's kind of a problem. Whenever you make art with a computer program  you're always on the tree  and the paradox is that for excellent art  you want to be off the tree. So  this is sort of a complication I've found. So  to get off the tree  I began to use my old computers. I took these to Tokyo in      to make computer objects. This is a new way to type  on my old  color Classic. You can't type very much on this. I also discovered that an IR mouse responds to CRT emissions and starts to move by itself  so this is a self drawing machine. And also  one year  the G  Bondi Blue thing    that caddy would come out  like  dangerous  like   whack   like that. But I thought   This is very interesting. What if I make like a car crash test   So I have a crash test. And sort of measure the impact. Stuff like this are things I made  just to sort of understand what these things are. Shortly after this       happened  and I was very depressed. I was concerned with contemporary art that was all about piss  and sort of really sad things  and so I wanted to think about something happy. So I focused on food as my area    these sort of clementine peel things. In Japan  it's a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel just in one piece. Who's done that before  One piece clementine  Oh  you guys are missing out  if you haven't done it yet. It was very good  and I discovered I can make sculptures out of this  actually  in different forms. If you dry them quick  you can make  like  elephants and steers and stuff  and my wife didn't like these  because they mold  so I had to stop that. So  I went back to the computer  and I bought five large fries  and scanned them all. And I was looking for some kind of food theme  and I wrote some software to automatically lay out french fry images. And as a child  I'd hear that song  you know   Oh  beautiful  for spacious skies  for amber waves of grain   so I made this amber waves image. It's sort of a Midwest cornfield out of french fries. And also  as a child  I was the fattest kid in class  so I used to love Cheetos. Oh  I love Cheetos  yummy. So  I wanted to play with Cheetos in some way. I wasn't sure where to go with this. I invented Cheeto paint. Cheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with Cheetos. I discovered that Cheetos are good  expressive material. And with these Cheetos  I began to think   What can I make with these Cheetos   And so  I began to crinkle up potato chip flecks  and also pretzels. I was looking for some kind of form  and in the end  I made     butter fries. Do you get it  And each butter fry is composed of different pieces. People ask me how they make the antenna. Sometimes  they find a hair in the food. That's my hair. My hair's clean    it's okay. I'm a tenured professor  which means  basically  I don't have to work anymore. It's a strange business model. I can come into work everyday and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte. End of story. But I realized that life could be very boring  so I've been thinking about life  and I notice that my camera    my digital camera versus my car  a very strange thing. The car is so big  the camera is so small  yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual. It doesn't make any sense. So  I was in the Cape one time  and I typed the word  simplicity   and I discovered  in this weird  M. Night Shyamalan way  that I discovered  the  letters  M  I  T. You know the word  In the words  simplicity  and  complexity   M  I  T occur in perfect sequence. It's a bit eerie  isn't it  So  I thought  maybe I'll do this for the next twenty years or something. And I wrote this book   The Laws of Simplicity.  It's a very short  simple book. There are ten laws and three keys. The ten laws and three keys    I won't go over them because that's why I have a book  and also that's why it's on the Web for free. But the laws are kind of like sushi in a way  there are all kinds. In Japan  they say that sushi is challenging. You know the uni is the most challenging  so number ten is challenging. People hate number ten like they hate uni  actually. The three keys are easy to eat  so this is anago  cooked already  so easy to eat. So enjoy your sushi meal later  with the laws of simplicity. Because I want to simplify them for you. Because that's what this is about. I have to simplify this thing. So  if I simplify the laws of simplicity  I have what's called the cookie versus laundry thing. Anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid a big cookie or a small cookie  which cookie are they going to take  The big cookie. You can say the small cookie has Godiva chocolate bits in it  but it doesn't work. They want the big cookie. But if you offer kids two piles of laundry to fold  the small pile or the big pile  which will they choose  Strangely  not the big pile. So  I think it's as simple as this. You know  when you want more  it's because you want to enjoy it. When you want less  it's because it's about work. And so  to boil it all down  simplicity is about living life with more enjoyment and less pain. I think this is sort of simple more versus less. Basically  it always depends. This book I wrote because I want to figure out life. I love life. I love being alive. I like to see things. And so life is a big question  I think  in simplicity  because you're trying to simplify your life. And I just love to see the world. The world is an amazing place. By being at TED  we see so many things at one time. And I can't help but enjoy looking at everything in the world. Like everything you see  every time you wake up. It's such a joy to sort of experience everything in the world. From everything from a weird hotel lobby  to Saran wrap placed over your window  to this moment where I had my road in front of my house paved dark black  and this white moth was sitting there dying in the sun. And so  this whole thing has struck me as exciting to be here  because life is finite. This was given to me by the chairman of Shiseido. He's an expert in aging. This horizontal axis is how old you are    twelve years old  twenty four years old  seventy four  ninety six years old    and this is some medical data. So  brain strength increases up to     and then after     it sort of goes down. Kind of depressing in a way. Also  if you look at your physical strength. You know  I have a lot of cocky freshmen at MIT  so I tell them   Oh  your bodies are really getting stronger and stronger  but in your late twenties and mid thirties  cells  they die.  OK. It gets them to work harder  sometimes. And if you have your vision  vision is interesting. As you age from infant age  your vision gets better  and maybe in your late teens  early twenties  you're looking for a mate  and your vision goes after that. Your social responsibility is very interesting. So  as you get older  you may  like  have kids  whatever. And then the kids graduate  and you have no responsibility any more    that's very good  too. But if any of you people ask   What actually goes up  Does anything go up  What's the positive part of this  you know   I think wisdom always goes up. I love these eighty year old  ninety year old guys and women. They have so many thoughts  and they have so much wisdom  and I think    you know  this TED thing  I've come here. And this is the fourth time  and I come here for this wisdom  I think. This whole TED effect  it sort of ups your wisdom  somehow. And I'm so glad to be here  and I'm very grateful to be here  Chris. And this is an amazing experience for me as well.,Artist,200709,6.305704142011838
264,1372,1374,John Maeda 2009,John Maeda,male,My journey in design,Jan 2009,988,I'm kind of tired of talking about simplicity  actually  so I thought I'd make my life more complex  as a serious play. So  I'm going to  like  go through some slides from way back when  and walk through them to give you a sense of how I end up here. So  basically it all began with this whole idea of a computer. Who has a computer  Yeah. O.K.  so  everyone has a computer. Even a mobile phone  it's a computer. And    anyone remember this workbook   Instant Activities for Your Apple     free poster in each book  This was how computing began. Don't forget  a computer came out  it had no software. You'd buy that thing  you'd bring it home  you'd plug it in  and it would do absolutely nothing at all. So  you had to program it  and there were great programming  like  tutorials  like this. I mean  this was great. It's  like  you know  Herbie the Apple II. It's such a great way to    I mean  they should make Java books like this  and we've have no problem learning a program. But this was a great  grand time of the computer  when it was just a raw  raw  what is it  kind of an era. And  you see  this era coincided with my own childhood. I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle. Who of you grew up in a family business  suffered the torture  Yes  yes. The torture was good. Wasn't it good torture  It was just life changing  you know. And so  in my life  you know  I was in the tofu  it was a family business. And my mother was a kind of a designer  also. She'd make this kind of  like  wall of tofu cooking  and it would confuse the customers  because they all thought it was a restaurant. A bad sort of branding thing  or whatever. But  anyway  that's where I grew up  in this little tofu factory in Seattle  and it was kind of like this  a small room where I kind of grew up. I'm big there in that picture. That's my dad. My dad was kind of like MacGyver  really  he would invent  like  ways to make things heavy. Like back here  there's like  concrete block technology here  and he would need the concrete blocks to press the tofu  because tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing  and so you have to have heavy stuff to push out the liquid and make it hard. Tofu comes out in these big batches  and my father would sort of cut them by hand. I can't tell you    family business story  you'd understand this    my father was the most sincere man possible. He walked into a Safeway once on a rainy day  slipped  broke his arm  rushed out  he didn't want to inconvenience Safeway. So  instead  you know  my father's  like  arm's broken for two weeks in the store  and that week    now  those two weeks were when my older brother and I had to do everything. And that was torture  real torture. Because  you see  we'd seen my father taking the big block of tofu and cutting it  like  knife in  zap  zap  zap. We thought  wow. So  the first time I did that  I went  like  whoa  Like this. Bad blocks. But anyways  the tofu to me was kind of my origin  basically. And because working in a store was so hard  I liked going to school  it was like heaven. And I was really good at school. So  when I got to MIT  you know  as most of you who are creatives  your parents all told you not to be creative  right  So  same way  you know  I was good at art and good at math  and my father says  he's    John's good at math. I went to MIT  did my math  but I had this wonderful opportunity  because computers had just become visual. The Apple    Macintosh just came out  I had a Mac in hand when I went to MIT. And it was a time when a guy who  kind of  could cross the two sides    it was a good time. And so  I remember that my first major piece of software was on a direct copy of then Aldus PageMaker. I made a desktop publishing system way back when  and that was  kind of  my first step into figuring out how to    oh  these two sides are kind of fun to mix. And the problem when you're younger    for all you students out there    is  your head gets kind of big really easy. And when I was making icons  I was  like  the icon master  and I was  like  yeah  I'm really good at this  you know. And then luckily  you know  I had the fortune of going to something called a library  and in the library I came upon this very book. I found this book. It's called   Thoughts on Design   by a man named Paul Rand. It's a little slim volume  I'm not sure if you've seen this. It's a very nice little book. It's about this guy  Paul Rand  who was one of the greatest graphic designers  and also a great writer as well. And when I saw this man's work  I realized how bad I was at design  or whatever I called it back then  and I suddenly had a kind of career goal  kind of in hot pursuit. So I kind of switched. I went to MIT  finished. I got my masters  and then went to art school after that. And just began to design stuff  like chopstick wrappers  napkins  menus    whatever I could get a handle on  sort of wheel and deal  move up in the design world  whatever. And isn't it that strange moment when you publish your design  Remember that moment    publishing your designs  Remember that moment  It felt so good  didn't it  So  I was published  you know  so  wow  my design's in a book  you know  After that  things kind of got strange  and I got thinking about the computer  because the computer to me always  kind of  bothered me. I didn't quite get it. And Paul Rand was a kind of crusty designer  you know  a crusty designer  like a good    kind of like a good French bread  You know  he wrote in one of his books   A Yale student once said  'I came here to learn how to design  not how to use a computer.' Design schools take heed.  This is in the '  s  in the great clash of computer non computer people. A very difficult time  actually. And this to me was an important message from Rand. And so I began to sort of mess with the computer at the time. This is the first sort of play thing I did  my own serious play. I built a working version of an Adobe Illustrator ish thing. It looks like Illustrator  it can  like  draw. It was very hard to make this  actually. It took a month to make this part. And then I thought  what if I added this feature  where I can say  this point  you can fly like a bird. You're free  kind of thing. So I could  sort of  change the kind of stability with a little control there on the dial  and I can sort of watch it flip around. And this is in     . And when my professors saw this  they were very upset at me. They were saying  Why's it moving  They were saying  Make it stop now. Now  I was saying  Well  that's the whole point  it's moving. And he says  Well  when's it going to stop  And I said  Never. And he said  Even worse. Stop it now. I started studying this whole idea  of like  what is this computer  It's a strange medium. It's not like print. It's not like video. It lasts forever. It's a very strange medium. So  I went off with this  and began to look for things even more. And so in Japan  I began to experiment with people. This is actually bad  human experiments. I would do these things where I'd have students become pens  there's blue pen  red pen  green pen  black pen. And someone sits down and draws a picture. They're laughing because he said  draw from the middle right to the middle  and he kind of messed up. See  humans don't know how to take orders  the computer's so good at it. This guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once  you know  you  pen  do this  and you  pen  do this. And so began to have multiple pens on the page    again  hard to do with our hands. And then someone discovered this  a ha moment  where you could use coordinate systems. We thought  ah  this is when it's going to happen. In the end  he drew a house. It was the most boring thing. It became computerish  we began to think computerish    the X  Y system    and so that was kind of a revelation. And after this I wanted to build a computer out of people  called a human powered computer. So  this happened in     . Sound down  please. It's a computer where the people are the parts. I have behind this wall a disk drive  a CPU  a graphics card  a memory system. They're picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard. It's put inside the computer. And that little program's on that cardboard disk. So  she wears the disk  and reads the data off the sectors of the disk  and the computer starts up  it sort of boots up  really. And it's a sort of a working computer. And when I built this computer  I had a moment of    what is it called     the epiphany where I realized that the computer's just so fast. This computer appears to be fast   she's working pretty hard  and people are running around  and we think  wow  this is happening at a fast rate. And this computer's programmed to do only one thing  which is  if you move your mouse  the mouse changes on the screen. On the computer  when you move your mouse  that arrow moves around. On this computer  if you move the mouse  it takes half an hour for the mouse cursor to change. To give you a sense of the speed  the scale  the computer is just so amazingly fast  O.K.  And so  after this I began to do experiments for different companies. This is something I did for Sony in     . It was three Sony  H  devices that responded to sound. So  if you talk into the mike  you'll hear some music in your headphones  if you talk in the phone  then video would happen. So  I began to experiment with industry in different ways with this kind of mixture of skills. I did this ad. I don't believe in this kind of alcohol  but I do drink sometimes. And Chanel. So  getting to do different projects. And also  one thing I realized is that I like to make things. We like to make things. It's fun to make things. And so I never developed the ability to have a staff. I have no staff  it's all kind of made by hand    these sort of broken hands. And these hands were influenced by this man  Mr. Inami Naomi. This guy was my kind of like mentor. He was the first digital media producer in Tokyo. He's the guy that kind of discovered me  and kind of got me going in digital media. He was such an inspirational guy. I remember  like  we'd be in his studio  like  at   a.m.  and then he'd show up from some client meeting. He'd come in and say  you know  If I am here  everything is okay. And you'd feel so much better  you know. And I'll never forget how  like  but    I'll never forget how  like  he had a sudden situation with his    he had an aneurysm. He went into a coma. And so  for three years he was out  and he could only blink  and so I realized at this moment  I thought  wow    how fragile is this thing we're wearing  this body and mind we're wearing  and so I thought  How do you go for it more  How do you take that time you have left and go after it  So  Naomi was pivotal in that. And so  I began to think more carefully about the computer. This was a moment where I was thinking about  so  you have a computer program  it responds to motion    X and Y    and I realized that each computer program has all these images inside the program. So  if you can see here  you know  that program you're seeing in the corner  if you spread it out  it's all these things all at once. It's real simultaneity. It's nothing we're used to working with. We're so used to working in one vector. This is all at the same time. The computer lives in so many dimensions. And also  at the same time I was frustrated  because I would go to all these art and design schools everywhere  and there were these  like   the computer lab   you know  and this is  like  in the late     s  and this is in Basel  a great graphic design school. And here's this  like  dirty  kind of  shoddy  kind of  dark computer room. And I began to wonder  Is this the goal  Is this what we want  you know  And also  I began to be fascinated by machines    you know  like copy machines    and so this is actually in Basel. I noticed how we spent so much time on making it interactive    this is  like  a touch screen    and I noticed how you can only touch five places  and so   why are we wasting so much interactivity everywhere   became a question. And also  the sound  I discovered I can make my ThinkPad pretend it's a telephone. You get it  No  O.K. And also  I discovered in Logan airport  this was  like  calling out to me. Do you hear that  It's like cows. This is at   a.m. at Logan. So  I was wondering  like  what is this thing in front of me  this computer thing  It didn't make any sense. So  I began to make things again. This is another series of objects made of old computers from my basement. I made    I took my old Macintoshes and made different objects out of them from Tokyo. I began to be very disinterested in computers themselves  so I began to make paintings out of PalmPilots. I made this series of works. They're paintings I made and put a PalmPilot in the middle as a kind of display that's sort of thinking  I'm abstract art. What am I  I'm abstract. And so it keeps thinking out loud of its own abstraction. I began to be fascinated by plastic  so I spent four months making eight plastic blocks perfectly optically transparent  as a kind of release of stress. Because of that  I became interested in blue tape  so in San Francisco  at C.C.  I had a whole exhibition on blue tape. I made a whole installation out of blue tape    blue painters' tape. And at this point my wife kind of got worried about me  so I stopped doing blue tape and began to think  Well  what else is there in life  And so computers  as you know  these big computers  there are now tiny computers. They're littler computers  so the one chip computers  I began to program one chip computers and make objects out of P.C. boards  LEDs. I began to make LED sculptures that would live inside little boxes out of MDF. This is a series of light boxes I made for a show in Italy. Very simple boxes  you just press one button and some LED interaction occurs. This is a series of lamps I made. This is a Bento box lamp  it's sort of a plastic rice lamp  it's very friendly. I did a show in London last year made out of iPods    I used iPods as a material. So I took    iPod Nanos and made a kind of a Nano fish  basically. Recently  this is for Reebok. I've done shoes for Reebok as well  as a kind of a hobby for apparel. So anyways  there are all these things you can do  but the thing I love the most is to experience  taste the world. The world is just so tasty. We think we'll go to a museum  that's where all the tastes are. No  they're all out there. So  this is  like  in front of the Eiffel Tower  really  actually  around the Louvre area. This I found  where nature had made a picture for me. This is a perfect    degree angle by nature. In this strange moment where  like  these things kind of appeared. We all are creative people. We have this gene defect in our mind. We can't help but stop  right  This feeling's a wonderful thing. It's the forever always on museum. This is from the Cape last year. I discovered that I had to find the equation of art and design  which we know as circle triangle square. It's everywhere on the beach  I discovered. I began to collect every instance of circle triangle square. I put these all back  by the way. And I also discovered how . some rocks are twins separated at birth. This is also out there  you know. I'm  like  how did this happen  kind of thing  I brought you guys together again. So  three years ago I discovered  the letters M I T occurring in simplicity and complexity. My alma mater  MIT  and I had this moment    a kind of M. Night Shayamalan moment    where I thought  Whoa  I have to do this. And I went after it with passion. However  recently this RISD opportunity kind of arose    going to RISD    and I couldn't reconcile this real easy  because the letters had told me  MIT forever. But I discovered in the French word raison d' tre. I was  like  aha  wait a second. And there RISD appeared. And so I realized it was O.K. to go. So  I'm going to RISD  actually. Who's a RISD alum out there  RISD alums  Yeah  RISD. There we go  RISD. Woo  RISD. I'm sorry  I'm sorry  Art Center    Art Center is good  too. RISD is kind of my new kind of passion  and I'll tell you a little bit about that. So  RISD is    I was outside RISD  and some student wrote this on some block  and I thought  Wow  RISD wants to know what itself is. And I have no idea what RISD should be  actually  or what it wants to be  but one thing I have to tell you is that although I'm a technologist  I don't like technology very much. It's a  kind of  the qi thing  or whatever. People say  Are you going to bring RISD into the future  And I say  well  I'm going to bring the future back to RISD. There's my perspective. Because in reality  the problem isn't how to make the world more technological. It's about how to make it more humane again. And if anything  I think RISD has a strange DNA. It's a strange exuberance about materials  about the world  a fascination that I think the world needs quite very much right now. So  thank you everyone.,Artist,200901,6.288616751269034
265,1283,1285,John Q. Walker 2008,John Q. Walker,male,"Great piano performances, recreated",Aug 2008,656,Ninety nine percent of us have the dream of listeners. Not being the musicians    the listeners  right  And we crave one thing  even though we kind of don't know it all the time. We crave to be in the room with the musician the day it was recorded  the day it was played. And we go to live concerts  and we get that as much as we can. But then we listen to the other    percent of our stuff recorded. And it turns out the further back you go in history  the little rougher it sounds. And so we said  there's a solution to this. Let's separate the performance  as a thing  out from the recording  which was how it was made. You know  the thing with microphones in the room and all that day. But the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers  and what instruments they were using. And it's the data hidden inside the recording. In order to do this  it's a lot of hardware and software that runs in a very high resolution. And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro that looks like a nice grand piano there. And you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things    but full of solenoids  and fiber optics  and computers and all this kind of stuff. The highest resolution out of Japan. And this just didn't work until we could cross this line that says high definition. And we were able to cross this line  called the uncanny valley  in terms of    artificial intelligence terms. We have a process where we  you know  kind of put it into the computer and digitize it  and then a whole lot of analysis. And we look at every single note  and all the attributes of those notes  how hard they were struck  and how they were held down  and how you move the fingers. So we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers. And  you know  it's a thing your piano teacher teaches you  but we never had a science behind these kinds of things. I'm going to start with Glenn Gould. He died    years ago this year  and was born    years ago this year. Was a beloved pianist  maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century. He just got tired of being in front of an audience  and felt like    a performing monkey was  in fact  his term. So he stepped back  and did nothing but the crafting of his work. And Gould's specialty was playing Bach. His maybe most famous recording was something called  The Goldberg Variations.  Bach only wrote themes and variations one time. He wrote some early pieces  but late in his life  in his mature period  he said   Here's a theme       variations.  In fact  the theme isn't even the melody  it's the bass line. And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about  one in mono  and one in stereo. And the one in mono  by the way  he used the pedal  and as he got older  he said   No  no  wait a minute. I'm going to get very scientific about this  and not use the pedal.  What I'd like you to hear live is the      version  and we'll play the first couple pieces of it. Glenn Gould      . How about that  So let me tell you a little bit how this was done. First of all  let me get you to the end step. This is    we have a fairly complex process that  you know  software and musicians and so on  but when we're all done  we know that the ear is the final arbiter. We can play the original in one ear  and a new recording in the other. So I'm going to do this for you right now  what you just heard. And in the right speaker is going to be the original recording  and the left speaker is going to be the new recording  actually of an instrument just like that one  and I'm going to play them together at the same time. That's the original.  Unclear  That's the two together. Before  Jurassic Park   there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle  right  So  in the video world  we've been able to invent  in our lifetimes  natural behavior. And this is kind of another example of putting a science behind natural behavior. And then you heard the original. Ultimately  I started with the experience. And the experience is  I want to be in the room and hear the musicians. Lots of you can afford to buy one of these. But  if not  there is now high definition surround sound. And I got to tell you  if you haven't heard high definition surround  go down to your audio dealer  your audiophile dealer. It's so involving compared to regular stereo. But if you don't have that  maybe you can listen on your headphones. And so on the same disk we have five recordings    Sony has five recordings. And you could listen in headphones with this thing called binaural recording. And it's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument  and it's got microphones where the ears are. And when you put on headphones  and you listen to this  you're inside of Glenn Gould's body. And it is a chuckle until  you know  the musicians  who are musicians who play the piano  listen to this  say   I can't believe it  It's just what it's like to play the piano.  Except now you're inside Glenn Gould's body playing the piano  and it feels like your fingers are making the decisions and moving through the whole process. It's a game changer. Here's now something we know in spectacular quality. The whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. What you heard today was not perfect. It's an amalgam of wood  and cast iron  and felt  and steel strings  and all these  and they're all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity. So when you go into the recording session  you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to. There's the whole action there  sitting  kind of  on the side  and the dummy head and our recording engineers standing around while we rebuild the piano. Without putting dates next to these things  step by step music will be turned into data  like every field that's occurred in the past    or    years. Audio has come very late to this game    I'm not talking about digitizing  and bits  and re mastering. I'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from  which is how it was performed. And audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool    they're high resolution  and they're wired straight to our emotions  and you can't trick them very easily. Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement  you know. All right  there's this episode of  Star Trek.  I get it    it was all just laid in for me yesterday there. The episode of  Star Trek  for me was James Daly played Methuselah    remember this one  And at some point he's dancing with his    and I won't ruin the episode for you  from     . Right  do you know where I'm going  And Nimoy  I'm sorry  Spock sits down at the piano  and he starts playing this Brahms waltz  and they all dance to it. And then Spock turns round  he goes   James  I know all of the Brahms waltzes  and I don't believe this is one of them in the category.  That's where I'm at. I want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn't write. I want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn't play. But I believe we're on a path now  when we get to data  that we can distill styles  and templates  and formulas  and all these kinds of things  again  that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world. It's now coming in this world. The transition will be this one. It says right now  we think music is notes and how they're played. And I believe this is coming. Because what you've just heard was a computer playing data    no Glenn Gould in the room. But yet  it was human. And I believe you'll get to the next step  the real dream of listeners. Every time you listen to a recording today  every time you take out your iPod and whatever  every time you listen to it  it's the same thing    it's frozen. Wouldn't it be cool if every time you listened  it could be different  This morning  you're sadder  you want to hear your song  the same song  played sadder than you did yesterday. You want to hear it played by different musicians. You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever. We've seen all these  Star Treks   and they're all holodeck episodes as well. Every time I listen to that  I get goose bumps. It's so amazing  it's so exciting. Every time I listen to that recording it's like   Oh my God  I can't believe I'm in the same room. I can't believe this is happening.  It's a way better experience than whatever you're used to listening to  in whatever form. And lastly  I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum. So I've really overshot my budget here. We made a new recording of him playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September. It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in     . And I've got to tell you  we have this lab where we build and measure everything  back in Raleigh  North Carolina  and we flew out to Los Angeles. And as the president of the company  I didn't feel real comfortable about where we were. That's a real uncomfortable feeling  when all the equipment's come out and a whole Sony team  and people are going to be sitting there in the audience. And we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine  which has not changed since       still seats       people. And on the sweet spot on the stage  Tatum starts playing ... and every note  every beat  every slur  every accent  every pedal was perfect  because he played it for that room on that day. And we captured all that data all over again. And I want you to hear that right now. And fortunately  it's right in here. This is an encore he used to do. It's one minute long. It's an Irish jig  and I want you to hear his humor. And that's just what the live audience did. So thank you very much  Michael  thank you for the opportunity.,Musician and inventor,200808,6.234743276283617
269,111,113,Jonathan Haidt 2012,Jonathan Haidt,male,"Religion, evolution, and the ecstasy of self-transcendence",Mar 2012,1078,I have a question for you  Are you religious  Please raise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religious person. Let's see  I'd say about three or four percent. I had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference. Okay  here's another question  Do you think of yourself as spiritual in any way  shape or form  Raise your hand. Okay  that's the majority. My Talk today is about the main reason  or one of the main reasons  why most people consider themselves to be spiritual in some way  shape or form. My Talk today is about self transcendence. It's just a basic fact about being human that sometimes the self seems to just melt away. And when that happens  the feeling is ecstatic and we reach for metaphors of up and down to explain these feelings. We talk about being uplifted or elevated. Now it's really hard to think about anything abstract like this without a good concrete metaphor. So here's the metaphor I'm offering today. Think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms  most of which we're very familiar with. But sometimes it's as though a doorway appears from out of nowhere and it opens onto a staircase. We climb the staircase and experience a state of altered consciousness. In       the great American psychologist William James wrote about the many varieties of religious experience. He collected all kinds of case studies. He quoted the words of all kinds of people who'd had a variety of these experiences. One of the most exciting to me is this young man  Stephen Bradley  had an encounter  he thought  with Jesus in     . And here's what Bradley said about it. for about one second in the room  with arms extended  appearing to say to me   Come.  The next day I rejoiced with trembling. My happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die. This world had no place in my affections. Previous to this time  I was very selfish and self righteous. But now I desired the welfare of all mankind and could  with a feeling heart  forgive my worst enemies. JH  So note how Bradley's petty  moralistic self just dies on the way up the staircase. And on this higher level he becomes loving and forgiving. The world's many religions have found so many ways to help people climb the staircase. Some shut down the self using meditation. Others use psychedelic drugs. This is from a   th century Aztec scroll showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god. Others use dancing  spinning and circling to promote self transcendence. But you don't need a religion to get you through the staircase. Lots of people find self transcendence in nature. Others overcome their self at raves. But here's the weirdest place of all  war. So many books about war say the same thing  that nothing brings people together like war. And that bringing them together opens up the possibility of extraordinary self transcendent experiences. I'm going to play for you an excerpt from this book by Glenn Gray. Gray was a soldier in the American army in World War II. And after the war he interviewed a lot of other soldiers and wrote about the experience of men in battle. Here's a key passage where he basically describes the staircase. that the experience of communal effort in battle has been the high point of their lives.  I  passes insensibly into a  we    my  becomes  our  and individual faith loses its central importance. I believe that it is nothing less than the assurance of immortality that makes self sacrifice at these moments so relatively easy. I may fall  but I do not die  for that which is real in me goes forward and lives on in the comrades for whom I gave up my life. JH  So what all of these cases have in common is that the self seems to thin out  or melt away  and it feels good  it feels really good  in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives. It feels somehow uplifting. This idea that we move up was central in the writing of the great French sociologist Emile Durkheim. Durkheim even called us Homo duplex  or two level man. The lower level he called the level of the profane. Now profane is the opposite of sacred. It just means ordinary or common. And in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals. We want to satisfy our individual desires. We pursue our individual goals. But sometimes something happens that triggers a phase change. Individuals unite into a team  a movement or a nation  which is far more than the sum of its parts. Durkheim called this level the level of the sacred because he believed that the function of religion was to unite people into a group  into a moral community. Durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness. And once people circle around some sacred object or value  they'll then work as a team and fight to defend it. Durkheim wrote about a set of intense collective emotions that accomplish this miracle of E pluribus unum  of making a group out of individuals. Think of the collective joy in Britain on the day World War II ended. Think of the collective anger in Tahrir Square  which brought down a dictator. And think of the collective grief in the United States that we all felt  that brought us all together  after     . So let me summarize where we are. I'm saying that the capacity for self transcendence is just a basic part of being human. I'm offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind. I'm saying we are Homo duplex and this staircase takes us up from the profane level to the level of the sacred. When we climb that staircase  self interest fades away  we become just much less self interested  and we feel as though we are better  nobler and somehow uplifted. So here's the million dollar question for social scientists like me  Is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design  Is it a product of natural selection  like our hands  Or is it a bug  a mistake in the system    this religious stuff is just something that happens when the wires cross in the brain    Jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience  it's just a mistake  Well many scientists who study religion take this view. The New Atheists  for example  argue that religion is a set of memes  sort of parasitic memes  that get inside our minds and make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff  self destructive stuff  like suicide bombing. And after all  how could it ever be good for us to lose ourselves  How could it ever be adaptive for any organism to overcome self interest  Well let me show you. In  The Descent of Man   Charles Darwin wrote a great deal about the evolution of morality    where did it come from  why do we have it. Darwin noted that many of our virtues are of very little use to ourselves  but they're of great use to our groups. He wrote about the scenario in which two tribes of early humans would have come in contact and competition. He said   If the one tribe included a great number of courageous  sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other  this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other.  He went on to say that  Selfish and contentious people will not cohere  and without coherence nothing can be effected.  In other words  Charles Darwin believed in group selection. Now this idea has been very controversial for the last    years  but it's about to make a major comeback this year  especially after E.O. Wilson's book comes out in April  making a very strong case that we  and several other species  are products of group selection. But really the way to think about this is as multilevel selection. So look at it this way  You've got competition going on within groups and across groups. So here's a group of guys on a college crew team. Within this team there's competition. There are guys competing with each other. The slowest rowers  the weakest rowers  are going to get cut from the team. And only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport. Maybe one of them will make it to the Olympics. So within the team  their interests are actually pitted against each other. And sometimes it would be advantageous for one of these guys to try to sabotage the other guys. Maybe he'll badmouth his chief rival to the coach. But while that competition is going on within the boat  this competition is going on across boats. And once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat  now they've got no choice but to cooperate because they're all in the same boat. They can only win if they all pull together as a team. I mean  these things sound trite  but they are deep evolutionary truths. The main argument against group selection has always been that  well sure  it would be nice to have a group of cooperators  but as soon as you have a group of cooperators  they're just going to get taken over by free riders  individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others. Let me illustrate this for you. Suppose we've got a group of little organisms    they can be bacteria  they can be hamsters  it doesn't matter what    and let's suppose that this little group here  they evolved to be cooperative. Well that's great. They graze  they defend each other  they work together  they generate wealth. And as you'll see in this simulation  as they interact they gain points  as it were  they grow  and when they've doubled in size  you'll see them split  and that's how they reproduce and the population grows. But suppose then that one of them mutates. There's a mutation in the gene and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy. It takes advantage of the others. And so when a green interacts with a blue  you'll see the green gets larger and the blue gets smaller. So here's how things play out. We start with just one green  and as it interacts it gains wealth or points or food. And in short order  the cooperators are done for. The free riders have taken over. If a group cannot solve the free rider problem then it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation and group selection cannot get started. But there are solutions to the free rider problem. It's not that hard a problem. In fact  nature has solved it many  many times. And nature's favorite solution is to put everyone in the same boat. For example  why is it that the mitochondria in every cell has its own DNA  totally separate from the DNA in the nucleus  It's because they used to be separate free living bacteria and they came together and became a superorganism. Somehow or other    maybe one swallowed another  we'll never know exactly why    but once they got a membrane around them  they were all in the same membrane  now all the wealth created division of labor  all the greatness created by cooperation  stays locked inside the membrane and we've got a superorganism. And now let's rerun the simulation putting one of these superorganisms into a population of free riders  of defectors  of cheaters and look what happens. A superorganism can basically take what it wants. It's so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens  from the defectors  the cheaters. And pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms. What I've shown you here is sometimes called a major transition in evolutionary history. Darwin's laws don't change  but now there's a new kind of player on the field and things begin to look very different. Now this transition was not a one time freak of nature that just happened with some bacteria. It happened again about     or a     million years ago when some solitary wasps began creating little simple  primitive nests  or hives. Once several wasps were all together in the same hive  they had no choice but to cooperate  because pretty soon they were locked into competition with other hives. And the most cohesive hives won  just as Darwin said. These early wasps gave rise to the bees and the ants that have covered the world and changed the biosphere. And it happened again  even more spectacularly  in the last half million years when our own ancestors became cultural creatures  they came together around a hearth or a campfire  they divided labor  they began painting their bodies  they spoke their own dialects  and eventually they worshiped their own gods. Once they were all in the same tribe  they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside. And they unlocked the most powerful force ever known on this planet  which is human cooperation    a force for construction and destruction. Of course  human groups are nowhere near as cohesive as beehives. Human groups may look like hives for brief moments  but they tend to then break apart. We're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are. In fact  often  as we've seen happen in a lot of the Arab Spring revolts  often those divisions are along religious lines. Nonetheless  when people do come together and put themselves all into the same movement  they can move mountains. Look at the people in these photos I've been showing you. Do you think they're there pursuing their self interest  Or are they pursuing communal interest  which requires them to lose themselves and become simply a part of a whole  Okay  so that was my Talk delivered in the standard TED way. And now I'm going to give the whole Talk over again in three minutes in a more full spectrum sort of way. of religious experience  as William James explained. One of the most common is climbing the secret staircase and losing ourselves. The staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary upwards to the experience of life as sacred  or deeply interconnected. We are Homo duplex  as Durkheim explained. And we are Homo duplex because we evolved by multilevel selection  as Darwin explained. I can't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation rather than a bug  but if it is an adaptation  then the implications are profound. If it is an adaptation  then we evolved to be religious. I don't mean that we evolved to join gigantic organized religions. Those things came along too recently. I mean that we evolved to see sacredness all around us and to join with others into teams and circle around sacred objects  people and ideas. This is why politics is so tribal. Politics is partly profane  it's partly about self interest  but politics is also about sacredness. It's about joining with others to pursue moral ideas. It's about the eternal struggle between good and evil  and we all believe we're on the good team. And most importantly  if the staircase is real  it explains the persistent undercurrent of dissatisfaction in modern life. Because human beings are  to some extent  hivish creatures like bees. We're bees. We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment. We broke down the old institutions and brought liberty to the oppressed. We unleashed Earth changing creativity and generated vast wealth and comfort. Nowadays we fly around like individual bees exulting in our freedom. But sometimes we wonder  Is this all there is  What should I do with my life  What's missing  What's missing is that we are Homo duplex  but modern  secular society was built to satisfy our lower  profane selves. It's really comfortable down here on the lower level. Come  have a seat in my home entertainment center. One great challenge of modern life is to find the staircase amid all the clutter and then to do something good and noble once you climb to the top. I see this desire in my students at the University of Virginia. They all want to find a cause or calling that they can throw themselves into. They're all searching for their staircase. And that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish. Most people long to overcome pettiness and become part of something larger. And this explains the extraordinary resonance of this simple metaphor conjured up nearly     years ago.  No man is an island entire of itself. Every man is a piece of the continent  a part of the main.  JH  Thank you.,Social psychologist,201203,6.024751131221714
270,1299,1301,Jonathan Haidt 2008,Jonathan Haidt,male,The moral roots of liberals and conservatives,Sep 2008,1078,Suppose that two American friends are traveling together in Italy. They go to see Michelangelo's  David   and when they finally come face to face with the statue  they both freeze dead in their tracks. The first guy    we'll call him Adam    is transfixed by the beauty of the perfect human form. The second guy    we'll call him Bill    is transfixed by embarrassment  at staring at the thing there in the center. So here's my question for you  which one of these two guys was more likely to have voted for George Bush  which for Al Gore  I don't need a show of hands because we all have the same political stereotypes. We all know that it's Bill. And in this case  the stereotype corresponds to reality. It really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives on a major personality trait called openness to experience. People who are high in openness to experience just crave novelty  variety  diversity  new ideas  travel. People low on it like things that are familiar  that are safe and dependable. If you know about this trait  you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior. You can understand why artists are so different from accountants. You can actually predict what kinds of books they like to read  what kinds of places they like to travel to  and what kinds of food they like to eat. Once you understand this trait  you can understand why anybody would eat at Applebee's  but not anybody that you know. This trait also tells us a lot about politics. The main researcher of this trait  Robert McCrae says that   Open individuals have an affinity for liberal  progressive  left wing political views     they like a society which is open and changing     whereas closed individuals prefer conservative  traditional  right wing views.  This trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join. So here's the description of a group I found on the Web. What kinds of people would join a global community welcoming people from every discipline and culture  who seek a deeper understanding of the world  and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all  This is from some guy named Ted. Well  let's see now  if openness predicts who becomes liberal  and openness predicts who becomes a TEDster  then might we predict that most TEDsters are liberal  Let's find out. I'm going to ask you to raise your hand  whether you are liberal  left of center    on social issues  we're talking about  primarily    or conservative  and I'll give a third option  because I know there are a number of libertarians in the audience. So  right now  please raise your hand    down in the simulcast rooms  too  let's let everybody see who's here    please raise your hand if you would say that you are liberal or left of center. Please raise your hand high right now. OK. Please raise your hand if you'd say you're libertarian. OK  about a    two dozen. And please raise your hand if you'd say you are right of center or conservative. One  two  three  four  five    about eight or   . OK. This is a bit of a problem. Because if our goal is to understand the world  to seek a deeper understanding of the world  our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder. Because when people all share values  when people all share morals  they become a team  and once you engage the psychology of teams  it shuts down open minded thinking. When the liberal team loses  as it did in       and as it almost did in       we comfort ourselves. We try to explain why half of America voted for the other team. We think they must be blinded by religion  or by simple stupidity. So  if you think that half of America votes Republican because they are blinded in this way  then my message to you is that you're trapped in a moral matrix  in a particular moral matrix. And by the matrix  I mean literally the matrix  like the movie  The Matrix.  But I'm here today to give you a choice. You can either take the blue pill and stick to your comforting delusions  or you can take the red pill  learn some moral psychology and step outside the moral matrix. Now  because I know    OK  I assume that answers my question. I was going to ask you which one you picked  but no need. You're all high in openness to experience  and besides  it looks like it might even taste good  and you're all epicures. So anyway  let's go with the red pill. Let's study some moral psychology and see where it takes us. Let's start at the beginning. What is morality and where does it come from  The worst idea in all of psychology is the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth. Developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds  and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things and hard to learn others. The best definition of innateness I've ever seen    this just clarifies so many things for me    is from the brain scientist Gary Marcus. He says   The initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience. Nature provides a first draft  which experience then revises. Built in doesn't mean unmalleable  it means organized in advance of experience.  OK  so what's on the first draft of the moral mind  To find out  my colleague  Craig Joseph  and I read through the literature on anthropology  on culture variation in morality and also on evolutionary psychology  looking for matches. What are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines  That you find across cultures and even across species  We found five    five best matches  which we call the five foundations of morality. The first one is harm care. We're all mammals here  we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming that makes us really bond with others  care for others  feel compassion for others  especially the weak and vulnerable. It gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm. This moral foundation underlies about    percent of the moral statements I've heard here at TED. The second foundation is fairness reciprocity. There's actually ambiguous evidence as to whether you find reciprocity in other animals  but the evidence for people could not be clearer. This Norman Rockwell painting is called  The Golden Rule   and we heard about this from Karen Armstrong  of course  as the foundation of so many religions. That second foundation underlies the other    percent of the moral statements I've heard here at TED. The third foundation is in group loyalty. You do find groups in the animal kingdom    you do find cooperative groups    but these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings. It's only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate  join together into groups  but in this case  groups that are united to fight other groups. This probably comes from our long history of tribal living  of tribal psychology. And this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable that even when we don't have tribes  we go ahead and make them  because it's fun. Sports is to war as pornography is to sex. We get to exercise some ancient  ancient drives. The fourth foundation is authority respect. Here you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species. But authority in humans is not so closely based on power and brutality  as it is in other primates. It's based on more voluntary deference  and even elements of love  at times. The fifth foundation is purity sanctity. This painting is called  The Allegory Of Chastity   but purity's not just about suppressing female sexuality. It's about any kind of ideology  any kind of idea that tells you that you can attain virtue by controlling what you do with your body  by controlling what you put into your body. And while the political right may moralize sex much more  the political left is really doing a lot of it with food. Food is becoming extremely moralized nowadays  and a lot of it is ideas about purity  about what you're willing to touch  or put into your body. I believe these are the five best candidates for what's written on the first draft of the moral mind. I think this is what we come with  at least a preparedness to learn all of these things. But as my son  Max  grows up in a liberal college town  how is this first draft going to get revised  And how will it end up being different from a kid born    miles south of us in Lynchburg  Virginia  To think about culture variation  let's try a different metaphor. If there really are five systems at work in the mind    five sources of intuitions and emotions    then we can think of the moral mind as being like one of those audio equalizers that has five channels  where you can set it to a different setting on every channel. And my colleagues  Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham  and I  made a questionnaire  which we put up on the Web at www.YourMorals.org. And so far         people have taken this questionnaire  and you can too. Here are the results. Here are the results from about        American citizens. On the left  I've plotted the scores for liberals  on the right  those for conservatives  in the middle  the moderates. The blue line shows you people's responses on the average of all the harm questions. So  as you see  people care about harm and care issues. They give high endorsement of these sorts of statements all across the board  but as you also see  liberals care about it a little more than conservatives    the line slopes down. Same story for fairness. But look at the other three lines. For liberals  the scores are very low. Liberals are basically saying   No  this is not morality. In group  authority  purity    this stuff has nothing to do with morality. I reject it.  But as people get more conservative  the values rise. We can say that liberals have a kind of a two channel  or two foundation morality. Conservatives have more of a five foundation  or five channel morality. We find this in every country we look at. Here's the data for       Canadians. I'll just flip through a few other slides. The U.K.  Australia  New Zealand  Western Europe  Eastern Europe  Latin America  the Middle East  East Asia and South Asia. Notice also that on all of these graphs  the slope is steeper on in group  authority  purity. Which shows that within any country  the disagreement isn't over harm and fairness. Everybody    I mean  we debate over what's fair    but everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter. Moral arguments within cultures are especially about issues of in group  authority  purity. This effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question. In one recent study  we asked people to suppose you're about to get a dog. You picked a particular breed  you learned some new information about the breed. Suppose you learn that this particular breed is independent minded  and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal  Well  if you are a liberal  you say   Hey  that's great   Because liberals like to say   Fetch  please.  But if you're conservative  that's not so attractive. If you're conservative  and you learn that a dog's extremely loyal to its home and family  and doesn't warm up quickly to strangers  for conservatives  well  loyalty is good    dogs ought to be loyal. But to a liberal  it sounds like this dog is running for the Republican nomination. So  you might say  OK  there are these differences between liberals and conservatives  but what makes those three other foundations moral  Aren't those just the foundations of xenophobia and authoritarianism and Puritanism  What makes them moral  The answer  I think  is contained in this incredible triptych from Hieronymus Bosch   The Garden of Earthly Delights.  In the first panel  we see the moment of creation. All is ordered  all is beautiful  all the people and animals are doing what they're supposed to be doing  where they're supposed to be. But then  given the way of the world  things change. We get every person doing whatever he wants  with every aperture of every other person and every other animal. Some of you might recognize this as the '  s. But the '  s inevitably gives way to the '  s  where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more. Of course  Bosch called this hell. So this triptych  these three panels portray the timeless truth that order tends to decay. The truth of social entropy. But lest you think this is just some part of the Christian imagination where Christians have this weird problem with pleasure  here's the same story  the same progression  told in a paper that was published in Nature a few years ago  in which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter had people play a commons dilemma. A game in which you give people money  and then  on each round of the game  they can put money into a common pot  and then the experimenter doubles what's in there  and then it's all divided among the players. So it's a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues  where we're asking people to make a sacrifice and they themselves don't really benefit from their own sacrifice. But you really want everybody else to sacrifice  but everybody has a temptation to a free ride. And what happens is that  at first  people start off reasonably cooperative    and this is all played anonymously. On the first round  people give about half of the money that they can. But they quickly see   You know what  other people aren't doing so much though. I don't want to be a sucker. I'm not going to cooperate.  And so cooperation quickly decays from reasonably good  down to close to zero. But then    and here's the trick    Fehr and Gachter said  on the seventh round  they told people   You know what  New rule. If you want to give some of your own money to punish people who aren't contributing  you can do that.  And as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on  cooperation shoots up. It shoots up and it keeps going up. There's a lot of research showing that to solve cooperative problems  it really helps. It's not enough to just appeal to people's good motives. It really helps to have some sort of punishment. Even if it's just shame or embarrassment or gossip  you need some sort of punishment to bring people  when they're in large groups  to cooperate. There's even some recent research suggesting that religion    priming God  making people think about God    often  in some situations  leads to more cooperative  more pro social behavior. Some people think that religion is an adaptation evolved both by cultural and biological evolution to make groups to cohere  in part for the purpose of trusting each other  and then being more effective at competing with other groups. I think that's probably right  although this is a controversial issue. But I'm particularly interested in religion  and the origin of religion  and in what it does to us and for us. Because I think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon is really simple. It's just a lot of rock  and then a lot of water and wind  and a lot of time  and you get the Grand Canyon. It's not that complicated. This is what's really complicated  that there were people living in places like the Grand Canyon  cooperating with each other  or on the savannahs of Africa  or on the frozen shores of Alaska  and then some of these villages grew into the mighty cities of Babylon  and Rome  and Tenochtitlan. How did this happen  This is an absolute miracle  much harder to explain than the Grand Canyon. The answer  I think  is that they used every tool in the toolbox. It took all of our moral psychology to create these cooperative groups. Yes  you do need to be concerned about harm  you do need a psychology of justice. But it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub groups  and if those sub groups have some internal structure  and if you have some ideology that tells people to suppress their carnality  to pursue higher  nobler ends. And now we get to the crux of the disagreement between liberals and conservatives. Because liberals reject three of these foundations. They say  No  let's celebrate diversity  not common in group membership.  They say   Let's question authority.  And they say   Keep your laws off my body.  Liberals have very noble motives for doing this. Traditional authority  traditional morality can be quite repressive  and restrictive to those at the bottom  to women  to people that don't fit in. So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed. They want change and justice  even at the risk of chaos. This guy's shirt says   Stop bitching  start a revolution.  If you're high in openness to experience  revolution is good  it's change  it's fun. Conservatives  on the other hand  speak for institutions and traditions. They want order  even at some cost to those at the bottom. The great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve. It's really precious  and it's really easy to lose. So as Edmund Burke said   The restraints on men  as well as their liberties  are to be reckoned among their rights.  This was after the chaos of the French Revolution. So once you see this    once you see that liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute  that they form a balance on change versus stability    then I think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix. This is the great insight that all the Asian religions have attained. Think about yin and yang. Yin and yang aren't enemies. Yin and yang don't hate each other. Yin and yang are both necessary  like night and day  for the functioning of the world. You find the same thing in Hinduism. There are many high gods in Hinduism. Two of them are Vishnu  the preserver  and Shiva  the destroyer. This image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body. You have the markings of Vishnu on the left  so we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god. You have the markings of Shiva on the right  Shiva's the liberal god. And they work together. You find the same thing in Buddhism. These two stanzas contain  I think  the deepest insights that have ever been attained into moral psychology. From the Zen master Seng ts'an   If you want the truth to stand clear before you  never be for or against. The struggle between for and against is the mind's worst disease.  Now unfortunately  it's a disease that has been caught by many of the world's leaders. But before you feel superior to George Bush  before you throw a stone  ask yourself  do you accept this  Do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil  Can you be not for or against anything  So  what's the point  What should you do  Well  if you take the greatest insights from ancient Asian philosophies and religions  and you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology  I think you come to these conclusions  that our righteous minds were designed by evolution to unite us into teams  to divide us against other teams and then to blind us to the truth. So what should you do  Am I telling you to not strive  Am I telling you to embrace Seng ts'an and stop  stop with this struggle of for and against  No  absolutely not. I'm not saying that. This is an amazing group of people who are doing so much  using so much of their talent  their brilliance  their energy  their money  to make the world a better place  to fight    to fight wrongs  to solve problems. But as we learned from Samantha Power  in her story about Sergio Vieira de Mello  you can't just go charging in  saying   You're wrong  and I'm right.  Because  as we just heard  everybody thinks they are right. A lot of the problems we have to solve are problems that require us to change other people. And if you want to change other people  a much better way to do it is to first understand who we are    understand our moral psychology  understand that we all think we're right    and then step out  even if it's just for a moment  step out    check in with Seng ts'an. Step out of the moral matrix  just try to see it as a struggle playing out  in which everybody does think they're right  and everybody  at least  has some reasons    even if you disagree with them    everybody has some reasons for what they're doing. Step out. And if you do that  that's the essential move to cultivate moral humility  to get yourself out of this self righteousness  which is the normal human condition. Think about the Dalai Lama. Think about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama    and it comes from his moral humility. So I think the point    the point of my talk  and I think the point of TED    is that this is a group that is passionately engaged in the pursuit of changing the world for the better. People here are passionately engaged in trying to make the world a better place. But there is also a passionate commitment to the truth. And so I think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment to the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all. Thank you.,Social psychologist,200809,6.082505330490407
272,1400,1402,Jose Antonio Abreu 2009,Jose Antonio Abreu,male,The El Sistema music revolution,Feb 2009,990,Chris Anderson  Let's now see the extraordinary speech that we captured a couple weeks ago. Jose Antonio Abreu  My dear friends  ladies and gentlemen  I am overjoyed today at being awarded the TED Prize on behalf of all the distinguished music teachers  artists and educators from Venezuela who have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for    years in founding  growing and developing in Venezuela the National System of Youth and Children's Orchestras and Choirs. Since I was a boy  in my early childhood  I always wanted to be a musician  and  thank God  I made it. From my teachers  my family and my community  I had all the necessary support to become a musician. All my life I've dreamed that all Venezuelan children have the same opportunity that I had. From that desire and from my heart stemmed the idea to make music a deep and global reality for my country. From the very first rehearsal  I saw the bright future ahead. Because the rehearsal meant a great challenge to me. I had received a donation of    music stands to be used by     boys in that rehearsal. When I arrived at the rehearsal  only    kids had shown up  and I said to myself   Do I close the program or multiply these kids   I decided to face the challenge  and on that same night  I promised those    children I'd turn our orchestra into one of the leading orchestras in the world. Two months ago  I remembered that promise I made  when a distinguished English critic published an article in the London Times  asking who could be the winner of the Orchestra World Cup. He mentioned four great world orchestras  and the fifth one was Venezuela's Youth Symphony Orchestra. Today we can say that art in Latin America is no longer a monopoly of elites and that it has become a social right  a right for all the people. Child  There is no difference here between classes  nor white or black  nor if you have money or not. Simply  if you are talented  if you have the vocation and the will to be here  you get in. You share with us and make music. JA  During the recent tour by the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela of U.S. and Europe  we saw how our music moved young audiences to the bottom of their souls  how children and adolescents rushed up to the stage to receive the jackets from our musicians  how the standing ovations  sometimes    minutes long  seemed to last forever  and how the public  after the concert was over  went out into the street to greet our young people in triumph. This meant not only an artistic triumph  but also a profound emotional sympathy between the public of the most advanced nations of the world and the musical youth of Latin America  as seen in Venezuela  giving these audiences a message of music  vitality  energy  enthusiasm and strength. In its essence  the orchestra and the choir are much more than artistic structures. They are examples and schools of social life  because to sing and to play together means to intimately coexist toward perfection and excellence  following a strict discipline of organization and coordination in order to seek the harmonic interdependence of voices and instruments. That's how they build a spirit of solidarity and fraternity among them  develop their self esteem and foster the ethical and aesthetical values related to the music in all its senses. This is why music is immensely important in the awakening of sensibility  in the forging of values and in the training of youngsters to teach other kids. Child  After all this time here  music is life. Nothing else. Music is life. JA  Each teenager and child in El Sistema has his own story  and they are all important and of great significance to me. Let me mention the case of Edicson Ruiz. He is a boy from a parish in Caracas who passionately attended to his double bass lessons at the San Agustin's Junior Orchestra. With his effort  and the support of his mother  his family and his community  he became a principal member in the double bass segment of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. We have another well known case    Gustavo Dudamel. He started as a boy member of the children's orchestra in his hometown  Barquisimeto. There  he grew as a violinist and as a conductor. He became the conductor of Venezuela's junior orchestras  and today conducts the world's greatest orchestras. He is the musical director of Los Angeles Philharmonic  and is still the overall leader of Venezuela's junior orchestras. He was the conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra  and he's an unbeatable example for young musicians in Latin America and the world. The structure of El Sistema is based on a new and flexible managing style adapted to the features of each community and region  and today attends to         children of the lower and middle class all over Venezuela. It's a program of social rescue and deep cultural transformation designed for the whole Venezuelan society with absolutely no distinctions whatsoever  but emphasizing the vulnerable and endangered social groups. The effect of El Sistema is felt in three fundamental circles  in the personal social circle  in the family circle and in the community. In the personal social circle  the children in the orchestras and choirs develop their intellectual and emotional side. The music becomes a source for developing the dimensions of the human being  thus elevating the spirit and leading man to a full development of his personality. So  the emotional and intellectual profits are huge    the acquisition of leadership  teaching and training principles  the sense of commitment  responsibility  generosity and dedication to others  and the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals. All this leads to the development of self esteem and confidence. Mother Teresa of Calcutta insisted on something that always impressed me  the most miserable and tragic thing about poverty is not the lack of bread or roof  but the feeling of being no one    the feeling of not being anyone  the lack of identification  the lack of public esteem. That's why the child's development in the orchestra and the choir provides him with a noble identity and makes him a role model for his family and community. It makes him a better student at school because it inspires in him a sense of responsibility  perseverance and punctuality that will greatly help him at school. Within the family  the parents' support is unconditional. The child becomes a role model for both his parents  and this is very important for a poor child. Once the child discovers he is important to his family  he begins to seek new ways of improving himself and hopes better for himself and his community. Also  he hopes for social and economic improvements for his own family. All this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic. The large majority of our children belong  as I already mentioned  to the most vulnerable strata of the Venezuelan population. That encourages them to embrace new dreams  new goals  and progress in the various opportunities that music has to offer. Finally  in the circle of the community  the orchestras prove to be the creative spaces of culture and sources of exchange and new meanings. The spontaneity music has excludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society. It's what makes a child play a violin at home  while his father works in his carpentry. It's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home  while her mother does the housework. The idea is that the families join with pride and joy in the activities of the orchestras and the choirs that their children belong to. The huge spiritual world that music produces in itself  which also lies within itself  ends up overcoming material poverty. From the minute a child's taught how to play an instrument  he's no longer poor. He becomes a child in progress heading for a professional level  who'll later become a full citizen. Needless to say that music is the number one prevention against prostitution  violence  bad habits  and everything degrading in the life of a child. A few years ago  historian Arnold Toynbee said that the world was suffering a huge spiritual crisis. Not an economic or social crisis  but a spiritual one. I believe that to confront such a crisis  only art and religion can give proper answers to humanity  to mankind's deepest aspirations  and to the historic demands of our times. Education    the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge    is the means to strive for a more perfect  more aware  more noble and more just society. With passion and enthusiasm we pay profound respects to TED for its outstanding humanism  the scope of its principles  for its open and generous promotion of young values. We hope that TED can contribute in a full and fundamental way to the building of this new era in the teaching of music  in which the social  communal  spiritual and vindicatory aims of the child and the adolescent become a beacon and a goal for a vast social mission. No longer putting society at the service of art  and much less at the services of monopolies of the elite  but instead art at the service of society  at the service of the weakest  at the service of the children  at the service of the sick  at the service of the vulnerable  and at the service of all those who cry for vindication through the spirit of their human condition and the raising up of their dignity. CA  We are going live now to Caracas. We are going live to Caracas to hear Maestro Abreu's TED Prize wish. JA  Here is my TED Prize wish  I wish that you'll help to create and document a special training program for    gifted young musicians  passionate about their art and social justice  and dedicated to bringing El Sistema to the United States and other countries. Thank you very much.,Maestro,200902,6.413460764587523
273,1637,1639,Joshua Prince-Ramus 2006,Joshua Prince-Ramus,male,Behind the design of Seattle's library,Jul 2006,1062,I'm going to present three projects in rapid fire. I don't have much time to do it. And I want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid fire presentation. The first is what I like to call a hyper rational process. It's a process that takes rationality almost to an absurd level  and it transcends all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call  sort of a rational conclusion to something. And it concludes in something that you see here  that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality. The second    the second is that this process does not have a signature. There is no authorship. Architects are obsessed with authorship. This is something that has editing and it has teams  but in fact  we no longer see within this process  the traditional master architect creating a sketch that his minions carry out. And the third is that it challenges    and this is  in the length of this  very hard to support why  connect all these things    but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility. High modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic  almost anything can happen within them. I call it sort of  shotgun flexibility     turn your head this way  shoot  and you're bound to kill something. So  this is the promise of high modernism  within a single space  actually  any kind of activity can happen. But as we're seeing  operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters. And so  with this sort of idea  what happens is  whatever actually is in the building on opening day  or whatever seems to be the most immediate need  starts to dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it  of anything else could ever happen. And so we're proposing a different kind of flexibility  something that we call  compartmentalized flexibility.  And the idea is that you  within that continuum  identify a series of points  and you design specifically to them. They can be pushed off center a little bit  but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped. With high modernist flexibility  that doesn't really work. Now I'm going to talk about    I'm going to build up the Seattle Central Library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams  and I truly mean this is the design process that you'll see. With the library staff and the library board  we settled on two core positions. This is the first one  and this is showing  over the last     years  the evolution of the book  and other technologies. This diagram was our sort of position piece about the book  and our position was  books are technology    that's something people forget    but it's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media. The second premise    and this was something that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first    is that libraries  since the inception of Carnegie Library tradition in America  had a second responsibility  and that was for social roles. Ok  now  this I'll come back to later  but something    actually  the librarians at first said   No  this isn't our mandate. Our mandate is media  and particularly the book.  So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building. The upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility. Sort of  any activity could happen anywhere. We don't know the future of the library  we don't know the future of the book  and so  we'll use this approach. And what we saw were buildings that were very generic  and worse    not only were they very generic    so  not only does the reading room look like the copy room look like the magazine area    but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it. And in this case  what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book. And so we proposed what's at the lower diagram. Very dumb approach  simply compartmentalize. Put those things whose evolution we could predict    and I don't mean that we could say what would actually happen in the future  but we have some certainty of the spectrum of what would happen in the future    put those in boxes designed specifically for it  and put the things that we can't predict on the rooftops. So that was the core idea. Now  we had to convince the library that social roles were equally important to media  in order to get them to accept this. What you're seeing here is actually their program on the left. That's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory. Our first operation was to re digest it back to them  show it to them and say   You know what  We haven't touched it  but only one third of your own program is dedicated to media and books. Two thirds of it is already dedicated    that's the white band below  the thing you said isn't important    is already dedicated to social functions.  So once we had presented that back to them  they agreed that this sort of core concept could work. We got the right to go back to first principles    that's the third diagram. We recombined everything. And then we started making new decisions. What you're seeing on the right is the design of the library  specifically in terms of square footage. On the left of that diagram  here  you'll see a series of five platforms    sort of combs  collective programs. And on the right are the more indeterminate spaces  things like reading rooms  whose evolution in            years we can't predict. So that literally was the design of the building. They signed it  and to their chagrin  we came back a week later  and we presented them this. And as you can see  it is literally the diagram on the right. We just sized    no  really  I mean that  literally. The things on the left hand side of the diagram  those are the boxes. We sized them into five compartments. They're super efficient. We had a very low budget to work with. We pushed them around on the site to make very literal contextual relationships. The reading room should be able to see the water. The main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code  and so forth. So  you see the five platforms  those are the boxes. within each one  a very discrete thing is happening. The area in between is sort of an urban continuum  these things that we can't predict their evolution to the same degree. To give you some sense of the power of this idea  the biggest block is what we call the book spiral. It's literally built in a very inexpensive way    it is a parking garage for books. It just so happens to be on the  th through   th floors of the building  but that is not necessarily an expensive approach. And it allows us to organize the entire Dewey Decimal System on one continuous run  no matter how it grows or contracts within the building  it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears that we've all experienced in public libraries. And so this was the final operation  which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter  and to hold onto them with a skin. That skin serves double duty  again  for economics. One  it is the lateral stability for the entire building  it's a structural element. But its dimensions were designed not only for structure  but also for holding on every piece of glass. The glass was then    I'll use the word impregnated    but it had a layer of metal that was called  stretched metal.  That metal acts as a microlouver  so from the exterior of the building  the sun sees it as totally opaque  but from the interior  it's entirely transparent. So now I'm going to take you on a tour of the building. Let me see if I can find it. For anyone who gets motion sickness  I apologize. So  this is the building. And I think what's important is  when we first unveiled the building  the public saw it as being totally about our whim and ego. And it was defended  believe it or not  by the librarians. They said   Look  we don't know what it is  but we know it's everything that we need it to be  based on the observations that we've done about the program.  This is going into one of the entries. So  it's an unusual building for a public library  obviously. So now we're going into what we call the living room. This is actually a program that we invented with the library. It was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space. There are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle  but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain. So this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything  including eat  yell  play chess and so forth. Now we're moving up into what we call the mixing chamber. That was the main technology area in the building. You'll have to tell me if I'm going too fast for you. And now up. This is actually the place that we put into the building so I could propose to my wife  right there. She said yes. I'm running out of time  so I'm actually going to stop. I can show this to you later. But let's see if I can very quickly get into the book spiral  because I think it's  as I said  the most    this is the main reading room    the most unique part of the building. You dizzy yet  Ok  so here  this is the book spiral. So  it's very indiscernible  but it's actually a continuous stair stepping. It allows you to  on one city block  go up one full floor  so that it's on a continuum. Ok  now I'm going to go back  and I'm going to hit a second project. I'm going to go very  very quickly through this. Now this is the Dallas Theater. It was an unusual client for us  because they came to us and they said   We need you to do a new building. We've been working in a temporary space for    years  but because of that temporary space  we've become an infamous theater company. Theater is really focused in New York  Chicago and Seattle  with the exception of the Dallas Theater Company.  And the very fact that they worked in a provisional space meant that for Beckett  they could blow out a wall  they could do  Cherry Orchard  and blow a hole through the floor  and so forth. So it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand new building that could be a pristine building  but keep this kind of experimental nature. And the second is  they were what we call a multi form theater  they do different kinds of performances in repertory. So they in the morning will do something in arena  then they'll do something in proscenium and so forth. And so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations  and for operational budget reasons  this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi form theater in the United States  so we needed to figure out a way to overcome that. So our thought was to literally put the theater on its head  to take those things that were previously defined as front of house and back of house and stack them above house and below house  and to create what we called a theater machine. We invest the money in the operation of the building. It's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere  wherever you place it  the area under it is charged for theatrical performances. And it allowed us to go back to first principles  and redefine fly tower  acoustic enclosure  light enclosure and so forth. And at the push of a button  it allows the artistic director to move between proscenium  thrust  and in fact  arena and traverse and flat floor  in a very quick transfiguration. So in fact  using operational budget  we can    sorry  capital cost    we can actually achieve what was no longer achievable in operational cost. And that means that the artistic director now has a palette that he or she can choose from  between a series of forms and a series of processions  because that enclosure around the theater that is normally trapped with front of house and back of house spaces has been liberated. So an artistic director has the ability to have a performance that enters in a Wagnerian procession  shows the first act in thrust  the intermission in a Greek procession  second act in arena  and so forth. So I'm going to show you what this actually means. This is the theater up close. Any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely. The light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure  so you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop. Portions can be opened  so you can now actually have motorcycles drive directly into the performance  or you can even just have an open air performance  or for intermissions. The balconies all move to go between those configurations  but they also disappear. The proscenium line can also disappear. You can bring enormous objects in  so in fact  the Dallas Theater Company    their first show will be a play about Charles Lindbergh  and they'll want to bring in a real aircraft. And then it also provides them  in the off season  the ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things. This is it from a distance. Open up entire portions for different kinds of events. And at night. Again  remove the light enclosure  keep the acoustic enclosure. This is a monster truck show. I'm going to show now the last project. This also is an unusual client. They inverted the whole idea of development. They came to us and they said    unlike normal developers    they said   We want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in Louisville. That's our main goal.  And so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money  they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown. And the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma  so they worked in reverse. And that pro forma led us to a mixed use building that was very large  in order to support their aspirations of the art  but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate  interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within. And it also charged us with thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of sub building. So this is Louisville's skyline  and I'm going to take you through the various constraints that led to the project. First  the physical constraints. We actually had to operate on three discrete sites  all of them well smaller than the size of the building. We had to operate next to the new Muhammad Ali Center  and respect it. We had to operate within the     year floodplain. Now  this area floods three to four times a year  and there's a levee behind our site  similar to the ones that broke in New Orleans. Had to operate behind the I    corridor  a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites. So we're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub. Underneath the bathtub are the city's main power lines. And there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add  that would link a series of cultural buildings  and a view corridor    because this is the historic district    that they didn't want to obstruct with a new building. And now we're going to add  .  million square feet. And if we did the traditional thing  that  .  million square feet    these are the different programs    the traditional thing would be to identify the public elements  place them on sites  and now we'd have a really terrible situation  a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods. And then we would size all the other elements    the different commercial elements  hotel  luxury housing  offices and so forth    and dump it on top. And we would create something that was unviable. In fact    and you know this    this is called the Time Warner Building. So our strategy was very simple. Just lift the entire block  flip some of the elements over  reposition them so they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown  and make circulation connections and reroute the road. So that's the basic concept  and now I'm going to show you what it leads to. Ok  it seems a very formal  willful gesture  but something derived entirely out of the constraints. And again  when we unveiled it  there was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect making a statement  not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems. Now  within that center zone  as I said  we have the ability to mix a series of things. So here  this is sort of an x ray    the towers are totally developer driven. They told us the dimensions  the sizes and so forth  and we focused on taking all the public components    the lobbies  the bars    everything that different commercial elements would have  and combined it in the center  in the sort of subway map  in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum. So it creates a situation like this  where you have artists who can operate within an art space that also has an amazing view on the   nd floor  but it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close. It allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen  or to see the art  and so forth. It also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool  they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool  so they're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space. So  how to build this. It's very simple  it's a chair. So  we begin by building the cores. As we're building the cores  we build the contemporary art museum at grade. That allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency. This is not a high budget building. The moment the cores get to mid level  we finish the art museum  we put all the mechanical equipment in it  and then we jack it up into the air. This is how they build really large aircraft hangars  for instance  the ones that they did for the A   . Finish the cores  finish the meat and you get something that looks like this. Now I only have about    seconds  so I want to start an animation  and we'll conclude with that. Thank you.

274,439,441,Juan Enriquez 2013,Juan Enriquez,male,"Your online life, permanent as a tattoo",May 2013,347,All right  so let's take four subjects that obviously go together  big data  tattoos  immortality and the Greeks. Right  Now  the issue about tattoos is that  without a word  tattoos really do shout.  Beautiful   Intriguing  So you don't have to say a lot.  Allegiance   Very intimate   Serious mistakes  And tattoos tell you a lot of stories. If I can ask an indiscreet question  how many of you have tattoos  A few  but not most. What happens if Facebook  Google  Twitter  LinkedIn  cell phones  GPS  Foursquare  Yelp  Travel Advisor  all these things you deal with every day turn out to be electronic tattoos  And what if they provide as much information about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would  What's ended up happening over the past few decades is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state or as a great celebrity is now being applied to you every day by all these people who are Tweeting  blogging  following you  watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself. And electronic tattoos also shout. And as you're thinking of the consequences of that  it's getting really hard to hide from this stuff  among other things  because it's not just the electronic tattoos  it's facial recognition that's getting really good. So you can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names  although  again  sometimes it does make mistakes.  Laughter  But that means you can take a typical bar scene like this  take a picture  say  of this guy right here  get the name  and download all the records before you utter a word or speak to somebody  because everybody turns out to be absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos. And so there's companies like face.com that now have about    billion faces online. Here's what happened to this company.  Company sold to Facebook  June         ...  There are other companies that will place a camera like this   this has nothing to do with Facebook   they take your picture  they tie it to the social media  they figure out you really like to wear black dresses  so maybe the person in the store comes up and says   Hey  we've got five black dresses that would just look great on you.  So what if Andy was wrong  Here's Andy's theory.  In the future  everybody will be world famous for    minutes.  What if we flip this  What if you're only going to be anonymous for    minutes   Laughter  Well  then  because of electronic tattoos  maybe all of you and all of us are very close to immortality  because these tattoos will live far longer than our bodies will. And if that's true  then what we want to do is we want to go through four lessons from the Greeks and one lesson from a Latin American. Why the Greeks  Well  the Greeks thought about what happens when gods and humans and immortality mix for a long time. So lesson number one  Sisyphus. Remember  He did a horrible thing  condemned for all time to roll this rock up  it would roll back down  roll back up  roll back down. It's a little like your reputation. Once you get that electronic tattoo  you're going to be rolling up and down for a long time  so as you go through this stuff  just be careful what you post. Myth number two  Orpheus  wonderful guy  charming to be around  great partier  great singer  loses his beloved  charms his way into the underworld  only person to charm his way into the underworld  charms the gods of the underworld  they release his beauty on the condition he never look at her until they're out. So he's walking out and walking out and walking out and he just can't resist. He looks at her  loses her forever. With all this data out here  it might be a good idea not to look too far into the past of those you love. Lesson number three  Atalanta. Greatest runner. She would challenge anybody. If you won  she would marry you. If you lost  you died. How did Hippomenes beat her  Well  he had all these wonderful little golden apples  and she'd run ahead  and he'd roll a little golden apple. She'd run ahead  and he'd roll a little golden apple. She kept getting distracted. He eventually won the race. Just remember the purpose as all these little golden apples come and reach you and you want to post about them or tweet about them or send a late night message. And then  of course  there's Narcissus. Nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with Narcissus. But as you're thinking about Narcissus  just don't fall in love with your own reflection. Last lesson  from a Latin American  This is the great poet Jorge Luis Borges. When he was threatened by the thugs of the Argentine military junta  he came back and said   Oh  come on  how else can you threaten  other than with death   The interesting thing  the original thing  would be to threaten somebody with immortality. And that  of course  is what we are all now threatened with today because of electronic tattoos. Thank you.,Futurist,201305,6.088318181818183
275,632,634,Juan Enriquez 2007,Juan Enriquez,male,Using biology to rethink the energy challenge,Nov 2007,1022,What is bioenergy  Bioenergy is not ethanol. Bioenergy isn't global warming. Bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive. Bioenergy is oil. It's gas. It's coal. And part of building that bridge to the future  to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way  or put up these geo spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff  is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it. And to do that  you really have to look first at agriculture. So we've been planting stuff for        years. And in the measure that we plant stuff  what we learn from agriculture is you've got to deal with pests  you've got to deal with all types of awful things  you've got to cultivate stuff. In the measure that you learn how to use water to cultivate  then you're going to be able to spread beyond the Nile. You're going to be able to power stuff  so irrigation makes a difference. Irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant stuff where you want it  as opposed to where the rivers flood. You start getting this organic agriculture  you start putting machinery onto this stuff. Machinery  with a whole bunch of water  leads to very large scale agriculture. You put together machines and water  and you get landscapes that look like this. And then you get sales that look like this. It's brute force. So what you've been doing in agriculture is you start out with something that's a reasonably natural system. You start taming that natural system. You put a lot of force behind that natural system. You put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides    end up with systems that look like this. And it's all brute force. And that's the way we've been approaching energy. So the lesson in agriculture is that you can actually change the system that's based on brute force as you start merging that system and learning that system and actually applying biology. And you move from a discipline of engineering  you move from a discipline of chemistry  into a discipline of biology. And probably one of the most important human beings on the planet is this guy behind me. This is a guy called Norman Borlaug. He won the Nobel Prize. He's got the Congressional Medal of Honor. He deserves all of this stuff. And he deserves this stuff because he probably has fed more people than any other human being alive because he researched how to put biology behind seeds. He did this in Mexico. The reason why India and China no longer have these massive famines is because Norman Borlaug taught them how to grow grains in a more efficient way and launched the Green Revolution. That is something that a lot of people have criticized. But of course  those are people who don't realize that China and India  instead of having huge amounts of starving people  are exporting grains. And the irony of this particular system is the place where he did the research  which was Mexico  didn't adopt this technology  ignored this technology  talked about why this technology should be thought about  but not really applied. And Mexico remains one of the largest grain importers on the planet because it doesn't apply technology that was discovered in Mexico. And in fact  hasn't recognized this man  to the point where there aren't statues of this man all over Mexico. There are in China and India. And the Institute that this guy ran has now moved to India. That is the difference between adopting technologies and discussing technologies. Now  it's not just that this guy fed a huge amount of people in the world. It's that this is the net effect in terms of what technology does  if you understand biology. What happened in agriculture  Well  if you take agriculture over a century  agriculture in about      would have been recognizable to somebody planting a thousand years earlier. Yeah  the plows look different. The machines were tractors or stuff instead of mules  but the farmer would have understood  this is what the guy's doing  this is why he's doing it  this is where he's going. What really started to change in agriculture is when you started moving from this brute force engineering and chemistry into biology  and that's where you get your productivity increases. And as you do that stuff  here's what happens to productivity. Basically  you go from     hours to produce     bushels  to     to     to five. Agricultural labor productivity increased seven times       to       whereas the rest of the economy increased about  .  times. This is an absolutely massive increase in how much is produced per person. The effect of this  of course  is it's not just amber waves of grain  it is mountains of stuff. And    percent of the EU budget is going to subsidize agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have overproduced. This would be a good outcome for energy. And of course  by now  you're probably saying to yourself   Self  I thought I came to a talk about energy and here's this guy talking about biology.  So where's the link between these two things  One of the ironies of this whole system is we're discussing what to do about a system that we don't understand. We don't even know what oil is. We don't know where oil comes from. I mean  literally  it's still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from. The best assumption  and one of the best guesses in this stuff  is that this stuff comes out of this stuff  that these things absorb sunlight  rot under pressure for millions of years  and you get these black rivers. Now  the interesting thing about that thesis    if that thesis turns out to be true    is that oil  and all hydrocarbons  turned out to be concentrated sunlight. And if you think of bioenergy  bioenergy isn't ethanol. Bioenergy is taking the sun  concentrating it in amoebas  concentrating it in plants  and maybe that's why you get these rainbows. And as you're looking at this system  if hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight  then bioenergy works in a different way. And we've got to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as part of these solar panels. Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west Texas  the types of wells that you're beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures of Kansas and those irrigated plots. This is how you farm oil. And as you think of farming oil and how oil has evolved  we started with this brute force approach. And then what did we learn  Then we learned we had to go bigger. And then what'd we learn  Then we have to go even bigger. And we are getting really destructive as we're going out and farming this bioenergy. These are the Athabasca tar sands  and there's an enormous amount    first of mining  the largest trucks in the world are working here  and then you've got to pull out this black sludge  which is basically oil that doesn't flow. It's tied to the sand. And then you've got to use a lot of steam to separate it  which only works at today's oil prices. Coal. Coal turns out to be virtually the same stuff. It is probably plants  except that these have been burned and crushed under pressure. So you take something like this  you burn it  you put it under pressure  and likely as not  you get this. Although  again  I stress  we don't know. Which is curious as we debate all this stuff. But as you think of coal  this is what burned wheat kernels look like. Not entirely unlike coal. And of course  coalmines are very dangerous places because in some of these coalmines  you get gas. When that gas blows up  people die. So you're producing a biogas out of coal in some mines  but not in others. Any place you see a differential  there're some interesting questions. There's some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff. But again  coal. Maybe the same stuff  maybe the same system  maybe bioenergy  and you're applying exactly the same technology. Here's your brute force approach. Once you get through your brute force approach  then you just rip off whole mountaintops. And you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions  which are coal fired gas plants. That is probably not the best use of bioenergy. As you think of what are the alternatives to this system    it's important to find alternatives because it turns out that the U.S. is dwindling in its petroleum reserves  but it is not dwindling in its coal reserves  nor is China. There are huge coal reserves that are sitting out there  and we've got to start thinking of them as biological energy  because if we keep treating them as chemical energy  or engineering energy  we're going to be in deep doo doo. Gas is a similar issue. Gas is also a biological product. And as you think of gas  well  you're familiar with gas. And here's a different way of mining coal. This is called coal bed methane. Why is this picture interesting  Because if coal turns out to be concentrated plant life  the reason why you may get a differential in gas output between one mine and another    the reason why one mine may blow up and another one may not blow up    may be because there's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas. This is a well known phenomenon.  Laughter  You eat certain things  you produce a lot of gas. It may turn out that biological processes in coalmines have the same process. If that is true  then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to rip whole mountaintops off  and it may not be to burn coal. It may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture. That is what bioenergy is. It is not ethanol. It is not subsidies to a few companies. It is not importing corn into Iowa because you've built so many of these ethanol plants. It is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture  from brute force into biological force. And in the measure that you can do that  you can clean some stuff  and you can clean it pretty quickly. We already have some indicators of productivity on this stuff. OK  if you put steam into coal fields or petroleum fields that have been running for decades  you can get a really substantial increase  like an eight fold increase  in your output. This is just the beginning stages of this stuff. And as you think of biomaterials  this guy    who did part of the sequencing of the human genome  who just doubled the databases of genes and proteins known on earth by sailing around the world    has been thinking about how you structure this. And there's a series of smart people thinking about this. And they've been putting together companies like Synthetic Genomics  like  a Cambria  like Codon  and what those companies are trying to do is to think of  how do you apply biological principles to avoid brute force  Think of it in the following terms. Think of it as beginning to program stuff for specific purposes. Think of the cell as a hardware. Think of the genes as a software. And in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that is interchangeable  that can become energy  that can become food  that can become fiber  that can become human beings  that can become a whole series of things  then you've got to shift your approach as to how you're going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way. What are the first principles of this stuff and where are we heading  This is one of the gentle giants on the planet. He's one of the nicest human beings you've ever met. His name is Hamilton Smith. He won the Nobel for figuring out how to cut genes    something called restriction enzymes. He was at Hopkins when he did this  and he's such a modest guy that the day he won  his mother called him and said   I didn't realize there was another Ham Smith at Hopkins. Do you know he just won the Nobel    Laughter  I mean  that was Mom  but anyway  this guy is just a class act. You find him at the bench every single day  working on a pipette and building stuff. And one of the things this guy just built are these things. What is this  This is the first transplant of naked DNA  where you take an entire DNA operating system out of one cell  insert it into a different cell  and have that cell boot up as a separate species. That's one month old. You will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff. And as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are  we're going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies. We're going to start thinking about biology entering energy. It is very expensive to process this stuff  both in economic terms and in energy terms. This is what accumulates in the tar sands of Alberta. These are sulfur blocks. Because as you separate that petroleum from the sand  and use an enormous amount of energy inside that vapor    steam to separate this stuff    you also have to separate out the sulfur. The difference between light crude and heavy crude    well  it's about    bucks a barrel. That's why you're building these pyramids of sulfur blocks. And by the way  the scale on these things is pretty large. Now  if you can take part of the energy content out of doing this  you reduce the system  and you really do start applying biological principles to energy. This has to be a bridge to the point where you can get to wind  to the point where you can get to solar  to the point where you can get to nuclear    and hopefully you won't build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault.  Laughter  Just a thought. But in the meantime  for the next decade at least  the name of the game is hydrocarbons. And be that oil  be that gas  be that coal  this is what we're dealing with. And before I make this talk too long  here's what's happening in the current energy system.    percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons. That means    percent of the stuff we're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff. And there's a role in here for conservation. There's a role in here for alternative stuff  but we've also got to get that other portion right. How we deal with that other portion is our bridge to the future. And as we think of this bridge to the future  one of the things you should ponder is  we are leaving about two thirds of the oil today inside those wells. So we're spending an enormous amount of money and leaving most of the energy down there. Which  of course  requires more energy to go out and get energy. The ratios become idiotic by the time you get to ethanol. It may even be a one to one ratio on the energy input and the energy output. That is a stupid way of managing this system. Last point  last graph. One of the things that we've got to do is to stabilize oil prices. This is what oil prices look like  OK  This is a very bad system because what happens is your hurdle rate gets set very low. People come up with really smart ideas for solar panels  or for wind  or for something else  and then guess what  The oil price goes through the floor. That company goes out of business  and then you can bring the oil price back up. So if I had one closing and modest suggestion  let's set a stable oil price in Europe and the United States. How do you do that  Well  let's put a tax on oil that is a non revenue tax  and it basically says for the next    years  the price of oil will be    whatever you want     bucks     bucks. If the OPEC price falls below that  we tax it. If the OPEC price goes above that  the tax goes away. What does that do for entrepreneurs  What does it do for companies  It tells people  if you can produce energy for less than    bucks a barrel  or less than    bucks a barrel  or less than    bucks a barrel    let's debate it    you will have a business. But let's not put people through this cycle where it doesn't pay to research because your company will go out of business as OPEC drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from happening.

276,1398,1400,Juan Enriquez 2009,Juan Enriquez,male,The next species of human,Feb 2009,1118,There's a great big elephant in the room called the economy. So let's start talking about that. I wanted to give you a current picture of the economy. That's what I have behind myself. But of course what we have to remember is this. And what you have to think about is  when you're dancing in the flames  what's next  So what I'm going to try to do in the next    and a half minutes is I'm going to talk first about the flames    where we are in the economy    and then I'm going to take three trends that have taken place at TED over the last    years and that will take place in this conference and I will try and bring them together. And I will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like. Those three trends are the ability to engineer cells  the ability to engineer tissues  and robots. And somehow it will all make sense. But anyway  let's start with the economy. There's a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there. One is leverage. And the problem with leverage is it makes the U.S. financial system look like this. So  a normal commercial bank has nine to    times leverage. That means for every dollar you deposit  it loans out about nine or   . A normal investment bank is not a deposit bank  it's an investment bank  it has    to    times. It turns out that B of A in September had    times. And your friendly Citibank had    times. Oops. That means every bad loan goes bad    times over. And that  of course  is the reason why all of you are making such generous and wonderful donations to these nice folks. And as you think about that  you've got to wonder  so what do banks have in store for you now  It ain't pretty. The government  meanwhile  has been acting like Santa Claus. We all love Santa Claus  right  But the problem with Santa Clause is  if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing and promising folks  it turned out that in          percent was mandatory spending on what we call  entitlements.  And then by      it was    percent. And we weren't supposed to run into     percent until about     . Except we've been so busy giving away a trillion here  a trillion there  that we've brought that date of reckoning forward to about     . And we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids  but  guess what  We're going to start to pay them. And the problem with this stuff is  now that the bill's come due  it turns out Santa isn't quite as cute when it's summertime. Right  Here's some advice from one of the largest investors in the United States. This guy runs the China Investment Corporation. He is the main buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds. And he gave an interview in December. Here's his first bit of advice. And here's his second bit of advice. And  by the way  the Chinese Prime Minister reiterated this at Davos last Sunday. This stuff is getting serious enough that if we don't start paying attention to the deficit  we're going to end up losing the dollar. And then all bets are off. Let me show you what it looks like. I think I can safely say that I'm the only trillionaire in this room. This is an actual bill. And it's    triliion dollars. The only problem with this bill is it's not really worth very much. That was eight bucks last week  four bucks this week  a buck next week. And that's what happens to currencies when you don't stand behind them. So the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep  and sometimes this creature's called Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes ... whatever you want    you've just got to say no. And you've got to start banishing a word that's called  entitlement.  And the reason we have to do that in the short term is because we have just run out of cash. If you look at the federal budget  this is what it looks like. The orange slice is what's discretionary. Everything else is mandated. It makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to Alaska in the overall scheme of things. So what we have to start thinking about doing is capping our medical spending because that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget. We've got to start thinking about asking people to retire a little bit later. If you're    to    you retire on time. Your     k  just got nailed. If you're    to    we want you to work two years more. If you're under    we want you to work four more years. The reason why that's reasonable is  when your grandparents were given Social Security  they got it at    and were expected to check out at   . Sixty eight is young today. We've also got to cut the military about three percent a year. We've got to limit other mandatory spending. We've got to quit borrowing as much  because otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie. And we've got to end up with a smaller government. And if we don't start changing this trend line  we are going to lose the dollar and start to look like Iceland. I got what you're thinking. This is going to happen when hell freezes over. But let me remind you this December it did snow in Vegas. Here's what happens if you don't address this stuff. So  Japan had a fiscal real estate crisis back in the late '  s. And its     largest companies today are worth one quarter of what they were    years ago. We don't fix this now  how would you like to see a Dow       in       Because that's the consequence of not dealing with this stuff. And unless you want this person to not just become the CFO of Florida  but the United States  we'd better deal with this stuff. That's the short term. That's the flame part. That's the financial crisis. Now  right behind the financial crisis there's a second and bigger wave that we need to talk about. That wave is much larger  much more powerful  and that's of course the wave of technology. And what's really important in this stuff is  as we cut  we also have to grow. Among other things  because startup companies are .   percent of U.S. GDP investmentm and they're about   .  percent of output. It's groups like that in this room that generate the future of the U.S. economy. And that's what we've got to keep growing. We don't have to keep growing these bridges to nowhere. So let's bring a romance novelist into this conversation. And that's where these three trends come together. That's where the ability to engineer microbes  the ability to engineer tissues  and the ability to engineer robots begin to lead to a reboot. And let me recap some of the stuff you've seen. Craig Venter showed up last year and showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware where you can insert DNA and have it boot up as a different species. In parallel  the folks at MIT have been building a standard registry of biological parts. So think of it as a Radio Shack for biology. You can go out and get your proteins  your RNA  your DNA  whatever. And start building stuff. In      they brought together high school students and college students and started to build these little odd creatures. They just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards. Here was one of the first things they built. So  cells have this cycle. First they don't grow. Then they grow exponentially. Then they stop growing. Graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in. So they engineered these cells so that when they're growing in the exponential phase  they would smell like wintergreen. And when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas. And you could tell very easily when your experiment was working and wasn't  and where it was in the phase. This got a bit more complicated two years later. Twenty one countries came together. Dozens of teams. They started competing. The team from Rice University started to engineer the substance in red wine that makes red wine good for you into beer. So you take resveratrol and you put it into beer. Of course  one of the judges is wandering by  and he goes   Wow  Cancer fighting beer  There is a God.  The team from Taiwan was a little bit more ambitious. They tried to engineer bacterias in such a way that they would act as your kidneys. Four years ago  I showed you this picture. And people oohed and ahhed  because Cliff Tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken. And that was very cool stuff back then. But now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering  let me show you what's happened in that period of time. Two years ago  you saw this creature. An almost extinct animal from Xochimilco  Mexico called an axolotl that can re generate its limbs. You can freeze half its heart. It regrows. You can freeze half the brain. It regrows. It's almost like leaving Congress. But now  you don't have to have the animal itself to regenerate  because you can build cloned mice molars in Petri dishes. And  of course if you can build mice molars in Petri dishes  you can grow human molars in Petri dishes. This should not surprise you  right  I mean  you're born with no teeth. You give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy. You re grow a set of teeth. But then if you lose one of those second set of teeth  they don't regrow  unless  if you're a lawyer. But  of course  for most of us  we know how to grow teeth  and therefore we can take adult stem teeth  put them on a biodegradable mold  re grow a tooth  and simply implant it. And we can do it with other things. So  a Spanish woman who was dying of T.B. had a donor trachea  they took all the cells off the trachea  they spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage. She regrew her own trachea  and    hours later it was implanted. She's now running around with her kids. This is going on in Tony Atala's lab in Wake Forest where he is re growing ears for injured soldiers  and he's also re growing bladders. So there are now nine women walking around Boston with re grown bladders  which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags for the rest of your life. This is kind of getting boring  right  I mean  you understand where this story's going. But  I mean it gets more interesting. Last year  this group was able to take all the cells off a heart  leaving just the cartilage. Then  they sprayed stem cells onto that heart  from a mouse. Those stem cells self organized  and that heart started to beat. Life happens. This may be one of the ultimate papers. This was done in Japan and in the U.S.  published at the same time  and it rebooted skin cells into stem cells  last year. That meant that you can take the stuff right here  and turn it into almost anything in your body. And this is becoming common  it's moving very quickly  it's moving in a whole series of places. Third trend  robots. Those of us of a certain age grew up expecting that by now we would have Rosie the Robot from  The Jetsons  in our house. And all we've got is a Roomba. We also thought we'd have this robot to warn us of danger. Didn't happen. And these were robots engineered for a flat world  right  So  Rosie runs around on skates and the other one ran on flat threads. If you don't have a flat world  that's not good  which is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different. This is Boston Dynamics'  BigDog.  And this is about as close as you can get to a physical Turing test. O.K.  so let me remind you  a Turing test is where you've got a wall  you're talking to somebody on the other side of the wall  and when you don't know if that thing is human or animal    that's when computers have reached human intelligence. This is not an intelligence Turing rest  but this is as close as you can get to a physical Turing test. And this stuff is moving very quickly  and by the way  that thing can carry about     pounds of weight. These are not the only interesting robots. You've also got flies  the size of flies  that are being made by Robert Wood at Harvard. You've got Stickybots that are being made at Stanford. And as you bring these things together  as you bring cells  biological tissue engineering and mechanics together  you begin to get some really odd questions. In the last Olympics  this gentleman  who had several world records in the Special Olympics  tried to run in the normal Olympics. The only issue with Oscar Pistorius is he was born without bones in the lower part of his legs. He came within about a second of qualifying. He sued to be allowed to run  and he won the suit  but didn't qualify by time. Next Olympics  you can bet that Oscar  or one of Oscar's successors  is going to make the time. And two or three Olympics after that  they are going to be unbeatable. And as you bring these trends together  and as you think of what it means to take people who are profoundly deaf  who can now begin to hear    I mean  remember the evolution of hearing aids  right  I mean  your grandparents had these great big cones  and then your parents had these odd boxes that would squawk at odd times during dinner  and now we have these little buds that nobody sees. And now you have cochlear implants that go into people's heads and allow the deaf to begin to hear. Now  they can't hear as well as you and I can. But  in    or    machine generations they will  and these are machine generations  not human generations. And about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can  they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing  or how whales talk  or how dogs talk  and other types of tonal scales. They'll be able to focus their hearing  they'll be able to increase the sensitivity  decrease the sensitivity  do a series of things that we can't do. And the same thing is happening in eyes. This is a group in Germany that's beginning to engineer eyes so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark. Very primitive. And then they'll be able to see shape. And then they'll be able to see color  and then they'll be able to see in definition  and one day  they'll see as well as you and I can. And a couple of years after that  they'll be able to see in ultraviolet  they'll be able to see in infrared  they'll be able to focus their eyes  they'll be able to come into a microfocus. They'll do stuff you and I can't do. All of these things are coming together  and it's a particularly important thing to understand  as we worry about the flames of the present  to keep an eye on the future. And  of course  the future is looking back     years  because next week is the    th anniversary of Darwin's birth. And it's the    th anniversary of the publication of  The Origin of Species.  And Darwin  of course  argued that evolution is a natural state. It is a natural state in everything that is alive  including hominids. There have actually been    species of hominids that have been around  have evolved  have wandered in different places  have gone extinct. It is common for hominids to evolve. And that's the reason why  as you look at the hominid fossil record  erectus  and heidelbergensis  and floresiensis  and Neanderthals  and Homo sapiens  all overlap. The common state of affairs is to have overlapping versions of hominids  not one. And as you think of the implications of that  here's a brief history of the universe. The universe was created   .  billion years ago  and then you created all the stars  and all the planets  and all the galaxies  and all the Milky Ways. And then you created Earth about  .  billion years ago  and then you got life about four billion years ago  and then you got hominids about  .    billion years ago  and then you got our version of hominids about  .     billion years ago. Ta dah  Maybe the reason for thr creation of the universe  and all the galaxies  and all the planets  and all the energy  and all the dark energy  and all the rest of stuff is to create what's in this room. Maybe not. That would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint. So  if that's not the purpose of the universe  then what's next  I think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid. I think we're going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evolutis. And I think this isn't       years out. I think most of us are going to glance at it  and our grandchildren are going to begin to live it. And a Homo evolutis brings together these three trends into a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control over the evolution of his species  her species and other species. And that  of course  would be the ultimate reboot. Thank you very much.,Futurist,200902,6.060060331825032
277,1890,1892,Juan Enriquez 2007,Juan Enriquez,male,The life code that will reshape the future,Apr 2007,1262,I'm supposed to scare you  because it's about fear  right  And you should be really afraid  but not for the reasons why you think you should be. You should be really afraid that    if we stick up the first slide on this thing    there we go    that you're missing out. Because if you spend this week thinking about Iraq and thinking about Bush and thinking about the stock market  you're going to miss one of the greatest adventures that we've ever been on. And this is what this adventure's really about. This is crystallized DNA. Every life form on this planet    every insect  every bacteria  every plant  every animal  every human  every politician     Laughter  is coded in that stuff. And if you want to take a single crystal of DNA  it looks like that. And we're just beginning to understand this stuff. And this is the single most exciting adventure that we have ever been on. It's the single greatest mapping project we've ever been on. If you think that the mapping of America's made a difference  or landing on the moon  or this other stuff  it's the map of ourselves and the map of every plant and every insect and every bacteria that really makes a difference. And it's beginning to tell us a lot about evolution. It turns out that what this stuff is    and Richard Dawkins has written about this    is  this is really a river out of Eden. So  the  .  billion base pairs inside each of your cells is really a history of where you've been for the past billion years. And we could start dating things  and we could start changing medicine and archeology. It turns out that if you take the human species about     years ago  white Europeans diverged from black Africans in a very significant way. White Europeans were subject to the plague. And when they were subject to the plague  most people didn't survive  but those who survived had a mutation on the CCR  receptor. And that mutation was passed on to their kids because they're the ones that survived  so there was a great deal of population pressure. In Africa  because you didn't have these cities  you didn't have that CCR  population pressure mutation. We can date it to     years ago. That is one of the reasons why AIDS is raging across Africa as fast as it is  and not as fast across Europe. And we're beginning to find these little things for malaria  for sickle cell  for cancers. And in the measure that we map ourselves  this is the single greatest adventure that we'll ever be on. And this Friday  I want you to pull out a really good bottle of wine  and I want you to toast these two people. Because this Friday     years ago  Watson and Crick found the structure of DNA  and that is almost as important a date as the   th of February when we first mapped ourselves  but anyway  we'll get to that. I thought we'd talk about the new zoo. So  all you guys have heard about DNA  all the stuff that DNA does  but some of the stuff we're discovering is kind of nifty because this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet. If you think you're successful or cockroaches are successful  it turns out that there's ten trillion trillion Pleurococcus sitting out there. And we didn't know that Pleurococcus was out there  which is part of the reason why this whole species mapping project is so important. Because we're just beginning to learn where we came from and what we are. And we're finding amoebas like this. This is the amoeba dubia. And the amoeba dubia doesn't look like much  except that each of you has about  .  billion letters  which is what makes you you  as far as gene code inside each of your cells  and this little amoeba which  you know  sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions  turns out to have     billion base pairs of gene code inside. So  this little thingamajig has a genome that's     times the size of yours. And if you're thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms  it may not turn out to be chips. It may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba. And  again  we're learning from life and how life works. This funky little thing  people didn't used to think that it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors because it was dangerous and  of course  nothing lived there. And then finally somebody picked up a microscope and looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores. And sitting next to that water in the cores was this little Deinococcus radiodurans  doing a backstroke  having its chromosomes blown apart every day  six  seven times  restitching them  living in about     times the radiation that would kill you. And by now you should be getting a hint as to how diverse and how important and how interesting this journey into life is  and how many different life forms there are  and how there can be different life forms living in very different places  maybe even outside of this planet. Because if you can live in radiation that looks like this  that brings up a whole series of interesting questions. This little thingamajig  we didn't know this thingamajig existed. We should have known that this existed because this is the only bacteria that you can see to the naked eye. So  this thing is  .   millimeters. It lives in a deep trench off the coast of Namibia. And what you're looking at with this namibiensis is the biggest bacteria we've ever seen. So  it's about the size of a little period on a sentence. Again  we didn't know this thing was there three years ago. We're just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo. This is a really odd one. This is Ferroplasma. The reason why Ferroplasma is interesting is because it eats iron  lives inside the equivalent of battery acid  and excretes sulfuric acid. So  when you think of odd life forms  when you think of what it takes to live  it turns out this is a very efficient life form  and they call it an archaea. Archaea means  the ancient ones.  And the reason why they're ancient is because this thing came up when this planet was covered by things like sulfuric acid in batteries  and it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core. So  it's not just dogs and cats and whales and dolphins that you should be aware of and interested in on this little journey. Your fear should be that you are not  that you're paying attention to stuff which is temporal. I mean  George Bush    he's going to be gone  alright  Life isn't. Whether the humans survive or don't survive  these things are going to be living on this planet or other planets. And it's just beginning to understand this code of DNA that's really the most exciting intellectual adventure that we've ever been on. And you can do strange things with this stuff. This is a baby gar. Conservation group gets together  tries to figure out how to breed an animal that's almost extinct. They can't do it naturally  so what they do with this thing is they take a spoon  take some cells out of an adult gar's mouth  code  take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow's egg  reprogram cow's egg    different gene code. When you do that  the cow gives birth to a gar. We are now experimenting with bongos  pandas  elims  Sumatran tigers  and the Australians    bless their hearts    are playing with these things. Now  the last of these things died in September     . These are Tasmanian tigers. The last known one died at the Hobart Zoo. But it turns out that as we learn more about gene code and how to reprogram species  we may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate DNA. And when we learn how to close the gene gaps  then we can put a full string of DNA together. And if we do that  and insert this into a fertilized wolf's egg  we may give birth to an animal that hasn't walked the earth since     . And then you can start going back further  and you can start thinking about dodos  and you can think about other species. And in other places  like Maryland  they're trying to figure out what the primordial ancestor is. Because each of us contains our entire gene code of where we've been for the past billion years  because we've evolved from that stuff  you can take that tree of life and collapse it back  and in the measure that you learn to reprogram  maybe we'll give birth to something that is very close to the first primordial ooze. And it's all coming out of things that look like this. These are companies that didn't exist five years ago. Huge gene sequencing facilities the size of football fields. Some are public. Some are private. It takes about   billion dollars to sequence a human being the first time. Takes about   million dollars the second time. We will have a       dollar genome within the next five to eight years. That means each of you will contain on a CD your entire gene code. And it will be really boring. It will read like this. The really neat thing about this stuff is that's life. And Laurie's going to talk about this one a little bit. Because if you happen to find this one inside your body  you're in big trouble  because that's the source code for Ebola. That's one of the deadliest diseases known to humans. But plants work the same way and insects work the same way  and this apple works the same way. This apple is the same thing as this floppy disk. Because this thing codes ones and zeros  and this thing codes A  T  C  Gs  and it sits up there  absorbing energy on a tree  and one fine day it has enough energy to say  execute  and it goes  thump . Right  And when it does that  pushes a .EXE  what it does is  it executes the first line of code  which reads just like that  AATCAGGGACCC  and that means  make a root. Next line of code  make a stem. Next line of code  TACGGGG  make a flower that's white  that blooms in the spring  that smells like this. In the measure that you have the code and the measure that you read it    and  by the way  the first plant was read two years ago  the first human was read two years ago  the first insect was read two years ago. The first thing that we ever read was in       a little bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae. In the measure that you have the source code  as all of you know  you can change the source code  and you can reprogram life forms so that this little thingy becomes a vaccine  or this little thingy starts producing biomaterials  which is why DuPont is now growing a form of polyester that feels like silk in corn. This changes all rules. This is life  but we're reprogramming it. This is what you look like. This is one of your chromosomes. And what you can do now is  you can outlay exactly what your chromosome is  and what the gene code on that chromosome is right here  and what those genes code for  and what animals they code against  and then you can tie it to the literature. And in the measure that you can do that  you can go home today  and get on the Internet  and access the world's biggest public library  which is a library of life. And you can do some pretty strange things because in the same way as you can reprogram this apple  if you go to Cliff Tabin's lab at the Harvard Medical School  he's reprogramming chicken embryos to grow more wings. Why would Cliff be doing that  He doesn't have a restaurant. The reason why he's reprogramming that animal to have more wings is because when you used to play with lizards as a little child  and you picked up the lizard  sometimes the tail fell off  but it regrew. Not so in human beings  you cut off an arm  you cut off a leg    it doesn't regrow. But because each of your cells contains your entire gene code  each cell can be reprogrammed  if we don't stop stem cell research and if we don't stop genomic research  to express different body functions. And in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings  and what the program is for those cells to differentiate  one of the things we're going to be able to do is to stop undifferentiated cells  which you know as cancer  and one of the things we're going to learn how to do is how to reprogram cells like stem cells in such a way that they express bone  stomach  skin  pancreas. And you are likely to be wandering around    and your children    on regrown body parts in a reasonable period of time  in some places in the world where they don't stop the research. How's this stuff work  If each of you differs from the person next to you by one in a thousand  but only three percent codes  which means it's only one in a thousand times three percent  very small differences in expression and punctuation can make a significant difference. Take a simple declarative sentence. Right  That's perfectly clear. So  men read that sentence  and they look at that sentence  and they read this. Okay  Now  women look at that sentence and they say  uh uh  wrong. This is the way it should be seen. That's what your genes are doing. That's why you differ from this person over here by one in a thousand. Right  But  you know  he's reasonably good looking  but... I won't go there. You can do this stuff even without changing the punctuation. You can look at this  right  And they look at the world a little differently. They look at the same world and they say... That's how the same gene code    that's why you have        genes  mice have        genes  husbands have        genes. Mice and men are the same. Wives know that  but anyway. You can make very small changes in gene code and get really different outcomes  even with the same string of letters. That's what your genes are doing every day. That's why sometimes a person's genes don't have to change a lot to get cancer. These little chippies  these things are the size of a credit card. They will test any one of you for        genetic conditions. That brings up questions of privacy and insurability and all kinds of stuff  but it also allows us to start going after diseases  because if you run a person who has leukemia through something like this  it turns out that three diseases with completely similar clinical syndromes are completely different diseases. Because in ALL leukemia  that set of genes over there over expresses. In MLL  it's the middle set of genes  and in AML  it's the bottom set of genes. And if one of those particular things is expressing in your body  then you take Gleevec and you're cured. If it is not expressing in your body  if you don't have one of those types    a particular one of those types    don't take Gleevec. It won't do anything for you. Same thing with Receptin if you've got breast cancer. Don't have an HER   receptor  Don't take Receptin. Changes the nature of medicine. Changes the predictions of medicine. Changes the way medicine works. The greatest repository of knowledge when most of us went to college was this thing  and it turns out that this is not so important any more. The U.S. Library of Congress  in terms of its printed volume of data  contains less data than is coming out of a good genomics company every month on a compound basis. Let me say that again  A single genomics company generates more data in a month  on a compound basis  than is in the printed collections of the Library of Congress. This is what's been powering the U.S. economy. It's Moore's Law. So  all of you know that the price of computers halves every    months and the power doubles  right  Except that when you lay that side by side with the speed with which gene data's being deposited in GenBank  Moore's Law is right here  it's the blue line. This is on a log scale  and that's what superexponential growth means. This is going to push computers to have to grow faster than they've been growing  because so far  there haven't been applications that have been required that need to go faster than Moore's Law. This stuff does. And here's an interesting map. This is a map which was finished at the Harvard Business School. One of the really interesting questions is  if all this data's free  who's using it  This is the greatest public library in the world. Well  it turns out that there's about    trillion bits moving inside from the United States to the United States  about  .  trillion is going over to those European countries  about  . 's going to Japan  there's almost no communication between Japan  and nobody else is literate in this stuff. It's free. No one's reading it. They're focusing on the war  they're focusing on Bush  they're not interested in life. So  this is what a new map of the world looks like. That is the genomically literate world. And that is a problem. In fact  it's not a genomically literate world. You can break this out by states. And you can watch states rise and fall depending on their ability to speak a language of life  and you can watch New York fall off a cliff  and you can watch New Jersey fall off a cliff  and you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence. And you can break it out by counties  because it's specific counties. And if you want to get more specific  it's actually specific zip codes. So  you want to know where life is happening  Well  in Southern California it's happening in      . And that's it. And that's the triangle between Salk  Scripps  UCSD  and it's called Torrey Pines Road. That means you don't need to be a big nation to be successful  it means you don't need a lot of people to be successful  and it means you can move most of the wealth of a country in about three or four carefully picked    s. Same thing in Massachusetts. Looks more spread out but    oh  by the way  the ones that are the same color are contiguous. What's the net effect of this  In an agricultural society  the difference between the richest and the poorest  the most productive and the least productive  was five to one. Why  Because in agriculture  if you had    kids and you grow up a little bit earlier and you work a little bit harder  you could produce about five times more wealth  on average  than your neighbor. In a knowledge society  that number is now     to  . It really matters if you're literate  not just in reading and writing in English and French and German  but in Microsoft and Linux and Apple. And very soon it's going to matter if you're literate in life code. So  if there is something you should fear  it's that you're not keeping your eye on the ball. Because it really matters who speaks life. That's why nations rise and fall. And it turns out that if you went back to the     s  the most productive nation on earth was Australia  per person. And New Zealand was way up there. And then the U.S. came in about       and then Switzerland about       and then the U.S. got back on top    beat up their chocolates and cuckoo clocks. And today  of course  you all know that the most productive nation on earth is Luxembourg  producing about one third more wealth per person per year than America. Tiny landlocked state. No oil. No diamonds. No natural resources. Just smart people moving bits. Different rules. Here's differential productivity rates. Here's how many people it takes to produce a single U.S. patent. So  about       Americans        Koreans         Brits          Argentines. You want to know why Argentina's crashing  It's got nothing to do with inflation. It's got nothing to do with privatization. You can take a Harvard educated Ivy League economist  stick him in charge of Argentina. He still crashes the country because he doesn't understand how the rules have changed. Oh  yeah  and it takes about  .  million Indians. Well  watch what happens to India. India and China used to be    percent of the global economy just at the Industrial Revolution  and they are now about  .  percent. Two billion people. One third of the global population producing   percent of the wealth because they didn't get this change  because they kept treating their people like serfs instead of like shareholders of a common project. They didn't keep the people who were educated. They didn't foment the businesses. They didn't do the IPOs. Silicon Valley did. And that's why they say that Silicon Valley has been powered by ICs. Not integrated circuits  Indians and Chinese. Here's what's happening in the world. It turns out that if you'd gone to the U.N. in       when it was founded  there were    countries in this world. It turns out there's now about    . Country after country is splitting  seceding  succeeding  failing    and it's all getting very fragmented. And this has not stopped. In the     s  these are sovereign states that did not exist before     . And this doesn't include fusions or name changes or changes in flags. We're generating about  .   states per year. People are taking control of their own states  sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. And the really interesting thing is  you and your kids are empowered to build great empires  and you don't need a lot to do it. And  given that the music is over  I was going to talk about how you can use this to generate a lot of wealth  and how code works. Moderator  Two minutes. Juan Enriquez  No  I'm going to stop there and we'll do it next year because I don't want to take any of Laurie's time. But thank you very much.,Futurist,200704,6.069832041343668
278,2031,2033,Julia Bacha 2011,Julia Bacha,female,Pay attention to nonviolence,Aug 2011,630,I'm a filmmaker. For the last   years  I have dedicated my life to documenting the work of Israelis and Palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means. When I travel with my work across Europe and the United States  one question always comes up  Where is the Palestinian Gandhi  Why aren't Palestinians using nonviolent resistance  The challenge I face when I hear this question is that often I have just returned from the Middle East where I spent my time filming dozens of Palestinians who are using nonviolence to defend their lands and water resources from Israeli soldiers and settlers. These leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region. Yet  most of you have probably never heard about them. This divide between what's happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we don't have yet a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful. So I'm here today to talk about the power of attention  the power of your attention  and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the West Bank  Gaza and elsewhere    but today  my case study is going to be Palestine. I believe that what's mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for Palestinians to start adopting nonviolence  but for us to start paying attention to those who already are. Allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called Budrus. About seven years ago  they faced extinction  because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier  and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village. They would lose    percent of their land and be surrounded  so they would lose free access to the rest of the West Bank. Through inspired local leadership  they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening. Let me show you some brief clips  so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground. Palestinian Woman  We were told the wall would separate Palestine from Israel. Here in Budrus  we realized the wall would steal our land. Israeli Man  The fence has  in fact  created a solution to terror. Man  Today you're invited to a peaceful march. You are joined by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters. Israeli Activist  Nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition. Woman  We saw the men trying to push the soldiers  but none of them could do that. But I think the girls could do it. Fatah Party Member  We must empty our minds of traditional thinking. Hamas Party Member  We were in complete harmony  and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine. Chanting  One united nation. Fatah  Hamas and the Popular Front  News Anchor  The clashes over the fence continue. Reporter  Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd. They were allowed to use any force necessary. Man  These are live bullets. It's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere. Israeli Activist  I was sure we were all going to die. But there were others around me who weren't even cowering. Israeli Soldier  A nonviolent protest is not going to stop the  unclear . Protester  This is a peaceful march. There is no need to use violence. Chanting  We can do it  We can do it  We can do it  Julia Bacha  When I first heard about the story of Budrus  I was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago  in     . What was even more surprising was the fact that Budrus was successful. The residents  after    months of peaceful resistance  convinced the Israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line  which is the internationally recognized boundary between Israel and the Palestinian Territories. The resistance in Budrus has since spread to villages across the West Bank and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem. Yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories. This silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow  or even survive  in Palestine. Violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common  they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause. If violent actors are the only ones constantly getting front page covers and attracting international attention to the Palestinian issue  it becomes very hard for nonviolent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option in addressing their plight. The power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room. The surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit. The tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior  since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it. Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children. But that's true for adults too. In fact  the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced  depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention. I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today. In the course of taking my film to villages in the West Bank  in Gaza and in East Jerusalem  I have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation. In a village called Wallajeh  which sits very close to Jerusalem  the community was facing a very similar plight to Budrus. They were going to be surrounded  lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access  either to the West Bank or Jerusalem. They had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention. So we organized a screening. A week later  they held the most well attended and disciplined demonstration to date. The organizers say that the villagers  upon seeing the story of Budrus documented in a film  felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing  that people cared. So they kept on going. On the Israeli side  there is a new peace movement called Solidariot  which means solidarity in Hebrew. The leaders of this movement have been using Budrus as one of their primary recruiting tools. They report that Israelis who had never been active before  upon seeing the film  understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities. The examples of Wallajeh and the Solidariot movement show that even a small budget independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior. Now imagine the power that big media players could have if they started covering the weekly nonviolent demonstrations happening in villages like Bil'in  Ni'lin  Wallajeh  in Jerusalem neighborhoods like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan    the nonviolent leaders would become more visible  valued and effective in their work. I believe that the most important thing is to understand that if we don't pay attention to these efforts  they are invisible  and it's as if they never happened. But I have seen first hand that if we do  they will multiply. If they multiply  their influence will grow in the overall Israeli Palestinian conflict. And theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation. These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus. Let's give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere. Thank you.,Filmmaker,201108,6.0874045801526675
285,1312,1314,Ken Robinson 2006,Ken Robinson,male,Do schools kill creativity?,Jun 2006,1145,Good morning. How are you  It's been great  hasn't it  I've been blown away by the whole thing. In fact  I'm leaving. There have been three themes running through the conference which are relevant to what I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here. Just the variety of it and the range of it. The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen  in terms of the future. No idea how this may play out. I have an interest in education. Actually  what I find is everybody has an interest in education. Don't you  I find this very interesting. If you're at a dinner party  and you say you work in education    Actually  you're not often at dinner parties  frankly. If you work in education  you're not asked. And you're never asked back  curiously. That's strange to me. But if you are  and you say to somebody  you know  they say   What do you do   and you say you work in education  you can see the blood run from their face. They're like   Oh my God   you know   Why me    My one night out all week.  But if you ask about their education  they pin you to the wall. Because it's one of those things that goes deep with people  am I right  Like religion  and money and other things. So I have a big interest in education  and I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it  partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think of it  children starting school this year will be retiring in     . Nobody has a clue  despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days  what the world will look like in five years' time. And yet we're meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability  I think  is extraordinary. And the third part of this is that we've all agreed  nonetheless  on the really extraordinary capacities that children have    their capacities for innovation. I mean  Sirena last night was a marvel  wasn't she  Just seeing what she could do. And she's exceptional  but I think she's not  so to speak  exceptional in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent. And my contention is  all kids have tremendous talents. And we squander them  pretty ruthlessly. So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity. My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy  and we should treat it with the same status. That was it  by the way. Thank you very much. So     minutes left. Well  I was born... no. I heard a great story recently    I love telling it    of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson. She was six  and she was at the back  drawing  and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention  and in this drawing lesson  she did. The teacher was fascinated. She went over to her  and she said   What are you drawing   And the girl said   I'm drawing a picture of God.  And the teacher said   But nobody knows what God looks like.  And the girl said   They will  in a minute.  When my son was four in England    Actually  he was four everywhere  to be honest. If we're being strict about it  wherever he went  he was four that year. He was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story  No  it was big  it was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel  you may have seen it.  Nativity II.  But James got the part of Joseph  which we were thrilled about. We considered this to be one of the lead parts. We had the place crammed full of agents in T shirts   James Robinson IS Joseph    Laughter  He didn't have to speak  but you know the bit where the three kings come in  They come in bearing gifts  gold  frankincense and myrrh. This really happened. We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence  because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said   You OK with that   And he said   Yeah  why  Was that wrong   They just switched. The three boys came in  four year olds with tea towels on their heads  and they put these boxes down  and the first boy said   I bring you gold.  And the second boy said   I bring you myrrh.  And the third boy said   Frank sent this.  What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance. If they don't know  they'll have a go. Am I right  They're not frightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is  if you're not prepared to be wrong  you'll never come up with anything original    if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults  most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities. Picasso once said this  he said that all children are born artists. The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately  that we don't grow into creativity  we grow out of it. Or rather  we get educated out of it. So why is this  I lived in Stratford on Avon until about five years ago. In fact  we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles. So you can imagine what a seamless transition that was. Actually  we lived in a place called Snitterfield  just outside Stratford  which is where Shakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought  I was. You don't think of Shakespeare having a father  do you  Do you  Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child  do you  Shakespeare being seven  I never thought of it. I mean  he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's English class  wasn't he  How annoying would that be   Must try harder.  Being sent to bed by his dad  you know  to Shakespeare   Go to bed  now  And put the pencil down.   And stop speaking like that.   It's confusing everybody.  Anyway  we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles  and I just want to say a word about the transition. My son didn't want to come. I've got two kids  he's    now  my daughter's   . He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it  but he had a girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life  Sarah. He'd known her for a month. Mind you  they'd had their fourth anniversary  because it's a long time when you're   . He was really upset on the plane  he said   I'll never find another girl like Sarah.  And we were rather pleased about that  frankly    Because she was the main reason we were leaving the country. But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world  Every education system on Earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be otherwise  but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages  then the humanities  and at the bottom are the arts. Everywhere on Earth. And in pretty much every system too  there's a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why  Why not  I think this is rather important. I think math is very important  but so is dance. Children dance all the time if they're allowed to  we all do. We all have bodies  don't we  Did I miss a meeting  Truthfully  what happens is  as children grow up  we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side. If you were to visit education  as an alien  and say  What's it for  public education   I think you'd have to conclude  if you look at the output  who really succeeds by this  who does everything that they should  who gets all the brownie points  who are the winners    I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it  They're the people who come out the top. And I used to be one  so there. And I like university professors  but you know  we shouldn't hold them up as the high water mark of all human achievement. They're just a form of life  another form of life. But they're rather curious  and I say this out of affection for them. There's something curious about professors in my experience    not all of them  but typically  they live in their heads. They live up there  and slightly to one side. They're disembodied  you know  in a kind of literal way. They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads. Don't they  It's a way of getting their head to meetings. If you want real evidence of out of body experiences  get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics  and pop into the discotheque on the final night. And there  you will see it. Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably  off the beat. Waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it. Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world  there were no public systems of education  really  before the   th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas. Number one  that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid  things you liked  on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that. Is that right  Don't do music  you're not going to be a musician  don't do art  you won't be an artist. Benign advice    now  profoundly mistaken. The whole world is engulfed in a revolution. And the second is academic ability  which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence  because the universities designed the system in their image. If you think of it  the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly talented  brilliant  creative people think they're not  because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued  or was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford to go on that way. In the next    years  according to UNESCO  more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history. More people  and it's the combination of all the things we've talked about    technology and its transformation effect on work  and demography and the huge explosion in population. Suddenly  degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true  When I was a student  if you had a degree  you had a job. If you didn't have a job  it's because you didn't want one. And I didn't want one  frankly.  Laughter  But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games  because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA  and now you need a PhD for the other. It's a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence. We know three things about intelligence. One  it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it. We think visually  we think in sound  we think kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms  we think in movement. Secondly  intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions of a human brain  as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations  intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn't divided into compartments. In fact  creativity    which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value    more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things. By the way  there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum. It's thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday  this is probably why women are better at multi tasking. Because you are  aren't you  There's a raft of research  but I know it from my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal at home    which is not often  thankfully. No  she's good at some things  but if she's cooking  she's dealing with people on the phone  she's talking to the kids  she's painting the ceiling  she's doing open heart surgery over here. If I'm cooking  the door is shut  the kids are out  the phone's on the hook  if she comes in I get annoyed. I say   Terry  please  I'm trying to fry an egg in here.   Give me a break.  Actually  do you know that old philosophical thing  if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it  did it happen  Remember that old chestnut  I saw a great t shirt recently  which said   If a man speaks his mind in a forest  and no woman hears him  is he still wrong   And the third thing about intelligence is  it's distinct. I'm doing a new book at the moment called  Epiphany   which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. I'm fascinated by how people got to be there. It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of  Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her  Some have. She's a choreographer  and everybody knows her work. She did  Cats  and  Phantom of the Opera.  She's wonderful. I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet  as you can see. Anyway  Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said   How did you get to be a dancer   It was interesting. When she was at school  she was really hopeless. And the school  in the '  s  wrote to her parents and said   We think Gillian has a learning disorder.  She couldn't concentrate  she was fidgeting. I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you  But this was the     s  and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point. It wasn't an available condition. People weren't aware they could have that. Anyway  she went to see this specialist. So  this oak paneled room  and she was there with her mother  and she was led and sat on this chair at the end  and she sat on her hands for    minutes while this man talked to her mother about the problems Gillian was having at school. Because she was disturbing people  her homework was always late  and so on  little kid of eight. In the end  the doctor went and sat next to Gillian  and said   I've listened to all these things your mother's told me  I need to speak to her privately. Wait here. We'll be back  we won't be very long   and they went and left her. But as they went out of the room  he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk. And when they got out  he said to her mother   Just stand and watch her.  And the minute they left the room  she was on her feet  moving to the music. And they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said   Mrs. Lynne  Gillian isn't sick  she's a dancer. Take her to a dance school.  I said   What happened   She said   She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was. We walked in this room and it was full of people like me. People who couldn't sit still. People who had to move to think.  Who had to move to think. They did ballet  they did tap  jazz  they did modern  they did contemporary. She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School  she became a soloist  she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School  founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company  met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history  she's given pleasure to millions  and she's a multi millionaire. Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down. What I think it comes to is this  Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology  one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip mine the earth  for a particular commodity. And for the future  it won't serve us. We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children. There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk  who said   If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth  within    years all life on Earth would end. If all human beings disappeared from the Earth  within    years all forms of life would flourish.  And he's right. What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination. We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about. And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are. And our task is to educate their whole being  so they can face this future. By the way    we may not see this future  but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it. Thank you very much.,Author/educator,200606,6.176430288461544
291,1358,1360,Larry Burns 2008,Larry Burns,male,The future of cars,Dec 2008,507,People love their automobiles. They allow us to go where we want to when we want to. They're a form of entertainment  they're a form of art  a pride of ownership. Songs are written about cars. Prince wrote a great song   Little Red Corvette.  He didn't write  Little Red Laptop Computer  or  Little Red Dirt Devil.  He wrote about a car. And one of my favorites has always been   Make love to your man in a Chevy van   because that was my vehicle when I was in college. The fact is  when we do our market research around the world  we see that there's nearly a universal aspiration on the part of people to own an automobile. And     million people in the world today own a car. And you say  boy  that's a lot. But you know what  That's just    percent of the population. We really have to ask the question  Can the world sustain that number of automobiles  And if you look at projections over the next    to    to    years  it looks like the world car park could grow to on the order of  .  billion vehicles. Now  if you parked those end to end and wrapped them around the Earth  that would stretch around the Earth     times. Now  we've made great progress with automobile technology over the last     years. Cars are dramatically cleaner  dramatically safer  more efficient and radically more affordable than they were     years ago. But the fact remains  the fundamental DNA of the automobile has stayed pretty much the same. If we are going to reinvent the automobile today  rather than     years ago  knowing what we know about the issues associated with our product and about the technologies that exist today  what would we do  We wanted something that was really affordable. The fuel cell looked great  one tenth as many moving parts and a fuel cell propulsion system as an internal combustion engine    and it emits just water. And we wanted to take advantage of Moore's Law with electronic controls and software  and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected. So we embarked upon the reinvention around an electrochemical engine  the fuel cell  hydrogen as the energy carrier. First was Autonomy. Autonomy really set the vision for where we wanted to head. We embodied all of the key components of a fuel cell propulsion system. We then had Autonomy drivable with Hy Wire  and we showed Hy Wire here at this conference last year. Hy Wire is the world's first drivable fuel cell  and we have followed up that now with Sequel. And Sequel truly is a real car. So if we would run the video    But the real key question I'm sure that's on your mind  where's the hydrogen going to come from  And secondly  when are these kinds of cars going to be available  So let me talk about hydrogen first. The beauty of hydrogen is it can come from so many different sources  it can come from fossil fuels  it can come from any way that you can create electricity  including renewables. And it can come from biofuels. And that's quite exciting. The vision here is to have each local community play to its natural strength in creating the hydrogen. A lot of hydrogen's produced today in the world. It's produced to get sulfur out of gasoline    which I find is somewhat ironic. It's produced in the fertilizer industry  it's produced in the chemical manufacturing industry. That hydrogen's being made because there's a good business reason for its use. But it tells us that we know how to create it  we know how to create it cost effectively  we know how to handle it safely. We did an analysis where you would have a station in each city with each of the     largest cities in the United States  and located the stations so you'd be no more than two miles from a station at any time. We put one every    miles on the freeway  and it turns out that translates into about        stations. And at a million dollars each  that would be about    billion dollars. Now that's a lot of money. But if you built the Alaskan pipeline today  that's half of what the Alaskan pipeline would cost. But the real exciting vision that we see truly is home refueling  much like recharging your laptop or recharging your cellphone. So we're pretty excited about the future of hydrogen. We think it's a question of not whether  but a question of when. What we've targeted for ourselves    and we're making great progress for this goal    is to have a propulsion system based on hydrogen and fuel cells  designed and validated  that can go head to head with the internal combustion engine    we're talking about obsoleting the internal combustion engine    and do it in terms of its affordability  add skill volumes  its performance and its durability. So that's what we're driving to for     . We haven't seen anything yet in our development work that says that isn't possible. We actually think the future's going to be event driven. So since we can't predict the future  we want to spend a lot of our time trying to create that future. I'm very  very intrigued by the fact that our cars and trucks sit idle    percent of the time  they're parked  they're parked all around us. They're usually parked within     feet of the people that own them. Now  if you take the power generating capability of an automobile and you compare that to the electric grid in the United States  it turns out that four percent of the automobiles  the power in four percent of the automobiles  equals that of the electric grid of the US. that's a huge power generating capability  a mobile power generating capability. And hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity to actually use our cars and trucks when they're parked to generate electricity for the grid. And we talked about swarm networks earlier. And talking about the ultimate swarm  about having all of the processors and all of the cars when they're sitting idle being part of a global grid for computing capability. We find that premise quite exciting. The automobile becomes  then  an appliance  not in a commodity sense  but an appliance  mobile power  mobile platform for information and computing and communication  as well as a form of transportation. And the key to all of this is to make it affordable  to make it exciting  to get it on a pathway where there's a way to make money doing it. And again  this is a pretty big march to take here. And a lot of people say  how do you sleep at night when you're rustling with a problem of that magnitude  And I tell them I sleep like a baby  I wake up crying every two hours. Actually the theme of this conference  I think  has hit on really one of the major keys to pull that off    and that's relationships and working together. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Larry  Larry  wait  wait  wait  wait  Larry  wait  wait one sec. Just    I've got so many questions I could ask you. I just want to ask one. You know  I could be wrong about this  but my sense is that in the public mind  today  that GM is not viewed as serious about some of these environmental ideas as some of your Japanese competitors  maybe even as Ford. Are you serious about it  and not just  you know  when the consumers want it  when the regulators force us to do it we will go there  Are you guys going to really try and show leadership on this  Larry Burns  Yeah  we're absolutely serious. We're into this over a billion dollars already  so I would hope people would think we're serious when we're spending that kind of money. And secondly  it's a fundamental business proposition. I'll be honest with you  we're into it because of business growth opportunities. We can't grow our business unless we solve these problems. The growth of the auto industry will be capped by sustainability issues if we don't solve the problems. And there's a simple principle of strategy that says  Do unto yourself before others do unto you. If we can see this possible future  others can too. And we want to be the first one to create it  Chris.,Automotive researcher,200812,6.2843103448275865
292,675,677,Larry Page 2014,Larry Page,male,Where’s Google going next?,Mar 2014,1400,Charlie Rose  So Larry sent me an email and he basically said  we've got to make sure that  we don't seem like we're a couple of middle aged boring men. I said  I'm flattered by that    because I'm a bit older  and he has a bit more net worth than I do. Larry Page  Well  thank you. CR  So we'll have a conversation about the Internet  and we'll have a conversation Google  and we'll have a conversation about search and privacy  and also about your philosophy and a sense of how you've connected the dots and how this journey that began some time ago has such interesting prospects. Mainly we want to talk about the future. So my first question  Where is Google and where is it going  LP  Well  this is something we think about a lot  and our mission we defined a long time ago is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. And people always say  is that really what you guys are still doing  And I always kind of think about that myself  and I'm not quite sure. But actually  when I think about search  it's such a deep thing for all of us  to really understand what you want  to understand the world's information  and we're still very much in the early stages of that  which is totally crazy. We've been at it for    years already  but it's not at all done. CR  When it's done  how will it be  LP  Well  I guess  in thinking about where we're going    you know  why is it not done     a lot of it is just computing's kind of a mess. You know  your computer doesn't know where you are  it doesn't know what you're doing  it doesn't know what you know  and a lot we've been trying to do recently is just make your devices work  make them understand your context. Google Now  you know  knows where you are  knows what you may need. So really having computing  work and understand you and understand that information  we really haven't done that yet. It's still very  very clunky. CR  Tell me  when you look at what Google is doing  where does Deep Mind fit  LP  Yeah  so Deep Mind is a company we just acquired recently. It's in the U.K. First  let me tell you the way we got there  which was looking at search and really understanding  trying to understand everything  and also make the computers not clunky and really understand you    like  voice was really important. So what's the state of the art  on speech recognition  It's not very good. It doesn't really understand you. So we started doing machine learning research to improve that. That helped a lot. And we started just looking at things like YouTube. Can we understand YouTube  But we actually ran machine learning on YouTube and it discovered cats  just by itself. Now  that's an important concept. And we realized there's really something here. If we can learn what cats are  that must be really important. So I think Deep Mind  what's really amazing about Deep Mind is that it can actually    they're learning things in this unsupervised way. They started with video games  and really just  maybe I can show the video  just playing video games  and learning how to do that automatically. CR  Take a look at the video games and how machines are coming to be able to do some remarkable things. LP  The amazing thing about this is this is  I mean  obviously  these are old games  but the system just sees what you see  the pixels  and it has the controls and it has the score  and it's learned to play all of these games  same program. It's learned to play all of these games with superhuman performance. We've not been able to do things like this with computers before. And maybe I'll just narrate this one quickly. This is boxing  and it figures out it can sort of pin the opponent down. The computer's on the left  and it's just racking up points. So imagine if this kind of intelligence were thrown at your schedule  or your information needs  or things like that. We're really just at the beginning of that  and that's what I'm really excited about. CR  When you look at all that's taken place with Deep Mind and the boxing  also a part of where we're going is artificial intelligence. Where are we  when you look at that  LP  Well  I think for me  this is kind of one of the most exciting things I've seen in a long time. The guy who started this company  Demis  has a neuroscience and a computer science background. He went back to school to get his Ph.D. to study the brain. And so I think we're seeing a lot of exciting work going on that sort of crosses computer science and neuroscience in terms of really understanding what it takes to make something smart and do really interesting things. CR  But where's the level of it now  And how fast do you think we are moving  LP  Well  this is the state of the art right now  understanding cats on YouTube and things like that  improving voice recognition. We used a lot of machine learning to improve things incrementally  but I think for me  this example's really exciting  because it's one program that can do a lot of different things. CR  I don't know if we can do this  but we've got the image of the cat. It would be wonderful to see this. This is how machines looked at cats and what they came up with. Can we see that image  LP  Yeah. CR  There it is. Can you see the cat  Designed by machines  seen by machines. LP  That's right. So this is learned from just watching YouTube. And there's no training  no notion of a cat  but this concept of a cat is something important that you would understand  and now that the machines can kind of understand. Maybe just finishing also on the search part  it started with search  really understanding people's context and their information. I did have a video I wanted to show quickly on that that we actually found. Zack Matere  Not long ago  I planted a crop of potatoes. Then suddenly they started dying one after the other. I checked out the books and  they didn't tell me much. So  I went and I did a search.   Zack Matere  Farmer   Potato diseases. One of the websites told me that ants could be the problem. It said  sprinkle wood ash over the plants. Then after a few days the ants disappeared. I got excited about the Internet. I have this friend who really would like to expand his business. So I went with him to the cyber cafe and we checked out several sites. When I met him next  he was going to put a windmill at the local school. I felt proud because something that wasn't there before was suddenly there. I realized that not everybody can be able to access what I was able to access. I thought that I need to have an Internet that my grandmother can use. So I thought about a notice board. A simple wooden notice board. When I get information on my phone  I'm able to post the information on the notice board. So it's basically like a computer. I use the Internet to help people. I think I am searching for a better life for me and my neighbors. So many people have access to information  but there's no follow up to that. I think the follow up to that is our knowledge. When people have the knowledge  they can find solutions without having to helped out. Information is powerful  but it is how we use it that will define us. LP  Now  the amazing thing about that video  actually  was we just read about it in the news  and we found this gentlemen  and made that little clip. CR  When I talk to people about you  they say to me  people who know you well  say  Larry wants to change the world  and he believes technology can show the way. And that means access to the Internet. It has to do with languages. It also means how people can get access and do things that will affect their community  and this is an example. LP  Yeah  that's right  and I think for me  I have been focusing on access more  if we're talking about the future. We recently released this Loon Project which is using balloons to do it. It sounds totally crazy. We can show the video here. Actually  two out of three people in the world don't have good Internet access now. We actually think this can really help people sort of cost efficiently. CR  It's a balloon. LP  Yeah  get access to the Internet. CR  And why does this balloon give you access to the Internet  Because there was some interesting things you had to do to figure out how to make balloons possible  they didn't have to be tethered. LP  Yeah  and this is a good example of innovation. Like  we've been thinking about this idea for five years or more before we started working on it  but it was just really  how do we get access points up high  cheaply  You normally have to use satellites and it takes a long time to launch them. But you saw there how easy it is to launch a balloon and get it up  and actually again  it's the power of the Internet  I did a search on it  and I found         years ago  someone had put up a balloon and it had gone around the Earth multiple times. And I thought  why can't we do that today  And that's how this project got going. CR  But are you at the mercy of the wind  LP  Yeah  but it turns out  we did some weather simulations which probably hadn't really been done before  and if you control the altitude of the balloons  which you can do by pumping air into them and other ways  you can actually control roughly where they go  and so I think we can build a worldwide mesh of these balloons that can cover the whole planet. CR  Before I talk about the future and transportation  where you've been a nerd for a while  and this fascination you have with transportation and automated cars and bicycles  let me talk a bit about what's been the subject here earlier with Edward Snowden. It is security and privacy. You have to have been thinking about that. LP  Yeah  absolutely. I saw the picture of Sergey with Edward Snowden yesterday. Some of you may have seen it. But I think  for me  I guess  privacy and security are a really important thing. We think about it in terms of both things  and I think you can't have privacy without security  so let me just talk about security first  because you asked about Snowden and all of that  and then I'll say a little bit about privacy. I think for me  it's tremendously disappointing that the government secretly did all this stuff and didn't tell us. I don't think we can have a democracy if we're having to protect you and our users from the government for stuff that we've never had a conversation about. And I don't mean we have to know what the particular terrorist attack is they're worried about protecting us from  but we do need to know what the parameters of it is  what kind of surveillance the government's going to do and how and why  and I think we haven't had that conversation. So I think the government's actually done itself a tremendous disservice by doing all that in secret. CR  Never coming to Google to ask for anything. LP  Not Google  but the public. I think we need to  have a debate about that  or we can't have a functioning democracy. It's just not possible. So I'm sad that Google's in the position of protecting you and our users from the government doing secret thing that nobody knows about. It doesn't make any sense. CR  Yeah. And then there's a privacy side of it. LP  Yes. The privacy side  I think it's    the world is changing. You carry a phone. It knows where you are. There's so much more information about you  and that's an important thing  and it makes sense why people are asking difficult questions. We spend a lot of time thinking about this and what the issues are. I'm a little bit    I think the main thing that we need to do is just provide people choice  show them what data's being collected    search history  location data. We're excited about incognito mode in Chrome  and doing that in more ways  just giving people more choice and more awareness of what's going on. I also think it's very easy. What I'm worried is that we throw out the baby with the bathwater. And I look at  on your show  actually  I kind of lost my voice  and I haven't gotten it back. I'm hoping that by talking to you I'm going to get it back. CR  If I could do anything  I would do that. LP  All right. So get out your voodoo doll and whatever you need to do. But I think  you know what  I look at that  I made that public  and I got all this information. We got a survey done on medical conditions with people who have similar issues  and I look at medical records  and I say  wouldn't it be amazing if everyone's medical records were available anonymously to research doctors  And when someone accesses your medical record  a research doctor  they could see  you could see which doctor accessed it and why  and you could maybe learn about what conditions you have. I think if we just did that  we'd save         lives this year. CR  Absolutely. Let me go    Applause  LP  So I guess I'm just very worried that with Internet privacy  we're doing the same thing we're  doing with medical records  is we're throwing out the baby with the bathwater  and we're not really thinking about the tremendous good that can come from people sharing information with the right people in the right ways. CR  And the necessary condition that people have to have confidence that their information will not be abused. LP  Yeah  and I had this problem with my voice stuff. I was scared to share it. Sergey encouraged me to do that  and it was a great thing to do. CR  And the response has been overwhelming. LP  Yeah  and people are super positive. We got thousands and thousands of people with similar conditions  which there's no data on today. So it was a really good thing. CR  So talking about the future  what is it about you and transportation systems  LP  Yeah. I guess I was just frustrated with this when I was at college in Michigan. I had to get on the bus and take it and wait for it. And it was cold and snowing. I did some research on how much it cost  and I just became a bit obsessed with transportation systems. CR  And that began the idea of an automated car. LP  Yeah  about    years ago I learned about people working on automated cars  and I became fascinated by that  and it takes a while to  get these projects going  but I'm super excited about the possibilities of that improving the world. There's    million people or more injured per year. It's the leading cause of death for people under    in the U.S. CR  So you're talking about saving lives. LP  Yeah  and also saving space and making life better. Los Angeles is half parking lots and roads  half of the area  and most cities are not far behind  actually. It's just crazy that that's what we use our space for. CR  And how soon will we be there  LP  I think we can be there very  very soon. We've driven well over         miles now totally automated. I'm super excited about getting that out quickly. CR  But it's not only you're talking about automated cars. You also have this idea for bicycles. LP  Well at Google  we got this idea that we should just provide free bikes to everyone  and that's been amazing  most of the trips. You see bikes going everywhere  and the bikes wear out. They're getting used    hours a day. CR  But you want to put them above the street  too. LP  Well I said  how do we get people using bikes more  CR  We may have a video here. LP  Yeah  let's show the video. I just got excited about this. So this is actually how you might separate bikes from cars with minimal cost. Anyway  it looks totally crazy  but I was actually thinking about our campus  working with the Zippies and stuff  and just trying to get a lot more bike usage  and I was thinking about  how do you cost effectively separate the bikes from traffic  And I went and searched  and this is what I found. And we're not actually working on this  that particular thing  but it gets your imagination going. CR  Let me close with this. Give me a sense of the philosophy  of your own mind. You have this idea of  Google X . You don't simply want to go in some small  measurable arena of progress. LP  Yeah  I think many of the things we just  talked about are like that  where they're really    I almost use the economic concept of additionality  which means that you're doing something that wouldn't happen unless  you were actually doing it. And I think the more you can do things like that  the bigger impact you have  and that's about doing things that people might not think are possible. And I've been amazed  the more I learn about technology  the more I realize I don't know  and that's because this technological horizon  the thing that you can see to do next  the more you learn about technology  the more you learn what's possible. You learn that the balloons are possible because there's some material that will work for them. CR  What's interesting about  you too  though  for me  is that  we have lots of people who are thinking about the future  and they are going and looking and they're coming back  but we never see the implementation. I think of somebody you knew and read about  Tesla. The principle of that for you is what  LP  Well  I think invention is not enough. If you invent something  Tesla invented electric power that we use  but he struggled to get it out to people. That had to be done by other people. It took a long time. And I think if we can actually combine both things  where we have an innovation and invention focus  plus the ability to really    a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people in a way that's positive for the world and to give people hope. You know  I'm amazed with the Loon Project just how excited people were about that  because it gave them hope for the two thirds of the world that doesn't have Internet right now that's any good. CR  Which is a second thing about corporations. You are one of those people who believe that corporations are an agent of change if they are run well. LP  Yeah. I'm really dismayed most people think companies are basically evil. They get a bad rap. And I think that's somewhat correct. Companies are doing the same incremental thing that they did    years ago or    years ago. That's not really what we need. We need  especially in technology  we need revolutionary change  not incremental change. CR  You once said  actually  as I think I've got this about right  that you might consider  rather than giving your money  if you were leaving it to some cause  just simply giving it to Elon Musk  because you had confidence that he would change the future  and that you would therefore   LP  Yeah  if you want to go Mars  he wants to go to Mars  to back up humanity  that's a worthy goal  but it's a company  and it's philanthropical. So I think we aim to do kind of similar things. And I think  you ask  we have a lot of employees at Google who have become pretty wealthy. People make a lot of money in technology. A lot of people in the room are pretty wealthy. You're working because you want to change the world. You want to make it better. Why isn't the company that you work for worthy not just of your time but your money as well  I mean  but we don't have a concept of that. That's not how we think about companies  and I think it's sad  because companies are most of our effort. They're where most of people's time is  where a lot of the money is  and so I think I'd like for us to help out more than we are. CR  When I close conversations with lots of people  I always ask this question  What state of mind  what quality of mind is it that has served you best  People like Rupert Murdoch have said curiosity  and other people in the media have said that. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have said focus. What quality of mind  as I leave this audience  has enabled you to think about the future and at the same time change the present  LP  You know  I think the most important thing    I looked at lots of companies and why I thought they don't succeed over time. We've had a more rapid turnover of companies. And I said  what did they fundamentally do wrong  What did those companies all do wrong  And usually it's just that they missed the future. And so I think  for me  I just try to focus on that and say  what is that future really going to be and how do we create it  and how do we cause our organization  to really focus on that and drive that at a really high rate  And so that's been curiosity  it's been looking at things people might not think about  working on things that no one else is working on  because that's where the additionality really is  and be willing to do that  to take that risk. Look at Android. I felt guilty about working on Android when it was starting. It was a little startup we bought. It wasn't really what we were really working on. And I felt guilty about spending time on that. That was stupid. That was the future  right  That was a good thing to be working on. CR  It is great to see you here. It's great to hear from you  and a pleasure to sit at this table with you. Thanks  Larry. LP  Thank you. CR  Larry Page.,CEO of Google,201403,6.189733201581029
293,53,55,"Lauren Hodge, Shree Bose + Naomi Shah 2012","Lauren Hodge, Shree Bose + Naomi Shah",female,Award-winning teenage science in action,Jan 2012,963,Lauren Hodge  If you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option  which would you choose  grilled or fried chicken  Now most people would answer grilled  and it's true that grilled chicken does contain less fat and fewer calories. However  grilled chicken poses a hidden danger. The hidden danger is heterocyclic amines    specifically phenomethylimidazopyridine  or PhIP    which is the immunogenic or carcinogenic compound. A carcinogen is any substance or agent that causes abnormal growth of cells  which can also cause them to metastasize or spread. They are also organic compounds in which one or more of the hydrogens in ammonia is replaced with a more complex group. Studies show that antioxidants are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines. However  no studies exist yet that show how or why. These here are five different organizations that classify carcinogens. And as you can see  none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe  which justifies the need to decrease them in our diet. Now you might wonder how a    year old girl could come up with this idea. And I was led to it through a series of events. I first learned about it through a lawsuit I read about in my doctor's office    which was between the Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine and seven different fast food restaurants. They weren't sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken  but they were sued because of California's Proposition     which stated that if there's anything dangerous in the products then the companies had to give a clear warning. So I was very surprised about this. And I was wondering why nobody knew more about this dangerous grilled chicken  which doesn't seem very harmful. But then one night  my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner  and I noticed that the edges of the chicken  which had been marinated in lemon juice  turned white. And later in biology class  I learned that it's due to a process called denaturing  which is where the proteins will change shape and lose their ability to chemically function. So I combined these two ideas and I formulated a hypothesis  saying that  could possibly the carcinogens be decreased due to a marinade and could it be due to the differences in PH  So my idea was born  and I had the project set up and a hypothesis  so what was my next step  Well obviously I had to find a lab to work at because I didn't have the equipment in my school. I thought this would be easy  but I emailed about     different people within a five hour radius of where I lived  and I got one positive response that said that they could work with me. Most of the others either never responded back  said they didn't have the time or didn't have the equipment and couldn't help me. So it was a big commitment to drive to the lab to work multiple times. However  it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab    so I could finally start my project. The first stage was completed at home  which consisted of marinating the chicken  grilling the chicken  amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab. The second stage was completed at the Penn State University main campus lab  which is where I extracted the chemicals  changed the PH so I could run it through the equipment and separated the compounds I needed from the rest of the chicken. The final stages  when I ran the samples through a high pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometer  which separated the compounds and analyzed the chemicals and told me exactly how much carcinogens I had in my chicken. So when I went through the data  I had very surprising results  because I found that four out of the five marinating ingredients actually inhibited the carcinogen formation. When compared with the unmarinated chicken  which is what I used as my control  I found that lemon juice worked by far the best  which decreased the carcinogens by about    percent. The saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade also worked very well  decreasing the carcinogens by about    percent. Olive oil slightly decreased the PhIP formation  but it was nearly negligible. And the soy sauce results were inconclusive because of the large data range  but it seems like soy sauce actually increased the potential carcinogens. Another important factor that I didn't take into account initially was the time cooked. And I found that if you increase the time cooked  the amount of carcinogens rapidly increases. So the best way to marinate chicken  based on this  is to  not under cook  but definitely don't over cook and char the chicken  and marinate in either lemon juice  brown sugar or saltwater. Based on these findings  I have a question for you. Would you be willing to make a simple change in your diet that could potentially save your life  Now I'm not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that's not marinated  you're definitely going to catch cancer and die. However  anything you can do to decrease the risk of potential carcinogens can definitely increase the quality of lifestyle. Is it worth it to you  How will you cook your chicken now  Shree Bose  Hi everyone. I'm Shree Bose. I was the       year old age category winner and then the grand prize winner. And I want all of you to imagine a little girl holding a dead blue spinach plant. And she's standing in front of you and she's explaining to you that little kids will eat their vegetables if they're different colors. Sounds ridiculous  right. But that was me years ago. And that was my first science fair project. It got a bit more complicated from there. My older brother Panaki Bose spent hours of his time explaining atoms to me when I barely understood basic algebra. My parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects  including a remote controlled garbage can. And then came the summer after my freshman year  when my grandfather passed away due to cancer. And I remember watching my family go through that and thinking that I never wanted another family to feel that kind of loss. So  armed with all the wisdom of freshman year biology  I decided I wanted to do cancer research at   . Good plan. So I started emailing all of these professors in my area asking to work under their supervision in a lab. Got rejected by all except one. And then went on  my next summer  to work under Dr. Basu at the UNT Health Center at Fort Worth  Texas. And that is where the research began. So ovarian cancer is one of those cancers that most people don't know about  or at least don't pay that much attention to. But yet  it's the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. In fact  one in    women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer. One in     will die from it. Chemotherapy  one of the most effective ways used to treat cancer today  involves giving patients really high doses of chemicals to try and kill off cancer cells. Cisplatin is a relatively common ovarian cancer chemotherapy drug    a relatively simple molecule made in the lab that messes with the DNA of cancer cells and causes them to kill themselves. Sounds great  right  But here's the problem  sometimes patients become resistant to the drug  and then years after they've been declared to be cancer free  they come back. And this time  they no longer respond to the drug. It's a huge problem. In fact  it's one of the biggest problems with chemotherapy today. So we wanted to figure out how these ovarian cancer cells are becoming resistant to this drug called Cisplatin. And we wanted to figure this out  because if we could figure that out  then we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening. So that's what we set out to do. And we thought it had something to do with this protein called AMP kinase  an energy protein. So we ran all of these tests blocking the protein  and we saw this huge shift. I mean  on the slide  you can see that on our sensitive side  these cells that are responding to the drug  when we start blocking the protein  the number of dying cells    those colored dots    they're going down. But then on this side  with the same treatment  they're going up    interesting. But those are dots on a screen for you  what exactly does that mean  Well basically that means that this protein is changing from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell. And in fact  it might be changing the cells themselves to make the cells resistant. And that's huge. In fact  it means that if a patient comes in and they're resistant to this drug  then if we give them a chemical to block this protein  then we can treat them again with the same drug. And that's huge for chemotherapy effectiveness    possibly for many different types of cancer. So that was my work  and it was my way of reimagining the future for future research  with figuring out exactly what this protein does  but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness    so maybe all grandfathers with cancer have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren. But my work wasn't just about the research. It was about finding my passion. That's why being the grand prize winner of the Google Global Science Fair    cute picture  right    it was so exciting to me and it was such an amazing honor. And ever since then  I've gotten to do some pretty cool stuff    from getting to meet the president to getting to be on this stage to talk to all of you guys. But like I said  my journey wasn't just about the research  it was about finding my passion  and it was about making my own opportunities when I didn't even know what I was doing. It was about inspiration and determination and never giving up on my interest for science and learning and growing. After all  my story begins with a dried  withered spinach plant and it's only getting better from there. Thank you. Naomi Shah  Hi everyone. I'm Naomi Shah  and today I'll be talking to you about my research involving indoor air quality and asthmatic patients.  .  million deaths worldwide. One death every    seconds. People spend over    percent of their lives indoors. And the economic burden of asthma exceeds that of HIV and tuberculosis combined. Now these statistics had a huge impact on me  but what really sparked my interest in my research was watching both my dad and my brother suffer from chronic allergies year round. It confused me  why did these allergy symptoms persist well past the pollen season  With this question in mind  I started researching  and I soon found that indoor air pollutants were the culprit. As soon as I realized this  I investigated the underlying relationship between four prevalent air pollutants and their affect on the lung health of asthmatic patients. At first  I just wanted to figure out which of these four pollutants have the largest negative health impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients. But soon after  I developed a novel mathematical model that essentially quantifies the effect of these environmental pollutants on the lung health of asthmatic patients. And it surprises me that no model currently exists that quantifies the effect of environmental factors on human lung health  because that relationship seems so important. So with that in mind  I started researching more  I started investigating more  and I became very passionate. Because I realized that if we could find a way to target remediation  we could also find a way to treat asthmatic patients more effectively. For example  volatile organic compounds are chemical pollutants that are found in our schools  homes and workplaces. They're everywhere. These chemical pollutants are currently not a criteria air pollutant  as defined by the U.S. Clean Air Act. Which is surprising to me  because these chemical pollutants  through my research  I show that they had a very large negative impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients and thus should be regulated. So today I want to show you my interactive software model that I created. I'm going to show it to you on my laptop. And I have a volunteer subject in the audience today  Julie. And all of Julie's data has been pre entered into my interactive software model. And this can be used by anyone. So I want you to imagine that you're in Julie's shoes  or someone who's really close to you who suffers from asthma or another lung disorder. So Julie's going to her doctor's office to get treated for her asthma. And the doctor has her sit down  and he takes her peak expiratory flow rate    which is essentially her exhalation rate  or the amount of air that she can breathe out in one breath. So that peak expiratory flow rate  I've entered it up into the interactive software model. I've also entered in her age  her gender and her height. I've assumed that she lives in an average household with average air pollutant levels. So any user can come in here and click on  lung function report  and it'll take them to this report that I created. And this report really drives home the crux of my research. So what it shows    if you want to focus on that top graph in the right hand corner    it shows Julie's actual peak expiratory flow rate in the yellow bar. This is the measurement that she took in her doctor's office. In the blue bar at the bottom of the graph  it shows what her peak expiratory flow rate  what her exhalation rate or lung health  should be based on her age  gender and height. So the doctor sees this difference between the yellow bar and the blue bar  and he says   Wow  we need to give her steroids  medication and inhalers.  But I want everyone here to reimagine a world where instead of prescribing steroids  inhalers and medication  the doctor turns to Julie and says   Why don't you go home and clean out your air filters. Clean out the air ducts in your home  in your workplace  in your school. Stop the use of incense and candles. And if you're remodeling your house  take out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring.  Because these solutions are natural  these solutions are sustainable  and these solutions are long term investments    long term investments that we're making for our generation and for future generations. Because these environmental solutions that Julie can make in her home  her workplace and her school are impacting everyone that lives around her. So I'm very passionate about this research and I really want to continue it and expand it to more disorders besides asthma  more respiratory disorders  as well as more pollutants. But before I end my talk today  I want to leave you with one saying. And that saying is that genetics loads the gun  but the environment pulls the trigger. And that made a huge impact on me when I was doing this research. Because what I feel  is a lot of us think that the environment is at a macro level  that we can't do anything to change our air quality or to change the climate or anything. But if each one of us takes initiative in our own home  in our own school and in our own workplace  we can make a huge difference in air quality. Because remember  we spend    percent of our lives indoors. And air quality and air pollutants have a huge impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients  anyone with a respiratory disorder and really all of us in general. So I want you to reimagine a world with better air quality  better quality of life and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations. Thank you. Lisa Ling  Right.

296,599,601,Lawrence Lessig 2007,Lawrence Lessig,male,Laws that choke creativity,Nov 2007,1062,I want to talk to you a little bit about user generated content. I'm going to tell you three stories on the way to one argument that's going to tell you a little bit about how we open user generated content up for business. So  here's the first story.     . This man  John Philip Sousa  traveled to this place  the United States Capitol  to talk about this technology  what he called the  quote   talking machines.  Sousa was not a fan of the talking machines. This is what he had to say.  These talking machines are going to ruin artistic development of music in this country. When I was a boy  in front of every house in the summer evenings  you would find young people together singing the songs of the day  or the old songs. Today  you hear these infernal machines going night and day. We will not have a vocal chord left   Sousa said.  The vocal chords will be eliminated by a process of evolution as was the tail of man when he came from the ape.  Now  this is the picture I want you to focus on. This is a picture of culture. We could describe it using modern computer terminology as a kind of read write culture. It's a culture where people participate in the creation and the re creation of their culture. In that sense  it's read write. Sousa's fear was that we would lose that capacity because of these  quote   infernal machines.  They would take it away. And in its place  we'd have the opposite of read write culture  what we could call read only culture. Culture where creativity was consumed but the consumer is not a creator. A culture which is top down  owned  where the vocal chords of the millions have been lost. Now  as you look back at the twentieth century  at least in what we think of as the  quote   developed world     hard not to conclude that Sousa was right. Never before in the history of human culture had it been as professionalized  never before as concentrated. Never before has creativity of the millions been as effectively displaced  and displaced because of these  quote   infernal machines.  The twentieth century was that century where  at least for those places we know the best  culture moved from this read write to read only existence. So  second. Land is a kind of property    it is property. It's protected by law. As Lord Blackstone described it  land is protected by trespass law  for most of the history of trespass law  by presuming it protects the land all the way down below and to an indefinite extent upward. Now  that was a pretty good system for most of the history of the regulation of land  until this technology came along  and people began to wonder  were these instruments trespassers as they flew over land without clearing the rights of the farms below as they traveled across the country  Well  in       Supreme Court got a chance to address that question. Two farmers  Thomas Lee and Tinie Causby  who raised chickens  had a significant complaint because of these technologies. The complaint was that their chickens followed the pattern of the airplanes and flew themselves into the walls of the barn when the airplanes flew over the land. And so they appealed to Lord Blackstone to say these airplanes were trespassing. Since time immemorial  the law had said  you can't fly over the land without permission of the landowner  so this flight must stop. Well  the Supreme Court considered this     years tradition and said  in an opinion written by Justice Douglas  that the Causbys must lose. The Supreme Court said the doctrine protecting land all the way to the sky has no place in the modern world  otherwise every transcontinental flight would subject the operator to countless trespass suits. Common sense  a rare idea in the law  but here it was. Common sense    Revolts at the idea. Common sense. Finally. Before the Internet  the last great terror to rain down on the content industry was a terror created by this technology. Broadcasting  a new way to spread content  and therefore a new battle over the control of the businesses that would spread content. Now  at that time  the entity  the legal cartel  that controlled the performance rights for most of the music that would be broadcast using these technologies was ASCAP. They had an exclusive license on the most popular content  and they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrate to the broadcasters who really was in charge. So  between      and       they raised rates by some     percent  until the broadcasters finally got together and said  okay  enough of this. And in       a lawyer  Sydney Kaye  started something called Broadcast Music Inc. We know it as BMI. And BMI was much more democratic in the art that it would include within its repertoire  including African American music for the first time in the repertoire. But most important was that BMI took public domain works and made arrangements of them  which they gave away for free to their subscribers. So that in       when ASCAP threatened to double their rates  the majority of broadcasters switched to BMI. Now  ASCAP said they didn't care. The people will revolt  they predicted  because the very best music was no longer available  because they had shifted to the second best public domain provided by BMI. Well  they didn't revolt  and in       ASCAP cracked. And the important point to recognize is that even though these broadcasters were broadcasting something you would call second best  that competition was enough to break  at that time  this legal cartel over access to music. Okay. Three stories. Here's the argument. In my view  the most significant thing to recognize about what this Internet is doing is its opportunity to revive the read write culture that Sousa romanticized. Digital technology is the opportunity for the revival of these vocal chords that he spoke so passionately to Congress about. User generated content  spreading in businesses in extraordinarily valuable ways like these  celebrating amateur culture. By which I don't mean amateurish culture  I mean culture where people produce for the love of what they're doing and not for the money. I mean the culture that your kids are producing all the time. For when you think of what Sousa romanticized in the young people together  singing the songs of the day  of the old songs  you should recognize what your kids are doing right now. Taking the songs of the day and the old songs and remixing them to make them something different. It's how they understand access to this culture. So  let's have some very few examples to get a sense of what I'm talking about here. Here's something called Anime Music Video  first example  taking anime captured from television re edited to music tracks. This one you should be    confidence. Jesus survives. Don't worry. And this is the best. My love ... There's only you in my life ... The only thing that's bright ... My first love ... You're every breath that I take ... You're every step I make ... And I .... I want to share all my love with you ... No one else will do ... And your eyes ... They tell me how much you care ... So  this is remix  right  And it's important to emphasize that what this is not is not what we call  quote   piracy.  I'm not talking about nor justifying people taking other people's content in wholesale and distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner. I'm talking about people taking and recreating using other people's content  using digital technologies to say things differently. Now  the importance of this is not the technique that you've seen here. Because  of course  every technique that you've seen here is something that television and film producers have been able to do for the last    years. The importance is that that technique has been democratized. It is now anybody with access to a        computer who can take sounds and images from the culture around us and use it to say things differently. These tools of creativity have become tools of speech. It is a literacy for this generation. This is how our kids speak. It is how our kids think. It is what your kids are as they increasingly understand digital technologies and their relationship to themselves. Now  in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies  the law has not greeted this Sousa revival with very much common sense. Instead  the architecture of copyright law and the architecture of digital technologies  as they interact  have produced the presumption that these activities are illegal. Because if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies  then in the digital world the one fact we can't escape is that every single use of culture produces a copy. Every single use therefore requires permission  without permission  you are a trespasser. You're a trespasser with about as much sense as these people were trespassers. Common sense here  though  has not yet revolted in response to this response that the law has offered to these forms of creativity. Instead  what we've seen is something much worse than a revolt. There's a growing extremism that comes from both sides in this debate  in response to this conflict between the law and the use of these technologies. One side builds new technologies  such as one recently announced that will enable them to automatically take down from sites like YouTube any content that has any copyrighted content in it  whether or not there's a judgment of fair use that might be applied to the use of that content. And on the other side  among our kids  there's a growing copyright abolitionism  a generation that rejects the very notion of what copyright is supposed to do  rejects copyright and believes that the law is nothing more than an ass to be ignored and to be fought at every opportunity possible. The extremism on one side begets extremism on the other  a fact we should have learned many  many times over  and both extremes in this debate are just wrong. Now  the balance that I try to fight for  I  as any good liberal  try to fight for first by looking to the government. Total mistake  right  Looked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them to do something to make the system make more sense. It failed partly because the courts are too passive  partly because the legislatures are corrupted  by which I don't mean that there's bribery operating to stop real change  but more the economy of influence that governs how Congress functions means that policymakers here will not understand this until it's too late to fix it. So  we need something different  we need a different kind of solution. And the solution here  in my view  is a private solution  a solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again  and to realize the economic potential of that  and that's where the story of BMI becomes relevant. Because  as BMI demonstrated  competition here can achieve some form of balance. The same thing can happen now. We don't have a public domain to draw upon now  so instead what we need is two types of changes. First  that artists and creators embrace the idea  choose that their work be made available more freely. So  for example  they can say their work is available freely for non commercial  this amateur type of use  but not freely for any commercial use. And second  we need the businesses that are building out this read write culture to embrace this opportunity expressly  to enable it  so that this ecology of free content  or freer content  can grow on a neutral platform where they both exist simultaneously  so that more free can compete with less free  and the opportunity to develop the creativity in that competition can teach one the lessons of the other. Now  I would talk about one particular such plan that I know something about  but I don't want to violate TED's first commandment of selling  so I'm not going to talk about this at all. I'm instead just going to remind you of the point that BMI teaches us. That artist choice is the key for new technology having an opportunity to be open for business  and we need to build artist choice here if these new technologies are to have that opportunity. But let me end with something I think much more important    much more important than business. It's the point about how this connects to our kids. We have to recognize they're different from us. This is us  right  We made mixed tapes  they remix music. We watched TV  they make TV. It is technology that has made them different  and as we see what this technology can do  we need to recognize you can't kill the instinct the technology produces. We can only criminalize it. We can't stop our kids from using it. We can only drive it underground. We can't make our kids passive again. We can only make them  quote   pirates.  And is that good  We live in this weird time. It's kind of age of prohibitions  where in many areas of our life  we live life constantly against the law. Ordinary people live life against the law  and that's what I    we are doing to our kids. They live life knowing they live it against the law. That realization is extraordinarily corrosive  extraordinarily corrupting. And in a democracy  we ought to be able to do better. Do better  at least for them  if not for opening for business. Thank you very much.,Legal activist,200711,6.0661716171617135
297,1711,1713,Lawrence Lessig 2010,Lawrence Lessig,male,Re-examining the remix,May 2010,1113,I want to talk about what we learn from conservatives. And I'm at a stage in life where I'm yearning for my old days  so I want to confess to you that when I was a kid  indeed  I was a conservative. I was a Young Republican  a Teenage Republican  a leader in the Teenage Republicans. Indeed  I was the youngest member of any delegation in the      convention that elected Ronald Reagan to be the Republican nominee for president. Now  I know what you're thinking. You're thinking   That's not what the Internets say.  You're thinking   Wikipedia doesn't say this fact.  And indeed  this is just one of the examples of the junk that flows across the tubes in these Internets here. Wikipedia reports that this guy  this former congressman from Erie  Pennsylvania was  at the age of     one of the youngest people at the Republican National Convention  but it's just not true. Indeed  it drives me so nuts  let me just change this little fact here. All right. Okay  so ... perfect. Perfect. Okay  speaker Lawrence Lessig  right. Okay. Finally  truth will be brought here. Okay  see  It's done. It's almost done. Here we go.  ... Youngest Republican   okay  we're finished. That's it. Please save this. Great  here we go. And ... Wikipedia is fixed  finally. Okay  but no  this is really besides the point. But the thing I want you to think about when we think about conservatives    not so much this issue of the      convention    the thing to think about is this  They go to church. Now  you know  I mean  a lot of people go to church. I'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church. And I'm not talking about the God thing. I don't want to get into that  you know  that's not my point. They go to church  by which I mean  they do lots of things for free for each other. They hold potluck dinners. Indeed  they sell books about potluck dinners. They serve food to poor people. They share  they give  they give away for free. And it's the very same people leading Wall Street firms who  on Sundays  show up and share. And not only food  right. These very same people are strong believers  in lots of contexts  in the limits on the markets. They are in many important places against markets. Indeed  they  like all of us  celebrate this kind of relationship. But they're very keen that we don't let money drop into that relationship  else it turns into something like this. They want to regulate us  those conservatives  to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places. Because they understand  There are places for the market and places where the market should not exist  where we should be free to enjoy the fellowship of others. They recognize  Both of these things have to live together. And the second great thing about conservatives  they get ecology. Right  it was the first great Republican president of the   th century who taught us about environmental thinking    Teddy Roosevelt. They first taught us about ecology in the context of natural resources. And then they began to teach us in the context of innovation  economics. They understand  in that context   free.  They understand  free  is an important essential part of the cultural ecology as well. That's the thing I want you to think about them. Now  I know you don't believe me  really  here. So here's exhibit number one. I want to share with you my latest hero  Julian Sanchez  a libertarian who works at the  for many people   evil  Cato Institute. Okay  so Julian made this video. He's a terrible producer of videos  but it's great content  so I'm going to give you a little bit of it. So here he is beginning. Julian Sanchez  I'm going to make an observation about the way remix culture seems to be evolving ... Larry Lessig  So what he does is he begins to tell us about these three videos. This is this fantastic Brat Pack remix set to Lisztomania. Which  of course  spread virally. Hugely successful. And then some people from Brooklyn saw it. They decided they wanted to do the same. And then  of course  people from San Fransisco saw it. And San Franciscans thought they had to do the same as well. And so they're beautiful  but this libertarian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this. Here's lesson number one. JS  There's obviously also something really deeply great about this. They are acting in the sense that they're emulating the original mashup. And the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye and some experience with video editing. But this is also basically just a group of friends having an authentic social moment and screwing around together. It should feel familiar and kind of resonate for anyone who's had a sing a long or a dance party with a group of good friends. LL  Or ... JS  So that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at because here  remix isn't just about an individual doing something alone in his basement  it becomes an act of social creativity. And it's not just that it yields a different kind of product at the end  it's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other. All of our normal social interactions become a kind of invitation to this sort of collective expression. It's our real social lives themselves that are transmuted into art. LL  And so then  what this libertarian draws from these two points ... JS  One remix is about individuals using our shared culture as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience. Stage two  social remix  is really about using it to mediate people's relationships to each other. First  within each video  the Brat Pack characters are used as a kind of template for performing the social reality of each group. But there's also a dialogue between the videos  where  once the basic structure is established  it becomes a kind of platform for articulating the similarities and differences between the groups' social and physical worlds. LL  And then  here's for me  the critical key to what Julian has to say ... JS  Copyright policy isn't just about how to incentivize the production of a certain kind of artistic commodity  it's about what level of control we're going to permit to be exercised over our social realities    social realities that are now inevitably permeated by pop culture. I think it's important that we keep these two different kinds of public goods in mind. If we're only focused on how to maximize the supply of one  I think we risk suppressing this different and richer and  in some ways  maybe even more important one. LL  Right. Bingo. Point. Freedom needs this opportunity to both have the commercial success of the great commercial works and the opportunity to build this different kind of culture. And for that to happen  you need ideas like fair use to be central and protected  to enable this kind of innovation  as this libertarian tells us  between these two creative cultures  a commercial and a sharing culture. The point is they  he  here  gets that culture. Now  my concern is  we Dems  too often  not so much. All right  take for example this great company. In the good old days when this Republican ran that company  their greatest work was work that built on the past  right. All of the great Disney works were works that took works that were in the public domain and remixed them  or waited until they entered the public domain to remix them  to celebrate this add on remix creativity. Indeed  Mickey Mouse himself  of course  as  Steamboat Willie   is a remix of the then  very dominant  very popular  Steamboat Bill  by Buster Keaton. This man was a remixer extraordinaire. He is the celebration and ideal of exactly this kind of creativity. But then the company passes through this dark stage to this Democrat. Wildly different. This is the mastermind behind the eventual passage of what we call the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act  extending the term of existing copyrights by    years  so that no one could do to Disney what Disney did to the Brothers Grimm. Now  when we tried to challenge this  going to the Supreme Court  getting the Supreme Court  the bunch of conservatives there    if we could get them to wake up to this    to strike it down  we had the assistance of Nobel Prize winners including this right wing Nobel Prize winner  Milton Friedman  who said he would join our brief only if the word  no brainer  was in the brief somewhere. But apparently  no brains existed in this place when Democrats passed and signed this bill into law. Now  tiny little quibble of a footnote  Sonny Bono  you might say  was a Republican  but I don't buy it. This guy is no Republican. Okay  for a second example  think about this cultural hero  icon on the Left  creator of this character. Look at the site that he built   Star Wars  MashUps  inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon. Read the license. The license for these remixers assigns all of the rights to the remix back to Lucas. The mashup is owned by Lucas. Indeed  anything you add to the mashup  music you might add  Lucas has a worldwide perpetual right to exploit that for free. There is no creator here to be recognized. The creator doesn't have any rights. The creator is a sharecropper in this story. And we should remember who employed the sharecroppers  the Democrats  right  So the point is the Republicans here recognize that there's a certain need of ownership  a respect for ownership  the respect we should give the creator  the remixer  the owner  the property owner  the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff  and not a generation of sharecroppers. Now  I think there are lessons we should learn here  lessons about openness. Our lives are sharing activities  at least in part. Even for the head of Goldman Sachs  at least in part. And for that sharing activity to happen  we have to have well protected spaces of fair use. That's number one. Number two  This ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create. Freedom  which means without permission from anyone  the ability to create. And number three  We need to respect the creator  the creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them. Now  this explains the right wing nonprofit Creative Commons. Actually  it's not a right wing nonprofit  but of course    let me just tie it here    the Creative Commons  which is offering authors this simple way to mark their content with the freedoms they intended to carry. So that we go from a  all rights reserved  world to a  some rights reserved  world so that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content  building and creating on the basis of this creative copyrighted work. These tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a copyright the creator has licensed freely. And it explains the vast right wing conspiracy that's obviously developed around these licenses  as now more than     million digital objects are out there  licensed freely in this way. Now that picture of an ecology of creativity  the picture of an ecology of balanced creativity  is that the ecology of creativity we have right now  Well  as you all know  not many of us believe we do. I tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity just last week. I created a video which was based on a Wireside Chat that I'd given  and I uploaded it to YouTube. I then got this email from YouTube weirdly notifying me that there was content in that owned by the mysterious WMG that matched their content ID. So I didn't think much about it. And then on Twitter  somebody said to me   Your talk on YouTube was DMCA'd. Was that your purpose   imagining that I had this deep conspiracy to reveal the obvious flaws in the DMCA. I answered   No.  I didn't even think about it. But then I went to the site and all of the audio in my site had been silenced. My whole    minute video had been silenced because there were snippets in that video  a video about fair use  that included Warner Music Group music. Now  interestingly  they still sold ads for that music  if you played the silent video. You could still buy the music  but you couldn't hear anything because it had been silenced. So I did what the current regime says I must do to be free to use YouTube to talk about fair use. I went to this site  and I had to answer these questions. And then in an extraordinarily Bart Simpson like  juvenile way you've actually got to type out these words and get them right to reassert your freedom to speak. And I felt like I was in third grade again.  I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair. I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair.  This is absurd. It is outrageous. It is an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom we should be encouraging. And the question I ask you is  Who's fighting it  Well  interestingly  in the last presidential election  who was the number one  active opponent of this system of regulation in online speech  John McCain. Letter after letter attacking YouTube's refusal to be more respectful of fair use with their extraordinary notice and take down system  that led his campaign so many times to be thrown off the Internet. Now  that was the story of me then  my good old days of right wing lunacy. Let me come back to now  now when I'm a little leftist    I'm certainly left handed  so at least a lefty    And I wonder  can we on the Left expect to build this ecology of freedom  now  in a world where we know the extraordinarily powerful influences against it  where even icons of the Left like this entertain and push bills that would effectively ban the requirement of open access for government funded research  The president  who has supported a process that secretly negotiates agreements  which effectively lock us into the insane system of DMCA that we have adopted and likely lock us down a path of three strikes  you're out that  of course  the rest of the world are increasingly adopting. Not a single example of reform has been produced yet. And we're not going to see this change in this system anytime soon. So here's the lessons of openness that I think we need to learn. Openness is a commitment to a certain set of values. We need to speak of those values. The value of freedom. It's a value of community. It's a value of the limits in regulation. It's a value respecting the creator. Now  if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the Right  if we can take them and incorporate them  maybe we could do a little trade. We learn those values on the Left  and maybe they'll do health care or global warming legislation or something in the Right. Anyway  please join me in teaching these values. Thank you very much.,Legal activist,201005,6.23357927786499
299,1532,1534,Lewis Pugh 2009,Lewis Pugh,male,How I swam the North Pole,Sep 2009,1073,Today I want to talk to you about swimming across the North Pole  across the most northern place in the whole world. And perhaps the best place to start is with my late father. He was a great storyteller. He could tell a story about an event  and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment. And one of the stories he told me so often when I was a young boy was of the first British atomic bomb test. He had been there and watched it go off. And he said that the explosion was so loud and the light was so intense  that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes. And he said that he could actually see an x ray of his fingers  because the light was so bright. And I know that watching that atomic bomb going off had a very  very big impact on my late father. Every holiday I had as a young boy was in a national park. What he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world  and show me just how fragile the world is. He also told me about the great explorers. He loved history. He would tell me about Captain Scott walking all the way to the South Pole and Sir Edmund Hillary climbing up Mount Everest. And so ever since I think I was just six years old  I dreamed of going to the polar regions. I really  really wanted to go to the Arctic. There was something about that place which drew me to it. And  well  sometimes it takes a long time for a dream to come true. But seven years ago  I went to the Arctic for the first time. And it was so beautiful that I've been back there ever since  for the last seven years. I love the place. But I have seen that place change beyond all description  just in that short period of time. I have seen polar bears walking across very  very thin ice in search of food. I have swum in front of glaciers which have retreated so much. And I have also  every year  seen less and less sea ice. And I wanted the world to know what was happening up there. In the two years before my swim     percent of the arctic sea ice cover just melted away. And I wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders to get them to understand what is happening. So I decided to do this symbolic swim at the top of the world  in a place which should be frozen over  but which now is rapidly unfreezing. And the message was very clear  Climate change is for real  and we need to do something about it. And we need to do something about it right now. Well  swimming across the North Pole  it's not an ordinary thing to do. I mean  just to put it in perspective     degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool. This morning  the temperature of the English Channel was    degrees. The passengers who fell off the Titanic fell into water of just five degrees centigrade. Fresh water freezes at zero. And the water at the North Pole is minus  . . It's fucking freezing. I'm sorry  but there is no other way to describe it. And so I had to assemble an incredible team around me to help me with this task. I assembled this team of    people from    nations. Some people think that swimming is a very solo sport  you just dive into the sea and off you go. It couldn't be further from the truth for me. And I then went and did a huge amount of training  swimming in icy water  backwards and forwards. But the most important thing was to train my mind to prepare myself for what was going to happen. And I had to visualize the swim. I had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end. I had to taste the salt water in my mouth. I had to see my coach screaming for me   Come on Lewis  Come on  Go  Go  Go  Don't slow down   And so I literally swam across the North Pole hundreds and hundreds of times in my mind. And then  after a year of training  I felt ready. I felt confident that I could actually do this swim. So myself and the five members of the team  we hitched a ride on an icebreaker which was going to the North Pole. And on day four  we decided to just do a quick five minute test swim. I had never swum in water of minus  .  degrees before  because it's just impossible to train in those types of conditions. So we stopped the ship  as you do. We all got down onto the ice  and I then got into my swimming costume and I dived into the sea. I have never in my life felt anything like that moment. I could barely breathe. I was gasping for air. I was hyperventilating so much  and within seconds my hands were numb. And it was    the paradox is that you're in freezing cold water  but actually you're on fire. I swam as hard as I could for five minutes. I remember just trying to get out of the water. I climbed out of the ice. And I remember taking the goggles off my face and looking down at my hands in sheer shock  because my fingers had swollen so much that they were like sausages. And they were swollen so much  I couldn't even close them. What had happened is that we are made partially of water  and when water freezes it expands. And so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded. And they had burst. And I was in so much agony. I immediately got rushed onto the ship and into a hot shower. And I remember standing underneath the hot shower and trying to defrost my fingers. And I thought  in two days' time  I was going to do this swim across the North Pole. I was going to try and do a    minute swim  for one kilometer across the North Pole. And this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy with my father  was just going out the window. There is no possibility that this was going to happen. And I remember then getting out of the shower and realizing I couldn't even feel my hands. And for a swimmer  you need to feel your hands because you need to be able to grab the water and pull it through with you. The next morning  I woke up and I was in such a state of depression  and all I could think about was Sir Ranulph Fiennes. For those of you who don't know him  he's the great British explorer. A number of years ago  he tried to ski all the way to the North Pole. He accidentally fell through the ice into the sea. And after just three minutes in that water  he was able to get himself out. And his hands were so badly frostbitten that he had to return to England. He went to a local hospital and there they said   Ran  there is no possibility of us being able to save these fingers. We are going to actually have to take them off.  And Ran decided to go into his tool shed and take out a saw and do it himself. And all I could think of was  if that happened to Ran after three minutes  and I can't feel my hands after five minutes  what on earth is going to happen if I try    minutes  At the very best  I'm going to end up losing some fingers. And at worst  I didn't even want to think about it. We carried on sailing through the ice packs towards the North Pole. And my close friend David  he saw the way I was thinking  and he came up to me and he said   Lewis  I've known you since you were    years old. I've known you  and I know  Lewis  deep down  right deep down here  that you are going to make this swim. I so believe in you Lewis. I've seen the way you've been training. And I realize the reason why you're going to do this. This is such an important swim. We stand at a very  very important moment in this history  and you're going to make a symbolic swim here to try to shake the lapels of world leaders. Lewis  have the courage to go in there  because we are going to look after you every moment of it.  And I just  I got so much confidence from him saying that  because he knew me so well. So we carried on sailing and we arrived at the North Pole. And we stopped the ship  and it was just as the scientists had predicted. There were open patches of sea everywhere. And I went down into my cabin and I put on my swimming costume. And then the doctor strapped on a chest monitor  which measures my core body temperature and my heart rate. And then we walked out onto the ice. And I remember looking into the ice  and there were big chunks of white ice in there  and the water was completely black. I had never seen black water before. And it is       meters deep. And I said to myself   Lewis  don't look left  don't look right. Just scuttle forward and go for it.  And so I now want to show you a short video of what happened there on the ice. Narrator  Video   We're just sailing out of harbor now  and it's at this stage when one can have a bit of a wobble mentally. Everything just looks so gray around here  and looks so cold. We've just seen our first polar bears. It was absolutely magical. A mother and a cub  such a beautiful sight. And to think that in        years they could become extinct. It's a very frightening  very  very frightening thought. We're finally at the North Pole. This is months and months and months of dreaming to get here  years of training and planning and preparation. Ooh. In a couple of hours' time I'm going to get in here and do my swim. It's all a little bit frightening  and emotional. Amundson  you ready  Amudson  Ready. Lewis Pugh  Ten seconds to swim. Ten seconds to swim. Take the goggles off. Take the goggles off  Man  Take the shoes. Take the shoes. Well done lad  You did it  You did it Lewis  You did it  You did it man  LP  How on earth did we do that  Man  Against the current  You did it against the current  LP  Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Audience  Encore  LP  I'd just like to end off by just saying this  It took me four months again to feel my hands. But was it worth it  Yes  absolutely it was. There are very  very few people who don't know now about what is happening in the Arctic. And people ask me   Lewis  what can we do about climate change   And I say to them  I think we need to do three things. The first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down into manageable chunks. You saw during that video all those flags. Those flags represented the countries from which my team came from. And equally  when it comes to climate change  every single country is going to have to make cuts. Britain  America  Japan  South Africa  the Congo. All of us together  we're all on the same ship together. The second thing we need to do is we need to just look back at how far we have come in such a short period of time. I remember  just a few years ago  speaking about climate change  and people heckling me in the back and saying it doesn't even exist. I've just come back from giving a series of speeches in some of the poorest townships in South Africa to young children as young as    years old. Four or five children sitting behind a desk  and even in those poorest conditions  they all have a very  very good grasp of climate change. We need to believe in ourselves. Now is the time to believe. We've come a long way. We're doing good. But the most important thing we must do is  I think  we must all walk to the end of our lives and turn around  and ask ourselves a most fundamental question. And that is   What type of world do we want to live in  and what decision are we going to make today to ensure that we all live in a sustainable world   Ladies and gentlemen  thank you very  very much.,Coldwater swimmer,200909,6.065873983739832
300,1758,1760,Lewis Pugh 2010,Lewis Pugh,male,My mind-shifting Everest swim,Jul 2010,570,Last year when I was here  I was speaking to you about a swim which I did across the North Pole. And while that swim took place three years ago  I can remember it as if it was yesterday. I remember standing on the edge of the ice  about to dive into the water  and thinking to myself  I have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening. The water is completely black. The water is minus  .  degrees centigrade  or    degrees Fahrenheit. It's flipping freezing in that water. And then a thought came across my mind  if things go pear shaped on this swim  how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean  And then I said to myself  I've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible. And the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up  listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Puff Daddy  and then committing myself a hundred percent    there is nothing more powerful than the made up mind    and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water. And that swim took me    minutes and    seconds  and it felt like    days. And I remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers  and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because    you know  we're made partially of water    when water freezes it expands  and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst. And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water was the following  I'm never  ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again. Anyway  last year  I heard about the Himalayas and the melting of the     Laughter  and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change. I heard about this lake  Lake Imja. This lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the melting of the glacier. The glacier's gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake. And I firmly believe that what we're seeing in the Himalayas is the next great  big battleground on this earth. Nearly two billion people    so one in three people on this earth    rely on the water from the Himalayas. And with a population increasing as quickly as it is  and with the water supply from these glaciers    because of climate change    decreasing so much  I think we have a real risk of instability. North  you've got China  south  you've India  Pakistan  Bangladesh  all these countries. And so I decided to walk up to Mt. Everest  the highest mountain on this earth  and go and do a symbolic swim underneath the summit of Mt. Everest. Now  I don't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt. Everest  but it's quite an ordeal getting up there.    great  big  powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain    I don't just have my Speedo  but there's a big film crew who then send all the images around the world. The other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude. I wanted to do the swim at       meters above sea level. So it's right up in the heavens. It's very  very difficult to breath. You get altitude sickness. I feels like you've got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time. That's not the worst part of it. The worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on Mt. Everest. Many  many people have died on Mt. Everest  and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain. And when you're walking up the mountain to attempt to do something which no human has ever done before  and  in fact  no fish    there are no fish up there swimming at       meters    When you're trying to do that  and then the bodies are coming past you  it humbles you  and you also realize very  very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are. And we walked up this pathway  all the way up. And to the right hand side of us was this great Khumbu Glacier. And all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice. And then we got up to this small lake underneath the summit of Mt. Everest  and I prepared myself the same way as I've always prepared myself  for this swim which was going to be so very difficult. I put on my iPod  I listened to some music  I got myself as aggressive as possible    but controlled aggression    and then I hurled myself into that water. I swam as quickly as I could for the first hundred meters  and then I realized very  very quickly  I had a huge problem on my hands. I could barely breathe. I was gasping for air. I then began to choke  and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water. And it all happened so quickly  I then    I don't know how it happened    but I went underwater. And luckily  the water was quite shallow  and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air. And then I said  carry on. Carry on. Carry on. I carried on for another five or six strokes  and then I had nothing in my body  and I went down to the bottom of the lake. And I don't where I got it from  but I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake. I've heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have. I have never  ever heard such utter bollocks. It is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have. I got myself to the side of the lake. My crew grabbed me  and then we walked as quickly as we could down    over the rubble    down to our camp. And there  we sat down  and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on Mt. Everest. And my team just gave it to me straight. They said  Lewis  you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim. Every single thing which you have learned in the past    years of swimming  you must forget. Every single thing which you learned when you were serving in the British army  about speed and aggression  you put that to one side. We want you to walk up the hill in another two days' time. Take some time to rest and think about things. We want you to walk up the mountain in two days' time  and instead of swimming fast  swim as slowly as possible. Instead of swimming crawl  swim breaststroke. And remember  never ever swim with aggression. This is the time to swim with real humility. And so we walked back up to the mountain two days later. And I stood there on the edge of the lake  and I looked up at Mt. Everest    and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth    and I said to myself  just do this slowly. And I swam across the lake. And I can't begin to tell you how good I felt when I came to the other side. But I learned two very  very important lessons there on Mt. Everest  and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this. The first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well  doesn't mean it's going to work in the future. And similarly  now  before I do anything  I ask myself what type of mindset do I require to successfully complete a task. And taking that into the world of climate change    which is  frankly  the Mt. Everest of all problems    just because we've lived the way we have lived for so long  just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long  doesn't mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on. The warning signs are all there. When I was born  the world's population was  .  billion people. We're now  .  billion people  and we're expected to be   billion people by     . And then the second lesson  the radical  tactical shift. And I've come here to ask you today  what radical tactical shift can you take in your relationship to the environment  which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world and a secure world  and most importantly  in a sustainable world  And I ask you  please  to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make  which will make that big difference  and then commit a hundred percent to doing it. Blog about it  tweet about it  talk about it  and commit a hundred percent  because very  very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it. So thank you very  very much.,Coldwater swimmer,201007,6.035955334987593
302,148,150,Liz Diller 2012,Liz Diller,female,A new museum wing ... in a giant bubble,Apr 2012,712,We conventionally divide space into private and public realms  and we know these legal distinctions very well because we've become experts at protecting our private property and private space. But we're less attuned to the nuances of the public. What translates generic public space into qualitative space  I mean  this is something that our studio has been working on for the past decade. And we're doing this through some case studies. A large chunk of our work has been put into transforming this neglected industrial ruin into a viable post industrial space that looks forward and backward at the same time. And another huge chunk of our work has gone into making relevant a site that's grown out of sync with its time. We've been working on democratizing Lincoln Center for a public that doesn't usually have      to spend on an opera ticket. So we've been eating  drinking  thinking  living public space for quite a long time. And it's taught us really one thing  and that is to truly make good public space  you have to erase the distinctions between architecture  urbanism  landscape  media design and so on. It really goes beyond distinction. Now we're moving onto Washington  D.C. and we're working on another transformation  and that is for the existing Hirshhorn Museum that's sited on the most revered public space in America  the National Mall. The Mall is a symbol of American democracy. And what's fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing  it's not an image  it's not an artifact  actually it's a space  and it's kind of just defined by a line of buildings on either side. It's a space where citizens can voice their discontent and show their power. It's a place where pivotal moments in American history have taken place. And they're inscribed in there forever    like the march on Washington for jobs and freedom and the great speech that Martin Luther King gave there. The Vietnam protests  the commemoration of all that died in the pandemic of AIDS  the march for women's reproductive rights  right up until almost the present. The Mall is the greatest civic stage in this country for dissent. And it's synonymous with free speech  even if you're not sure what it is that you have to say. It may just be a place for civic commiseration. There is a huge disconnect  we believe  between the communicative and discursive space of the Mall and the museums that line it to either side. And that is that those museums are usually passive  they have passive relationships between the museum as the presenter and the audience  as the receiver of information. And so you can see dinosaurs and insects and collections of locomotives and all of that  but you're really not involved  you're being talked to. When Richard Koshalek took over as director of the Hirshhorn in       he was determined to take advantage of the fact that this museum was sited at the most unique place  at the seat of power in the U.S. And while art and politics are inherently and implicitly together always and all the time  there could be some very special relationship that could be forged here in its uniqueness. The question is  is it possible ultimately for art to insert itself into the dialogue of national and world affairs  And could the museum be an agent of cultural diplomacy  There are over     embassies in Washington D.C. There are over     think tanks. There should be a way of harnessing all of that intellectual and global energy into  and somehow through  the museum. There should be some kind of brain trust. So the Hirshhorn  as we began to think about it  and as we evolved the mission  with Richard and his team    it's really his life blood. But beyond exhibiting contemporary art  the Hirshhorn will become a public forum  a place of discourse for issues around arts  culture  politics and policy. It would have the global reach of the World Economic Forum. It would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference. It would have the informality of the town square. And for this new initiative  the Hirshhorn would have to expand or appropriate a site for a contemporary  deployable structure. This is it. This is the Hirshhorn    so a     foot diameter concrete doughnut designed in the early '  s by Gordon Bunshaft. It's hulking  it's silent  it's cloistered  it's arrogant  it's a design challenge. Architects love to hate it. One redeeming feature is it's lifted up off the ground and it's got this void  and it's got an empty core kind of in the spirit and that facade very much corporate and federal style. And around that space  the ring is actually galleries. Very  very difficult to mount shows in there. When the Hirshhorn opened  Ada Louise Huxstable  the New York Times critic  had some choice words   Neo penitentiary modern.   A maimed monument and a maimed Mall for a maimed collection.  Almost four decades later  how will this building expand for a new progressive program  Where would it go  It can't go in the Mall. There is no space there. It can't go in the courtyard. It's already taken up by landscape and by sculptures. Well there's always the hole. But how could it take the space of that hole and not be buried in it invisibly  How could it become iconic  And what language would it take  The Hirshhorn sits among the Mall's monumental institutions. Most are neoclassical  heavy and opaque  made of stone or concrete. And the question is  if one inhabits that space  what is the material of the Mall  It has to be different from the buildings there. It has to be something entirely different. It has to be air. In our imagination  it has to be light. It has to be ephemeral. It has to be formless. And it has to be free. So this is the big idea. It's a giant airbag. The expansion takes the shape of its container and it oozes out wherever it can    the top and sides. But more poetically  we like to think of the structure as inhaling the democratic air of the Mall  bringing it into itself. The before and the after. It was dubbed  the bubble  by the press. That was the lounge. It's basically one big volume of air that just oozes out in every direction. The membrane is translucent. It's made of silcon coated glass fiber. And it's inflated twice a year for one month at a time. This is the view from the inside. So you might have been wondering how in the world did we get this approved by the federal government. It had to be approved by actually two agencies. And one is there to preserve the dignity and sanctity of the Mall. I blush whenever I show this. It is yours to interpret. But one thing I can say is that it's a combination of iconoclasm and adoration. There was also some creative interpretation involved. The Congressional Buildings Act of      limits the height of buildings in D.C. to     feet  except for spires  towers  domes and minarets. This pretty much exempts monuments of the church and state. And the bubble is     ft. That's the Pantheon next to it. It's about  .  million cubic feet of compressed air. And so we argued it on the merits of being a dome. So there it is  very stately  among all the stately buildings in the Mall. And while this Hirshhorn is not landmarked  it's very  very historically sensitive. And so we couldn't really touch its surfaces. We couldn't leave any traces behind. So we strained it from the edges  and we held it by cables. It's a study of some bondage techniques  which are actually very important because it's hit by wind all the time. There's one permanent steel ring at the top  but it can't be seen from any vantage point on the Mall. There are also some restrictions about how much it could be lit. It glows from within  it's translucent. But it can't be more lit than the Capitol or some of the monuments. So it's down the hierarchy on lighting. So it comes to the site twice a year. It's taken off the delivery truck. It's hoisted. And then it's inflated with this low pressure air. And then it's restrained with the cables. And then it's ballasted with water at the very bottom. This is a very strange moment where we were asked by the bureaucracy at the Mall how much time would it take to install. And we said  well the first erection would take one week. And they really connected with that idea. And then it was really easy all the way through. So we didn't really have that many hurdles  I have to say  with the government and all the authorities. But some of the toughest hurdles have been the technical ones. This is the warp and weft. This is a point cloud. There are extreme pressures. This is a very  very unusual building in that there's no gravity load  but there's load in every direction. And I'm just going to zip through these slides. And this is the space in action. So flexible interior for discussions  just like this  but in the round    luminous and reconfigurable. Could be used for anything  for performances  films  for installations. And the very first program will be one of cultural dialogue and diplomacy organized in partnership with the Council on Foreign Relations. Form and content are together here. The bubble is an anti monument. The ideals of participatory democracy are represented through suppleness rather than rigidity. Art and politics occupy an ambiguous site outside the museum walls  but inside of the museum's core  blending its air with the democratic air of the Mall. And the bubble will inflate hopefully for the first time at the end of     . Thank you.,Designer,201204,6.090387323943659
303,1311,1313,Liz Diller 2008,Liz Diller,female,The Blur Building and other tech-empowered architecture,Oct 2008,1146,Aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space  architecture is nothing but a special effects machine that delights and disturbs the senses. Our work is across media. The work comes in all shapes and sizes. It's small and large. This is an ashtray  a water glass. From urban planning and master planning to theater and all sorts of stuff. The thing that all the work has in common is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space. And these are everyday conventions  conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity. And I've assembled a sampling of work that all share a kind of productive nihilism that's used in the service of creating a particular special effect. And that is something like nothing  or something next to nothing. It's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through. This is an image that won us a competition for an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo      on Lake Neuchatel  near Geneva. And we wanted to use the water not only as a context  but as a primary building material. We wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere. So  no walls  no roof  no purpose    just a mass of atomized water  a big cloud. And this proposal was a reaction to the over saturation of emergent technologies in recent national and world expositions  which feeds  or has been feeding  our insatiable appetite for visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity. High definition  in our opinion  has become the new orthodoxy. And we ask the question  can we use technology  high technology  to make an expo pavilion that's decidedly low definition  that also challenges the conventions of space and skin  and rethinks our dependence on vision  So this is how we sought to do it. Water's pumped from the lake and is filtered and shot as a fine mist through an array of high pressure fog nozzles         of them. And a weather station is on the structure. It reads the shifting conditions of temperature  humidity  wind direction  wind speed  dew point  and it processes this data in a central computer that calibrates the degree of water pressure and distribution of water throughout. And it's a responsive system that's trained on actual weather. So  this is just in construction  and there's a tensegrity structure. It's about     feet wide  the size of a football field  and it sits on just four very delicate columns. These are the fog nozzles  the interface  and basically the system is kind of reading the real weather  and producing kind of semi artificial and real weather. So  we're very interested in creating weather. I don't know why. Now  here we go  one side  the outside and then from the inside of the space you can see what the quality of the space was. Unlike entering any normal space  entering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium. It's formless  featureless  depthless  scaleless  massless  purposeless and dimensionless. All references are erased  leaving only an optical whiteout and white noise of the pulsing nozzles. So  this is an exhibition pavilion where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do. And we pride ourselves    it's a spectacular anti spectacle in which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head. So  the audience is dispersed  focused attention and dramatic build up and climax are all replaced by a kind of attenuated attention that's sustained by a sense of apprehension caused by the fog. And this is very much like how the Victorian novel used fog in this way. So here the world is put out of focus  while our visual dependence is put into focus. The public  you know  once disoriented can actually ascend to the angel deck above and then just come down under those lips into the water bar. So  all the waters of the world are served there  so we thought that  you know  after being at the water and moving through the water and breathing the water  you could also drink this building. And so it is sort of a theme  but it goes a little bit  you know  deeper than that. We really wanted to bring out our absolute dependence on this master sense  and maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses. You know  when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell  because the Swiss said   Well  why are we going to spend  you know     million dollars producing an effect that we already have in natural abundance that we hate   And  you know  we thought    well  we tried to convince them. And in the end  you know  they adapted this as a national icon that came to represent Swiss doubt  which we    you know  it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of. Anyway  it's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed  and so it's now a memory of an apparition  actually  but it continues to live in edible form. And this is the highest honor to be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland    to have a chocolate bar. Anyway  moving along. So in the '  s and '  s  we were mostly known for independent work  such as installation artist  architect  commissioned projects by museums and non for profit organizations. And we did a lot of media work  also a lot of experimental theater projects. In       the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work that featured a lot of this work from the '  s and '  s. However  the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective  and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show. This was a piece on tourism in the United States. This is  Soft Sell  for   nd Street. This was something done at the Cartier Foundation.  Master Slave  at the MOMA  the project series  a piece called  Parasite.  And so there were many  many of these kinds of projects. Anyway  they gave us the whole fourth floor  and  you know  the problem of the retrospective was something we were very uncomfortable with. It's a kind of invention of the museum that's supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding to the public of a body of work. And our work doesn't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all. And one of the recurring themes  by the way  that in the work was a kind of hostility toward the museum itself  and asking about the conventions of the museum  like the wall  the white wall. So  what you see here is basically a plan of many installations that were put there. And we actually had to install white walls to separate these pieces  which didn't belong together. But these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time. We used the wall to partition the    installations of the project and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation. And what you see is    actually  the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element  which was a new piece that created    that we created for the    which was a robotic drill  basically  that went all the way around  cruised the museum  went all around the walls and did a lot of damage. So  the drill was mounted on this robotic arm. We worked with  by the way  Honeybee Robotics. This is the brain. Honeybee Robotics designed the Mars Driller  and it was really very much fun to work with them. They weren't doing their primary work  which was for the government  while they were helping us with this. In any case  the way it works is that an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls. So  unfolded it's about     linear feet. And it randomly generates points within a three dimensional matrix. It selects a point  it guides the drill to that point  it pierces the dry wall  leaving a half inch hole before traveling to the next location. Initially these holes were lone blemishes  and as the exhibition continued the walls became increasingly perforated. So eventually holes on both sides of the wall aligned  opening views from gallery to gallery. Clusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall. And so this was a three month performance piece in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element. And also the acoustic separation was destroyed. Also the visual separation. And there was also this constant background groan  which was very annoying. And this is one of the blackout spaces where there's a video piece that became totally not useful. So rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display  the wall now actively competed for attention. And this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance basically exposed the discomfort of the work to this encompassing nature of the retrospective. It was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text. Moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago. It's the ICA    the Institute of Contemporary Art    in Boston  which is on the waterfront. And there's not enough time to really introduce the building  but I'll simply say that the building negotiates between this outwardly focused nature of the site    you know  it's a really great waterfront site in Boston    and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum. So  the nature of the building is that it looks at looking    I mean that's its primary objective  both its program and its architectural conceit. The building incorporates the site  but it dispenses it in very small doses in the way that the museum is choreographed. So  you come in and you're basically squeezed by the theater  by the belly of the theater  into this very compressed space where the view is turned off. Then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall. This elevator's about the size of a New York City studio apartment. And then  this is a view going up  and then you could come into the theater  which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop. And many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open. The view is denied in the galleries where we receive just natural light  and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view. The original intention of this space  which was unfortunately never realized  was to use lenticular glass which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out. In this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries the intention was really to not get a climax  but to have the view stalk you  so the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other. This was eliminated because the view was too good  and the mayor said   No  we just want this open.  The architect lost here. But culminating    and that's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk    is this Mediatheque  which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building. So this is an    foot cantilever    it's quite substantial. So  it's already sticking out into space enough  and then from that is this  is this small area called the Mediatheque. The Mediatheque has something like    stations where the public can get onto the server and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web. And this was really a kind of very important part of this building  and here is a point where architecture    this is like technology free    architecture is only a framing device  it only edits the harbor view  the industrial harbor just through its walls  its floors and its ceiling  to only expose the water itself  the texture of water  much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow or a lava lamp or something like that. And here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence of the technological and the natural in the project. But there is just no information  it's just    it's just hypnosis. Moving along to Lincoln Center. These are the guys that did the project in the first place     years ago. We're taking over now  doing work that ranges in scale from small scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions. But we're doing it with a lot less testosterone. This is the extent of the work that's to be completed by     . And for the purposes of this talk  I wanted to isolate just a part of a project that's even a part of a project that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects  and it happens to be our current obsession  and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction. It's Alice Tully Hall  and it's tucked under the Juilliard Building and descends several levels under the street. So  this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be  before the renovation  which we just started. And we asked ourselves  why couldn't it be exhibitionistic  like the Met  or like some of the other buildings at Lincoln Center  And one of the things that we were asked to do was give it a street identity  expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible. And this building  which is just naturally hermetic  we stripped. We basically did a striptease  architectural striptease  where we're framing with this kind of canopy    the underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard  about        square feet    cutting it to the angle of Broadway  and then exposing  using that canopy to frame Tully Hall. Before and after shot.  Applause  Wait a minute  it's just in that state  we have a long way to go. But what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left to just talk about the hall itself  which is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work. So  the hall is a multi purpose hall. The clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall. Now  that's really tough to do with a hall that has       seats. Chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons and small scale performances. They asked us to bring an intimacy. How do you bring an intimacy into a hall  Intimacy for us means a lot of different things. It means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy. One thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall. Another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall. It's like a coffin  it basically sends all the sound  like a gutter ball effect  down the aisles. The walls are made of absorptive surface  half absorptive  half reflective  which is not very good for concert sound. This is Avery Fisher Hall  but the notion of junk    visual junk    was very  very important to us  to get rid of visual noise. Because we can't eliminate a single seat  the architecture is restricted to    inches. So it's a very  very thin architecture. First we do a kind of partial box and box separation  to take away the distraction of the subway noise. Next we wrap the entire hall    almost like this Olivetti keyboard    with a material  with a wood material that basically covers all the surfaces  wall  ceiling  floor  stage  steps  everything  boxes. But it's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage. And here's an acoustic shelf. Looking up the hall. Just a section of the stage. Just everything is lined  it incorporates    every single thing that you could possibly imagine is tucked into this high performance skin. But one more added feature. So now that we've stripped the hall of all visual distraction  everything that prevents this intimacy which is supposed to connect the house  the audience  with the performers  we add one little detail  one piece of architectural excess  a special effect  lighting. We very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival as it is when the concert starts. So what we wanted to do was produce this effect  this lighting effect  which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls. And what it entails is the use of resin  of this very thick resin with a veneer of the same kind of wood that's used throughout the hall  in a kind of seamless continuity that wraps the hall in light  like a belt of light  rather than separating  like a proscenium would separate the audience from performers  it connects audience with players. And this is a mockup that is in Salt Lake City that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full scale. And this is a guy from Salt Lake City  this is what they look like out there. And for us  I mean it's really kind of a very strange thing  but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin  very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier  the walls will just exude this glow  temporarily stealing attention from the stage. And this is Tully in construction now. I have no ending to say  except that I'm a couple of minutes over. Thank you very much.,Designer,200810,6.095328467153276
308,5,7,Malcolm Gladwell 2011,Malcolm Gladwell,male,The strange tale of the Norden bombsight,Oct 2011,883,Thank you. It's a real pleasure to be here. I last did a TED Talk I think about seven years ago or so. I talked about spaghetti sauce. And so many people  I guess  watch those videos. People have been coming up to me ever since to ask me questions about spaghetti sauce  which is a wonderful thing in the short term    but it's proven to be less than ideal over seven years. And so I though I would come and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me. The theme of this morning's session is Things We Make. And so I thought I would tell a story about someone who made one of the most precious objects of his era. And the man's name is Carl Norden. Carl Norden was born in     . And he was Swiss. And of course  the Swiss can be divided into two general categories  those who make small  exquisite  expensive objects and those who handle the money of those who buy small  exquisite  expensive objects. And Carl Norden is very firmly in the former camp. He's an engineer. He goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich. In fact  one of his classmates is a young man named Lenin who would go on to break small  expensive  exquisite objects. And he's a Swiss engineer  Carl. And I mean that in its fullest sense of the word. He wears three piece suits  and he has a very  very small  important mustache  and he is domineering and narcissistic and driven and has an extraordinary ego  and he works    hour days  and he has very strong feelings about alternating current  and he feels like a suntan is a sign of moral weakness  and he drinks lots of coffee  and he does his best work sitting in his mother's kitchen in Zurich for hours in complete silence with nothing but a slide rule. In any case  Carl Norden emigrates to the United States just before the First World War and sets up shop on Lafayette Street in downtown Manhattan. And he becomes obsessed with the question of how to drop bombs from an airplane. Now if you think about it  in the age before GPS and radar  that was obviously a really difficult problem. It's a complicated physics problem. You've got a plane that's thousands of feet up in the air  going at hundreds of miles an hour  and you're trying to drop an object  a bomb  towards some stationary target in the face of all kinds of winds and cloud cover and all kinds of other impediments. And all sorts of people  moving up to the First World War and between the wars  tried to solve this problem  and nearly everybody came up short. The bombsights that were available were incredibly crude. But Carl Norden is really the one who cracks the code. And he comes up with this incredibly complicated device. It weighs about    lbs. It's called the Norden Mark    bombsight. And it has all kinds of levers and ball bearings and gadgets and gauges. And he makes this complicated thing. And what he allows people to do is he makes the bombardier take this particular object  visually sight the target  because they're in the Plexiglas cone of the bomber  and then they plug in the altitude of the plane  the speed of the plane  the speed of the wind and the coordinates of the target. And the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb. And as Norden famously says   Before that bombsight came along  bombs would routinely miss their target by a mile or more.  But he said  with the Mark    Norden bombsight  he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at        ft. Now I cannot tell you how incredibly excited the U.S. military was by the news of the Norden bombsight. It was like manna from heaven. Here was an army that had just had experience in the First World War  where millions of men fought each other in the trenches  getting nowhere  making no progress  and here someone had come up with a device that allowed them to fly up in the skies high above enemy territory and destroy whatever they wanted with pinpoint accuracy. And the U.S. military spends  .  billion dollars    billion dollars in      dollars    developing the Norden bombsight. And to put that in perspective  the total cost of the Manhattan project was three billion dollars. Half as much money was spent on this Norden bombsight as was spent on the most famous military industrial project of the modern era. And there were people  strategists  within the U.S. military who genuinely thought that this single device was going to spell the difference between defeat and victory when it came to the battle against the Nazis and against the Japanese. And for Norden as well  this device had incredible moral importance  because Norden was a committed Christian. In fact  he would always get upset when people referred to the bombsight as his invention  because in his eyes  only God could invent things. He was simply the instrument of God's will. And what was God's will  Well God's will was that the amount of suffering in any kind of war be reduced to as small an amount as possible. And what did the Norden bombsight do  Well it allowed you to do that. It allowed you to bomb only those things that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb. So in the years leading up to the Second World War  the U.S. military buys        of these Norden bombsights at a cost of         each    again  in      dollars  that's a lot of money. And they trained        bombardiers on how to use them    long extensive  months long training sessions    because these things are essentially analog computers  they're not easy to use. And they make every one of those bombardiers take an oath  to swear that if they're ever captured  they will not divulge a single detail of this particular device to the enemy  because it's imperative the enemy not get their hands on this absolutely essential piece of technology. And whenever the Norden bombsight is taken onto a plane  it's escorted there by a series of armed guards. And it's carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it. And the box is handcuffed to one of the guards. It's never allowed to be photographed. And there's a little incendiary device inside of it  so that  if the plane ever crashes  it will be destroyed and there's no way the enemy can ever get their hands on it. The Norden bombsight is the Holy Grail. So what happens during the Second World War  Well  it turns out it's not the Holy Grail. In practice  the Norden bombsight can drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at        ft.  but that's under perfect conditions. And of course  in wartime  conditions aren't perfect. First of all  it's really hard to use    really hard to use. And not all of the people who are of those        men who are bombardiers have the ability to properly program an analog computer. Secondly  it breaks down a lot. It's full of all kinds of gyroscopes and pulleys and gadgets and ball bearings  and they don't work as well as they ought to in the heat of battle. Thirdly  when Norden was making his calculations  he assumed that a plane would be flying at a relatively slow speed at low altitudes. Well in a real war  you can't do that  you'll get shot down. So they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds. And the Norden bombsight doesn't work as well under those conditions. But most of all  the Norden bombsight required the bombardier to make visual contact with the target. But of course  what happens in real life  There are clouds  right. It needs cloudless sky to be really accurate. Well how many cloudless skies do you think there were above Central Europe between      and       Not a lot. And then to give you a sense of just how inaccurate the Norden bombsight was  there was a famous case in      where the Allies bombed a chemical plant in Leuna  Germany. And the chemical plant comprised     acres. And over the course of    bombing missions  the Allies dropped        bombs on this     acre chemical plant  using the Norden bombsight. Well what percentage of those bombs do you think actually landed inside the     acre perimeter of the plant     percent.    percent. And of those    percent that landed     percent didn't even go off  they were duds. The Leuna chemical plant  after one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war  was up and running within weeks. And by the way  all those precautions to keep the Norden bombsight out of the hands of the Nazis  Well it turns out that Carl Norden  as a proper Swiss  was very enamored of German engineers. So in the     s  he hired a whole bunch of them  including a man named Hermann Long who  in       gave a complete set of the plans for the Norden bombsight to the Nazis. So they had their own Norden bombsight throughout the entire war    which also  by the way  didn't work very well. So why do we talk about the Norden bombsight  Well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of Norden bombsights. We live in a time where there are all kinds of really  really smart people running around  saying that they've invented gadgets that will forever change our world. They've invented websites that will allow people to be free. They've invented some kind of this thing  or this thing  or this thing that will make our world forever better. If you go into the military  you'll find lots of Carl Nordens as well. If you go to the Pentagon  they will say   You know what  now we really can put a bomb inside a pickle barrel at        ft.  And you know what  it's true  they actually can do that now. But we need to be very clear about how little that means. In the Iraq War  at the beginning of the first Iraq War  the U.S. military  the air force  sent two squadrons of F   E Fighter Eagles to the Iraqi desert equipped with these five million dollar cameras that allowed them to see the entire desert floor. And their mission was to find and to destroy    remember the Scud missile launchers  those surface to air missiles that the Iraqis were launching at the Israelis  The mission of the two squadrons was to get rid of all the Scud missile launchers. And so they flew missions day and night  and they dropped thousands of bombs  and they fired thousands of missiles in an attempt to get rid of this particular scourge. And after the war was over  there was an audit done    as the army always does  the air force always does    and they asked the question  how many Scuds did we actually destroy  You know what the answer was  Zero  not a single one. Now why is that  Is it because their weapons weren't accurate  Oh no  they were brilliantly accurate. They could have destroyed this little thing right here from        ft. The issue was they didn't know where the Scud launchers were. The problem with bombs and pickle barrels is not getting the bomb inside the pickle barrel  it's knowing how to find the pickle barrel. That's always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars. Or take the battle in Afghanistan. What is the signature weapon of the CIA's war in Northwest Pakistan  It's the drone. What is the drone  Well it is the grandson of the Norden Mark    bombsight. It is this weapon of devastating accuracy and precision. And over the course of the last six years in Northwest Pakistan  the CIA has flown hundreds of drone missiles  and it's used those drones to kill       suspected Pakistani and Taliban militants. Now what is the accuracy of those drones  Well it's extraordinary. We think we're now at    percent accuracy when it comes to drone strikes.    percent of the people we kill need to be killed  right  That is one of the most extraordinary records in the history of modern warfare. But do you know what the crucial thing is  In that exact same period that we've been using these drones with devastating accuracy  the number of attacks  of suicide attacks and terrorist attacks  against American forces in Afghanistan has increased tenfold. As we have gotten more and more efficient in killing them  they have become angrier and angrier and more and more motivated to kill us. I have not described to you a success story. I've described to you the opposite of a success story. And this is the problem with our infatuation with the things we make. We think the things we make can solve our problems  but our problems are much more complex than that. The issue isn't the accuracy of the bombs you have  it's how you use the bombs you have  and more importantly  whether you ought to use bombs at all. There's a postscript to the Norden story of Carl Norden and his fabulous bombsight. And that is  on August          a B    bomber called the Enola Gay flew over Japan and  using a Norden bombsight  dropped a very large thermonuclear device on the city of Hiroshima. And as was typical with the Norden bombsight  the bomb actually missed its target by     ft. But of course  it didn't matter. And that's the greatest irony of all when it comes to the Norden bombsight. the air force's  .  billion dollar bombsight was used to drop its three billion dollar bomb  which didn't need a bombsight at all. Meanwhile  back in New York  no one told Carl Norden that his bombsight was used over Hiroshima. He was a committed Christian. He thought he had designed something that would reduce the toll of suffering in war. It would have broken his heart.,Writer,201110,5.531044776119401
309,1279,1281,Malcolm Gladwell 2006,Malcolm Gladwell,male,"Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce",Sep 2006,1042,I think I was supposed to talk about my new book  which is called  Blink   and it's about snap judgments and first impressions. And it comes out in January  and I hope you all buy it in triplicate. But I was thinking about this  and I realized that although my new book makes me happy  and I think would make my mother happy  it's not really about happiness. So I decided instead  I would talk about someone who I think has done as much to make Americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last    years  a man who is a great personal hero of mine  someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz  who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce. Howard's about this high  and he's round  and he's in his   s  and he has big huge glasses and thinning gray hair  and he has a kind of wonderful exuberance and vitality  and he has a parrot  and he loves the opera  and he's a great aficionado of medieval history. And by profession  he's a psychophysicist. Now  I should tell you that I have no idea what psychophysics is  although at some point in my life  I dated a girl for two years who was getting her doctorate in psychophysics. Which should tell you something about that relationship. As far as I know  psychophysics is about measuring things. And Howard is very interested in measuring things. And he graduated with his doctorate from Harvard  and he set up a little consulting shop in White Plains  New York. And one of his first clients was Pepsi. This is many years ago  back in the early   s. And Pepsi came to Howard and they said   You know  there's this new thing called aspartame  and we would like to make Diet Pepsi. We'd like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of Diet Pepsi in order to have the perfect drink.  Now that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer  and that's what Howard thought. Because Pepsi told him   We're working with a band between eight and    percent. Anything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough  anything above    percent sweetness is too sweet. We want to know  what's the sweet spot between   and      Now  if I gave you this problem to do  you would all say  it's very simple. What we do is you make up a big experimental batch of Pepsi  at every degree of sweetness    eight percent   .    .    .   all the way up to       and we try this out with thousands of people  and we plot the results on a curve  and we take the most popular concentration  right  Really simple. Howard does the experiment  and he gets the data back  and he plots it on a curve  and all of a sudden he realizes it's not a nice bell curve. In fact  the data doesn't make any sense. It's a mess. It's all over the place. Now  most people in that business  in the world of testing food and such  are not dismayed when the data comes back a mess. They think   Well  you know  figuring out what people think about cola's not that easy.   You know  maybe we made an error somewhere along the way.   You know  let's just make an educated guess   and they simply point and they go for    percent  right in the middle. Howard is not so easily placated. Howard is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards. And this was not good enough for him  and this question bedeviled him for years. And he would think it through and say   What was wrong  Why could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi   And one day  he was sitting in a diner in White Plains  about to go trying to dream up some work for Nescaf . And suddenly  like a bolt of lightning  the answer came to him. And that is  that when they analyzed the Diet Pepsi data  they were asking the wrong question. They were looking for the perfect Pepsi  and they should have been looking for the perfect Pepsis. Trust me. This was an enormous revelation. This was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science. Howard immediately went on the road  and he would go to conferences around the country  and he would stand up and say   You had been looking for the perfect Pepsi. You're wrong. You should be looking for the perfect Pepsis.  And people would look at him blankly and say   What are you talking about  Craziness.  And they would say   Move  Next   Tried to get business  nobody would hire him    he was obsessed  though  and he talked about it and talked about it. Howard loves the Yiddish expression  To a worm in horseradish  the world is horseradish.  This was his horseradish. He was obsessed with it  And finally  he had a breakthrough. Vlasic Pickles came to him  and they said   Doctor Moskowitz  we want to make the perfect pickle.  And he said   There is no perfect pickle  there are only perfect pickles.  And he came back to them and he said   You don't just need to improve your regular  you need to create zesty.  And that's where we got zesty pickles. Then the next person came to him  Campbell's Soup. And this was even more important. In fact  Campbell's Soup is where Howard made his reputation. Campbell's made Prego  and Prego  in the early   s  was struggling next to Rag   which was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the   s and   s. In the industry    I don't know whether you care about this  or how much time I have to go into this. But it was  technically speaking    this is an aside    Prego is a better tomato sauce than Rag . The quality of the tomato paste is much better  the spice mix is far superior  it adheres to the pasta in a much more pleasing way. In fact  they would do the famous bowl test back in the   s with Rag  and Prego. You'd have a plate of spaghetti  and you would pour it on  right  And the Rag  would all go to the bottom  and the Prego would sit on top. That's called  adherence.  And  anyway  despite the fact that they were far superior in adherence  and the quality of their tomato paste  Prego was struggling. So they came to Howard  and they said  fix us. And Howard looked at their product line  and he said  what you have is a dead tomato society. So he said  this is what I want to do. And he got together with the Campbell's soup kitchen  and he made    varieties of spaghetti sauce. And he varied them according to every conceivable way that you can vary tomato sauce  by sweetness  by level of garlic  by tomatoey ness  by tartness  by sourness  by visible solids    my favorite term in the spaghetti sauce business. Every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce  he varied spaghetti sauce. And then he took this whole raft of    spaghetti sauces  and he went on the road. He went to New York  to Chicago  he went to Jacksonville  to Los Angeles. And he brought in people by the truckload into big halls. And he sat them down for two hours  and over the course of that two hours  he gave them ten bowls. Ten small bowls of pasta  with a different spaghetti sauce on each one. And after they ate each bowl  they had to rate  from   to      how good they thought the spaghetti sauce was. At the end of that process  after doing it for months and months  he had a mountain of data about how the American people feel about spaghetti sauce. And then he analyzed the data. Did he look for the most popular variety of spaghetti sauce  No  Howard doesn't believe that there is such a thing. Instead  he looked at the data  and he said  let's see if we can group all these different data points into clusters. Let's see if they congregate around certain ideas. And sure enough  if you sit down  and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce  you realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups. There are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain  there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy  and there are people who like it extra chunky. And of those three facts  the third one was the most significant  because at the time  in the early     s  if you went to a supermarket  you would not find extra chunky spaghetti sauce. And Prego turned to Howard  and they said   You're telling me that one third of Americans crave extra chunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs   And he said  Yes   And Prego then went back  and completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce  and came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely took over the spaghetti sauce business in this country. And over the next    years  they made     million dollars off their line of extra chunky sauces. Everyone else in the industry looked at Howard had done  and they said   Oh my god  We've been thinking all wrong   And that's when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar  and    different kinds of mustard  and    different kinds of olive oil. And then eventually even Rag  hired Howard  and Howard did the exact same thing for Rag  that he did for Prego. And today  if you go to a really good supermarket  do you know how many Rag s there are      In six varieties  Cheese  Light  Robusto  Rich   Hearty  Old World Traditional    Extra Chunky Garden. That's Howard's doing. That is Howard's gift to the American people. Now why is that important  It is  in fact  enormously important. I'll explain to you why. What Howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy. Assumption number one in the food industry used to be that the way to find out what people want to eat  what will make people happy  is to ask them. And for years and years and years  Rag  and Prego would have focus groups  and they would sit you down  and they would say   What do you want in a spaghetti sauce  Tell us what you want in a spaghetti sauce.  And for all those years           years    through all those focus group sessions  no one ever said they wanted extra chunky. Even though at least a third of them  deep in their hearts  actually did. People don't know what they want  As Howard loves to say   The mind knows not what the tongue wants.  It's a mystery  And a critically important step in understanding our own desires and tastes is to realize that we cannot always explain what we want  deep down. If I asked all of you  for example  in this room  what you want in a coffee  you know what you'd say  Every one of you would say   I want a dark  rich  hearty roast.  It's what people always say when you ask them.  What do you like    Dark  rich  hearty roast   What percentage of you actually like a dark  rich  hearty roast  According to Howard  somewhere between    and    percent of you. Most of you like milky  weak coffee. But you will never  ever say to someone who asks you what you want that  I want a milky  weak coffee.  So that's number one thing that Howard did. Number two thing that Howard did is he made us realize    it's another very critical point    he made us realize the importance of what he likes to call  horizontal segmentation.  Why is this critical  Because this is the way the food industry thought before Howard. What were they obsessed with in the early   s  They were obsessed with mustard. In particular  they were obsessed with the story of Grey Poupon. Used to be  there were two mustards  French's and Gulden's. What were they  Yellow mustard. What's in it  Yellow mustard seeds  turmeric  and paprika. That was mustard. Grey Poupon came along  with a Dijon. Right  Much more volatile brown mustard seed  some white wine  a nose hit  much more delicate aromatics. And what do they do  They put it in a little tiny glass jar  with a wonderful enameled label on it  made it look French  even though it's made in Oxnard  California. And instead of charging a dollar fifty for the eight ounce bottle  the way that French's and Gulden's did  they decided to charge four dollars. And they had those ads. With the guy in the Rolls Royce  eating the Grey Poupon. Another pulls up  and says   Do you have any Grey Poupon   And the whole thing  after they did that  Grey Poupon takes off  Takes over the mustard business  And everyone's take home lesson from that was that the way to make people happy is to give them something that is more expensive  something to aspire to. It's to make them turn their back on what they think they like now  and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy. A better mustard  A more expensive mustard  A mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning. And Howard looked to that and said   That's wrong   Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy. Mustard exists  just like tomato sauce  on a horizontal plane. There is no good mustard or bad mustard. There is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard. There are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people. He fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste. And for that  as well  we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks. Third thing that Howard did  and perhaps the most important  is Howard confronted the notion of the Platonic dish. What do I mean by that  For the longest time in the food industry  there was a sense that there was one way  a perfect way  to make a dish. You go to Chez Panisse  they give you the red tail sashimi with roasted pumpkin seeds in a something something reduction. They don't give you five options on the reduction. They don't say   Do you want the extra chunky reduction  or ...   No  You just get the reduction. Why  Because the chef at Chez Panisse has a Platonic notion about red tail sashimi.  This is the way it ought to be.  And she serves it that way time and time again  and if you quarrel with her  she will say   You know what  You're wrong  This is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant.  Now that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well. They had a Platonic notion of what tomato sauce was. And where did that come from  It came from Italy. Italian tomato sauce is what  It's blended  it's thin. The culture of tomato sauce was thin. When we talked about  authentic tomato sauce  in the     s  we talked about Italian tomato sauce  we talked about the earliest Rag s  which had no visible solids  right  Which were thin  you just put a little bit and it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta. That's what it was. And why were we attached to that  Because we thought that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce  A. And B  we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce  then they would embrace it. And that's what would please the maximum number of people. In other words  people in the cooking world were looking for cooking universals. They were looking for one way to treat all of us. And it's good reason for them to be obsessed with the idea of universals  because all of science  through the   th century and much of the   th  was obsessed with universals. Psychologists  medical scientists  economists were all interested in finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave. But that changed  right  What is the great revolution in science of the last        years  It is the movement from the search for universals to the understanding of variability. Now in medical science  we don't want to know  necessarily  just how cancer works  we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer. I guess my cancer different from your cancer. Genetics has opened the door to the study of human variability. What Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying   This same revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce.  And for that  we owe him a great vote of thanks. I'll give you one last illustration of variability  and that is    oh  I'm sorry. Howard not only believed that  but he took it a second step  which was to say that when we pursue universal principles in food  we aren't just making an error  we are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice. And the example he used was coffee. And coffee is something he did a lot of work with  with Nescaf . If I were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee    a type of coffee  a brew    that made all of you happy  and then I asked you to rate that coffee  the average score in this room for coffee would be about    on a scale of   to    . If  however  you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters  maybe three or four coffee clusters  and I could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters  your scores would go from    to    or   . The difference between coffee at    and coffee at    is a difference between coffee that makes you wince  and coffee that makes you deliriously happy. That is the final  and I think most beautiful lesson  of Howard Moskowitz  that in embracing the diversity of human beings  we will find a surer way to true happiness.

317,2010,2012,Markus Fischer 2011,Markus Fischer,male,A robot that flies like a bird,Jul 2011,359,It is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird. Birds are very agile. They fly  not with rotating components  so they fly only by flapping their wings. So we looked at the birds  and we tried to make a model that is powerful  ultralight  and it must have excellent aerodynamic qualities that would fly by its own and only by flapping its wings. So what would be better than to use the herring gull  in its freedom  circling and swooping over the sea  and to use this as a role model  So we bring a team together. There are generalists and also specialists in the field of aerodynamics  in the field of building gliders. And the task was to build an ultralight indoor flying model that is able to fly over your heads. So be careful later on. And this was one issue  to build it that lightweight that no one would be hurt if it fell down. So why do we do all this  We are a company in the field of automation  and we'd like to do very lightweight structures because that's energy efficient  and we'd like to learn more about pneumatics and air flow phenomena. So I now would like you to put your seat belts on and put your hats on. So maybe we'll try it once    to fly a SmartBird. Thank you. So we can now look at the SmartBird. So here is one without a skin. We have a wingspan of about two meters. The length is one meter and six  and the weight is only     grams. And it is all out of carbon fiber. In the middle we have a motor  and we also have a gear in it  and we use the gear to transfer the circulation of the motor. So within the motor  we have three Hall sensors  so we know exactly where the wing is. And if we now beat up and down    We have the possibility to fly like a bird. So if you go down  you have the large area of propulsion  and if you go up  the wings are not that large  and it is easier to get up. So  the next thing we did  or the challenges we did  was to coordinate this movement. We have to turn it  go up and go down. We have a split wing. With the split wing  we get the lift at the upper wing  and we get the propulsion at the lower wing. Also  we see how we measure the aerodynamic efficiency. We had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency and then we can calculate the aerodynamic efficiency. So therefore  it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion  from    percent up to    percent. Next thing we have to do  we have to control and regulate the whole structure. Only if you control and regulate it  you will get that aerodynamic efficiency. So the overall consumption of energy is about    watts at takeoff and    to    watts in flight. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Markus  we should fly it once more. Markus Fischer  Yeah  sure.,Designer,201107,6.253193277310923
322,809,811,Matthew O'Reilly 2014,Matthew O'Reilly,male,“Am I dying?” The honest answer.,Sep 2014,327,I've been a critical care EMT for the past seven years in Suffolk County  New York. I've been a first responder in a number of incidents ranging from car accidents to Hurricane Sandy. If you are like most people  death might be one of your greatest fears. Some of us will see it coming. Some of us won't. There is a little known documented medical term called impending doom. It's almost a symptom. As a medical provider  I'm trained to respond to this symptom like any other  so when a patient having a heart attack looks at me and says   I'm going to die today   we are trained to reevaluate the patient's condition. Throughout my career  I have responded to a number of incidents where the patient had minutes left to live and there was nothing I could do for them. With this  I was faced with a dilemma  Do I tell the dying that they are about to face death  or do I lie to them to comfort them  Early in my career  I faced this dilemma by simply lying. I was afraid. I was afraid if I told them the truth  that they would die in terror  in fear  just grasping for those last moments of life. That all changed with one incident. Five years ago  I responded to a motorcycle accident. The rider had suffered critical  critical injuries. As I assessed him  I realized that there was nothing that could be done for him  and like so many other cases  he looked me in the eye and asked that question   Am I going to die   In that moment  I decided to do something different. I decided to tell him the truth. I decided to tell him that he was going to die and that there was nothing I could do for him. His reaction shocked me to this day. He simply laid back and had a look of acceptance on his face. He was not met with that terror or fear that I thought he would be. He simply laid there  and as I looked into his eyes  I saw inner peace and acceptance. From that moment forward  I decided it was not my place to comfort the dying with my lies. Having responded to many cases since then where patients were in their last moments and there was nothing I could do for them  in almost every case  they have all had the same reaction to the truth  of inner peace and acceptance. In fact  there are three patterns I have observed in all these cases. The first pattern always kind of shocked me. Regardless of religious belief or cultural background  there's a need for forgiveness. Whether they call it sin or they simply say they have a regret  their guilt is universal. I had once cared for an elderly gentleman who was having a massive heart attack. As I prepared myself and my equipment for his imminent cardiac arrest  I began to tell the patient of his imminent demise. He already knew by my tone of voice and body language. As I placed the defibrillator pads on his chest  prepping for what was going to happen  he looked me in the eye and said   I wish I had spent more time with my children and grandchildren instead of being selfish with my time.  Faced with imminent death  all he wanted was forgiveness. The second pattern I observe is the need for remembrance. Whether it was to be remembered in my thoughts or their loved ones'  they needed to feel that they would be living on. There's a need for immortality within the hearts and thoughts of their loved ones  myself  my crew  or anyone around. Countless times  I have had a  patient look me in the eyes and say   Will you remember me   The final pattern I observe always touched me the deepest  to the soul. The dying need to know that their life had meaning. They need to know that they did not waste their life on meaningless tasks. This came to me very  very early in my career. I had responded to a call. There was a female in her late   s severely pinned within a vehicle. She had been t boned at a high rate of speed  critical  critical condition. As the fire department worked to remove her from the car  I climbed in to begin to render care. As we talked  she had said to me   There was so much more I wanted to do with my life.  She had felt she had not left her mark on this Earth. As we talked further  it would turn out that she was a mother of two adopted children who were both on their way to medical school. Because of her  two children had a chance they never would have had otherwise and would go on to save lives in the medical field as medical doctors. It would end up taking    minutes to free her from the vehicle. However  she perished prior to freeing her. I believed what you saw in the movies  when you're in those last moments that it's strictly terror  fear. I have come to realize  regardless of the circumstance  it's generally met with peace and acceptance  that it's the littlest things  the littlest moments  the littlest things you brought into the world that give you peace in those final moments. Thank you.,Emergency medical technician,201409,5.560045248868775
338,499,501,Miranda Wang and Jeanny Yao 2013,Miranda Wang and Jeanny Yao,they (both female),Two young scientists break down plastics with bacteria,Jul 2013,11,Miranda Wang  We're here to talk about accidents. How do you feel about accidents  When we think about accidents  we usually consider them to be harmful  unfortunate or even dangerous  and they certainly can be. But are they always that bad  The discovery that had led to penicillin  for example  is one of the most fortunate accidents of all time. Without biologist Alexander Fleming's moldy accident  caused by a neglected workstation  we wouldn't be able to fight off so many bacterial infections. Jeanny Yao  Miranda and I are here today because we'd like to share how our accidents have led to discoveries. In       we visited the Vancouver Waste Transfer Station and saw an enormous pit of plastic waste. We realized that when plastics get to the dump  it's difficult to sort them because they have similar densities  and when they're mixed with organic matter and construction debris  it's truly impossible to pick them out and environmentally eliminate them. MW  However  plastics are useful because they're durable  flexible  and can be easily molded into so many useful shapes. The downside of this convenience is that there's a high cost to this. Plastics cause serious problems  such as the destruction of ecosystems  the pollution of natural resources  and the reduction of available land space. This picture you see here is the Great Pacific Gyre. When you think about plastic pollution and the marine environment  we think about the Great Pacific Gyre  which is supposed to be a floating island of plastic waste. But that's no longer an accurate depiction of plastic pollution in the marine environment. Right now  the ocean is actually a soup of plastic debris  and there's nowhere you can go in the ocean where you wouldn't be able to find plastic particles. JY  In a plastic dependent society  cutting down production is a good goal  but it's not enough. And what about the waste that's already been produced  Plastics take hundreds to thousands of years to biodegrade. So we thought  you know what  Instead of waiting for that garbage to sit there and pile up  let's find a way to break them down with bacteria. Sounds cool  right  Audience  Yeah. JY  Thank you. But we had a problem. You see  plastics have very complex structures and are difficult to biodegrade. Anyhow  we were curious and hopeful and still wanted to give it a go. MW  With this idea in mind  Jeanny and I read through some hundreds of scientific articles on the Internet  and we drafted a research proposal in the beginning of our grade    year. We aimed to find bacteria from our local Fraser River that can degrade a harmful plasticizer called phthalates. Phthalates are additives used in everyday plastic products to increase their flexibility  durability and transparency. Although they're part of the plastic  they're not covalently bonded to the plastic backbone. As a result  they easily escape into our environment. Not only do phthalates pollute our environment  but they also pollute our bodies. To make the matter worse  phthalates are found in products to which we have a high exposure  such as babies' toys  beverage containers  cosmetics  and even food wraps. Phthalates are horrible because they're so easily taken into our bodies. They can be absorbed by skin contact  ingested  and inhaled. JY  Every year  at least     million pounds of phthalates contaminate our air  water and soil. The Environmental Protection Agency even classified this group as a top priority pollutant because it's been shown to cause cancer and birth defects by acting as a hormone disruptor. We read that each year  the Vancouver municipal government monitors phthalate concentration levels in rivers to assess their safety. So we figured  if there are places along our Fraser River that are contaminated with phthalates  and if there are bacteria that are able to live in these areas  then perhaps  perhaps these bacteria could have evolved to break down phthalates. MW  So we presented this good idea to Dr. Lindsay Eltis at the University of British Columbia  and surprisingly  he actually took us into his lab and asked his graduate students Adam and James to help us. Little did we know at that time that a trip to the dump and some research on the Internet and plucking up the courage to act upon inspiration would take us on a life changing journey of accidents and discoveries. JY  The first step in our project was to collect soil samples from three different sites along the Fraser River. Out of thousands of bacteria  we wanted to find ones that could break down phthalates  so we enriched our cultures with phthalates as the only carbon source. This implied that  if anything grew in our cultures  then they must be able to live off of phthalates. Everything went well from there  and we became amazing scientists.  Laughter  MW  Um... uh  Jeanny. JY  I'm just joking. MW  Okay. Well  it was partially my fault. You see  I accidentally cracked the flask that had contained our third enrichment culture  and as a result  we had to wipe down the incubator room with bleach and ethanol twice. And this is only one of the examples of the many accidents that happened during our experimentation. But this mistake turned out to be rather serendipitous. We noticed that the unharmed cultures came from places of opposite contamination levels  so this mistake actually led us to think that perhaps we can compare the different degradative potentials of bacteria from sites of opposite contamination levels. JY  Now that we grew the bacteria  we wanted to isolate strains by streaking onto mediate plates  because we thought that would be less accident prone  but we were wrong again. We poked holes in our agar while streaking and contaminated some samples and funghi. As a result  we had to streak and restreak several times. Then we monitored phthalate utilization and bacterial growth  and found that they shared an inverse correlation  so as bacterial populations increased  phthalate concentrations decreased. This means that our bacteria were actually living off of phthalates. MW  So now that we found bacteria that could break down phthalates  we wondered what these bacteria were. So Jeanny and I took three of our most efficient strains and then performed gene amplification sequencing on them and matched our data with an online comprehensive database. We were happy to see that  although our three strains had been previously identified bacteria  two of them were not previously associated with phthalate degradation  so this was actually a novel discovery. JY  To better understand how this biodegradation works  we wanted to verify the catabolic pathways of our three strains. To do this  we extracted enzymes from our bacteria and reacted with an intermediate of phthalic acid. MW  We monitored this experiment with spectrophotometry and obtained this beautiful graph. This graph shows that our bacteria really do have a genetic pathway to biodegrade phthalates. Our bacteria can transform phthalates  which is a harmful toxin  into end products such as carbon dioxide  water and alcohol. I know some of you in the crowd are thinking  well  carbon dioxide is horrible  it's a greenhouse gas. But if our bacteria did not evolve to break down phthalates  they would have used some other kind of carbon source  and aerobic respiration would have led it to have end products such as carbon dioxide anyway. We were also interested to see that  although we've obtained greater diversity of bacteria biodegraders from the bird habitat site  we obtained the most efficient degraders from the landfill site. So this fully shows that nature evolves through natural selection. JY  So Miranda and I shared this research at the Sanofi BioGENEius Challenge competition and were recognized with the greatest commercialization potential. Although we're not the first ones to find bacteria that can break down phthalates  we were the first ones to look into our local river and find a possible solution to a local problem. We have not only shown that bacteria can be the solution to plastic pollution  but also that being open to uncertain outcomes and taking risks create opportunities for unexpected discoveries. Throughout this journey  we have also discovered our passion for science  and are currently continuing research on other fossil fuel chemicals in university. We hope that in the near future  we'll be able to create model organisms that can break down not only phthalates but a wide variety of different contaminants. We can apply this to wastewater treatment plants to clean up our rivers and other natural resources. And perhaps one day we'll be able to tackle the problem of solid plastic waste. MW  I think our journey has truly transformed our view of microorganisms  and Jeanny and I have shown that even mistakes can lead to discoveries. Einstein once said   You can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking you used when you created them.  If we're making plastic synthetically  then we think the solution would be to break them down biochemically. Thank you. JY  Thank you.,Science fair winners,201307,5.784801980198016
342,1220,1222,Moran Cerf 2016,Moran Cerf,male,This scientist can hack your dreams,May 2016,1072,So we spend a   th of our life dreaming  and most of it is forgotten. What if we could peek inside our brain and see our dreams  maybe even shape them  I am a neuroscientist  and I study how thinking works inside the brain. But this story starts five years ago  when my work was about to be published broadly  and one slip of a tongue made me take a big turn. It was October   th  and I woke up because my phone was buzzing. I look at the phone and I see that I have hundreds of missed calls. So I pick up the phone  and on the other line is a producer from the BBC  and in a thick British accent  he asks me about my work and specifically about my team's ability to record people's dreams for the first time in history. Now  just to be clear  my work had nothing to do with recording people's dreams. Apparently  he saw a short movie that I made to accompany the publication that's about to come out  and I'm explaining the results there  but I want to end with something that's like a TED like uplifting message  so I ask one of my colleagues to explain what the future may hold. And he says   In the future  we'll be able to decode people's intentions  people's memories  people's emotions    and maybe even their dreams.  And the camera fades out. So I explained to the producer that we didn't actually do that. And he asks me   But is it possible to record people's dreams   And I say   In theory  it's possible.   Thank you  bye.  Five minutes later  the headline on BBC   Scientist claims dream recording is possible.  Within minutes  the entire world picks up on this headline  and everyone speaks about my team's ability to record people's dreams. It doesn't matter how much I explained to everyone that this was impossible. The story now has a life of its own. So I call my dad  who is a journalist  and I ask him   Dad  how can I kill a story   And he says   No problem  just turn off the phone. No one cares about science.  So I turn off the phone    and people start emailing me their dreams. A famous chef asks me if I can open his brain and extract a recipe he's been dreaming of for a while. People ask me to look into their spouse's dreams. Others  who finally have a proof that the CIA is spying on them  want me to go and testify in Congress. Warner Brothers calls me. They want me to be the face of the upcoming DVD release of the movie  Inception   to show the science behind it. And a big computer company wanted to option the  dream recording machine   because my device now has a name  it has specifications  it had Wikipedia pages and fans all over the world. To make things worse    my students had the idea to go out to a Halloween party to forget about things  so I decided  in state of a depreciative sense of humor  to dress up like Sigmund Freud. So now there is not only just a story about me but also a nice visual to go with it  and I am deemed by the media now the modern day Freud. This story went on for a few weeks  until  fortunately  Prince William proposed to his girlfriend  which was much more important  and I got to go back to my work. Now  if you were interested in studying dreams  I would recommend starting first by just looking at people's thoughts when they are awake  and this is what I do. So I am indeed a neuroscientist  but I study the brain in a very non traditional way  partially inspired by my background. Before I became a neuroscientist  I was a computer hacker. I used to break into banks and government institutes to test their security. And I wanted to use the same techniques that hackers use to look inside black boxes when I wanted to study the brain  looking from the inside out. Now  neuroscientists study the brain in one of two typical methods. Some of them look at the brain from the outside using imaging techniques like EEG or fMRI. And the problem there is that the signal is very kind of blurry  coarse. So others look at the brain from the inside  where they stick electrodes inside the brain and listen to brain cells speaking their own language. This is very precise  but this obviously can be done only with animals. Now  if you were to peek inside the brain and listen to it speak  what you would see is that it has this electrochemical signal that you can translate to sound  and this sound is the common currency of the brain. It sounds something like this. So I wanted to use this in humans  but who would let you do that  Patients who undergo brain surgery. So I partner with neurosurgeons across the globe who employ this unique procedure where they open the skull of patients  they stick electrodes in the brain to find the source of the problem  and finding the source can take days or sometimes weeks  so this gives us a unique opportunity to eavesdrop on the brains of patients while they are awake and behaving and they have their skull open with electrodes inside. So now that we do that  we want to find what triggers those cells active  what makes them tick. So what we do is we run studies like this one. This is Linda  one of our patients. She is sitting here and watching those clips. Morgan Cerf  What you hear is the sound of one cell in her brain. Try to see if you can figure out what it cares about. The Simpsons. This is one cell out of a little network that's bound hand and fist with the concept of The Simpsons in Linda's brain. Now  if you know what The Simpsons are  then you all have similar cells in your brain that came to life right now when you saw this image. Now  those cells are amazing. They're very precise. They don't fire for any cartoon character or any yellow creature. They only fire when you think of The Simpsons. They fire when you see any picture of The Simpsons. Even if you hear the sound of The Simpsons  or just read the text   The Simpsons   these cells will fire. In fact  they fire even if you close your eyes and just imagine The Simpsons in your own head. We can remove the world  and the show still goes on. And we know that because we came back to Linda and asked her now  without saying anything  to just close her eyes and recall from her memory the things she has seen before  and what you see is that as she remembers The Simpsons  the same cell fires. In fact  it fires seconds before she speaks. So we get to see her thoughts coming to her. Now  this is remarkable  because when I speak to you right now  I feel that everything that I have to say comes out in real time. But now you can tell that we're actually a little bit behind. My brain plans the next word. That's the slowest I could ever speak. So once we find such cells in her brain  Bart Simpson  mom  dad  the Eiffel Tower  we can essentially know what she's thinking  and then we can do all sorts of fancy stuff that is based on those cells. For example  we can have her think of her mom and just move a spaceship on a computer screen with her thoughts alone. Or  if I can see her thoughts arising  I can actually do things before she's conscious of it. So I can ask her to press a button  but beat her to it and turn the lights on before she gets there. And it doesn't matter how smart she is or how fast she is. I'm always going to be there earlier because I'm inside her head. And finally  if we can actually show your thoughts  we can just project them on a screen in front of your eyes. And this is what we did five years ago. So naturally  when people saw thoughts on a screen  they started imagining the possibility of decoding dreams in the same way. Which we did not do. Until two years ago. When I got a call from the BBC again  and they asked me about dream recording  I told them   You know  we've been through it before.  And they said   No  we actually want you to comment on the work of someone that just came out that shows that this can be done.  So it turns out  three years after I explained to everyone why this was only theoretically possible  a colleague of mine  Professor Yukiyasu Kamitani from Japan  was inspired by it and did it. And that's when I decided I want to do it myself. So I decided I'm going to dive into dream research in two paths. The researcher in me said I'm going to try to see if we can access them and show them  and the hacker in me said I want to see if we can influence them and change people's behaviors. Looking into dreams is really interesting  obviously  but it's also very helpful. And the reason is that we don't really know what we're dreaming precisely if we just rely on what you tell us  because the language that you use is unreliable for two reasons. One  they fade away when we wake up. And this is by design  this is our brain's way of making sure we don't confuse them with real memories  so you don't think you actually scored a touchdown and had dinner with Aaron Sorkin. And if you actually remember something  we only describe them in the vocabulary that we have when we're awake. So blind people usually don't describe their dreams visually  because sight isn't in their vocabulary. Or  if anyone here is in their   s  it's very likely that when you were younger  you described your dreams in black and white. Only when people started seeing movies in color did they think that dreams should be in color too. So looking into dreams is really interesting. It's allowing us to actually get access to something that you forget. Imagine giving Einstein  Shakespeare or Picasso access to the dreams they forget in the morning. We were very excited about it  and we said  let's try to do it. But how  And then we had the idea  maybe the same neurons that fire when you're awake survive even when you're sleeping. After all  it's the same brain. It's us  awake or asleep. So my colleague Florian Mormann had the idea to go to the patient and tell them a story that involved the things that we find during the day. So Bart Simpson visits Paris  he goes to a Beatles concert with Al Gore  and so on. Then he asks the patient to memorize the story and go to sleep  and tells them  when you wake up  I'll ask you to tell it again. And what he shows is that when they're sleeping  the brain replays the same story using the same neurons in the same order  sequence and timing  as if you see the story in your mind  and this is remarkable. Now we don't know if the story that she sees is the same as the one that we decode. Maybe in her mind  Al Gore is holding a balloon and Bart Simpson is blue. But something about the content is preserved  and we can now decode it. And this is the first time someone could show a dream in such precise accuracy in humans. So we were very excited. But we said  this is still people with open brains  electrodes inside. Can we do it with everyone  And here  our colleagues from Japan show us that the answer is yes. We can zoom out from the brain and actually bring people and try to look at their dreams. Now  when you zoom out  the resolution decreases  so instead of seeing Bart Simpson and Al Gore  you will see maybe that it's a person or an object or some character  but something about the content is preserved. And maybe we can look at it. So we brought people to the scanner and had them fall asleep  and fortunately  from my experience  people fall asleep in my studies all the time. And while they are sleeping  the computer tries to guess what they're dreaming using those high level concepts. Is it a person  Is it a character  And once the computer is getting good in making a guess on what you're dreaming  we wake you up and we ask you to tell us the story. And what we show is that the computer is amazing in just learning over time to guess your dream and predict something about the gist of the story that you saw in your mind. So now we're pretty excited  because we have a way to get there  working both internally and externally. So this gets us now to thinking about the ability to maybe also change things when you are asleep. To change things when you are asleep  you have to know something about the function of dreams. And here neuroscientists are debating  and the range of options is wide. Some say the function of dreams is to forget things  erase memories or suppress thoughts  whereas the others say that this is our brain's way of simulating futures  so you're kind of thinking about dumping him and moving to Vancouver or marrying him and starting a family in Alabama. You don't know the answer. Your brain is going to simulate both options and give you something to think about when you wake up. But regardless of whichever option you believe in  what's common to all of them is that during the night  we think that this is our brain's way of keeping ourselves up and crafting answers to problems. So we said that if we define the right moment  we can maybe change things in your dreams. Now  this of course is quite spooky  the idea that something happens to me when I'm sleeping. But we're going to show you how we're using that. So a colleague of mine brought people to the lab who are addicted smokers  and she had them go to sleep. And during the sleep  she sprayed the smell of cigarettes into their nose. And right after  she sprayed the smell of rotten eggs into their nose  making their brain think they don't like smoking. And then she wakes them up. They have no idea what happened  but somehow their brain creates this feeling. So when they leave the lab  for a few days after  they feel less of an urge to smoke. And then we said  let's see if we can do the same thing with people whose awake realities haunt them when they are awake and when they're sleeping  like Nicholas. He was discharged from the Army after his service in Iraq because he has post traumatic stress. His awake reality bothers him  and he is unable to solve it. So we got him into the lab and had him to go sleep for several nights. And every night  we paired the sounds that trigger the traumas in his brain when he is awake  and immediately after  sprayed positive smells to create some changes in his brain. So we slowly  overnight  used the fact that our brains and our memories are not fixed. They're malleable. They change as we use them. So we make his brain remember something and override it  remember  and override it in his dream. And then when he wakes up  he again has no idea what happened  but suddenly he feels less of this anxiety when he is up. And this has been going on for a few months now with Nicholas. So we are pretty excited about that  and now we're trying to see if there is a way to help other people in the same way by working with them when they are awake in one way and with the same brain when they are asleep. And we are thinking about other ways to enhance experiences using the opportunity that your dream provides. For example  what if we can teach you things when you are asleep  So you go to sleep and you wake up knowing kung fu. Or two people sleep side by side  and we can share dreams simultaneously. Or just help you navigate your dream to a specific location. A lot of things in our life are owed to dreams. The periodic table. Hitchcock's movies. What if we can help you focus your dreams on something specific  Or  I know there are a lot of engineers here. What if I can build a device that helps guarantee a positive sleep for everyone  We are not there yet. But if there is one thing I learned from the last five years  it is that saying that something is impossible before you know it is a mistake. Because science isn't just about collecting facts  it's also about enabling promises  hunches and even dreams. Neuroscientists are now giving us a new tool to control our dreams  a new platform to create experiences on  a new canvas that flickers to life when we fall asleep. So designers  perfumers  musicians  filmmakers can now use this to create new experiences. Because in the end  we are now able to  for the first time  help people change behavior and understand ourselves better by essentially teaching ourselves to dream bigger.

343,688,690,Murray Gell-Mann 2007,Murray Gell-Mann,male,"Beauty, truth and ... physics?",Dec 2007,894,Thank you for putting up these pictures of my colleagues over here. Now  I'm going try an experiment. I don't do experiments  normally. I'm a theorist. But I'm going see what happens if I press this button. Sure enough. OK. I used to work in this field of elementary particles. What happens to matter if you chop it up very fine  What is it made of  And the laws of these particles are valid throughout the universe  and they're very much connected with the history of the universe. We know a lot about four forces. There must be a lot more  but those are at very  very small distances  and we haven't really interacted with them very much yet. The main thing I want to talk about is this  that we have this remarkable experience in this field of fundamental physics that beauty is a very successful criterion for choosing the right theory. And why on earth could that be so  Well  here's an example from my own experience. It's fairly dramatic  actually  to have this happen. Three or four of us  in       put forward a partially complete theory of one of these forces  this weak force. And it was in disagreement with seven    seven  count them  seven experiments. Experiments were all wrong. And we published before knowing that  because we figured it was so beautiful  it's gotta be right  The experiments had to be wrong  and they were. Now our friend over there  Albert Einstein  used to pay very little attention when people said   You know  there's a man with an experiment that seems to disagree with special relativity. DC Miller. What about that   And he would say   Aw  that'll go away.   Laughter  Now  why does stuff like that work  That's the question. Now  yeah  what do we mean by beautiful  That's one thing. I'll try to make that clear    partially clear. Why should it work  and is this something to do with human beings  I'll let you in on the answer to the last one that I offer  and that is  it has nothing to do with human beings. Somewhere in some other planet  orbiting some very distant star  maybe in a another galaxy  there could well be entities that are at least as intelligent as we are  and are interested in science. It's not impossible  I think there probably are lots. Very likely  none is close enough to interact with us. But they could be out there  very easily. And suppose they have  you know  very different sensory apparatus  and so on. They have seven tentacles  and they have    little funny looking compound eyes  and a brain shaped like a pretzel. Would they really have different laws  There are lots of people who believe that  and I think it is utter baloney. I think there are laws out there  and we of course don't understand them at any given time very well    but we try. And we try to get closer and closer. And someday  we may actually figure out the fundamental unified theory of the particles and forces  what I call the  fundamental law.  We may not even be terribly far from it. But even if we don't run across it in our lifetimes  we can still think there is one out there  and we're just trying to get closer and closer to it. I think that's the main point to be made. We express these things mathematically. And when the mathematics is very simple    when in terms of some mathematical notation  you can write the theory in a very brief space  without a lot of complication    that's essentially what we mean by beauty or elegance. Here's what I was saying about the laws. They're really there. Newton certainly believed that. And he said  here   It is the business of natural philosophy to find out those laws.  The basic law  let's say    here's an assumption. The assumption is that the basic law really takes the form of a unified theory of all the particles. Now  some people call that a theory of everything. That's wrong because the theory is quantum mechanical. And I won't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it's like  and so on. You've heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway.  Laughter  There are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff. But the main thing here is that it predicts probabilities. Now  sometimes those probabilities are near certainties. And in a lot of familiar cases  they of course are. But other times they're not  and you have only probabilities for different outcomes. So what that means is that the history of the universe is not determined just by the fundamental law. It's the fundamental law and this incredibly long series of accidents  or chance outcomes  that are there in addition. And the fundamental theory doesn't include those chance outcomes  they are in addition. So it's not a theory of everything. And in fact  a huge amount of the information in the universe around us comes from those accidents  and not just from the fundamental laws. Now  it's often said that getting closer and closer to the fundamental laws by examining phenomena at low energies  and then higher energies  and then higher energies  or short distances  and then shorter distances  and then still shorter distances  and so on  is like peeling the skin of an onion. And we keep doing that  and build more powerful machines  accelerators for particles. We look deeper and deeper into the structure of particles  and in that way we get probably closer and closer to this fundamental law. Now  what happens is that as we do that  as we peel these skins of the onion  and we get closer and closer to the underlying law  we see that each skin has something in common with the previous one  and with the next one. We write them out mathematically  and we see they use very similar mathematics. They require very similar mathematics. That is absolutely remarkable  and that is a central feature of what I'm trying to say today. Newton called it    that's Newton  by the way    that one. This one is Albert Einstein. Hi  Al  And anyway  he said   nature conformable to herself     personifying nature as a female. And so what happens is that the new phenomena  the new skins  the inner skins of the slightly smaller skins of the onion that we get to  resemble the slightly larger ones. And the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin is almost the same as what we need for the next skin. And that's why the equations look so simple. Because they use mathematics we already have. A trivial example is this  Newton found the law of gravity  which goes like one over the square of the distance between the things gravitated. Coulomb  in France  found the same law for electric charges. Here's an example of this similarity. You look at gravity  you see a certain law. Then you look at electricity. Sure enough. The same rule. It's a very simple example. There are lots of more sophisticated examples. Symmetry is very important in this discussion. You know what it means. A circle  for example  is symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle. You rotate around the center of the circle  the circle remains unchanged. You take a sphere  in three dimensions  you rotate around the center of the sphere  and all those rotations leave the sphere alone. They are symmetries of the sphere. So we say  in general  that there's a symmetry under certain operations if those operations leave the phenomenon  or its description  unchanged. Maxwell's equations are of course symmetrical under rotations of all of space. Doesn't matter if we turn the whole of space around by some angle  it doesn't leave the    doesn't change the phenomenon of electricity or magnetism. There's a new notation in the   th century that expressed this  and if you use that notation  the equations get a lot simpler. Then Einstein  with his special theory of relativity  looked at a whole set of symmetries of Maxwell's equations  which are called special relativity. And those symmetries  then  make the equations even shorter  and even prettier  therefore. Let's look. You don't have to know what these things mean  doesn't make any difference. But you can just look at the form.  Laughter  You can look at the form. You see above  at the top  a long list of equations with three components for the three directions of space  x  y and z. Then  using vector analysis  you use rotational symmetry  and you get this next set. Then you use the symmetry of special relativity and you get an even simpler set down here  showing that symmetry exhibits better and better. The more and more symmetry you have  the better you exhibit the simplicity and elegance of the theory. The last two  the first equation says that electric charges and currents give rise to all the electric and magnetic fields. The next    second    equation says that there is no magnetism other than that. The only magnetism comes from electric charges and currents. Someday we may find some slight hole in that argument. But for the moment  that's the case. Now  here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of. They should have heard of it  but it's a little tricky to explain in technical detail  so I won't do it. I'll just mention it.  Laughter  But Chen Ning Yang  called by us  Frank  Yang     Laughter     and Bob Mills put forward     years ago  this generalization of Maxwell's equations  with a new symmetry. A whole new symmetry. Mathematics very similar  but there was a whole new symmetry. They hoped that this would contribute somehow to particle physics    didn't. It didn't  by itself  contribute to particle physics. But then some of us generalized it further. And then it did  And it gave a very beautiful description of the strong force and of the weak force. So here we say  again  what we said before  that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins. So the mathematics for the adjoining skins is very similar to what we need for the new one. And therefore it looks beautiful because we already know how to write it in a lovely  concise way. So here are the themes. We believe there is a unified theory underlying all the regularities. Steps toward unification exhibit the simplicity. Symmetry exhibits the simplicity. And then there is self similarity across the scales    in other words  from one skin of the onion to another one. Proximate self similarity. And that accounts for this phenomenon. That will account for why beauty is a successful criterion for selecting the right theory. Here's what Newton himself said   Nature is very consonant and conformable to her self.  One thing he was thinking of is something that most of us take for granted today  but in his day it wasn't taken for granted. There's the story  which is not absolutely certain to be right  but a lot of people told it. Four sources told it. That when they had the plague in Cambridge  and he went down to his mother's farm    because the university was closed    he saw an apple fall from a tree  or on his head or something. And he realized suddenly that the force that drew the apple down to the earth could be the same as the force regulating the motions of the planets and the moon. That was a big unification for those days  although today we take it for granted. It's the same theory of gravity. So he said that this principle of nature  consonance   This principle of nature being very remote from the conceptions of philosophers  I forbore to describe it in that book  lest I should be accounted an extravagant freak ...   That's what we all have to watch out for   Laughter  especially at this meeting.   ... and so prejudice my readers against all those things which were the main design of the book.  Now  who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind  That the force that causes the apple to fall to the ground is the same force that causes the planets and the moon to move around  and so on  Everybody knows that. It's a property of gravitation. It's not something in the human mind. The human mind can  of course  appreciate it and enjoy it  use it  but it's not    it doesn't stem from the human mind. It stems from the character of gravity. And that's true of all the things we're talking about. They are properties of the fundamental law. The fundamental law is such that the different skins of the onion resemble one another  and therefore the math for one skin allows you to express beautifully and simply the phenomenon of the next skin. I say here that Newton did a lot of things that year  gravity  the laws of motion  the calculus  white light composed of all the colors of the rainbow. And he could have written quite an essay on  What I Did Over My Summer Vacation.  So we don't have to assume these principles as separate metaphysical postulates. They follow from the fundamental theory. They are what we call emergent properties. You don't need    you don't need something more to get something more. That's what emergence means. Life can emerge from physics and chemistry  plus a lot of accidents. The human mind can arise from neurobiology and a lot of accidents  the way the chemical bond arises from physics and certain accidents. It doesn't diminish the importance of these subjects to know that they follow from more fundamental things  plus accidents. That's a general rule  and it's critically important to realize that. You don't need something more in order to get something more. People keep asking that when they read my book   The Quark and the Jaguar   and they say   Isn't there something more beyond what you have there   Presumably  they mean something supernatural. Anyway  there isn't.  Laughter  You don't need something more to explain something more. Thank you very much.  Applause ,Physicist,200712,6.074778947368416
349,1243,1245,Nathan Myhrvold 2008,Nathan Myhrvold,male,"Archeology, animal photography, BBQ ...",Jun 2008,1025,So  I'm in Chile  in the Atacama desert  sitting in a hotel lobby  because that's the only place that I can get a Wi Fi connection  and I have this picture up on my screen  and a woman comes up behind me. She says   Oh  that's beautiful. What is it  Is that Jackson Pollock   And unfortunately  I can be a little too honest. I said   No  it's    it's penguin shit.  And  you know   Excuse me   And I could sense that she thought I was speaking synecdochically. So  I said   No  no  really    it's penguin shit.  Because I had just been in the Falkland Islands taking pictures of penguins. This is a Gentoo penguin. And she was still skeptical. So  literally  a few minutes before that  I downloaded this scientific paper about calculations on avian defecation  which is really quite interesting  because it turns out you can model this as something called  Poiseuille flow   and you can learn an awful lot about the physics of the avian rectum. Actually  technically  it's not a rectum. It's called a cloaca. At this point  she stops me  and she says   Who are you  Wha    what do you do   And I was stuck  because I didn't have any way to describe what I do. And so  in some sense  this talk today is my answer to that. It's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that I do. And it's very hard for me to make sense of it  so I'm not sure that you can. It's the kind of thing that I sit up late at night thinking about sometimes    often at four in the morning. So  some people are afraid of what I do. Some people think I am the nerd Tony Soprano  and in response  I have ordered a bulletproof pocket protector. I'm not sure what these people think  because I don't speak Norsk. But I'm not thinking  monsteret  is a good thing. I don't know  you know  So  one of the things that I love to do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites. Because archaeology gives us an opportunity to study past civilizations  and see where they succeeded and where they failed. Use science to  you know  work backwards and say   Well  really  what were they thinking   And recently  I was in Easter Island  which is an incredibly beautiful place  and an incredibly mysterious place  because no matter where you go in Easter Island  you're struck by these statues  called the moai. The place is    square miles. They made  so far as we can tell      of them. Why on Earth  And if you haven't read Jared Diamond's book   Collapse   I totally recommend that you do. He's got a great chapter about it. Basically  these people committed ecological suicide in order to make more of these. And somewhere along the line  somebody said   I know  Let's cut down the last tree and commit suicide  because we need more identical statues.  And  one thing that isn't a mystery  actually  was when I grew up    because when I was a little kid  I'd seen these pictures    and I thought   Well  why that look on the face  Why that brow   I mean  it's such a powerful thing. Where did they get that inspiration  And then I met Yoyo  who is the native Rapa Nui an guide  and if you look at Yoyo's face  you kind of figure out where they got it. There's many mysteries  these statues. Everyone wants to know  how did they make them  how did they transport them  This woman in the foreground is Jo Anne Van Tilberg. She's the leading archaeologist working Easter Island today. And she has studied the statues for    some years  and she has detailed records of every single statue. The one on the page here is the same that's up there. One interesting problem is the stone isn't very hard. So  this used to be completely smooth. In fact  in many of the statues  when you excavate them  the backs are totally smooth    almost glass smooth. But after       years out in the weather  they look like this. Jo Anne and I have just embarked on a project to digitize them all  and we're going to do a very high res digitization  first because it's a way of preserving them. Second  we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically  then  learn a few of the mysteries about them. How long have they been standing in what positions  And maybe  indirectly  get at some of the issues of what caused them to be the way they are. While I was in Easter Island  comet McNaught was there also  so you get a gratuitous picture of a moai with a comet. I also have an archaeological project going on in Egypt.  Going on  is perhaps a little bit strong. We're trying to get all of the permissions to get everything all set  to get it going. So  I'll talk about it at a future TED. But there's some amazing opportunities in Egypt as well. Another thing I do is I invent stuff. In fact  I design nuclear reactors. Not a joke. This is the conventional nuclear fuel cycle. The red line is what is done in most nuclear reactors. It's called the open fuel cycle. The white lines are what's called an advance fuel cycle  where you reprocess. Now  this is the normal way it's done. It's got the huge advantage that it does not create carbon pollution. It has a lot of disadvantages  each one of these steps is extremely expensive  it's potentially dangerous and they have the interesting property that the step cannot be performed in anyone's backyard  which is a problem. So  our reactor eliminates these steps  which  if we can actually make it work  is a really cool thing. Now  it's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor. There's    no reactor's been even built to an old design  much less a new one  in the United States for    years. It's the kind of very high risk  but potentially very high return thing that we do. Changing into a totally different field  we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics  particularly in an area called metamaterials. A metamaterial is an artificial material  which manipulates  in this case  electromagnetic radiation  in a way that you couldn't otherwise. So  this device here is an invisibility cloak. It may not seem that  but if you were a microwave  this is how you would view it. Rays of light    in this case  microwave light    come in  and they just squish around the cell  and they come back the other side. Now  you could do that with mirrors from one angle. The cool thing is  this does it from all angles. Metamaterials  unfortunately    A  it only works on microwave  and B  it doesn't work all that well yet. But metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field. It's    you know  today I'd like to say it's a zero billion dollar business  but  in fact  it's negative. But some day  some day  maybe it's going to work. We do a lot of work in biomedical fields. In this case  we're working with a major medical foundation to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing diseases in developing countries. So  they say the eyes are the windows of the soul    turns out they're a window to a whole lot more stuff. And these happen to be my eyes  by the way. Now  I'm also very interested in cooking. While I was at Microsoft  I took a leave of absence and went to a chef school in France. I used to work  also while at Microsoft  at a leading restaurant in Seattle  so I do a lot of cooking. I've been on a team that won the world championship of barbecue. But barbecue's interesting  because it's one of these cult foods like chili  or bouillabaisse. Various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to    there's tremendous traditions  there's secrecy. And I'm trying to use a very scientific approach. So  this is my latest cooker  and if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor  that's because it is. But if you get to play with all those knobs and dials    and of course  really the controller over there does it all on software    you can make some terrific ribs. This is a high speed centrifuge. You should all have one in your kitchen  beside your Turbochef. This subjects food to a force about        times that of normal gravity  and oh boy  does it clarify chicken stock. You would not believe it  I perform a series of ghoulish experiments on food    in this case  trying to calibrate a mathematical model so that one can predict exactly what the internal cooking times are. It turns out  A  it's useful  and for a geek like me  it's fun. Theory is red  black is experiment. So  I'm either really good at faking it  or this particular model seems to work. So  another random thing I do is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence  or SETI. And you may be familiar with the movie  Contact   which sort of popularized that. It turns out there are real people who go out and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way. In fact  almost everybody in the movie is based on a real character  a real person. So  the Jodie Foster character here is actually this woman  Jill Tarter  and Jill has dedicated her life to this. You know  a lot of people risk their lives in a brief act of heroism  which is kind of cool  but Jill has what I call slow heroism. She is risking her professional life on something that her own calculations show may not work for a thousand years    may not ever. So  I like to support people that are risking their lives. After the movie came out  of course  there was a lot of interest in SETI. My kids saw the movie  and afterwards they came to me and they said   So  Dad  so    so    that character    that's Jill  right   I said   Oh  yeah  yeah    absolutely.   And that other person  that's someone      I said   Yes.  They said   Well  you know that creepy rich guy in the movie  Is that you   I said   Well  you know  it's just a movie  Come on.  So  the SETI Institute  with a little bit of help from me  and a lot of help from Paul Allen and a variety of other people  is building a dedicated radio telescope in Hat Creek  California  so they can do this SETI work. Now  I travel a lot  and I change cell phones a lot  and the one person who always gets updated on all my cell phones and pagers and everything else is Jill  because I really don't want to miss  the call.  I mean  can you imagine  E.T.'s phoning home  and I'm not  like  there  You know  horrible  So  I do a lot of work on dinosaurs. I'm known to TEDsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs. And I resemble that remark. I'm going to talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs  which is the finding of them. Now  to find dinosaurs  you hike around in horrible conditions looking for a dinosaur. It sounds really dumb  but that's what it is. It's horrible conditions  because wherever you have nice weather  plants grow  and you don't get any erosion  and you don't see any dinosaurs. So  you always find dinosaurs in deserts or badlands  areas that have very little plant growth and have flash floods in the spring. You know  skiers pray for snow  Paleontologists pray for erosion. So  you hike around and    this is after you dig them up  they look like this. You hike around  you see something like this. Now  this is something I found  so look at it very closely here. You've got this bentonite clay  which is    sort of swells up and expands. And there's some stuff poking out. So  you look at that  and you look up close  and you say   Well  gee  that's kind of interesting. What are all of these pieces   Well  if you look closely  you can recognize  actually  from the shape  that these are skull fragments. And then when you look at this  you say   That's a tooth. It's a big tooth.  It's about the size of a banana. It has a big serration on the edge. This is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground. And this is what it's like to find a Tyrannosaurus rex  which I was lucky enough to do a few years ago. Now  this is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room. Not the same one  actually. This is a cast  which I had bought  and then  after buying the cast  I found my own  and I don't have room for two. You know. So  the thing that's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs is that it is both an intellectual thing  because you're trying to reconstruct the environment of millions of years ago. It's something that can inform all sorts of science in unexpected ways. The study of dinosaurs led to the realization that there's a problem with asteroid impact  for example. The study of dinosaurs may  literally  one day save the planet. Study of the ancient climate is very important. In fact  the Mesozoic  when dinosaurs lived  had much higher CO  than today  was much warmer than today  and is one of the interesting proof points for the effects of CO  on climate. But  besides being intellectually and scientifically interesting  it's also very different than the other things I do  because you get to hike around in the badlands. This is actually what most dinosaur research looks like. This is one of my papers   A pygostyle from a non avian theropod.  It's not as gripping as dinosaur sex  so we're not going to go into it further. Now  I'm also really big on photography. I travel all over the world taking pictures    some of them good  most of them not. These days  bits are cheap. Unfortunately  that means you've got to spend more time sorting through them. Here's a picture I took in the Falkland Islands of king penguins on a beach. Here's a picture I took in Alaska  a few years ago  of Orcas. I'd gone up to photograph Orcas  and we had looked for a week  and we hadn't seen a damn Orca. And the last day  the sun comes out  the Orcas come  they're right by the boat. It's fantastic. And I get lots of pictures like this. Then  a little bit later  I start getting some pictures like this. Now  to a human audience  I need to explain that if Penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition  this would be the centerfold. It's true. So  there's more and more activity near the boat  and all of a sudden somebody shouts   What's that in the water   I said   Well  I think that's what you call a free willy.  There's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex. The first thing you learn is the overwhelming importance of hands. They don't have them. I think Paul Simon is in the audience  and he has    he may not realize it  but he wrote a song all about whale sex   Slip Slidin' Away.  That's kind of what it's like. The other interesting thing that I learned about whale sex  they curl their toes too. So    where do you go putting all of these disparate pieces together  You know  there's a tremendous amount of wisdom in finding a great thing  passion in life  and focusing all your energy on it  and I've never been able to do that. I just    you know  because  yes  I'll focus passion on something  but then there will be something else  and then there's something else again. And for a long time I fought this  and I thought   Well  gee  I really ought to buckle down.  And you know  when I was at Microsoft  that was so engrossing  and the whole industry was expanding so much  that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life. But ultimately  I decided that what I really ought to do is not fight being who I am  but embrace it. And say   Yeah  you know  I    this whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep  but that's really what works for me.  And regardless of whether it's nuclear reactors or metamaterials or whale sex  the common    or lowest common denominator    is me. That's it  thank you.,Polymath,200806,6.073611987381697
350,1998,2000,Nathan Myhrvold 2011,Nathan Myhrvold,male,Cooking as never seen before,Jul 2011,591,So I'm going to tell you a little bit about reimagining food. I've been interested in food for a long time. I taught myself to cook with a bunch of big books like this. I went to chef school in France. And there is a way the world both envisions food  the way the world writes about food and learns about food. And it's largely what you would find in these books. And it's a wonderful thing. But there's some things that have been going on since this idea of food was established. In the last    years  people have realized that science has a tremendous amount to do with food. In fact  understanding why cooking works requires knowing the science of cooking    some of the chemistry  some of the physics and so forth. But that's not in any of those books. There's also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed  some about new aesthetics  new approaches to food. There's a chef in Spain named Ferran Adria. He's developed a very avant garde cuisine. A guy in England called Heston Blumenthal  he's developed his avant garde cuisine. None of the techniques that these people have developed over the course of the last    years is in any of those books. None of them are taught in cooking schools. In order to learn them  you have to go work in those restaurants. And finally  there's the old way of viewing food is the old way. And so a few years ago    fours years ago  actually    I set out to say  is there a way we can communicate science and technique and wonder  Is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before  So we tried  and I'll show you what we came up with. This is a picture called a cutaway. This is actually the first picture I took in the book. The idea here is to explain what happens when you steam broccoli. And this magic view allows you to see all of what's happening while the broccoli steams. Then each of the different little pieces around it explain some fact. And the hope was two fold. One is you can actually explain what happens when you steam broccoli. But the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people into stuff that was a little more technical  maybe a little bit more scientific  maybe a little bit more chef y than they otherwise would have. Because with that beautiful photo  maybe I can also package this little box here that talks about how steaming and boiling actually take different amounts of time. Steaming ought to be faster. It turns out it isn't because of something called film condensation  and this explains that. Well  that first cutaway picture worked  so we said   Okay  let's do some more.  So here's another one. We discovered why woks are the shape they are. This shaped wok doesn't work very well  this caught fire three times. But we had a philosophy  which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second. And one of our canning cutaways. Once you start cutting things in half  you kind of get carried away  so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan. And each of these text blocks explains a key thing that's going on. In this case  boiling water canning is for canning things that are already pretty acidic. You don't have to heat them up as hot as you would something you do pressure canning because bacterial spores can't grow in the acid. So this is great for pickled vegetables  which is what we're canning here. Here's our hamburger cutaway. One of our philosophies in the book is that no dish is really intrinsically any better than any other dish. So you can lavish all the same care  all the same technique  on a hamburger as you would on some much more fancy dish. And if you do lavish as much technique as possible  and you try to make the highest quality hamburger  it gets to be a little bit involved. The New York Times ran a piece after my book was delayed and it was called  The Wait for the    Hour Hamburger Just Got Longer.  Because our hamburger recipe  our ultimate hamburger recipe  if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff  it does take about    hours. Of course  you're not actually working the whole time. Most of the time is kind of sitting there. The point of this cutaway is to show people a view of hamburgers they haven't seen before and to explain the physics of hamburgers and the chemistry of hamburgers  because  believe it or not  there is something to the physics and chemistry    in particular  those flames underneath the burger. Most of the characteristic char grilled taste doesn't come from the wood or the charcoal. Buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference. Mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing  or burning. So it's the fat that drips down and flares up that causes the characteristic taste. Now you might wonder  how do we make these cutaways  Most people assume we use Photoshop. And the answer is  no  not really  we use a machine shop. And it turns out  the best way to cut things in half is to actually cut them in half. So we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world. We cut a        restaurant oven in half. The manufacturer said   What would it take for you to cut one in half   I said   It would have to show up free.  And so it showed up  we used it a little while  we cut it in half. Now you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots. We would glue a piece of Pyrex or heat resistant glass in front. We used a red  very high temperature silicon to do that. The great thing is  when you cut something in half  you have another half. So you photograph that in exactly the same position  and then you can substitute in    and that part does use Photoshop    just the edges. So it's very much like in a Hollywood movie where a guy flies through the air  supported by wires  and then they take the wires away digitally so you're flying through the air. In most cases  though  there was no glass. Like for the hamburger  we just cut the damn barbecue. And so those coals that kept falling off the edge  we kept having to put them back up. But again  it only has to work for a thousandth of a second. The wok shot caught fire three times. What happens when you have your wok cut in half is the oil goes down into the fire and whoosh  One of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way. But hey  they grow back. In addition to cutaways  we also explain physics. This is Fourier's law of heat conduction. It's a partial differential equation. We have the only cookbook in the world that has partial differential equations in it. But to make them palatable  we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire and photographed it like this. We've got lots of little tidbits in the book. Everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage  right  But you probably don't know that much about James Watt. But now you will  we put a biography of James Watt in. It's a little couple paragraphs to explain why we call that unit of heat the watt  and where he got his inspiration. It turned out he was hired by a Scottish distillery to understand why they were burning so damn much peat to distill the whiskey. We also did a lot of calculation. I personally wrote thousands of lines of code to write this cookbook. Here's a calculation that shows how the intensity of a barbecue  or other radiant heat source  goes as you move away from it. So as you move vertically away from this surface  the heat falls off. As you move side to side  it moves off. That horn shaped region is what we call the sweet spot. That's the place where the heat is even to within    percent. So that's the place where you really want to cook. And it's got this funny horn shaped thing  which as far as I know  again  the first cookbook to ever do this. Now it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it. You know  there's two ways you can make a product. You can do lots of market research and do focus groups and figure out what people really want  or you can just kind of go for it and make the book you want and hope other people like it. Here's a step by step that shows grinding hamburger. If you really want great hamburger  it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain. And it's really simple  as you can see here. As it comes out of the grinder  you just have a little tray  and you just take it off in little passes  build it up  slice it vertically. Here's the final hamburger. This is the    hour hamburger. We make every aspect of this burger. The lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it. We also have things about how to make the bun. There's a mushroom  ketchup    it goes on and on. Now watch closely. This is popcorn. I'll explain it here. The popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics. Isn't that beautiful  We have a very high speed camera  which we had lots of fun with on the book. The key physics principle here is when water boils to steam it expands by a factor of      . That's what's happening to the water inside that popcorn. So it's a great illustration of that. Now I'm going to close with a video that is kind of unusual. We have a chapter on gels. And because people watch Mythbusters and CSI  I thought  well  let's put in a recipe for a ballistics gelatin. Well  if you have a high speed camera  and you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around  pretty soon somebody does this. Now the amazing thing here is that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic what happens to human flesh when you get shot    that's why you shouldn't get shot. The other amazing thing is  when this ballistics gelatin comes down  it falls back down as a nice block. Anyway  here's the book. Here it is.       pages. And they're nice big pages too. A friend of mine complained that this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen  so there's a sixth volume that has washable  waterproof paper.,Polymath,201107,6.054794188861983
351,168,170,Nathan Wolfe 2012,Nathan Wolfe,male,What's left to explore?,May 2012,413,Recently I visited Beloit  Wisconsin. And I was there to honor a great   th century explorer  Roy Chapman Andrews. During his time at the American Museum of Natural History  Andrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions  like here in the Gobi Desert. He was quite a figure. He was later  it's said  the basis of the Indiana Jones character. And when I was in Beloit  Wisconsin  I gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students. And I'm here to tell you  if there's anything more intimidating than talking here at TED  it'll be trying to hold the attention of a group of a thousand    year olds for a    minute lecture. Don't try that one. At the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions  but there was one that's really stuck with me since then. There was a young girl who stood up  and she asked the question   Where should we explore   I think there's a sense that many of us have that the great age of exploration on Earth is over  that for the next generation they're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans in order to find something significant to explore. But is that really the case  Is there really nowhere significant for us to explore left here on Earth  It sort of made me think back to one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology. This is an explorer of the unseen world  Martinus Beijerinck. So Beijerinck set out to discover the cause of tobacco mosaic disease. What he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters. And he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known    bacteria  at the time. He came up with a name for his mystery agent. He called it the virus    Latin for  poison.  And in uncovering viruses  Beijerinck really opened this entirely new world for us. We now know that viruses make up the majority of the genetic information on our planet  more than the genetic information of all other forms of life combined. And obviously there's been tremendous practical applications associated with this world    things like the eradication of smallpox  the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer  which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus. And Beijerinck's discovery  this was not something that occurred     years ago. It was a little over     years ago that Beijerinck discovered viruses. So basically we had automobiles  but we were unaware of the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet. We now have these amazing tools to allow us to explore the unseen world    things like deep sequencing  which allow us to do much more than just skim the surface and look at individual genomes from a particular species  but to look at entire metagenomes  the communities of teeming microorganisms in  on and around us and to document all of the genetic information in these species. We can apply these techniques to things from soil to skin and everything in between. In my organization we now do this on a regular basis to identify the causes of outbreaks that are unclear exactly what causes them. And just to give you a sense of how this works  imagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you. And this is something we commonly do to look for respiratory viruses like influenza. The first thing we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information. And if we started looking into that genetic information  we'd see a number of usual suspects out there    of course  a lot of human genetic information  but also bacterial and viral information  mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose. But we'd also see something very  very surprising. As we started to look at this information  we would see that about    percent of the genetic information in your nose doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before    no plant  animal  fungus  virus or bacteria. Basically we have no clue what this is. And for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data  a few of us have actually begun to call this information biological dark matter. We know it's not anything that we've seen before  it's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent right within our own genetic information. And there's a lot of it. If you think    percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot of biological dark matter  if we looked at your gut  up to    or    percent of that information is biological dark matter. And even in the relatively sterile blood  around one to two percent of this information is dark matter    can't be classified  can't be typed or matched with anything we've seen before. At first we thought that perhaps this was artifact. These deep sequencing tools are relatively new. But as they become more and more accurate  we've determined that this information is a form of life  or at least some of it is a form of life. And while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter are really only in their infancy  there's a very  very exciting possibility that exists  that buried in this life  in this genetic information  are signatures of as of yet unidentified life. That as we explore these strings of A's  T's  C's and G's  we may uncover a completely new class of life that  like Beijerinck  will fundamentally change the way that we think about the nature of biology. That perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us or identify the source of an outbreak that we aren't familiar with or perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology. I'm pleased to announce that  along with colleagues at Stanford and Caltech and UCSF  we're currently starting an initiative to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life. A little over a hundred years ago  people were unaware of viruses  the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet. A hundred years from now  people may marvel that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life that literally was right under our noses. It's true  we may have charted all the continents on the planet and we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there  but that doesn't mean that there's nothing left to explore on Earth. Beijerinck and his kind provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers    people like that young girl from Beloit  Wisconsin. And I think if we phrase that lesson  it's something like this  Don't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story. Go after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore. There are unknowns all around us and they're just waiting to be discovered. Thank you.,Virus hunter,201205,6.078224637681161
352,1429,1431,Nathan Wolfe 2009,Nathan Wolfe,male,The jungle search for viruses,Mar 2009,717,When most people think about the beginnings of AIDS  they're gonna think back to the     s. And certainly  this was the decade in which we discovered AIDS and the virus that causes it  HIV. But in fact this virus crossed over into humans many decades before  from chimpanzees  where the virus originated  into humans who hunt these apes. This photo was taken before the Great Depression in Brazzaville  Congo. At this time  there were thousands of individuals  we think  that were infected with HIV. So I have a couple of really important questions for you. If this virus was in thousands of individuals at this point  why was it the case that it took us until      to be able to discover this virus  OK now  more importantly  had we been there in the '  s and '  s  '  s  had we seen this disease  had we understood exactly what was going on with it  how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved  In fact  this is not unique to HIV. The vast majority of viruses come from animals. And you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubbling up of viruses from animals into human populations. But only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human. Nevertheless  we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid  trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings  that are going to be very very difficult to address    as we've seen in the case of HIV. So during the last    years  I've been working to actually study the earlier interface here    what I've labeled  viral chatter   which was a term coined by my mentor Don Burke. This is the idea that we can study the sort of pinging of these viruses into human populations  the movement of these agents over into humans  and by capturing this moment  we might be able to move to a situation where we can catch them early. OK  so this is a picture  and I'm going to show you some pictures now from the field. This is a picture of a central African hunter. It's actually a fairly common picture. One of the things I want you to note from it is blood    that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact. This was absolutely key for us. This is a very intimate form of connection. So if we're going to study viral chatter  we need to get to these populations who have intensive contact with wild animals. And so we've been studying people like this individual. We collect blood from them  other specimens. We look at the diseases  which are in the animals as well as the humans. And ideally  this is going to allow us to catch these things early on  as they're moving over into human populations. And the basic objective of this work is not to just go out once and look at these individuals  but to establish thousands of individuals in these populations that we would monitor continuously on a regular basis. When they were sick  we would collect specimens from them. We would actually enlist them    which we've done now    to collect specimens from animals. We give them these little pieces of filter paper. When they sample from animals  they collect the blood on the filter paper and this allows us to identify yet unknown viruses from exactly the right animals    the ones that are actually being hunted. two hunters stalk their prey. Their names are Patrice and Patee. They're searching for bush meat  forest animals they can kill to feed their families. Patrice and Patee set out most days to go out hunting in the forest around their homes. They have a series of traps  of snares that they've set up to catch wild pigs  snakes  monkeys  rodents    anything they can  really. Patrice and Patee have been out for hours but found nothing. The animals are simply gone. We stop for a drink of water. Then there is a rustle in the brush. A group of hunters approach  their packs loaded with wild game. There's at least three viruses that you know about  which are in this particular monkey. Nathan Wolfe  This species  yeah. And there's many many more pathogens that are present in these animals. These individuals are at specific risk  particularly if there's blood contact  they're at risk for transmission and possibly infection with novel viruses. Narrator  As the hunters display their kills  something surprising happens. They show us filter paper they've used to collect the animals' blood. The blood will be tested for zoonotic viruses  part of a program Dr. Wolfe has spent years setting up. NW  So this is from this animal right here  Greater Spot Nosed Guenon. Every person who has one of those filter papers has at least  at a minimum  been through our basic health education about the risks associated with these activities  which presumably  from our perspective  gives them the ability to decrease their own risk  and then obviously the risk to their families  the village  the country  and the world. NW  OK  before I continue  I think it's important to take just a moment to talk about bush meat. Bush meat is the hunting of wild game. OK  And you can consider all sorts of different bush meat. I'm going to be talking about this. When your children and grandchildren sort of pose questions to you about this period of time  one of the things they're gonna ask you  is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives  some of the most valuable and endangered species on our planet  to go extinct because we weren't able to address some of the issues of poverty in these parts of the world. But in fact that's not the only question they're going to ask you about this. They're also going to ask you the question that when we knew that this was the way that HIV entered into the human population  and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this  why did we let these behaviors continue  Why did we not find some other solution to this  They're going to say  in regions of profound instability throughout the world  where you have intense poverty  where populations are growing and you don't have sustainable resources like this  this is going to lead to food insecurity. But they're also going to ask you probably a different question. It's one that I think we all need to ask ourselves  which is  why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here. Now this is the individual    you can see just right up over his right shoulder    this is the individual that hunted the monkey from the last picture that I showed you. OK  take a look at his shirt. You know  take a look at his face. Bush meat is one of the central crises  which is occurring in our population right now  in humanity  on this planet. But it can't be the fault of somebody like this. OK  And solving it cannot be his responsibility alone. There's no easy solutions  but what I'm saying to you is that we neglect this problem at our own peril. So  in       along with my mentors Don Burke and Colonel Mpoudi Ngole  we went to actually start this work in Central Africa  to work with hunters in this part of the world. And my job    at that time I was a post doctoral fellow  and I was really tasked with setting this up. So I said to myself   OK  great    we're gonna collect all kinds of specimens. We're gonna go to all these different locations. It's going to be wonderful.  You know  I looked at the map  I picked out    sites  I figured  no problem. Needless to say  I was drastically wrong. This is challenging work to do. Fortunately  I had and continue to have an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team  and that's the only way that this work can really occur. We have a whole range of challenges about this work. One of them is just obtaining trust from individuals that we work with in the field. The person you see on the right hand side is Paul DeLong Minutu. He's one of the best communicators that I've really ever dealt with. When I arrived I didn't speak a word of French  and I still seemed to understand what it was he was saying. Paul worked for years on the Cameroonian national radio and television  and he spoke about health issues. He was a health correspondent. So we figured we'd hire this person    when we got there he could be a great communicator. When we would get to these rural villages  though  what we found out is that no one had television  so they wouldn't recognize his face. But    when he began to speak they would actually recognize his voice from the radio. And this was somebody who had incredible potential to spread aspects of our message  whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation or health prevention. Often we run into obstacles. This is us coming back from one of these very rural sites  with specimens from     individuals that we needed to get back to the lab within    hours. I like to show this shot    this is Ubald Tamoufe  who's the lead investigator in our Cameroon site. Ubald laughs at me when I show this photo because of course you can't see his face. But the reason I like to show the shot is because you can see that he's about to solve this problem. Which    which he did  which he did. Just a few quick before and after shots. This was our laboratory before. This is what it looks like now. Early on  in order to ship our specimens  we had to have dry ice. To get dry ice we had to go to the breweries    beg  borrow  steal to get these folks to give it to us. Now we have our own liquid nitrogen. I like to call our laboratory the coldest place in Central Africa    it might be. And here's a shot of me  this is the before shot of me. No comment. So what happened  So during the    years that we've been doing this work  we actually surprised ourselves. We made a number of discoveries. And what we've found is that if you look in the right place  you can actually monitor the flow of these viruses into human populations. That gave us a tremendous amount of hope. What we've found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals  including new viruses in the same group as HIV    so  brand new retroviruses. And let's face it  any new retrovirus in the human population    it's something we should be aware of. It's something we should be following. It's not something that we should be surprised by. Needless to say in the past these viruses entering into these rural communities might very well have gone extinct. That's no longer the case. Logging roads provide access to urban areas. And critically  what happens in central Africa doesn't stay in Central Africa. So  once we discovered that it was really possible that we could actually do this monitoring  we decided to move this from research  to really attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort. Through generous support and partnership scientifically with Google.org and the Skoll Foundation  we were able to start the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative and begin work in four different sites in Africa and Asia. Needless to say  different populations from different parts of the world have different sorts of contact. So it's not just hunters in Central Africa. It's also working in live animal markets    these wet markets    which is exactly the place where SARS emerged in Asia. But really  this is just the beginning from our perspective. Our objective right now  in addition to deploying to these sites and getting everything moving  is to identify new partners because we feel like this effort needs to be extended to probably    or more sites throughout the world    to viral hotspots    because really the idea here is to cast an incredibly wide net so that we can catch these things  ideally  before they make it to blood banks  sexual networks  airplanes. And that's really our objective. There was a time not very long ago when the discovery of unknown organisms was something that held incredible awe for us. It had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves  and thought about ourselves. Many people  I think  on our planet right now despair  and they think we've reached a point where we've discovered most of the things. I'm going tell you right now  please don't despair. If an intelligent extra terrestrial was taxed with writing the encyclopedia of life on our planet     out of    of these volumes would be devoted to bacteria and virus  with just a few of the volumes left for plants  fungus and animals  humans being a footnote  interesting footnote but a footnote nonetheless. This is honestly the most exciting period ever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet. The dominant things that exist here we know almost nothing about. And yet finally  we have the tools  which will allow us to actually explore that world and understand them. Thank you very much.,Virus hunter,200903,5.971219047619049

358,97,99,Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala 2007,Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala,female,Want to help Africa? Do business here,May 2007,1192,Thank you very much  Chris. Everybody who came up here said they were scared. I don't know if I'm scared  but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this. And I don't have any smart technology for you to look at. There are no slides  so you'll just have to be content with me. What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different Africa. Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa that you hear about all the time  the Africa of HIV AIDS  the Africa of malaria  the Africa of poverty  the Africa of conflict  and the Africa of disasters. While it is true that those things are going on  there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much. And sometimes I'm puzzled  and I ask myself why. This is the Africa that is changing  that Chris alluded to. This is the Africa of opportunity. This is the Africa where people want to take charge of their own futures and their own destinies. And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships to do this. That's what I want to talk about today. And I want to start by telling you a story about that change in Africa. On   th of September       Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha  a governor of one of the oil rich states of Nigeria  was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London. He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars that went into some dormant accounts that belonged to him and his family. This arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the London Metropolitan Police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria    led by one of our most able and courageous people  Mr. Nuhu Ribadu. Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London. Due to some slip ups  he managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from London back to Nigeria where  according to our constitution  those in office as governors  president    as in many countries    have immunity and cannot be prosecuted. But what happened  people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office. Today  Alams    as we call him for short    is in jail. This is a story about the fact that people in Africa are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders. This is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good  and not taken out to places where they'll benefit just a few of the elite. And therefore  when you hear about the corrupt Africa    corruption all the time    I want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries  and that some successes are emerging. Does it mean the problem is over  The answer is no. There's still a long way to go  but that there's a will there. And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight. So when you hear about corruption  don't just feel that nothing is being done about this    that you can't operate in any African country because of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case. There's a will to fight  and in many countries  that fight is ongoing and is being won. In others  like mine  where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria  the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go. But the truth of the matter is that this is going on. The results are showing  independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption  and governance is improving. A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in    African countries. And let me say just one more thing before I leave this area of governance. That is that people talk about corruption  corruption. All the time when they talk about it you immediately think about Africa. That's the image  African countries. But let me say this  if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London    if the other people who had taken money  estimated at    to    billion now of developing countries' monies sitting abroad in the developed countries    if they're able to do this  what is that  Is that not corruption  In this country  if you receive stolen goods  are you not prosecuted  So when we talk about this kind of corruption  let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the globe    where the money's going and what can be done to stop it. I'm working on an initiative now  along with the World Bank  on asset recovery  trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad    developing countries' moneys    to get that sent back. Because if we can get the    billion dollars sitting out there back  it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together. The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform. Africans  after    they're tired  we're tired of being the subject of everybody's charity and care. We are grateful  but we know that we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform. And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization that no one can do it but us. We have to do it. We can invite partners who can support us  but we have to start. We have to reform our economies  change our leadership  become more democratic  be more open to change and to information. And this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent  Nigeria. In fact  if you're not in Nigeria  you're not in Africa. I want to tell you that. One in four sub Saharan Africans is Nigerian  and it has     million dynamic people    chaotic people    but very interesting people. You'll never be bored. What we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves. And with the support of a leader who was willing  at the time  to do the reforms  we put forward a comprehensive reform program  which we developed ourselves. Not the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank  where I worked for    years and rose to be a vice president. No one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself. We put together a program that would  one  get the state out of businesses it had nothing    it had no business being in. The state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it's inefficient and incompetent. So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises. We    as a result  we decided to liberalize many of our markets. Can you believe that prior to this reform    which started at the end of       when I left Washington to go and take up the post of Finance Minister    we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop       landlines in its entire    year history  Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury. You couldn't get it. You had to bribe. You had to do everything to get your phone. When President Obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector  we went from       landlines to    million GSM lines  and counting. Nigeria's telecoms market is the second fastest growing in the world  after China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecoms. And nobody knows  except a few smart people. The smartest one  first to come in  was the MTN company of South Africa. And in the three years that I was Finance Minister  they made an average of     million dollars profit per year.     million in a market    in a country that is a poor country  with an average per capita income just under     dollars per capita. So the market is there. When they kept this under wraps  but soon others got to know. Nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies  and three or four others have come in. But there's a huge market out there  and people don't know about it  or they don't want to know. So privatization is one of the things we've done. The other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better. Because nobody's going to help you and support you if you're not managing your own finances well. And Nigeria  with the oil sector  had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well. So what did we try to do  We introduced a fiscal rule that de linked our budget from the oil price. Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in  because oil is the biggest  most revenue earning sector in the economy     percent of our revenues come from oil. We de linked that  and once we did it  we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save whatever was above that price. We didn't know we could pull it off  it was very controversial. But what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development    where  even if oil prices were high  we would grow very fast. When they crashed  we crashed. And we could hardly even pay anything  any salaries  in the economy. That smoothened out. We were able to save  just before I left     billion dollars. Whereas    and this went to our reserves    when I arrived in       we had seven billion dollars in reserves. By the time I left  we had gone up to almost    billion dollars. And as we speak now  we have about    billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances. And that shores up our economy  makes it stable. Our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have a predictability of prices in the economy. We brought inflation down from    percent to about    percent. And we had GDP grow from an average of  .  percent the previous decade to about  .  percent now. So all the changes and reforms we were able to make have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy. And what is more important  because we want to get away from oil and diversify    and there are so many opportunities in this one big country  as in many countries in Africa    what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone  but from non oil. Agriculture grew at better than eight percent. As telecoms sector grew  housing and construction  and I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macro economy straightened out  the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous. We have opportunities in agriculture  like I said. We have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in or explored. And we realized that without the proper legislation to make that possible  that wouldn't happen. So we've now got a mining code that is comparable with some of the best in the world. We have opportunities in housing and real estate. There was nothing in a country of     million people    no shopping malls as you know them here. This was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people. And now  we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected. So  huge things in construction  real estate  mortgage markets. Financial services  we had    banks. Too many not doing their real business. We consolidated them from    to    banks by requiring that they increase their capital    share capital. And it went from about    million dollars to     million dollars. The banks    these banks are now consolidated  and that strengthening of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside. Barclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in     million. Standard Chartered has brought in     million. And I can go on. Dollars  on and on  into the system. We are doing the same with the insurance sector. So in financial services  a great deal of opportunity. In tourism  in many African countries  a great opportunity. And that's what many people know East Africa for  the wildlife  the elephants  and so on. But managing the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the people is very important. So what am I trying to say  I'm trying to tell you that there's a new wave on the continent. A new wave of openness and democratization in which  since       more than two thirds of African countries have had multi party democratic elections. Not all of them have been perfect  or will be  but the trend is very clear. I'm trying to tell you that since the past three years  the average rate of growth on the continent has moved from about  .  percent to about five percent per annum. This is better than the performance of many OECD countries. So it's clear that things are changing. Conflicts are down on the continent  from about    conflicts a decade ago  we are down to three or four conflicts    one of the most terrible  of course  of which is Darfur. And  you know  you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent  it looks like the entire continent is affected. But you should know that this continent is not    is a continent of many countries  not one country. And if we are down to three or four conflicts  it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable  growing  exciting economies where there's plenty of opportunity. And I want to just make one point about this investment. The best way to help Africans today is to help them to stand on their own feet. And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs. There's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that and saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine. But imagine the impact on a family  if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school  that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves. If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet  isn't that a wonderful opportunity  Isn't that the way to go  And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women. I have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time. Otherwise  I would have liked you to have seen this. It says   Africa  Open for Business.  And this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the year. Understand that the woman who made it is going to be in Tanzania  where they're having the session in June. But it shows you Africans  and particularly African women  who against all odds have developed businesses  some of them world class. One of the women in this video  Adenike Ogunlesi  making children's clothes    which she started as a hobby and grew into a business. Mixing African materials  such as we have  with materials from elsewhere. So  she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys  with African material mixed in. Very creative designs  has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal Mart. For        pieces. So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing. And the women are diligent. They are focused  they work hard. I could go on giving examples  Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda  who opened up a flower business and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning and is employing     other women and men to work with her. However  many of these are starved for capital to expand  because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market. Nobody thinks there's opportunity. But I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now  will miss it forever. So if you want to be in Africa  think about investing. Think about the Beatrices  think about the Adenikes of this world  who are doing incredible things  that are bringing them into the global economy  whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed  and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income. So I invite you to explore the opportunities. When you go to Tanzania  listen carefully  because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent  for the people and for yourselves. Thank you very much.,Economist,200705,6.0355774647887275
359,326,328,Nicholas Negroponte 2006,Nicholas Negroponte,male,One Laptop per Child,Aug 2006,1049,I've been at MIT for    years. I went to TED I. There's only one other person here  I think  who did that. All the other TEDs    and I went to them all  under Ricky's regime    I talked about what the Media Lab was doing  which today has almost     people in it. And if you read the press  last week it actually said I quit the Media Lab. I didn't quit the Media Lab  I stepped down as chairman    which was a kind of ridiculous title  but someone else has taken it on    and one of the things you can do as a professor is you stay on as a professor. And I will now do for the rest of my life the One Laptop Per Child  which I've sort of been doing for a year and a half  anyway. So I'm going to tell you about this  use my    minutes to tell you why we're doing it  how we're doing it and then what we're doing. And at some point I'll even pass around what the      laptop might be like. I was asked by Chris to talk about some of the big issues  and so I figured I'd start with the three that at least drove me to do this. And the first is pretty obvious. It's amazing when you meet a head of state  and you say   What is your most precious natural resource   They will not say  children  at first  and then when you say   children   they will pretty quickly agree with you. And so that isn't very hard. Everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems  they include education  sometimes can be just education and can never be without some element of education. So that's certainly part of it. And the third is a little bit less obvious. And that is that we all in this room learned how to walk  how to talk  not by being taught how to talk  or taught how to walk  but by interacting with the world  by having certain results as a consequence of being able to ask for something  or being able to stand up and reach it. Whereas at about the age six  we were told to stop learning that way  and that all learning from then on would happen through teaching  whether it's people standing up  like I'm doing now  or a book  or something. But it was really through teaching. And one of the things in general that computers have provided to learning is that it now includes a kind of learning which is a little bit more like walking and talking  in the sense that a lot of it is driven by the learner himself or herself. So with those as the principles    some of you may know Seymour Papert. This is back in       when we were working in Senegal. Because some people think that the      laptop just happened a year ago  or two years ago  or we were struck by lightning    this actually has gone back a long time  and in fact  back to the '  s. Here we're in the '  s. Steve Jobs had given us some laptops. We were in Senegal. It didn't scale but it at least was bringing computers to developing countries and learning pretty quickly that these kids  even though English wasn't their language  the Latin alphabet barely was their language  but they could just swim like fish. They could play these like pianos. A little bit more recently  I got involved personally. And these are two anecdotes    one was in Cambodia  in a village that has no electricity  no water  no television  no telephone  but has broadband Internet now. And these kids  their first English word is  Google  and they only know Skype. They've never heard of telephony. They just use Skype. And they go home at night    they've got a broadband connection in a hut that doesn't have electricity. The parents love it  because when they open up the laptops  it's the brightest light source in the house. And talk about where metaphors and reality mix    this is the actual school. In parallel with this  Seymour Papert got the governor of Maine to legislate one laptop per child in the year     . Now at the time  I think it's fair to say that    percent of the teachers were    let me say  apprehensive. Really  they were actually against it. And they really preferred that the money would be used for higher salaries  more schools  whatever. And now  three and a half years later  guess what  They're reporting five things  drop of truancy to almost zero  attending parent teacher meetings    which nobody did and now almost everybody does    drop in discipline problems  increase in student participation. Teachers are now saying it's kind of fun to teach. Kids are engaged    they have laptops     and then the fifth  which interests me the most  is that the servers have to be turned off at certain times at night because the teachers are getting too much email from the kids asking them for help. So when you see that kind of thing    this is not something that you have to test. The days of pilot projects are over  when people say   We'd like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works.  Screw you. Go to the back of the line and someone else will do it  and then when you figure out that this works  you can join as well. And this is what we're doing. So  One Laptop Per Child was formed about a year and a half ago. It's a nonprofit association. It raised about    million dollars to do the engineering to just get this built  and then have it produced afterwards. Scale is truly important. And it's not important because you can buy components at a lower price  OK  It's because you can go to a manufacturer    and I will leave the name out    but we wanted a small display  doesn't have to have perfect color uniformity. It can even have a pixel or two missing. It doesn't have to be that bright. And this particular manufacturer said   We're not interested in that. We're interested in the living room. We're interested in perfect color uniformity. We're interested in big displays  bright displays. You're not part of our strategic plan.  And I said   That's kind of too bad  because we need     million units a year.  And they said   Oh  well  maybe we could become part of your strategic plan.  And that's why scale counts. And that's why we will not launch this without five to    million units in the first run. And the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down  and that's why I said seven to    million there. And we're doing it without a sales and marketing team. I mean  you're looking at the sales and marketing team. We will do it by going to seven large countries and getting them to agree and launch it  and then the others can follow. We have partners. It's not hard to guess Google would be one. The others are all playing to pending. And this has been in the press a great deal. It's the so called Green Machine that we introduced with Kofi Annan in November at the World Summit that was held in Tunisia. Now once people start looking at this  they say   Ah  this is a laptop project.  Well  no  it's not a laptop project. It's an education project. And the fun part    and I'm quite focused on it    I tell people I used to be a light bulb  but now I'm a laser    I'm just going to get that thing built  and it turns out it's not so hard. Because laptop economics are the following  I say    percent here    it's more like        percent of the cost of your laptop is sales  marketing  distribution and profit. Now we have none of those  OK  None of those figure into our cost  because first of all  we sell it at cost  and the governments distribute it. It gets distributed to the school system like a textbook. So that piece disappears. Then you have display and everything else. Now the display on your laptop costs  in rough numbers     dollars a diagonal inch. That can drop to eight  it can drop to seven but it's not going to drop to two  or to one and a half  unless we do some pretty clever things. It's the rest    that little brown box    that is pretty fascinating  because the rest of your laptop is devoted to itself. It's a little bit like an obese person having to use most of their energy to move their obesity. And we have a situation today which is incredible. I've been using laptops since their inception. And my laptop runs slower  less reliably and less pleasantly than it ever has before. And this year is worse. People clap  sometimes you even get standing ovations  and I say   What the hell's wrong with you  Why are we all sitting there   And somebody    to remain nameless    called our laptop a  gadget  recently. And I said   God  our laptop's going to go like a bat out of hell. When you open it up  it's going to go 'bing.'  It'll be on. It'll be just like it was in       when you bought an Apple Macintosh    . It worked really well. And we've been going steadily downhill. Now  people ask all the time what it is. That's what it is. The two pieces that are probably notable  it'll be a mesh network  so when the kids open up their laptops  they all become a network  and then just need one or two points of backhaul. You can serve a couple of thousand kids with two megabits. So you really can bring into a village  and then the villages can connect themselves  and you really can do it quite well. The dual mode display    the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors    isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight  Well  you can't see it. And one of the reasons you can't see it is because it's backlighting most of the time  most cell phones. Now  what we're doing is  we're doing one that will be both frontlit and backlit. And whether you manually switch it or you do it in the software is to be seen. But when it's backlit  it's color. And when it's frontlit  it's black and white at three times the resolution. Is it all worked out  No. That's why a lot of our people are more or less living in Taiwan right now. And in about    days  we'll know for sure whether this works. Probably the most important piece there is that the kids really can do the maintenance. And this is again something that people don't believe  but I really think it's quite true. That's the machine we showed in Tunis. This is more the direction that we're going to go. And it's something that we didn't think was possible. Now  I'm going to pass this around. This isn't a design  OK  So this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with. And it's clearly just a model. The working one is at MIT. I'm going to pass it to this handsome gentleman. At least you can decide whether it goes left or    Chris Anderson  Before you do it  for the people down in simulcast    Nicholas Negroponte  Sorry  I forgot. CA  Just show it off a bit. So wherever the camera is    OK  good point. Thank you  Chris. The idea was that it would be not only a laptop  but that it could transform into an electronic book. So it's sort of an electronic book. This is where when you go outside  it's in black and white. The games buttons are missing  but it'll also be a games machine  book machine. Set it up this way  and it's a television set. Etc.  etc.    is that enough for simulcast  OK  sorry. I'll let Jim decide which way to send it afterwards. OK. Seven countries. I say  maybe  for Massachusetts  because they actually have to do a bid. By law you've got to bid  and so on and so forth. So I can't quite name them. In the other cases  they don't have to do bids. They can decide    it's the federal government in each case. It's kind of agonizing  because a lot of people say   Let's do it at the state level   because states are more nimble than the feds  just because of size. And yet we count. We're really dealing with the federal government. We're really dealing with ministries of education. And if you look at governments around the world  ministries of education tend to be the most conservative  and also the ones that have huge payrolls. Everybody thinks they know about education  a lot of culture is built into it as well. It's really hard. And so it's certainly the hard road. If you look at the countries  they're pretty geoculturally distributed. Have they all agreed  No  not completely. Probably Thailand  Brazil and Nigeria are the three that are the most active and most agreed. We're purposely not signing anything with anybody until we actually have the working ones. And since I visit each one of those countries within at least every three months  I'm just going around the world every three weeks. Here's sort of the schedule and I put at the bottom we might give some away free in two years at this meeting. Everybody says it's a      laptop    you can't do it. Well  guess what  we're not. We're coming in probably at      to start  then drift down. And that's very important  because so many things hit the market at a price and then drift up. It's kind of the loss leader  and then as soon as it looks interesting  it can't be afforded  or it can't be scaled out. So we're targeting    dollars in     . The gray market's a big issue. And one of the ways    just one    but one of the ways to help in the case of the gray market is to make something that is so utterly unique    It's a little bit like the fact that automobiles    thousands of automobiles are stolen every day in the United States. Not one single post office truck is stolen. And why  Because there's no market for post office trucks. It looks like a post office truck. You can spray paint it. You can do anything you want. I just learned recently  in South Africa  no white Volvos are stolen. Period. None. Zero. So we want to make it very much like a white Volvo. Each government has a task force. This perhaps is less interesting  but we're trying to get the governments to all work together and it's not easy. The economics of this is to start with the federal governments and then later  to subsequently go to other    whether it's child to child funding  so a child in this country buys one for a child in the developing world  maybe of the same gender  maybe of the same age. An uncle gives a niece or a nephew that as a birthday present. I mean  there are all sorts of things that will happen  and they'll be very  very exciting. And everybody says    I say    it's an education project. Are we providing the software  The answer is  The system certainly has software  but no  we're not providing the education content. That is really done in the countries. But we are certainly constructionists. And we certainly believe in learning by doing and everything from Logo  which was started in       to more modern things  like Scratch  if you've ever even heard of it  are very  very much part of it. And that's the rollout. Are we dreaming  Is this real  It actually is real. The only criticism  and people really don't want to criticize this  because it is a humanitarian effort  a nonprofit effort and to criticize it is a little bit stupid  actually. But the one thing that people could criticize was   Great idea  but these guys can't do it.  And that could either mean these guys  professors and so on couldn't do it  or that it's not possible. Well  on December     a company called Quanta agreed to build it  and since they make about one third of all the laptops on the planet today  that question disappeared. So it's not a matter of whether it's going to happen. It is going to happen. And if it comes out at     dollars  so what  If it comes out six months late  so what  That's a pretty soft landing.

360,1062,1064,Nicholas Negroponte 2008,Nicholas Negroponte,male,"5 predictions, from 1984",Mar 2008,1462,In this rather long sort of marathon presentation  I've tried to break it up into three parts  the first being a whole lot of examples on how it can be a little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computer and really address the qualities of the human interface. And these will be some simple design qualities and they will also be some qualities of  if you will  the intelligence of interaction. Then the second part will really just be examples of new technologies    new media falling very much into that mold. Again  I will go through them as fast as possible. And then the last one will be some examples I've been able to collect  which I think illustrate this at least as best I can  in the world of entertainment. People have this belief    and I share most of it    that we will be using the TV screens or their equivalents for electronic books of the future. But then you think   My God  What a terrible image you get when you look at still pictures on TV.  Well  it doesn't have to be terrible. And that is a slide taken from a TV set and it was pre processed to be very sympathetic to the TV medium  and it absolutely looks beautiful. Well  what's happened  How did people get into this mess  Where you are now  all of a sudden  sitting in front of personal computers and video text    teletext systems  and somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen  Well  you have to remember that TV was designed to be looked at eight times the distance of the diagonal. So you get a    inch     inch  whatever  TV  and then you should multiply that by eight and that's the distance you should sit away from the TV set. Now we've put people    inches in front of a TV  and all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen  all of a sudden  are staring you in the face  the shadow mask  the scan lines  all of that. And they can be treated very easily  there are actually ways of getting rid of them  there are actually ways of just making absolutely beautiful pictures. I'm talking here a little bit about display technologies. Let me talk about how you might input information. And my favorite example is always fingers. I'm very interested in touch sensitive displays. High tech  high touch. Isn't that what some of you said  It's certainly a very important medium for input  and a lot of people think that fingers are a very low resolution sort of stylus for inputting to a display. In fact  they're not  it's really a very  very high resolution input medium    you have to just do it twice  you have to touch the screen and then rotate your finger slightly    and you can move a cursor with great accuracy. And so when you see on the market these systems that have just a few light emitting diodes on the side and are very low resolution  it's nice that they exist because it still is better than nothing. But it  in some sense  misses the point  namely  that fingers are a very  very high resolution input medium. Now  what are some of the other advantages  Well  the one advantage is that you don't have to pick them up  and people don't realize how important that is    not having to pick up your fingers to use them.  Laughter  When you think for a second of the mouse on Macintosh    and I will not criticize the mouse too much    when you're typing    what you have    you want to now put something    first of all  you've got to find the mouse. You have to probably stop. Maybe not come to a grinding halt  but you've got to sort of find that mouse. Then you find the mouse  and you're going to have to wiggle it a little bit to see where the cursor is on the screen. And then when you finally see where it is  then you've got to move it to get the cursor over there  and then     Bang     you've got to hit a button or do whatever. That's four separate steps versus typing and then touching and typing and just doing it all in one motion    or one and a half  depending on how you want to count. Again  what I'm trying to do is just illustrate the kinds of problems that I think face the designers of new computer systems and entertainment systems and educational systems from the perspective of the quality of that interface. And another advantage  of course  of using fingers is you have    of them. And we have never known how to do this technically  so this slide is a fake slide. We never succeeded in using ten fingers  but there are certain things you can do  obviously  with more than one finger input  which is rather fascinating. What we did stumble across was something ... Again  which is typical of the computer field  is when you have a bug that you can't get rid of you turn it into a feature. And maybe ...  Laughter  maybe a mouse is a new kind of bug. But the bug in our case was in touch sensitive displays  we wanted to be able to draw    you know  rub your finger across the screen to input continuous points    and there was just too much friction created between your finger and the glass    if glass was the substrate  which it usually is. So we found that that actually was a feature in the sense you could build a pressure sensitive display. And when you touch it with your finger  you can actually  then  introduce all the forces on the face of that screen  and that actually has a certain amount of value. Let me see if I can load another disc and show you  quickly  an example. Now  imagine a screen  which is not only touch sensitive now  it's pressure sensitive. And it's pressure sensitive to the forces both in the plane of the screen    X  Y  and Z at least in one direction  we couldn't figure out how to come in the other direction. But let me get rid of the slide  and let's see if this comes on. OK. So there is the pressure sensitive display in operation. The person's just  if you will  pushing on the screen to make a curve. But this is the interesting part. I want to stop it for a second because the movie is very badly made. And the particular display was built about six years ago  and when we moved from one room to another room  a rather large person sat on it and it got destroyed. So all we have is this record.  Laughter  But imagine that screen having lots of objects on it and the person has touched an object    one of N    like he did there  and then pushed on it. Now  imagine a program where some of those objects are physically heavy and some are light  one is an anvil on a fuzzy rug and the other one is a ping pong ball on a sheet of glass. And when you touch it  you have to really push very hard to move that anvil across the screen  and yet you touch the ping pong ball very lightly and it just scoots across the screen. And what you can do    oops  I didn't mean to do that    what you can do is actually feed back to the user the feeling of the physical properties. So again  they don't have to be weight  they could be a general trying to move troops  and he's got to move an aircraft carrier versus a little boat. In fact  they funded it for that very reason. The whole notion  then  is one that at the interface there are physical properties in that transducer    in this case it's pressure and touches    that allow you to present things to the user that you could never present before. So it's not simply looking at the quality or  if you will  the luxury of that interface  but it's actually looking at the idea of presenting things that previously couldn't be presented before. I want to move on to another example  which is one of a different sort  where we're trying to use computer and video disc technology now to come up with a new kind of book. Here  the idea is that you're going to take this book  if you will  and it's going to come alive. You're going to sort of breathe life into it. We are so used to doing monologues. Filmmakers  for example  are the experts in monologue making  you make a film and it has a well formed beginning  middle and end  and in some sense the art of it is that. And you then say   There's an opportunity for making conversational movies.  Well  what does that mean  And it sort of nibbles at the core of the whole profession and all the assumptions of that medium. So  book writing is the same thing. What I'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book where it is mixed now with ... all sorts of things live in there  but you have to keep a few things in mind. One is that this book knows about itself. Each frame of the movie has information about itself. So it knows  or at least there is computer readable information in the medium itself. It's just not a static movie frame. That's one thing. The other is that you have to realize that it is a random access medium  and you can  in fact  branch and expand and elaborate and shrink. And here    again  my favorite example    is the cookbook  the  Larousse Gastronomique.  And I think I use the example all too often  but it's a great one because there is a classic ending in that little encyclopedia style cookbook that tells you how to do something like penguin  and you get to the end of the recipe and it says   Cook until done.  Now  that would be  if you will  the top green track  which doesn't mean too much. But you might have to elaborate for me or for somebody who isn't an expert  and say   Cook at     degrees for    minutes.  And then for a real beginner  you would go down even further and elaborate more    say   Open the oven  preheat  wait for the light to go out  open the door  don't leave it open too long  put the penguin in and shut the door ...   Laughter  whatever. And that's a much more elaborate one than you dribble back. That's one kind of use of random access. And the other is where you want to explain the same thing in different ways. If you're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question  the last thing you do is repeat what you just said. You try and think of a different way of saying the same thing  or if you know the particular student and that student's cognitive style  then you might say it in a way that you think would have a good impedance match with that student. There are all sorts of techniques you will use    and again  this is a different kind of branching. So  what I will show you is ... it's a rather boring book  but I'm afraid sometimes you have to do boring books because your sponsors aren't necessarily interested in fiction and entertainment. And this is a book on how to repair a transmission. Now  I don't even know what vintage the transmission is  but let me just show you very quickly some of it  and we'll move on. Nicholas Negroponte  Now  this is his table of contents. Just a picture of the transmission  and as you rub your finger across the transmission it highlights the various parts. Narrator  When I find a chapter that I want to see  I just touch the text and the system will format pages for me to read. The words or phrases that are lit up in red are glossary words  so I can get a different definition by just touching the word  and the definition appears  superimposed over the illustration. NN  This is about the oil pan  or the oil filter and all that. This is relatively important because it sets the page ... Narrator  This is another example of a page with glossary words highlighted in red. I can get a definition of these words just by touching them  and the definition will appear in the illustration corner. I can get back to the illustration  but in this case it's not a single frame  but it's actually a movie of someone coming into the frame and doing the repair that's described in the text. The two headed slider is a speed control that allows me to watch the movie at various speeds  in forward or reverse. And the movie is displayed as a full frame movie. I can go back to the beginning ... and play the movie at full speed. Here's another step by step procedure  only in this case    NN  Okay  this movie is ... Everybody's heard of sound sync movies    this is text sync movies  so as the movie plays  the text gets highlighted. We highlight the text as we go through the movie. Repairman  ... Not too far out. Front poles  preferably. Don't loosen them too far. If you loosen them too far  you'll have a big mess. NN  I suspect that some of you might not even understand that language. OK. I'm at the third and last part of this  which I said I would make an attempt to at least give you some examples that may be more directly related to the world of entertainment. And of course  good education has got to be good entertainment  so my first example will be drawn from a very recent experiment that we've been doing    in this case  in Senegal    where we have tried to use personal computers as a pedagogical medium. But not as teaching machines at all  the whole notion is to use this as an instrument where there is a complete reversal of roles    the child is  if you will  the teacher and the machine is the student    and the art of computer programming is a vehicle that sort of approximates thinking about thinking. But teaching kids programming per se is utterly irrelevant. And there are just a few slides I want to go through  but there's a story I'd like to tell. And that was when  before we did this in any developing countries    we're doing it  in fact  in three developing countries right now  Pakistan  Colombia and Senegal    we did it in some pretty rough areas of New York City. And one child  whose name I've forgotten  was about seven or eight years old  absolutely considered mentally handicapped    couldn't read  didn't even make it in the lowest section of the school's classes    and was pretty much not in school  though physically there. But did hang around the  quote   computer room   where there were quite a few computers  and learned this particular language called Logo    and learned it with great ease and found it a lot of fun  it was very interesting. And one day  by chance  some visitors from the NIE came by in their double breasted suits looking at this setup  and none of the children who were normally there  except for this one child  were there. He was  and he said   Let me show you how this works   and they got an absolutely ingenuous  wonderful description of Logo. And the child was just zipping right through it  showing them all sorts of things until they asked him how to do something which he couldn't explain and so he flipped through the manual  found the explanation and typed the command and got it to do what they asked. They were delighted  and by the time it was time to go see the principal  whom they'd actually come to see    not the computer room    they went upstairs and they said   This is absolutely remarkable  That child was very articulate and showed us and even dealt with the things he couldn't do automatically with that manual. It was just absolutely fantastic.  The principal said   There's a dreadful mistake  because that child can't read. And you obviously have been hoodwinked or you've talked about somebody else.  And they all got up and they all went downstairs and the child was still there. And they did something very intelligent  they asked the child   Can you read   And the child said   No  I can't.  And then they said   But wait a minute. You just looked through that manual and you found ...   and he said   Oh  but that's not reading.  And so they said   Well  what's reading then   He says   Well  reading is this junk they give me in little books to read. It's absolutely irrelevant   Laughter  and I get nothing for it. But here  with a little bit of effort I get a lot of return.  And it really meant something to the child. The child read beautifully  it turned out  and was really very competent. So it actually meant something. And that story has many other anecdotes that are similar  but wow. The key to the future of computers in education is right there  and it is  when does it mean something to a child  There is a myth  and it truly is a myth  we believe    and I'm sure a lot of you believe in this room    that it is harder to read and write than it is to learn how to speak. And it's not  but we think speech     My God  little children pick it up somehow  and by the age of two they're doing a mediocre job  and by three and four they're speaking reasonably well. And yet you've got to go to school to learn how to read  and you have to sit in a classroom and somebody has to teach you. Hence  it must be harder.  Well  it's not harder. What the truth is is that speaking has great value to a child  the child can get a great deal by talking to you. Reading and writing is utterly useless. There is no reason for a child to read and write except blind faith  and that it's going to help you.  Laughter  So what happens is you go to school and people say   Just believe me  you're going to like it. You're going to like reading   and just read and read. On the other hand  you give a kid    a three year old kid    a computer and they type a little command and    Poof     something happens. And all of a sudden ... You may not call that reading and writing  but a certain bit of typing and reading stuff on the screen has a huge payoff  and it's a lot of fun. And in fact  it's a powerful educational instrument. Well  in Senegal we found that this was the traditional classroom      kids    three per desk    one teacher  a little bit of chalk. This student was one of our first students  and it's the girl on the left leaning with her chalkboard  and she came ... within two days    I want to show you the program she wrote  and remember her hairstyle. And that is the program she made. That's what meant something to her  is doing the hair pattern  and actually did it within two days    an hour each day    and found it was  to her  absolutely the most meaningful piece ... But rooted in that  little did she know how much knowledge she was acquiring about geometry and just math and logic and all the rest. And again  I could talk for three hours about this subject. I will come to my last example and then quit. And my last example    as some of my former colleagues  whom I see in the room  can imagine what it will be. Yes  it is. It's our work    that was a while ago  and it still is my favorite project    of teleconferencing. And the reason it remains a favorite project is that we were asked to do a teleconferencing system where you had the following situation  you had five people at five different sites    they were known people    and you had to have these people in teleconference  such that each one was utterly convinced that the other four were physically present. Now  that is sufficiently zany that we would  obviously  jump to the bait  and we did. And the fact that we knew the people    we had to take a page out of the history of Walt Disney    we actually went so far as to build CRTs in the shapes of the people's faces. So if I wanted to call my friend Peter Sprague on the phone  my secretary would get his head out and bring it and set it on the desk  and that would be the TV used for the occasion. And it's uncanny  there's no way I can explain to you the amount of eye contact you get with that physical face projected on a  D CRT of that sort. The next thing that we had to do is to persuade them that there needed to be spatial correspondence  which is straightforward  but again  it's something that didn't fall naturally out of a telecommunications or computing style of thinking  it was a very  if you will  architectural or spatial concept. And that was to recognize that when you sit around the table  the actual location of the people becomes rather important. And when somebody gets up  in fact  to go answer a phone or use a bathroom or something  the empty seat becomes  if you will  that person. And you point frequently to the empty seat and you say   He or she wouldn't agree   and the empty chair is that person and the spatiality is crucial. So we said   Well  these will be on round tables and the order around the table had to be the same  so that at my site  I would be  if you will  real and then at each other's site you'd have these plastic heads. And the plastic heads  sometimes you want to project them. And there are a number of schemes  which I don't want to dwell on  but this is the one that we finally used where we projected onto rear screen material that was molded in the face    literally in the face of the person. And I'll show you one more slide  where this is actually made from something called a solid photograph and is the screen. Now  we track  on the person's head  the head motions    so we transmit with a video the head positions    and so this head moves in about two axes. So if I  all of a sudden  turn to the person to my left and start talking to that person  then at the person to my right's site  he'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other. And then if that person interrupts  then those two heads may turn. And it really is reconstructing  quite accurately  teleconferencing.,Tech visionary,200803,6.1341724941725015
361,1253,1255,Nicholas Negroponte 2008,Nicholas Negroponte,male,"One Laptop per Child, two years on",Jun 2008,984,Most people don't know that when I went to high school in this country    I applied for university at a time when I was convinced I was going to be an artist and be a sculptor. And I came from a very privileged background. I was very lucky. My family was wealthy  and my father believed in one thing  and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted. And I announced I wanted to be a sculptor in Paris. And he was a clever man. He sort of said   Well  that's OK  but you've done very well in your math SATs.  In fact  I'd got an    . And he thought I did very well    and I did  too    in the arts  this was my passion. And he said  If you go to MIT   to which I had been given early admission   I will pay for every year you're at MIT  in graduate or undergraduate    as much as you want    I will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in Paris.  And I thought that was the best deal in town  so I accepted it immediately. And I decided that if I was good in art  and I was good in mathematics  I'd study architecture  which was the blending of the two. I went and told my headmaster that  at prep school. And I said to him what I was doing  that I was going to go study architecture because it was art and mathematics put together. He said to me something that just went completely over my head. He said   You know  I like grey suits  and I like pin striped suits  but I don't like grey pin striped suits.  And I thought   What a turkey this guy is   and I went off to MIT. I studied architecture  then did a second degree in architecture  and then actually quickly realized that it wasn't architecture. That really  the mixing of art and science was computers  and that that really was the place to bring both  and enjoyed a career doing that. And probably  if I were to fill out Jim Citrin's scale  I'd put     percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative. And after doing this for a long time  and the Media Lab passing the baton on  I thought   Well  maybe it's time for me to do a project. Something that would be important  but also something that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had.  And in the case of the Media Lab  knowing a lot of people  knowing people who were either executives or wealthy  and also not having  in my own case  a career to worry about anymore. My career  I mean  I'd done my career. Didn't have to worry about earning money. Didn't have to worry about what people thought about me. And I said   Boy  let's really do something that takes advantage of all these features   and thought that if we could address education  by leveraging the children  and bringing to the world the access of the computers  that that was really the thing we should do. Never shown this picture before  and probably going to be sued for it. It's taken at three o'clock in the morning  without the permission of the company. It's about two weeks old. There they are  folks. If you look at the picture  you'll see they're stacked up. Those are conveyor belts that go around. This is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by  but then you'll see the ones up above. What happens is  they burn into flash memory the software  and then test them for a few hours. But you've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line  because it's constant. So they go around in this loop  which is why you see them up there. So this was great for us because it was a real turning point. But it goes back. This picture was taken in       just before the IBM PC was even announced. Seymour Papert and I were bringing computers to schools and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself. But one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here. And when people tell me   Who's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids   I say to myself   What planet do you come from   Okay  there's not a person in this room    I don't care how techie you are    there's not a person in this room that doesn't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it. OK  We all need help  even those of us who are very seasoned. This picture of Seymour       years ago. Seymour made a very simple observation in       and then basically presented it in         April    to be precise    called  Teaching Children Thinking.  What he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently  and when they debug the programs  they come the closest to learning about learning. That was very important  and in some sense  we've lost that. Kids don't program enough and boy  if there's anything I hope this brings back  it's programming to kids. It's really important. Using applications is OK  but programming is absolutely fundamental. This is being launched with three languages in it  Squeak  Logo  and a third  that I've never even seen before. The point being  this is going to be very  very intensive on the programming side. This photograph is very important because it's much later. This is in the early     s. My son  Dimitri    who's here  many of you know Dimitri    went to Cambodia  set up this school that we had built  just as the school connected it to the Internet. And these kids had their laptops. But it was really what spirited this  plus the influence of Joe and others. We started One Laptop per Child. This is the same village in Cambodia  just a couple of months ago. These kids are real pros. There were just       machines out there being tested by kids. Being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental. Everybody advised me not to be a nonprofit  but they were all wrong. And the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold. There are many reasons  but the two that merit the little bit of time is  one  the clarity of purpose is there. The moral purpose is clear. I can see any head of state  any executive I want  at any time  because I'm not selling laptops. OK  I have no shareholders. Whether we sell  it doesn't make any difference whatsoever. The clarity of purpose is absolutely critical. And the second is very counterintuitive    you can get the best people in the world. If you look at our professional services  including search firms  including communications  including legal services  including banking  they're all pro bono. And it's not to save money. We've got money in the bank. It's because you get the best people. You get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission  and they're the best people. We couldn't afford to hire a CFO. We put out a job description for a CFO at zero salary  and we had a queue of people. It allows you to team up with people. The U.N.'s not going to be our partner if we're profit making. So announcing this with Kofi Annan was very important  and the U.N. allowed us to basically reach all the countries. And this was the machine we were showing before I met Yves Behar. And while this machine in some sense is silly  in retrospect  it actually served a very important purpose. That pencil yellow crank was remembered by everybody. Everybody remembered the pencil yellow crank. It's different. It was getting its power in a different way. It's kind of childlike. Even though this wasn't the direction we went because the crank    it really is stupid to have it on board  by the way. In spite of what some people in the press don't get it  didn't understand it  we didn't take it off because we didn't want to do    having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want. You want a separate thing  like the AC adaptor. I didn't bring one with me  but they really work much better off board. And then  I could tell you lots about the laptop  but I decided on just four things. Just keep in mind    because there are other people  including Bill Gates  who said   Gee  you've got a real computer.  That computer is unlike anything you've had  and does things    there are four of them    that you don't come close to. And it's very important to be low power  and I hope that's picked up more by the industry. That the reason that you want to be below two watts is that's roughly what you can generate with your upper body. Dual mode display    that sunlight display's fantastic. We were using it at lunch today in the sunlight  and the more sunlight the better. And that was really critical. The mesh network  it'll become commonplace. And of course   rugged  goes without saying. And the reason I think design matters isn't because I wanted to go to art school. And by the way  when I graduated from MIT  I thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years.  Laughter  So  I didn't do that. But design matters for a number of reasons. The most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product. Most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design  cheap labor  cheap components  and making a cheap laptop. And  in English  the word  cheap  has a double meaning  which is really appropriate  because it's cheap  in the pejorative sense  as well as inexpensive. But if you take a different approach  and you think of very large scale integration  very advanced materials  very advanced manufacturing    so you're pouring chemicals in one end  iPods are spewing out the other    and really cool design  that's what we wanted to do. And I can race through these and save a lot of time because Yves and I obviously didn't compare notes. These are his slides  and so I don't have to talk about them. But it was really  to us  very important as a strategy. It wasn't just to kind of make it cute  because somebody    you know  good design is very important. Yves showed one of the power generating devices. The mesh network  the reason I    and I won't go into it in great detail    but when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and poorest parts of the world  they're connected. There's not just laptops. And so  we have to drop in satellite dishes. We put in generators. It's a lot of stuff that goes behind these. These can talk to each other. If you're in a desert  they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart. If you're in the jungle  it's about     meters. So if a kid bicycles home  or walks a few miles  they're going to be off the grid  so to speak. They're not going to be near another laptop  so you have to nail these onto a tree  and sort of  get it. You don't call Verizon or Sprint. You build your own network. And that's very important  the user interface. We are launching with    keyboards. English is by far the minority. Latin is relatively rare  too. You just look at some of the languages. I'm willing to suspect some of you hadn't even heard of them before. Is there anybody in the room  one person  unless you work with OLPC  is there anybody in the room that can tell me what language the keyboard is that's on the screen  There's only one hand    so you get it. Yes  you're right. He's right. It's Amharic  it's Ethiopian. In Ethiopia  there's never been a keyboard. There is no keyboard standard because there's no market. And this is the big difference. Again  when you're a nonprofit  you look at children as a mission  not as a market. So we went to Ethiopia  and we helped them make a keyboard. And this will become the standard Ethiopian keyboard. So what I want to end with is sort of what we're doing to roll it out. And we changed strategy completely. I decided at the beginning    it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning  it's not what we're doing now    is to go to six countries. Big countries  one of them is not so big  but it's rich. Here's the six. We went to the six  and in each case the head of state said he would do it  he'd do a million. In the case of Gaddafi  he'd do  .  million  and that they would launch it. We thought  this is exactly the right strategy  get it out  and then the little countries could sort of piggyback on these big countries. And so I went to each of those countries at least six times  met with the head of state probably two or three times. In each case  got the ministers  went through a lot of the stuff. This was a period in my life where I was traveling     days per year. Not something you'd envy or want to do. In the case of Libya  it was a lot of fun meeting Gaddafi in his tent. The camel smells were unbelievable. And it was    degrees C. I mean  this was not what you'd call a cool experience. And former countries    I say former  because none of them really came through this summer    there was a big difference between getting a head of state to have a photo opportunity  make a press release. So we went to smaller ones. Uruguay  bless their hearts. Small country  not so rich. President said he'd do it  and guess what  He did do it. The tender had nothing in it that related to us  nothing specific about sunlight readable  mesh network  low power  but just a vanilla laptop proposal. And guess what  We won it hands down. When it was announced that they were going to do every child in Uruguay  the first          boom  went to OLPC. The next day    the next day  not even    hours had passed    in Peru  the president of Peru said   We'll do    .  And boom  a little domino effect. The president of Rwanda stepped in and said he would do it. The president of Ethiopia said he would do it. And boom  boom  boom. The president of Mongolia. And so what happens is  these things start to happen with these countries    still not enough. Add up all those countries  it didn't quite get to thing  so we said   Let's start a program in the United States.  So  end of August  early September  we decide to do this. We announced it near the middle  end    just when the Clinton Initiative was taking place. We thought that was a good time to announce it. Launched it on the    of November. We said it would be just for a short period until the   . We've extended it until the   . And the  Give One  Get One  program is really important because it got a lot of people absolutely interested. The first day it was just wild. And then we said   Well  let's get people to give many. Not just one  and get one  but maybe give      give      .  And that's where you come in. And that's where I think it's very important. I don't want you all to go out and buy     dollars worth of laptops. Okay  Do it  but that's not going to help. Okay  If everybody in this room goes out tonight and orders one of these things for     dollars  whatever it is      people in the room doing it    yeah  great. I want you do something else. And it's not to go out and buy     or        though  I invite you to do that  and        would be even better. Tell people about it  It's got to become viral  OK  Use your mailing lists. People in this room have extraordinary mailing lists. Get your friends to give one  get one. And if each one of you sends it to     or     people  that would be fantastic. I won't dwell on the pricing at all. Just to say that when you do the  Give One  Get One   a lot of press is a bit about   They didn't make it  it's     dollars  it's not    .  It will be     in two years. It will go below    . We've pledged not to add features  but to bring that price down. But it was the countries that wanted it to go up  and we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons. So what you can do    I've just said it. Don't just give one  get one. I just want to end with one last one. This one is not even    hours old  or maybe it's    hours. The first kids got their laptops. They got them by ship  and I'm talking now about              at a time went out this week. They went to Uruguay  Peru  Mexico. And it's been slow coming  and we're only making about       a week  but we hope  we hope  sometime in next year  maybe by the middle of the year  to hit a million a month. Now put that number  and a million isn't so much. It's not a big number. We're selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year. But a million a month in laptop land is a big number. And the world production today  everybody combined  making laptops  is five million a month. So I'm standing here telling you that sometime next year  we're going to make    percent of the world production. And if we do that  there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there. And we hope if you have EG two years from now  or whenever you have it again  I won't have bad breath  and I will be invited back  and will have  hopefully by then  maybe     million out there to children. Thank you.,Tech visionary,200806,6.147760115606934
368,1435,1437,P.W. Singer 2009,P.W. Singer,male,Military robots and the future of war,Apr 2009,1102,I thought I'd begin with a scene of war. There was little to warn of the danger ahead. The Iraqi insurgent had placed the IED  an Improvised Explosive Device  along the side of the road with great care. By       there were more than       of these attacks every single month  and they were the leading cause of casualties among American soldiers and Iraqi civilians. The team that was hunting for this IED is called an EOD team  Explosives Ordinance Disposal and they're the pointy end of the spear in the American effort to suppress these roadside bombs. Each EOD team goes out on about     of these bomb calls every year  defusing about two bombs a day. Perhaps the best sign of how valuable they are to the war effort  is that the Iraqi insurgents put a         bounty on the head of a single EOD soldier. Unfortunately  this particular call would not end well. By the time the soldier advanced close enough to see the telltale wires of the bomb  it exploded in a wave of flame. Now  depending how close you are and how much explosive has been packed into that bomb  it can cause death or injury. You have to be as far as    yards away to escape that. The blast is so strong it can even break your limbs  even if you're not hit. That soldier had been on top of the bomb. And so when the rest of the team advanced they found little left. And that night the unit's commander did a sad duty  and he wrote a condolence letter back to the United States  and he talked about how hard the loss had been on his unit  about the fact that they had lost their bravest soldier  a soldier who had saved their lives many a time. And he apologized for not being able to bring them home. But then he talked up the silver lining that he took away from the loss.  At least   as he wrote   when a robot dies  you don't have to write a letter to its mother.  That scene sounds like science fiction  but is battlefield reality already. The soldier in that case was a    pound robot called a PackBot. The chief's letter went  not to some farmhouse in Iowa like you see in the old war movies  but went to the iRobot Company  which is named after the Asimov novel and the not so great Will Smith movie  and... um...  Laughter ... if you remember that in that fictional world  robots started out carrying out mundane chores  and then they started taking on life and death decisions. That's a reality we face today. What we're going to do is actually just flash a series of photos behind me that show you the reality of robots used in war right now or already at the prototype stage. It's just to give you a taste. Another way of putting it is you're not going to see anything that's powered by Vulcan technology  or teenage wizard hormones or anything like that. This is all real. So why don't we go ahead and start those pictures. Something big is going on in war today  and maybe even the history of humanity itself. The U.S. military went into Iraq with a handful of drones in the air. We now have      . We went in with zero unmanned ground systems. We now have       . And the tech term  killer application  takes on new meaning in this space. And we need to remember that we're talking about the Model T Fords  the Wright Flyers  compared to what's coming soon. That's where we're at right now. One of the people that I recently met with was an Air Force three star general  and he said basically  where we're headed very soon is tens of thousands of robots operating in our conflicts  and these numbers matter  because we're not just talking about tens of thousands of today's robots  but tens of thousands of these prototypes and tomorrow's robots  because of course  one of the things that's operating in technology is Moore's Law  that you can pack in more and more computing power into those robots  and so flash forward around    years  if Moore's Law holds true  those robots will be close to a billion times more powerful in their computing than today. And so what that means is the kind of things that we used to only talk about at science fiction conventions like Comic Con have to be talked about in the halls of power and places like the Pentagon. A robots revolution is upon us. Now  I need to be clear here. I'm not talking about a revolution where you have to worry about the Governor of California showing up at your door  a la the Terminator.  Laughter  When historians look at this period  they're going to conclude that we're in a different type of revolution  a revolution in war  like the invention of the atomic bomb. But it may be even bigger than that  because our unmanned systems don't just affect the  how  of war fighting  they affect the  who  of fighting at its most fundamental level. That is  every previous revolution in war  be it the machine gun  be it the atomic bomb  was about a system that either shot faster  went further  had a bigger boom. That's certainly the case with robotics  but they also change the experience of the warrior and even the very identity of the warrior. Another way of putting this is that mankind's       year old monopoly on the fighting of war is breaking down in our very lifetime. I've spent the last several years going around meeting with all the players in this field  from the robot scientists to the science fiction authors who inspired them to the    year old drone pilots who are fighting from Nevada  to the four star generals who command them  to even the Iraqi insurgents who they are targeting and what they think about our systems  and what I found interesting is not just their stories  but how their experiences point to these ripple effects that are going outwards in our society  in our law and our ethics  etc. And so what I'd like to do with my remaining time is basically flesh out a couple of these. So the first is that the future of war  even a robotics one  is not going to be purely an American one. The U.S. is currently ahead in military robotics right now  but we know that in technology there's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage. In a quick show of hands  how many people in this room still use Wang Computers   Laughter  It's the same thing in war. The British and the French invented the tank. The Germans figured out how to use it right  and so what we have to think about for the U.S. is that we are ahead right now  but you have    other countries out there working on military robotics  and they include all the interesting countries like Russia  China  Pakistan  Iran. And this raises a bigger worry for me. How do we move forward in this revolution given the state of our manufacturing and the state of our science and mathematics training in our schools  Or another way of thinking about this is  what does it mean to go to war increasingly with soldiers whose hardware is made in China and software is written in India  But just as software has gone open source  so has warfare. Unlike an aircraft carrier or an atomic bomb  you don't need a massive manufacturing system to build robotics. A lot of it is off the shelf. A lot of it's even do it yourself. One of those things you just saw flashed before you was a raven drone  the handheld tossed one. For about a thousand dollars  you can build one yourself  equivalent to what the soldiers use in Iraq. That raises another wrinkle when it comes to war and conflict. Good guys might play around and work on these as hobby kits  but so might bad guys. This cross between robotics and things like terrorism is going to be fascinating and even disturbing  and we've already seen it start. During the war between Israel  a state  and Hezbollah  a non state actor  the non state actor flew four different drones against Israel. There's already a jihadi website that you can go on and remotely detonate an IED in Iraq while sitting at your home computer. And so I think what we're going to see is two trends take place with this. First is  you're going to reinforce the power of individuals against governments  but then the second is that we are going to see an expansion in the realm of terrorism. The future of it may be a cross between al Qaeda  .  and the next generation of the Unabomber. And another way of thinking about this is the fact that  remember  you don't have to convince a robot that they're gonna receive    virgins after they die to convince them to blow themselves up. But the ripple effects of this are going to go out into our politics. One of the people that I met with was a former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Ronald Reagan  and he put it this way   I like these systems because they save American lives  but I worry about more marketization of wars  more shock and awe talk  to defray discussion of the costs. People are more likely to support the use of force if they view it as costless.  Robots for me take certain trends that are already in play in our body politic  and maybe take them to their logical ending point. We don't have a draft. We don't have declarations of war anymore. We don't buy war bonds anymore. And now we have the fact that we're converting more and more of our American soldiers that we would send into harm's way into machines  and so we may take those already lowering bars to war and drop them to the ground. But the future of war is also going to be a YouTube war. That is  our new technologies don't merely remove humans from risk. They also record everything that they see. So they don't just delink the public  they reshape its relationship with war. There's already several thousand video clips of combat footage from Iraq on YouTube right now  most of it gathered by drones. Now  this could be a good thing. It could be building connections between the home front and the war front as never before. But remember  this is taking place in our strange  weird world  and so inevitably the ability to download these video clips to  you know  your iPod or your Zune gives you the ability to turn it into entertainment. Soldiers have a name for these clips. They call it war porn. The typical one that I was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a Predator strike taking out an enemy site. Missile hits  bodies burst into the air with the explosion. It was set to music. It was set to the pop song  I Just Want To Fly  by Sugar Ray. This ability to watch more but experience less creates a wrinkle in the public's relationship with war. I think about this with a sports parallel. It's like the difference between watching an NBA game  a professional basketball game on TV  where the athletes are tiny figures on the screen  and being at that basketball game in person and realizing what someone seven feet really does look like. But we have to remember  these are just the clips. These are just the ESPN SportsCenter version of the game. They lose the context. They lose the strategy. They lose the humanity. War just becomes slam dunks and smart bombs. Now the irony of all this is that while the future of war may involve more and more machines  it's our human psychology that's driving all of this  it's our human failings that are leading to these wars. So one example of this that has big resonance in the policy realm is how this plays out on our very real war of ideas that we're fighting against radical groups. What is the message that we think we are sending with these machines versus what is being received in terms of the message. So one of the people that I met was a senior Bush Administration official  who had this to say about our unmanning of war   It plays to our strength. The thing that scares people is our technology.  But when you go out and meet with people  for example in Lebanon  it's a very different story. One of the people I met with there was a news editor  and we're talking as a drone is flying above him  and this is what he had to say.  This is just another sign of the coldhearted cruel Israelis and Americans  who are cowards because they send out machines to fight us. They don't want to fight us like real men  but they're afraid to fight  so we just have to kill a few of their soldiers to defeat them.  The future of war also is featuring a new type of warrior  and it's actually redefining the experience of going to war. You can call this a cubicle warrior. This is what one Predator drone pilot described of his experience fighting in the Iraq War while never leaving Nevada.  You're going to war for    hours  shooting weapons at targets  directing kills on enemy combatants  and then you get in the car and you drive home and within    minutes  you're sitting at the dinner table talking to your kids about their homework.  Now  the psychological balancing of those experiences is incredibly tough  and in fact those drone pilots have higher rates of PTSD than many of the units physically in Iraq. But some have worries that this disconnection will lead to something else  that it might make the contemplation of war crimes a lot easier when you have this distance.  It's like a video game   is what one young pilot described to me of taking out enemy troops from afar. As anyone who's played Grand Theft Auto knows  we do things in the video world that we wouldn't do face to face. So much of what you're hearing from me is that there's another side to technologic revolutions  and that it's shaping our present and maybe will shape our future of war. Moore's Law is operative  but so's Murphy's Law. The fog of war isn't being lifted. The enemy has a vote. We're gaining incredible new capabilities  but we're also seeing and experiencing new human dilemmas. Now  sometimes these are just  oops  moments  which is what the head of a robotics company described it  you just have  oops  moments. Well  what are  oops  moments with robots in war  Well  sometimes they're funny. Sometimes  they're like that scene from the Eddie Murphy movie  Best Defense   playing out in reality  where they tested out a machine gun armed robot  and during the demonstration it started spinning in a circle and pointed its machine gun at the reviewing stand of VIPs. Fortunately the weapon wasn't loaded and no one was hurt  but other times  oops  moments are tragic  such as last year in South Africa  where an anti aircraft cannon had a  software glitch   and actually did turn on and fired  and nine soldiers were killed. We have new wrinkles in the laws of war and accountability. What do we do with things like unmanned slaughter  What is unmanned slaughter  We've already had three instances of Predator drone strikes where we thought we got bin Laden  and it turned out not to be the case. And this is where we're at right now. This is not even talking about armed  autonomous systems with full authority to use force. And do not believe that that isn't coming. During my research I came across four different Pentagon projects on different aspects of that. And so you have this question  what does this lead to issues like war crimes  Robots are emotionless  so they don't get upset if their buddy is killed. They don't commit crimes of rage and revenge. But robots are emotionless. They see an    year old grandmother in a wheelchair the same way they see a T    tank  they're both just a series of zeroes and ones. And so we have this question to figure out  How do we catch up our   th century laws of war  that are so old right now that they could qualify for Medicare  to these   st century technologies  And so  in conclusion  I've talked about what seems the future of war  but notice that I've only used real world examples and you've only seen real world pictures and videos. And so this sets a great challenge for all of us that we have to worry about well before you have to worry about your Roomba sucking the life away from you. Are we going to let the fact that what's unveiling itself right now in war sounds like science fiction and therefore keeps us in denial  Are we going to face the reality of   st century war  Is our generation going to make the same mistake that a past generation did with atomic weaponry  and not deal with the issues that surround it until Pandora's box is already opened up  Now  I could be wrong on this  and one Pentagon robot scientist told me that I was. He said   There's no real social  ethical  moral issues when it comes to robots. That is   he added   unless the machine kills the wrong people repeatedly. Then it's just a product recall issue.  And so the ending point for this is that actually  we can turn to Hollywood. A few years ago  Hollywood gathered all the top characters and created a list of the top     heroes and top     villains of all of Hollywood history  the characters that represented the best and worst of humanity. Only one character made it onto both lists  The Terminator  a robot killing machine. And so that points to the fact that our machines can be used for both good and evil  but for me it points to the fact that there's a duality of humans as well. This week is a celebration of our creativity. Our creativity has taken our species to the stars. Our creativity has created works of arts and literature to express our love. And now  we're using our creativity in a certain direction  to build fantastic machines with incredible capabilities  maybe even one day an entirely new species. But one of the main reasons that we're doing that is because of our drive to destroy each other  and so the question we all should ask  is it our machines  or is it us that's wired for war  Thank you.

373,1414,1416,Pattie Maes + Pranav Mistry 2009,Pattie Maes + Pranav Mistry,both,Meet the SixthSense interaction,Mar 2009,511,I've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense    a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to meta information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we're coming across. And some of you may argue   Well  don't today's cell phones do that already   But I would say no. When you meet someone here at TED    and this is the top networking place  of course  of the year    you don't shake somebody's hand and then say   Can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you   Or when you go to the supermarket and you're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers  you don't take out your cell phone  and open a browser  and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make. So we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take. And so my research group at the Media Lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way  without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior. And I'm here to unveil our latest effort  and most successful effort so far  which is still very much a work in process. I'm actually wearing the device right now and we've sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf    and that  by the way  only cost     dollars at this point in time. I'm wearing a camera  just a simple web cam  a portable  battery powered projection system with a little mirror. These components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket which acts as the communication and computation device. And in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry  who's really the genius who's been implementing and designing this whole system. And we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him. The system tracks the four significant fingers. In this case  he's wearing simple marker caps that you may recognize. But if you want a more stylish version  you could also paint your nails in different colors. And the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he's making so he can just go to  for example  a map of Long Beach  zoom in and out  etc. The system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the  take a picture  gesture  and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you. And when he then walks back to the Media Lab  he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he's taken  sort through them and organize them  and re size them  etc.  again using all natural gestures. So  some of you most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by Jeff Han  or some of you may think   Well  doesn't this look like the Microsoft Surface Table   And yes  you also interact using natural gestures  both hands  etc. But the difference here is that you can use any surface  you can walk up to any surface  including your hand  if nothing else is available  and interact with this projected data. The device is completely portable  and can be    So  one important difference is that it's totally mobile. Another even more important difference is that in mass production  this would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging    could look a lot more stylish than this version that I'm wearing around my neck. But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in  Minority Report   the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you. So we see Pranav here going into the supermarket and he's shopping for some paper towels. And  as he picks up a product  the system can recognize the product that he's picking up  using either image recognition or marker technology  and give him the green light or an orange light. He can ask for additional information. So this particular choice here is a particularly good choice  given his personal criteria. Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice. If he picks up a book in the bookstore  he can get an Amazon rating    it gets projected right on the cover of the book. This is Juan's book  our previous speaker  which gets a great rating  by the way  at Amazon. And so  Pranav turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book    reader comments  maybe sort of information by his favorite critic  etc. If he turns to a particular page  he finds an annotation by maybe an expert or a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page. Reading the newspaper    it never has to be outdated. You can get video annotations of the events that you're reading about. You can get the latest sports scores  etc. This is a more controversial one. As you interact with someone at TED  maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags  the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages. In this case  the student is interested in cameras  etc. On your way to the airport  if you pick up your boarding pass  it can tell you that your flight is delayed  that the gate has changed  etc. And  if you need to know what the current time is  it's as simple as drawing a watch    on your arm. So that's where we're at so far in developing this sixth sense that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we may come across. My student Pranav  who's really  like I said  the genius behind this. He does deserve a lot of applause  because I don't think he's slept much in the last three months  actually. And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either. But it's not perfect yet  it's very much a work in progress. And who knows  maybe in another    years we'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant. Thank you.,,200903,6.23846743295019
378,610,612,Paul Rothemund 2007,Paul Rothemund,male,Playing with DNA that self-assembles,Nov 2007,12,There's an ancient and universal concept that words have power  that spells exist  and that if we could only pronounce the right words  then    whooosh    you know  an avalanche would come and wipe out the hobbits  right  So this is a very attractive idea because we're very lazy  like the sorcerer's apprentice  or the world's greatest computer programmer. And so this idea has a lot of traction with us. We love the idea that words  when pronounced    they're just little more than pure information  but they evoke some physical action in the real world that helps us do work. And so  of course  with lots of programmable computers and robots around this is an easy thing to picture. So how many of you know what I'm talking about  Raise your right hand. OK. How many of you don't know what I'm talking about  Raise your left hand. So that's great. So that was too easy. You guys have very insecure computers  OK  So now  the thing is that this is a different kind of spell. This is a computer program made of zeros and ones. It can be pronounced on a computer. It does something like this. The important thing is we can write it in a high level language. A computer magician can write this thing. It can be compiled into this    into zeros and ones    and pronounced by a computer. And that's what makes computers powerful  these high level languages that can be compiled. And so  I'm here to tell you  you don't need a computer to actually have a spell. In fact  what you can do at the molecular level is that if you encode information    you encode a spell or program as molecules    then physics can actually directly interpret that information and run a program. That's what happens in proteins. When this amino acid sequence gets pronounced as atoms  these little letters are sticky for each other. It collapses into a three dimensional shape that turns it into a nanomachine that actually cuts DNA. And the interesting thing is that if you change the sequence  you change the three dimensional folding. You get now a DNA stapler instead. These are the kind of molecular programs that we want to be able to write  but the problem is  we don't know the machine language of proteins. We don't have a compiler for proteins. So I've joined a growing band of people that try to make molecular spells using DNA. We use DNA because it's cheaper. It's easier to handle. It's something that we understand really well. We understand it so well  in fact  that we think we can actually write programming languages for DNA and have molecular compilers. So then  we think we can do that. And my first question doing this    or one of my questions doing this    was how can you make an arbitrary shape or pattern out of DNA  And I decided to use a type of DNA origami  where you take a long strand of DNA and fold it into whatever shape or pattern you might want. So here's a shape. I actually spent about a year in my home  in my underwear  coding  like Linus  Torvalds   in that picture before. And this program takes a shape  spits out     DNA sequences. These short DNA sequences are what are going to fold the long strand into this shape that we want to make. So you send an e mail with these sequences in it to a company  and what it does    the company pronounces them on a DNA synthesizer. It's a machine about the size of a photocopier. And what happens is  they take your e mail and every letter in your e mail  they replace with    atom cluster    one for each letter  A  T  C  and G in DNA. They string them up in the right sequence  and then they send them back to you via FedEx. So you get     of these in the mail in little tubes. I mix them together  add a little bit of salt water  and then add this long strand I was telling you about  that I've stolen from a virus. And then what happens is  you heat this whole thing up to about boiling. You cool it down to room temperature  and as you do  what happens is those short strands  they do the following thing  each one of them binds that long strand in one place  and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place  and brings those two parts of the long strand close together so that they stick together. And so the net effect of all     of these strands is to fold the long strand into the shape that you're looking for. It'll approximate that shape. We do this for real in the test tube. In each little drop of water you get    billion of these guys. You can look with a microscope and see them on a surface. And the neat thing is that if you change the sequence and change the spell  you just change the sequence of the staples. You can make a molecule that looks like this  and  you know  he likes to hang out with his buddies  right. And a lot of them are actually pretty good. If you change the spell again  you change the sequence again. You get really nice     nanometer triangles. If you do it again  you can get arbitrary patterns. So on a rectangle you can paint patterns of North and South America  or the words   DNA.  So that's DNA origami. That's one way. There are many ways of casting molecular spells using DNA. What we really want to do in the end is learn how to program self assembly so that we can build anything  right  We want to be able to build technological artifacts that are maybe good for the world. We want to learn how to build biological artifacts  like people and whales and trees. And if it's the case that we can reach that level of complexity  if our ability to program molecules gets to be that good  then that will truly be magic. Thank you very much.,DNA origamist,200711,6.332394366197184
379,1287,1289,Paul Rothemund 2008,Paul Rothemund,male,"DNA folding, in detail",Sep 2008,946,So  people argue vigorously about the definition of life. They ask if it should have reproduction in it  or metabolism  or evolution. And I don't know the answer to that  so I'm not going to tell you. I will say that life involves computation. So this is a computer program. Booted up in a cell  the program would execute  and it could result in this person  or with a small change  it could result in this person  or another small change  this person  or with a larger change  this dog  or this tree  or this whale. So now  if you take this metaphor  of  genome as program seriously  you have to consider that Chris Anderson is a computer fabricated artifact  as is Jim Watson  Craig Venter  as are all of us. And in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true  there are lots of similarities between genetic programs and computer programs that could help to convince you. But one  to me  that's most compelling is the peculiar sensitivity to small changes that can make large changes in biological development    the output. A small mutation can take a two wing fly and make it a four wing fly. Or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be. Or if you're familiar with  The Princess Bride   it could create a six fingered man. Now  a hallmark of computer programs is just this kind of sensitivity to small changes. If your bank account's one dollar  and you flip a single bit  you could end up with a thousand dollars. So these small changes are things that I think that    they indicate to us that a complicated computation in development is underlying these amplified  large changes. So now  all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology  and it shows the power of molecular programs    biology does. And what I want to do is write molecular programs  potentially to build technology. And there are a lot of people doing this  a lot of synthetic biologists doing this  like Craig Venter. And they concentrate on using cells. They're cell oriented. So my friends  molecular programmers  and I have a sort of biomolecule centric approach. We're interested in using DNA  RNA and protein  and building new languages for building things from the bottom up  using biomolecules  potentially having nothing to do with biology. So  these are all the machines in a cell. There's a camera. There's the solar panels of the cell  some switches that turn your genes on and off  the girders of the cell  motors that move your muscles. My little group of molecular programmers are trying to refashion all of these parts from DNA. We're not DNA zealots  but DNA is the cheapest  easiest to understand and easy to program material to do this. And as other things become easier to use    maybe protein    we'll work with those. If we succeed  what will molecular programming look like  You're going to sit in front of your computer. You're going to design something like a cell phone  and in a high level language  you'll describe that cell phone. Then you're going to have a compiler that's going to take that description and it's going to turn it into actual molecules that can be sent to a synthesizer and that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed. And what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately  is it will do a developmental computation  a molecular computation  and it'll build an electronic computer. And if I haven't revealed my prejudices already  I think that life has been about molecular computers building electrochemical computers  building electronic computers  which together with electrochemical computers will build new molecular computers  which will build new electronic computers  and so forth. And if you buy all of this  and you think life is about computation  as I do  then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist. So one big question is  how does a baby know when to stop growing  And for molecular programming  the question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing  Or how does a computer program know when to stop running  Or more to the point  how do you know if a program will ever stop  There are other questions like this  too. One of them is Craig Venter's question. Turns out I think he's actually a computer scientist. He asked  how big is the minimal genome that will give me a functioning microorganism  How few genes can I use  This is exactly analogous to the question  what's the smallest program I can write that will act exactly like Microsoft Word  And just as he's writing  you know  bacteria that will be smaller  he's writing genomes that will work  we could write smaller programs that would do what Microsoft Word does. But for molecular programming  our question is  how many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone  What's the smallest number we can get away with  Now  these are big questions in computer science. These are all complexity questions  and computer science tells us that these are very hard questions. Almost    many of them are impossible. But for some tasks  we can start to answer them. So  I'm going to start asking those questions for the DNA structures I'm going to talk about next. So  this is normal DNA  what you think of as normal DNA. It's double stranded  it's a double helix  has the As  Ts  Cs and Gs that pair to hold the strands together. And I'm going to draw it like this sometimes  just so I don't scare you. We want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix. When we synthesize it  it comes single stranded  so we can take the blue strand in one tube and make an orange strand in the other tube  and they're floppy when they're single stranded. You mix them together and they make a rigid double helix. Now for the last    years  Ned Seeman and a bunch of his descendants have worked very hard and made beautiful three dimensional structures using this kind of reaction of DNA strands coming together. But a lot of their approaches  though elegant  take a long time. They can take a couple of years  or it can be difficult to design. So I came up with a new method a couple of years ago I call DNA origami that's so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen and design the stuff on a laptop. But to do it  you need a long  single strand of DNA  which is technically very difficult to get. So  you can go to a natural source. You can look in this computer fabricated artifact  and he's got a double stranded genome    that's no good. You look in his intestines. There are billions of bacteria. They're no good either. Double strand again  but inside them  they're infected with a virus that has a nice  long  single stranded genome that we can fold like a piece of paper. And here's how we do it. This is part of that genome. We add a bunch of short  synthetic DNAs that I call staples. Each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place  and a right half that binds it in a different place  and brings the long strand together like this. The net action of many of these on that long strand is to fold it into something like a rectangle. Now  we can't actually take a movie of this process  but Shawn Douglas at Harvard has made a nice visualization for us that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it. And what happens is that we mix these strands together. We heat them up  we add a little bit of salt  we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down  and as we cool them down  the short strands bind the long strands and start to form structure. And you can see a little bit of double helix forming there. When you look at DNA origami  you can see that what it really is  even though you think it's complicated  is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other  and they're held together by places where short strands go along one helix and then jump to another one. So there's a strand that goes like this  goes along one helix and binds    it jumps to another helix and comes back. That holds the long strand like this. Now  to show that we could make any shape or pattern that we wanted  I tried to make this shape. I wanted to fold DNA into something that goes up over the eye  down the nose  up the nose  around the forehead  back down and end in a little loop like this. And so  I thought  if this could work  anything could work. So I had the computer program design the short staples to do this. I ordered them  they came by FedEx. I mixed them up  heated them  cooled them down  and I got    billion little smiley faces floating around in a single drop of water. And each one of these is just one thousandth the width of a human hair  OK  So  they're all floating around in solution  and to look at them  you have to get them on a surface where they stick. So  you pour them out onto a surface and they start to stick to that surface  and we take a picture using an atomic force microscope. It's got a needle  like a record needle  that goes back and forth over the surface  bumps up and down  and feels the height of the first surface. It feels the DNA origami. There's the atomic force microscope working and you can see that the landing's a little rough. When you zoom in  they've got  you know  weak jaws that flip over their heads and some of their noses get punched out  but it's pretty good. You can zoom in and even see the extra little loop  this little nano goatee. Now  what's great about this is anybody can do this. And so  I got this in the mail about a year after I did this  unsolicited. Anyone know what this is  What is it  It's China  right  So  what happened is  a graduate student in China  Lulu Qian  did a great job. She wrote all her own software to design and built this DNA origami  a beautiful rendition of China  which even has Taiwan  and you can see it's sort of on the world's shortest leash  right  So  this works really well and you can make patterns as well as shapes  OK  And you can make a map of the Americas and spell DNA with DNA. And what's really neat about it    well  actually  this all looks like nano artwork  but it turns out that nano artwork is just what you need to make nano circuits. So  you can put circuit components on the staples  like a light bulb and a light switch. Let the thing assemble  and you'll get some kind of a circuit. And then you can maybe wash the DNA away and have the circuit left over. So  this is what some colleagues of mine at Caltech did. They took a DNA origami  organized some carbon nano tubes  made a little switch  you see here  wired it up  tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch. Now  this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer  so we have a long way to go. But this is very promising because the origami can organize parts just one tenth the size of those in a normal computer. So it's very promising for making small computers. Now  I want to get back to that compiler. The DNA origami is a proof that that compiler actually works. So  you start with something in the computer. You get a high level description of the computer program  a high level description of the origami. You can compile it to molecules  send it to a synthesizer  and it actually works. And it turns out that a company has made a nice program that's much better than my code  which was kind of ugly  and will allow us to do this in a nice  visual  computer aided design way. So  now you can say  all right  why isn't DNA origami the end of the story  You have your molecular compiler  you can do whatever you want. The fact is that it does not scale. So if you want to build a human from DNA origami  the problem is  you need a long strand that's    trillion trillion bases long. That's three light years' worth of DNA  so we're not going to do this. We're going to turn to another technology  called algorithmic self assembly of tiles. It was started by Erik Winfree  and what it does  it has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a DNA origami. You zoom in  there are just four DNA strands and they have little single stranded bits on them that can bind to other tiles  if they match. And we like to draw these tiles as little squares. And if you look at their sticky ends  these little DNA bits  you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern. So  these tiles would make a complicated  self assembling checkerboard. And the point of this  if you didn't catch that  is that tiles are a kind of molecular program and they can output patterns. And a really amazing part of this is that any computer program can be translated into one of these tile programs    specifically  counting. So  you can come up with a set of tiles that when they come together  form a little binary counter rather than a checkerboard. So you can read off binary numbers five  six and seven. And in order to get these kinds of computations started right  you need some kind of input  a kind of seed. You can use DNA origami for that. You can encode the number    in the right hand side of a DNA origami  and when you add those tiles that count  they will start to count    they will read that    and they'll stop at   . So  what we've done is we've figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop going. It knows when to stop growing because it can count. It knows how big it is. So  that answers that sort of first question I was talking about. It doesn't tell us how babies do it  however. So now  we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things than DNA origami could otherwise. Here's the DNA origami  and what we can do is we can write    on both edges of the DNA origami  and we can now use our watering can and water with tiles  and we can start growing tiles off of that and create a square. The counter serves as a template to fill in a square in the middle of this thing. So  what we've done is we've succeeded in making something much bigger than a DNA origami by combining DNA origami with tiles. And the neat thing about it is  is that it's also reprogrammable. You can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation and you'll get    rather than   . And if you do that  the origami's the same size  but the resulting square that you get is three times bigger. So  this sort of recapitulates what I was telling you about development. You have a very sensitive computer program where small changes    single  tiny  little mutations    can take something that made one size square and make something very much bigger. Now  this    using counting to compute and build these kinds of things by this kind of developmental process is something that also has bearing on Craig Venter's question. So  you can ask  how many DNA strands are required to build a square of a given size  If we wanted to make a square of size         or        if we used DNA origami alone  we would require a number of DNA strands that's the square of the size of that square  so we'd need             or a million DNA strands. That's really not affordable. But if we use a little computation    we use origami  plus some tiles that count    then we can get away with using          or     DNA strands. And so we can exponentially reduce the number of DNA strands we use  if we use counting  if we use a little bit of computation. And so computation is some very powerful way to reduce the number of molecules you need to build something  to reduce the size of the genome that you're building. And finally  I'm going to get back to that sort of crazy idea about computers building computers. If you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it  the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory. So if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles    rather than to the staple strands  you affix them to the tiles    then they'll self assemble the somewhat complicated circuits  the demultiplexer circuits  that you need to address this memory. So you can actually make a complicated circuit using a little bit of computation. It's a molecular computer building an electronic computer. Now  you ask me  how far have we gotten down this path  Experimentally  this is what we've done in the last year. Here is a DNA origami rectangle  and here are some tiles growing from it. And you can see how they count. One  two  three  four  five  six  nine                . So it's got some errors  but at least it counts up. So  it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago  and that's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things  so I think we made a lot of progress. We've got ideas about how to fix these errors. And I think in the next five or    years  we'll make the kind of squares that I described and maybe even get to some of those self assembled circuits. So now  what do I want you to take away from this talk  I want you to remember that to create life's very diverse and complex forms  life uses computation to do that. And the computations that it uses  they're molecular computations  and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it  as Feynman said  you know  we need to build something to understand it. And so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing  rebuild everything from the bottom up  using DNA in ways that nature never intended  using DNA origami  and DNA origami to seed this algorithmic self assembly. You know  so this is all very cool  but what I'd like you to take from the talk  hopefully from some of those big questions  is that this molecular programming isn't just about making gadgets. It's not just making about    it's making self assembled cell phones and circuits. What it's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light  asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things.

380,952,954,Paul Tudor Jones II 2015,Paul Tudor Jones II,male,Why we need to rethink capitalism,Apr 2015,585,This is a story about capitalism. It's a system I love because of the successes and opportunities it's afforded me and millions of others. I started in my   s trading commodities  cotton in particular  in the pits  and if there was ever a free market free for all  this was it  where men wearing ties  but acting like gladiators fought literally  and physically for a profit. Fortunately  I was good enough that by the time I was     I was able to move into the upstairs  world of money management  where I spent the next three decades as a global macro trader. And over that time  I've seen a lot of crazy things in the markets  and I've traded a lot of crazy manias. And unfortunately  I'm sad to report that right now  we might be in the grips of one of the most disastrous  certainly of my career  and one consistent takeaway is manias never end well. Now  over the past    years  we as a society have come to view our companies and corporations in a very narrow  almost monomaniacal fashion with regard to how we value them  and we have put so much emphasis on profits  on short term quarterly earnings and share prices  at the exclusion of all else. It's like we've ripped the humanity out of our companies. Now  we don't do that    conveniently reduce something to a set of numbers that you can play with like Lego toys    we don't do that in our individual life. We don't treat somebody or value them based on their monthly income  or their credit score  but we have this double standard when it comes to the way that we value our businesses  and you know what  It's threatening the very underpinnings of our society. And here's how you'll see. This chart is corporate profit margins going back    years as a percentage of revenues  and you can see that we're at a    year high of   .  percent. Now  hooray if you're a shareholder  but if you're the other side of that  and you're the average American worker  then you can see it's not such a good thing.   U.S. Share of Income Going to Labor vs. CEO to Worker Compensation Ratio   Now  higher profit margins do not increase societal wealth. What they actually do is they exacerbate income inequality  and that's not a good thing. But intuitively  that makes sense  right  Because if the top    percent of American families own    percent of the stocks  as they take a greater share of corporate profits  then there's less wealth left for the rest of society. Again  income inequality is not a good thing. This next chart  made by The Equality Trust  shows    countries from Austria to Japan to New Zealand. On the horizontal axis is income inequality. The further to the right you go  the greater the income inequality. On the vertical axis are nine social and health metrics. The more you go up that  the worse the problems are  and those metrics include life expectancy  teenage pregnancy  literacy  social mobility  just to name a few. Now  those of you in the audience who are Americans may wonder  well  where does the United States rank  Where does it lie on that chart  And guess what  We're literally off the chart. Yes  that's us  with the greatest income inequality and the greatest social problems  according to those metrics. Now  here's a macro forecast that's easy to make  and that's  that gap between the wealthiest and the poorest  it will get closed. History always does it. It typically happens in one of three ways  either through revolution  higher taxes  or wars. None of those are on my bucket list. Now  there's another way to do it  and that's by increasing justness in corporate behavior  but the way that we're operating right now  that would require a tremendous change in behavior  and like an addict trying to kick a habit  the first step is to acknowledge that you have a problem. And let me just say  this profits mania that we're on is so deeply entrenched that we don't even realize how we're harming society. Here's a small but startling example of exactly how we're doing that  this chart shows corporate giving as a percentage of profits   not revenues  over the last    years. Juxtapose that to the earlier chart of corporate profit margins  and I ask you  does that feel right  In all fairness  when I started writing this  I thought   Oh wow  what does my company  what does Tudor do   And I realized we give one percent of corporate profits to charity every year. And I'm supposed to be a philanthropist. When I realized that  I literally wanted to throw up. But the point is  this mania is so deeply entrenched that well intentioned people like myself don't even realize that we're part of it. Now  we're not going to change corporate behavior by simply increasing corporate philanthropy or charitable contributions. And oh  by the way  we've since quadrupled that  but     Applause     Please. But we can do it by driving more just behavior. And one way to do it is actually trusting the system that got us here in the first place  and that's the free market system. About a year ago  some friends of mine and I started a not for profit called Just Capital. Its mission is very simple  to help companies and corporations learn how to operate in a more just fashion by using the public's input to define exactly what the criteria are for just corporate behavior. Now  right now  there's no widely accepted standard that a company or corporation can follow  and that's where Just Capital comes in  because beginning this year and every year we'll be conducting a nationwide survey of a representative sample of        Americans to find out exactly what they think are the criteria for justness in corporate behavior. Now  this is a model that's going to start in the United States but can be expanded anywhere around the globe  and maybe we'll find out that the most important thing for the public is that we create living wage jobs  or make healthy products  or help  not harm  the environment. At Just Capital  we don't know  and it's not for us to decide. We're but messengers  but we have     percent confidence  and faith in the American public to get it right. So we'll release the findings this September for the first time  and then next year  we'll poll again  and we'll take the additive step this time of ranking the       largest U.S. companies from number one to number       and everything in between. We're calling it the Just Index  and remember  we're an independent not for profit with no bias  and we will be giving the American public a voice. And maybe over time  we'll find out that as people come to know which companies are the most just  human and economic resources will be driven towards them  and they'll become the most prosperous and help our country be the most prosperous. Now  capitalism has been responsible for every major innovation that's made this world a more inspiring and wonderful place to live in. Capitalism has to be based on justice. It has to be  and now more than ever  with economic divisions growing wider every day. It's estimated that    percent of American workers can be displaced in the next    years. I'm not against progress. I want the driverless car and the jet pack just like everyone else. But I'm pleading for recognition that with increased wealth and profits has to come greater corporate social responsibility.  If justice is removed   said Adam Smith  the father of capitalism   the great  the immense fabric of human society must in a moment crumble into atoms.  Now  when I was young  and there was a problem  my mama used to always sigh and shake her head and say   Have mercy  have mercy.  Now's not the time for us  for the rest of us to show them mercy. The time is now for us to show them fairness  and we can do that  you and I  by starting where we work  in the businesses that we operate in. And when we put justness on par with profits  we'll get the most wonderful thing in all the world. We'll take back our humanity. Thank you.,Investor,201504,6.228143712574848
392,1636,1638,Philip K. Howard 2010,Philip K. Howard,male,Four ways to fix a broken legal system,Feb 2010,1062,I've always been interested in the relationship of formal structures and human behavior. If you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town  people will move there. Well  law is also a powerful driver of human behavior. And what I'd like to discuss today is the need to overhaul and simplify the law to release the energy and passion of Americans  so that we can begin to address the challenges of our society. You might have noticed that law has grown progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two. If you run a business  it's hard to do much of anything without calling your general counsel. Indeed  there is this phenomenon now where the general counsels are becoming the CEOs. It's a little bit like the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. You need a lawyer to run the company  because there's so much law. But it's not just business that's affected by this  it's actually pressed down into the daily activities of ordinary people. A couple of years ago I was hiking near Cody  Wyoming. It was in a grizzly bear preserve  although no one told me that before we went. And our guide was a local science teacher. She was wholly unconcerned about the bears  but she was terrified of lawyers. The stories started pouring out. She'd just been involved in an episode where a parent had threatened to sue the school because she lowered the grade of the student by    percent when he turned the paper in late. The principal didn't want to stand up to the parent because he didn't want to get dragged into some legal proceedings. So  she had to go to meeting after meeting  same arguments made over and over again. After    days of sleepless nights  she finally capitulated and raised the grade. She said   Life's too short  I just can't keep going with this.  About the same time  she was going to take two students to a leadership conference in Laramie  which is a couple of hours away  and she was going to drive them in her car  but the school said   No  you can't drive them in the car for liability reasons. You have to go in a school bus.  So  they provided a bus that held    people and drove the three of them back and forth several hours to Laramie. Her husband is also a science teacher  and he takes his biology class on a hike in the nearby national park. But he was told he couldn't go on the hike this year because one of the students in the class was disabled  so the other    students didn't get to go on the hike either. At the end of this day I could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher. Now  we've been taught to believe that law is the foundation of freedom. But somehow or another  in the last couple of decades  the land of the free has become a legal minefield. It's really changed our lives in ways that are sort of imperceptible  and yet  when you pull back  you see it all the time. It's changed the way we talk. I was talking to a pediatrician friend in North Carolina. He said   Well you know  I don't deal with patients the same way anymore. You wouldn't want to say something off the cuff that might be used against you.  This is a doctor  whose life is caring for people. My own law firm has a list of questions that I'm not allowed to ask when interviewing candidates  such as the sinister question  bulging with hidden motives and innuendo   Where are you from   Now for    years  tort reformers have been sounding the alarm that lawsuits are out of control. And we read every once in while about these crazy lawsuits  like the guy in the District of Columbia who sued his dry cleaners for    million dollars because they lost his pair of pants. The case went on for two years  I think he's still appealing the case. But the reality is  these crazy cases are relatively rare. They don't usually win. And the total of direct tort cost in this country is about two percent  which is twice as much as in other countries but  as taxes go  hardly crippling. But the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg. What's happened here  again  almost without our knowing  is our culture has changed. People no longer feel free to act on their best judgment. So  what do we do about it  We certainly don't want to give up the rights  when people do something wrong  to seek redress in the courts. We need regulation to make sure people don't pollute and such. We lack even a vocabulary to deal with this problem  and that's because we have the wrong frame of reference. We've been trained to think that the way to look at every dispute  every issue  is a matter of kind of individual rights. And so we peer through a legal microscope  and look at everything. Is it possible that there are extenuating circumstances that explain why Johnny turned his paper in late in Cody  Wyoming  Is it possible that the doctor might have done something differently when the sick person gets sicker  And of course the hindsight bias is perfect. There's always a different scenario that you can sketch out where it's possible that something could have been done differently. And yet  we've been trained to squint into this legal microscope  hoping that we can judge any dispute against the standard of a perfect society  where everyone will agree what's fair  and where accidents will be extinct  risk will be no more. Of course  this is Utopia  it's a formula for paralysis  not freedom. It's not the basis of the rule of law  it's not the basis of a free society. So  now I have the first of four propositions I'm going to leave with you about how you simplify the law  You've got to judge law mainly by its effect on the broader society  not individual disputes. Absolutely vital. So  let's pull back from the anecdotes for a second and look at our society from high above. Is it working  What does the macro data show us  Well  the healthcare system has been transformed  a culture pervaded with defensiveness  universal distrust of the system of justice  universal practice of defensive medicine. It's very hard to measure because there are mixed motives. Doctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes  and also they no longer even know what's right or wrong. But reliable estimates range between    billion and     billion dollars per year. That's enough to provide care to all the people in America who don't have it. The trial lawyers say   Well  this legal fear makes doctors practice better medicine.  Well that's been studied too  by the Institute of Medicine and others. Turns out that's not the case. The fear has chilled professional interaction so thousands of tragic errors occur because doctors are afraid to speak up   Are you sure that's the right dosage   Because they're not sure  and they don't want to take legal responsibility. Let's go to schools. As we saw with the teacher in Cody  Wyoming  she seems to be affected by the law. Well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law. You could have a separate section of a law library around each of the following legal concepts  due process  special education  no child left behind  zero tolerance  work rules ... it goes on. We did a study of all the rules that affect one school in New York. The Board of Ed. had no idea. Tens of thousands of discreet rules     steps to suspend a student from school  It's a formula for paralysis. What's the effect of that  One is a decline in order. Again  studies have shown it's directly attributable to the rise of due process. Public agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago where they found that    percent of the high school teachers in America say that they spend at least half of their time maintaining order in the classroom. That means those students are getting half the learning they're supposed to  because if one child is disrupting the class no one can learn. And what happens when the teacher tries to assert order  They're threatened with a legal claim. We also surveyed that. Seventy eight percent of the middle and high school teachers in America have been threatened by their students with violating their rights  with lawsuits by their students. They are threatening  their students. It's not that they usually sue  it's not that they would win  but it's an indication of the corrosion of authority. And how has this system of law worked for government  It doesn't seem to be working very well does it  Neither in Sacramento nor in Washington. The other day at the State of the Union speech  President Obama said  and I think we could all agree with this goal   From the first railroads to the interstate highway system  our nation has always been the first to compete. There is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains.  Well  actually there is a reason  Environmental review has evolved into a process of no pebble left unturned for any major project taking the better part of a decade  then followed by years of litigation by anybody who doesn't like the project. Then  just staying above the Earth for one more second  people are acting like idiots  all across the country. Idiots. A couple of years ago  Broward County  Florida  banned running at recess. That means all the boys are going to be ADD. I mean it's just absolutely a formula for failure. My favorite  though  are all the warning labels.  Caution  Contents are hot   on billions of coffee cups. Archeologists will dig us up in a thousand years and they won't know about defensive medicine and stuff  but they'll see all these labels   Contents are extremely hot.  They'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac. That's the only explanation. Because why would you have to tell people that something was actually hot  My favorite warning was one on a five inch fishing lure. I grew up in the South and whiled away the summers fishing. Five inch fishing lure  it's a big fishing lure  with a three pronged hook in the back  and outside it said   Harmful if swallowed.  So  none of these people are doing what they think is right. And why not  They don't trust the law. Why don't they trust the law  Because it gives us the worst of both worlds  It's random    anybody can sue for almost anything and take it to a jury  not even an effort at consistency    and it's also too detailed. In the areas that are regulated  there are so many rules no human could possibly know it. Well how do you fix it  We could spend        lifetimes trying to prune this legal jungle. But the challenge here is not one of just amending the law  because the hurdle for success is trust. People    for law to be the platform for freedom  people have to trust it. So  that's my second proposition  Trust is an essential condition to a free society. Life is complicated enough without legal fear. But law is different than other kinds of uncertainties  because it carries with it the power of state. And so the state can come in. It actually changes the way people think. It's like having a little lawyer on your shoulders all day long  whispering in your ear   Could that go wrong  Might that go wrong   It drives people from the smart part of the brain    that dark  deep well of the subconscious  where instincts and experience  and all the other factors of creativity and good judgment are    it drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic. Pretty soon the doctor's saying   Well  I doubt if that headache could be a tumor  but who would protect me if it were  So maybe I'll just order the MRI.  Then you've wasted     billion dollars in unnecessary tests. If you make people self conscious about their judgments  studies show you will make them make worse judgments. If you tell the pianist to think about how she's hitting the notes when she's playing the piece  she can't play the piece. Self consciousness is the enemy of accomplishment. Edison stated it best. He said   Hell  we ain't got no rules around here  we're trying to accomplish something.  So  how do you restore trust  Tweaking the law's clearly not good enough  and tort reform  which is a great idea  lowers your cost if you're a businessperson  but it's like a Band Aid on this gaping wound of distrust. States with extensive tort reform still suffer all these pathologies. So  what's needed is not just to limit claims  but actually create a dry ground of freedom. It turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure. And it is this  Law sets boundaries  and on one side of those boundaries are all the things you can't do or must do    you can't steal  you've got to pay your taxes    but those same boundaries are supposed to define and protect a dry ground of freedom. Isaiah Berlin put it this way   Law sets frontiers  not artificially drawn  within which men shall be inviolable.  We've forgotten that second part. Those dikes have burst. People wade through law all day long. So  what's needed now is to rebuild these boundaries. And it's especially important to rebuild them for lawsuits. Because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries for everybody else's freedom. If someone brings a lawsuit over   A kid fell off the seesaw   it doesn't matter what happens in the lawsuit  all the seesaws will disappear. Because no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit. And that's what's happened. There are no seesaws  jungle gyms  merry go rounds  climbing ropes  nothing that would interest a kid over the age of four  because there's no risk associated with it. So  how do we rebuild it  Life is too complex for... Life is too complex for a software program. All these choices involve value judgments and social norms  not objective facts. And so here is the fourth proposition. This is what we have  the philosophy we have to change to. And there are two essential elements of it  We have to simplify the law. We have to migrate from all this complexity towards general principles and goals. The constitution is only    pages long. Worked pretty well for     years. Law has to be simple enough so that people can internalize it in their daily choices. If they can't internalize it  they won't trust it. And how do you make it simple  Because life is complex  and here is the hardest and biggest change  We have to restore the authority to judges and officials to interpret and apply the law. We have to rehumanize the law. To make law simple so that you feel free  the people in charge have to be free to use their judgment to interpret and apply the law in accord with reasonable social norms. As you're going down  and walking down the sidewalk during the day  you have to think that if there is a dispute  there's somebody in society who sees it as their job to affirmatively protect you if you're acting reasonably. That person doesn't exist today. This is the hardest hurdle. It's actually not very hard. Ninety eight percent of cases  this is a piece of cake. Maybe you've got a claim in small claims court for your lost pair of pants for       but not in a court of general jurisdiction for millions of dollars. Case dismissed without prejudice or refiling in small claims court. Takes five minutes. That's it  it's not that hard. But it's a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksand because we woke up in the     s to all these really bad values  racism  gender discrimination  pollution    they were bad values. And we wanted to create a legal system where no one could have bad values anymore. The problem is  we created a system where we eliminated the right to have good values. It doesn't mean that people in authority can do whatever they want. They're still bounded by legal goals and principles  The teacher is accountable to the principal  the judge is accountable to an appellate court  the president is accountable to voters. But the accountability's up the line judging the decision against the effect on everybody  not just on the disgruntled person. You can't run a society by the lowest common denominator. So  what's needed is a basic shift in philosophy. We can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy. We've been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom. It's not true. Authority  in fact  is essential to freedom. Law is a human institution  responsibility is a human institution. If teachers don't have authority to run the classroom  to maintain order  everybody's learning suffers. If the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims  then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders. If the environmental agency can't decide that the power lines are good for the environment  then there's no way to bring the power from the wind farms to the city. A free society requires red lights and green lights  otherwise it soon descends into gridlock. That's what's happened to America. Look around. What the world needs now is to restore the authority to make common choices. It's the only way to get our freedom back  and it's the only way to release the energy and passion needed so that we can meet the challenges of our time.

393,1357,1359,Philip Rosedale 2008,Philip Rosedale,male,Life in Second Life,Dec 2008,1692,You know  we're going to do things a little differently. I'm not going to show you a presentation. I'm going to talk to you. And at the same time  we're going to look at just images from a photo stream that is pretty close to live of things that    snapshots from Second Life. So hopefully this will be fascinating. You can    I can compete for your attention with the strange pictures that you see on screen that come from there. I thought I'd talk a little bit about some just big ideas about this  and then get John back out here so we can talk interactively a little bit more and think and ask questions. You know  I guess the first question is  why build a virtual world at all  And I think the answer to that is always going to be at least driven to a certain extent by the people initially crazy enough to start the project  you know. So I can give you a little bit of first background just on me and what moved me as a    really going back as far as a teenager and then an adult  to actually try and build this kind of thing. I was a very creative kid who read a lot  and got into electronics first  and then later  programming computers  when I was really young. I was just always trying to make things. I was just obsessed with taking things apart and building things  and just anything I could do with my hands or with wood or electronics or metal or anything else. And so  for example    and it's a great Second Life thing    I had a bedroom. And every kid  you know  as a teenager  has got his bedroom he retreats to    but I wanted my door  I thought it would be cool if my door went up rather than opened  like on Star Trek. I thought it would be neat to do that. And so I got up in the ceiling and I cut through the ceiling joists  much to my parents' delight  and put the door  you know  being pulled up through the ceiling. I built    I put a garage door opener up in the attic that would pull this door up. You can imagine the amount of time that it took me to do this to the house and the displeasure of my parents. The thing that was always striking to me was that we as people could have so many really amazing ideas about things we'd like to do  but are so often unable  in the real world  to actually do those things    to actually cobble together the materials and go through the actual execution phase of building something that you imagine from a design perspective. And so for me  I know that when the Internet came around and I was doing computer programming and just  you know  just generally trying to run my own little company and figure out what to do with the Internet and with computers  I was just immediately struck by how the ultimate thing that you would really want to do with the Internet and with computers would be to use the Internet and connected computers to simulate a world to sort of recreate the laws of physics and the rules of how things went together    the sort of    the idea of atoms and how to make things  and do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff. And so for me that was the thing that was so enticing. I just wanted this place where you could build things. And so I think you see that in the genesis of what has happened with Second Life  and I think it's important. I also think that more generally  the use of the Internet and technology as a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general trend. It is a    sort of a great human progress. Technology is just generally being used to allow us to create in as shared and social a way as possible. And I think that Second Life and virtual worlds more generally represent the best we can do to achieve that right now. You know  another way to look at that  and related to the content and  you know  thinking about space  is to connect sort of virtual worlds to space. I thought that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second. If you think about going into space  it's a fascinating thing. So many movies  so many kids  we all sort of dream about exploring space. Now  why is that  Stop for a moment and ask  why that conceit  Why do we as people want to do that  I think there's a couple of things. It's what we see in the movies    you know  it's this dream that we all share. One is that if you went into space you'd be able to begin again. In some sense  you would become someone else in that journey  because there wouldn't be    you'd leave society and life as you know it  behind. And so inevitably  you would transform yourself    irreversibly  in all likelihood    as you began this exploration. And then the second thing is that there's this tangible sense that if you travel far enough  you can find out there    oh  yeah    you have no idea what you're going to find once you get there  into space. It's going to be different than here. And in fact  it's going to be so different than what we see here on earth that anything is going to be possible. So that's kind of the idea    we as humans crave the idea of creating a new identity and going into a place where anything is possible. And I think that if you really sit and think about it  virtual worlds  and where we're going with more and more computing technology  represent essentially the likely  really tactically possible version of space exploration. We are moved by the idea of virtual worlds because  like space  they allow us to reinvent ourselves and they contain anything and everything  and probably anything could happen there. You know  to give you a size idea about scale  you know  comparing space to Second Life  most people don't realize  kind of    and then this is just like the Internet in the early '  s. In fact  Second Life virtual worlds are a lot like the Internet in the early '  s today  everybody's very excited  there's a lot of hype and excitement about one idea or the next from moment to moment  and then there's despair and everybody thinks the whole thing's not going to work. Everything that's happening with Second Life and more broadly with virtual worlds  all happened in the early '  s. We always play a game at the office where you can take any article and find the same article where you just replace the words  Second Life  with  Web   and  virtual reality  with  Internet.  You can find exactly the same articles written about everything that people are observing. To give you an idea of scale  Second Life is about        CPUs at this point. It's about        computers connected together in three facilities in the United States right now  that are simulating this virtual space. And the virtual space itself    there's about         people a day that are wandering around in there  so the kind of  active population is something like a smallish city. The space itself is about    times the size of San Francisco  and it's about as densely built out. So it gives you an idea of scale. Now  it's expanding very rapidly    about five percent a month or so right now  in terms of new servers being added. And so of course  radically unlike the real world  and like the Internet  the whole thing is expanding very  very quickly  and historically exponentially. So that sort of space exploration thing is matched up here by the amount of content that's in there  and I think that amount is critical. It was critical with the virtual world that it be this space of truly infinite possibility. We're very sensitive to that as humans. You know  you know when you see it. You know when you can do anything in a space and you know when you can't. Second Life today is this        machines  and it's about     million or so user created objects where  you know  an object would be something like this  possibly interactive. Tens of millions of them are thinking all the time  they have code attached to them. So it's a really large world already  in terms of the amount of stuff that's there and that's very important. If anybody plays  like  World of Warcraft  World of Warcraft comes on  like  four DVDs. Second Life  by comparison  has about     terabytes of user created data  making it about        times larger. So again  like the Internet compared to AOL  and the sort of chat rooms and content on AOL at the time  what's happening here is something very different  because the sheer scale of what people can do when they're enabled to do anything they want is pretty amazing. The last big thought is that it is almost certainly true that whatever this is going to evolve into is going to be bigger in total usage than the Web itself. And let me justify that with two statements. Generically  what we use the Web for is to organize  exchange  create and consume information. It's kind of like Irene talking about Google being data driven. I'd say I kind of think about the world as being information. Everything that we interact with  all the experiences that we have  is kind of us flowing through a sea of information and interacting with it in different ways. The Web puts information in the form of text and images. The topology  the geography of the Web is text to text links for the most part. That's one way of organizing information  but there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual world that I think are the important ways that they're very different and much better than what we've been able to do to date with the Web. The first is that  as I said  the    well  the first difference for virtual worlds is that information is presented to you in the virtual world using the most powerful iconic symbols that you can possibly use with human beings. So for example  C H A I R is the English word for that  but a picture of this is a universal symbol. Everybody knows what it means. There's no need to translate it. It's also more memorable if I show you that picture  and I show you C H A I R on a piece of paper. You can do tests that show that you'll remember that I was talking about a chair a couple of days later a lot better. So when you organize information using the symbols of our memory  using the most common symbols that we've been immersed in all our lives  you maximally both excite  stimulate  are able to remember  transfer and manipulate data. And so virtual worlds are the best way for us to essentially organize and experience information. And I think that's something that people have talked about for    years    you know  that  D  that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us. But the second thing    and I think this one is less obvious    is that the experience of creating  consuming  exploring that information is in the virtual world implicitly and inherently social. You are always there with other people. And we as humans are social creatures and must  or are aided by  or enjoy more  the consumption of information in the presence of others. It's essential to us. You can't escape it. When you're on Amazon.com and you're looking for digital cameras or whatever  you're on there right now  when you're on the site  with like       other people  but you can't talk to them. You can't just turn to the people that are browsing digital cameras on the same page as you  and ask them   Hey  have you seen one of these before  Because I'm thinking about buying it.  That experience of like  shopping together  just as a simple example  is an example of how as social creatures we want to experience information in that way. So that second point  that we inherently experience information together or want to experience it together  is critical to essentially  kind of  this trend of where we're going to use technology to connect us. And so I think  again  that it's likely that in the next decade or so these virtual worlds are going to be the most common way as human beings that we kind of use the electronics of the Internet  if you will  to be together  to consume information. You know  mapping in India    that's such a great example. Maybe the solution there involves talking to other people in real time. Asking for advice  rather than any possible way that you could just statically organize a map. So I think that's another big point. I think that wherever this is all going  whether it's Second Life or its descendants  or something broader that happens all around the world at a lot of different points    this is what we're going to see the Internet used for  and total traffic and total unique users is going to invert  so that the Web and its bibliographic set of text and graphical information is going to become a tool or a part of that consumption pattern  but the pattern itself is going to happen mostly in this type of an environment. Big idea  but I think highly defensible. So let me stop there and bring John back  and maybe we can just have a longer conversation. Thank you. John. That's great. John Hockenberry  Why is the creation  the impulse to create Second Life  not a utopian impulse  Like for example  in the   th century  any number of works of literature that imagined alternative worlds were explicitly utopian. Philip Rosedale  I think that's great. That's such a deep question. Yeah. Is a virtual world likely to be a utopia  would be one way I'd say it. The answer is no  and I think the reason why is because the Web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms up. That idea of infinite possibility  that magic of anything can happen  only happens in an environment where you really know that there's a fundamental freedom at the level of the individual actor  at the level of the Lego blocks  if you will  that make up the virtual world. You have to have that level of freedom  and so I'm often asked that  you know  is there a  kind of  utopian or  is there a utopian tendency to Second Life and things like it  that you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it  Those top down schemes are alienating to just about everybody  even if you mean well when you build them. And what's more  human society  when it's controlled  when you set out a grand scheme of rules  a new way of people interacting  or a new way of laying out a city  or whatever  that stuff historically has never scaled much beyond  you know    I always laughingly say    the Mall of America  you know  which is like  the largest piece of centrally designed architecture that  you know  has been built. JH  The Kremlin was pretty big. PR  The Kremlin  yeah. That's true. The whole complex. JH  Give me a story of a tool you created at the beginning in Second Life that you were pretty sure people would want to use in the creation of their avatars or in communicating that people actually in practice said  no  I'm not interested in that at all  and name something that you didn't come up with that almost immediately people began to demand. PR  I'm sure I can think of multiple examples of both of those. One of my favorites. I had this feature that I built into Second Life    I was really passionate about it. It was an ability to kind of walk up close to somebody and have a more private conversation  but it wasn't instant messaging because you had to sort of befriend somebody. It was just this idea that you could kind of have a private chat. I just remember it was one of those examples of data driven design. I thought it was such a good idea from my perspective  and it was just absolutely never used  and we ultimately    I think we've now turned it off  if I remember. We finally gave up  took it out of the code. But more generally  you know  one other example I think about this  which is great relative to the utopian idea. Second Life originally had    simulators. It now has       . So when it only had     it was only about as big as this college campus. And we had    we zoned it  you know  we put a nightclub  we put a disco where you could dance  and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to  and we had another place that was like a boardwalk  kind of a Coney Island. And we laid out the zoning  but of course  people could build all around it however they wanted to. And what was so amazing right from the start was that the idea that we had put out in the zoning concept  basically  was instantly and thoroughly ignored  and like  two months into the whole thing     which is really a small amount of time  even in Second Life time    I remember the users  the people who were then using Second Life  the residents came to me and said  we want to buy the disco    because I had built it    we want to buy that land and raze it and put houses on it. And I sold it to them    I mean  we transferred ownership and they had a big party and blew up the entire building. And I remember that that was just so telling  you know  that you didn't know exactly what was going to happen. When you think about stuff that people have built that's popular    JH  CBGB's has to close eventually  you know. That's the rule. PR  Exactly. And it    but it closed on day one  basically  in Internet time. You know  an example of something    pregnancy. You can have a baby in Second Life. This is done entirely using  kind of  the tools that are built into Second Life  so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby  of course    Second Life is  at the platform level  at the level of the company    at Linden Lab    Second Life has no game properties to it whatsoever. There is no attempt to structure the experience  to make it utopian in that sense that we put into it. So of course  we never would have put a mechanism for having babies or  you know  taking two avatars and merging them  or something. But people built the ability to have babies and care for babies as a purchasable experience that you can have in Second Life and so    I mean  that's a pretty fascinating example of  you know  what goes on in the overall economy. And of course  the existence of an economy is another idea. I didn't talk about it  but it's a critical feature. When people are given the opportunity to create in the world  there's really two things they want. One is fair ownership of the things they create. And then the second one is    if they feel like it  and they're not going to do it in every case  but in many they are    they want to actually be able to sell that creation as a way of providing for their own livelihood. True on the Web    also true in Second Life. And so the existence of an economy is critical. JH  Questions for Philip Rosedale  Right here. JH  The observation is  Philip has been accused of looking like a character  an avatar  in Second Life. Respond  and then we'll get the rest of your question. PR  But I don't look like my avatar. How many people here know what my avatar looks like  That's probably not very many. JH  Are you ripping off somebody else's avatar with that  sort of    PR  No  no. I didn't. One of the other guys at work had a fantastic avatar    a female avatar    that I used to be once in a while. But my avatar is a guy wearing chaps. Spiky hair    spikier than this. Kind of orange hair. Handlebar mustache. Kind of a Village People sort of a character. So  very cool. JH  And your question  JH  The question is  there appears to be a lack of cultural fine tuning in Second Life. It doesn't seem to have its own culture  and the sort of differences that exist in the real world aren't translated into the Second Life map. PR  Well  first of all  we're very early  so this has only been going on for a few years. And so part of what we see is the same evolution of human behavior that you see in emerging societies. So a fair criticism    is what it is    of Second Life today is that it's more like the Wild West than it is like Rome  from a cultural standpoint. That said  the evolution of  and the nuanced interaction that creates culture  is happening at    times the speed of the real world  and in an environment where  if you walk into a bar in Second Life     percent of the people there are not in the United States  and in fact are speaking their  you know  various and different languages. In fact  one of the ways to make money in Second Life is to make really cool translators that you drag onto your body and they basically  kind of  pop up on your screen and allow you to use Google or Babel Fish or one of the other online text translators to on the fly translate spoken    I'm sorry    typed text between individuals. And so  the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot that's happening inside Second Life is quite    I think  quite remarkable relative to what in real human terms in the real world we've ever been able to achieve. So  I think that culture will fine tune  it will emerge  but we still have some years to wait while that happens  as you would naturally expect. JH  Other questions  Right here. JH  What's your demographic  PR  So  the question is  what's the demographic. So  the average age of a person in Second Life is     however  the use of Second Life increases dramatically as your physical age increases. So as you go from age    to age       and there are many people in their sixties using Second Life    this is also not a sharp curve    it's very  very distributed    usage goes up in terms of  like  hours per week by    percent as you go from age    to age    in real life  so there's not    many people make the mistake of believing that Second Life is some kind of an online game. Actually it's generally unappealing    I'm just speaking broadly and critically    it's not very appealing to people that play online video games  because the graphics are not yet equivalent to    I mean  these are very nice pictures  but in general the graphics are not quite equivalent to the fine tuned graphics that you see in a Grand Theft Auto  . So average age    . I mentioned    percent of the users are not in the United States. The distribution amongst countries is extremely broad. There's users from  you know  virtually every country in the world now in Second Life. The dominant ones are    if you take the UK and Europe  together they make up about    percent of the usage base in Second Life. In terms of psychographic    oh  men and women  men and women are almost equally matched in Second Life  so about    percent of the people online right now on Second Life are women. Women use Second Life  though  about    to    percent more  on an hours basis  than men do  meaning that more men sign up than women  and more women stay and use it than men. So that's another demographic fact. In terms of psychographic  you know  the people in Second Life are remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think  when you go in and talk to them and meet them  and I would  you know  challenge you to just do this and find out. But it's not a bunch of programmers. It's not easy to describe as a demographic. If I had to just sort of paint a broad picture  I'd say  remember the people who were really getting into eBay in the first few years of eBay  Maybe a little bit like that  in other words  people who are early adopters. They tend to be creative. They tend to be entrepreneurial. A lot of them    about        people so far    are cash flow positive  they're making money from what    I mean  real world money    from what they're doing in Second Life  so it's a very build    still a creative  building things  build your own business type of an orientation. So  that's it. JH  You describe yourself  Philip  as someone who was really creative when you were young and  you know  liked to make things. I mean  it's not often that you hear somebody describe themselves as really creative. I suspect that's possibly a euphemism for C student who spent a lot of time in his room  Is it possible  PR  I was a    there were times I was a C student. You know  it's funny. When I got to college    I studied physics in college    and I got really    it was funny  because I was definitely a more antisocial kid. I read all the time. I was shy. I don't seem like it now  but I was very shy. Moved around a bunch    had that experience too. So I did  kind of  I think  live in my own world  and obviously that helps  you know  engage your real interest in something. JH  So you're on your fifth life at this point  PR  If you count  yeah  cities. So    but I did    and I didn't do    I think I didn't do as well in school as I could have. I think you're right. I wasn't  like  an obsessed    you know  get A's kind of guy. I was going to say  I had a great social experience when I went to college that I hadn't had before  a more fraternal experience  where I met six or seven other guys who I studied physics with  and I was very competitive with them  so then I started to get A's. But you're right  I wasn't an A student. JH  Last question. Right here. JH  You want to paraphrase that  PR  Yeah  so let me restate that. So  you're saying that in the pamphlet there's a statement that we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones    our more malleable or manageable digital identities to our real identities    and that in fact  much of human life and human experience may move into the digital realm. And then that's kind of a horrifying thought  of course. That's a frightening change  frightening disruption. I guess  and you're asking  what do I think about that  How do I    JH  What's your response to the people who would say  that's horrifying  what would be your response   PR  Well  I'd say a couple of things. One is  it's disturbing like the Internet or electricity was. That is to say  it's a big change  but it isn't avoidable. So  no amount of backpedaling or intentional behavior or political behavior is going to keep these technology changes from connecting us together  because the basic motive that people have    to be creative and entrepreneurial    is going to drive energy into these virtual worlds in the same way that it has with the Web. So this change  I believe  is a huge disruptive change. Obviously  I'm the optimist and a big believer in what's going on here  but I think that as    even a sober  you know  the most sober  disconnected thinker about this  looking at it from the side  has to conclude  based on the data  that with those kinds of economic forces at play  there is definitely going to be a sea change  and that change is going to be intensely disruptive relative to our concept of our very lives and being  and our identities  as well. I don't think we can get away from those changes. I think generally  we were talking about this    I think that generally being present in a virtual world and being challenged by it  being    surviving there  having a good life there  so to speak  is a challenge because of the multiculturality of it  because of the languages  because of the entrepreneurial richness of it  the sort of flea market nature  if you will  of the virtual world today. It puts challenges on us to rise to. We must be better than ourselves  in many ways. We must learn things and  you know  be more tolerant  and be smarter and learn faster and be more creative  perhaps  than we are typically in our real lives. And I think that if that is true of virtual worlds  then these changes  though scary    and  I say  inevitable    are ultimately for the better  and therefore something that we should ride out. But I would say that    and many other authors and speakers about this  other than me  have said  you know  fasten your seat belts because the change is coming. There are going to be big changes.

395,2021,2023,Philip Zimbardo 2011,Philip Zimbardo,male,The demise of guys?,Aug 2011,266,So today  I want us to reflect on the demise of guys. Guys are flaming out academically  they're wiping out socially with girls and sexually with women. Other than that  there's not much of a problem. So what's the data  So the data on dropping out is amazing. Boys are    percent more likely than girls to drop out of school. In Canada  five boys drop out for every three girls. Girls outperform boys now at every level  from elementary school to graduate school. There's a    percent differential between getting BA's and all graduate programs  with guys falling behind girls. Two thirds of all students in special ed. remedial programs are guys. And as you all know  boys are five times more likely than girls to be labeled as having attention deficit disorder    and therefore we drug them with Ritalin. What's the evidence of wiping out  First  it's a new fear of intimacy. Intimacy means physical  emotional connection with somebody else    and especially with somebody of the opposite sex who gives off ambiguous  contradictory  phosphorescent signals. And every year there's research done on self reported shyness among college students. And we're seeing a steady increase among males. And this is two kinds. It's a social awkwardness. The old shyness was a fear of rejection. It's a social awkwardness like you're a stranger in a foreign land. They don't know what to say  they don't know what to do  especially one on one  with the  opposite sex. They don't know the language of face contact  the non verbal and verbal set of rules that enable you to comfortably talk to somebody else  listen to somebody else. There's something I'm developing here called social intensity syndrome  which tries to account for why guys really prefer male bonding over female mating. It turns out  from earliest childhood  boys  and then men  prefer the company of guys    physical company. And there's actually a cortical arousal we're looking at  because guys have been with guys in teams  in clubs  in gangs  in fraternities  especially in the military  and then in pubs. And this peaks at Super Bowl Sunday when guys would rather be in a bar with strangers  watching a totally overdressed Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers  rather than Jennifer Lopez totally naked in the bedroom. The problem is they now prefer  the  asynchronistic Internet world to the spontaneous interaction in social relationships. What are the causes  Well  it's an unintended consequence. I think it's excessive Internet use in general  excessive video gaming  excessive new access to pornography. The problem is these are arousal addictions. Drug addiction  you simply want more. Arousal addiction  you want different. Drugs  you want more of the same    different. So you need the novelty in order for the arousal to be sustained. And the problem is the industry is supplying it. Jane McGonigal told us last year that by the time a boy is     he's played        hours of video games  most of that in isolation. As you remember  Cindy Gallop said men don't know the difference between making love and doing porn. The average boy now watches    porn video clips a week. And there's some guy watching a hundred  obviously. And the porn industry is the fastest growing industry in America       billion annually. For every     movies made in Hollywood  there are        now made porn videos. So the effect  very quickly  is it's a new kind of arousal. Boys' brains are being digitally rewired in a totally new way for change  novelty  excitement and constant arousal. That means they're totally out of sync in traditional classes  which are analog  static  interactively passive. They're also totally out of sync in romantic relationships  which build gradually and subtly. So what's the solution  It's not my job. I'm here to alarm. It's your job to solve. But who should care  The only people who should care about this is parents of boys and girls  educators  gamers  filmmakers and women who would like a real man who they can talk to  who can dance  who can make love slowly and contribute to the evolutionary pressures to keep our species above banana slugs. No offense to banana slug owners. Thank you.,Psychologist,201108,5.995435897435898
398,211,213,Raghava KK 2012,Raghava KK,male,What's your 200-year plan?,Jul 2012,642,About    years ago  my grandfather  a young man  walked into a tent that was converted into a movie theater like that  and he fell hopelessly in love with the woman he saw on the silver screen  none other than Mae West  the heartthrob of the '  s  and he could never forget her. In fact  when he had his daughter many years later  he wanted to name her after Mae West  but can you imagine an Indian child name Mae West  The Indian family said  no way  So when my twin brother Kaesava was born  he decided to tinker with the spelling of Keshava's name. He said  if Mae West can be M A E  why can't Keshava be K A E  So he changed Kaesava's spelling. Now Kaesava had a baby boy called Rehan a couple of weeks ago. He decided to spell  or  rather  misspell Raehan with an A E. You know  my grandfather died many years ago when I was little  but his love for Mae West lives on as a misspelling in the DNA of his progeny. That for me is successful legacy.  Laughs  You know  as for me  my wife and I have our own crazy legacy project. We actually sit every few years  argue  disagree  fight  and actually come up with our very own     year plan. Our friends think we're mad. Our parents think we're cuckoo. Because  you know  we both come from families that really look up to humility and wisdom  but we both like to live larger than life. I believe in the concept of a Raja Yogi  Be a dude before you can become an ascetic. This is me being a rock star  even if it's in my own house. You know  So when Netra and I sat down to make our first plan    years ago  we said we want the focus of this plan to go way beyond ourselves. What do we mean by beyond ourselves  Well     years  we calculated  is at the end of our direct contact with the world. There's nobody I'll meet in my life will ever live beyond     years  so we thought that's a perfect place where we should situate our plan and let our imagination take flight. You know  I never really believed in legacy. What am I going to leave behind  I'm an artist. Until I made a cartoon about     . It caused so much trouble for me. I was so upset. You know  a cartoon that was meant to be a cartoon of the week ended up staying so much longer. Now I'm in the business of creating art that will definitely even outlive me  and I think about what I want to leave behind through those paintings. You know  the      cartoon upset me so much that I decided I'll never cartoon again. I said  I'm never going to make any honest public commentary again. But of course I continued creating artwork that was honest and raw  because I forgot about how people reacted to my work. You know  sometimes forgetting is so important to remain idealistic. Perhaps loss of memory is so crucial for our survival as human beings. One of the most important things in my     year plan that Netra and I write is what to forget about ourselves. You know  we carry so much baggage  from our parents  from our society  from so many people    fears  insecurities    and our     year plan really lists all our childhood problems that we have to expire. We actually put an expiry date on all our childhood problems. The latest date I put was  I said  I am going to expire my fear of my leftist  feminist mother in law  and this today is the date   Laughs  She's watching.  Laughter  Anyway  you know  I really make decisions all the time about how I want to remember myself  and that's the most important kind of decisions I make. And this directly translates into my paintings. But like my friends  I can do that really well on Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Flickr  YouTube. Name it  I'm on it. I've started outsourcing my memory to the digital world  you know  But that comes with a problem. It's so easy to think of technology as a metaphor for memory  but our brains are not perfect storage devices like technology. We only remember what we want to. At least I do. And I rather think of our brains as biased curators of our memory  you know  And if technology is not a metaphor for memory  what is it  Netra and I use our technology as a tool in our     year plan to really curate our digital legacy. That is a picture of my mother  and she recently got a Facebook account. You know where this is going. And I've been very supportive until this picture shows up on my Facebook page.  Laughter  And I actually untagged myself first  then I picked up the phone. I said   Mom  you will never put a picture of me in a bikini ever again.  And she said   Why  You look so cute  darling.  I said   You just don't understand.  Maybe we are among the first generation that really understands this digital curating of ourselves. Maybe we are the first to even actively record our lives. You know  whether you agree with  you know  legacy or not  we are actually leaving behind digital traces all the time. So Netra and I really wanted to use our     year plan to curate this digital legacy  and not only digital legacy but we believe in curating the legacy of my past and future. How  you may ask  Well  when I think of the future  I never see myself moving forward in time. I actually see time moving backward towards me. I can actually visualize my future approaching. I can dodge what I don't want and pull in what I want. It's like a video game obstacle course. And I've gotten better and better at doing this. Even when I make a painting  I actually imagine I'm behind the painting  it already exists  and someone's looking at it  and I see whether they're feeling it from their gut. Are they feeling it from their heart  or is it just a cerebral thing  And it really informs my painting. Even when I do an art show  I really think about  what should people walk away with  I remember when I was     I did  I wanted to do my first art exhibition  and I wanted the whole world to know about it. I didn't know TED then  but what I did was I closed my eyes tight  and I started dreaming. I could imagine people coming in  dressed up  looking beautiful  my paintings with all the light  and in my visualization I actually saw a very famous actress launching my show  giving credibility to me. And I woke up from my visualization and I said  who was that  I couldn't tell if it was Shabana Azmi or Rekha  two very famous Indian actresses  like the Meryl Streeps of India. As it turned out  next morning I wrote a letter to both of them  and Shabana Azmi replied  and came and launched my very first show    years ago. And what a bang it started my career with  You know  when we think of time in this way  we can curate not only the future but also the past. This is a picture of my family  and that is Netra  my wife. She's the co creator of my     year plan. Netra's a high school history teacher. I love Netra  but I hate history. I keep saying   Nets  you live in the past while I'll create the future  and when I'm done  you can study about it.  She gave me an indulgent smile  and as punishment  she said   Tomorrow I'm teaching a class on Indian history  and you are sitting in it  and I'm grading you.  I'm like   Oh  God.  I went. I actually went and sat in on her class. She started by giving students primary source documents from India  Pakistan  from Britain  and I said   Wow.  Then she asked them to separate fact from bias. I said   Wow   again. Then she said   Choose your facts and biases and create an image of your own story of dignity.  History as an imaging tool  I was so inspired. I went and created my own version of Indian history. I actually included stories from my grandmother. She used to work for the telephone exchange  and she used to actually overhear conversations between Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten. And she used to hear all kinds of things she shouldn't have heard. But  you know  I include things like that. This is my version of Indian history. You know  if this is so  it occurred to me that maybe  just maybe  the primary objective of our brains is to serve our dignity. Go tell Facebook to figure that out  Netra and I don't write our     year plan for someone else to come and execute it in     years. Imagine receiving a parcel saying  from the past  okay now you're supposed to spend the rest of your life doing all of this. No. We actually write it only to set our attitudes right. You know  I used to believe that education is the most important tool to leave a meaningful legacy. Education is great. It really teaches us who we are  and helps us contextualize ourselves in the world  but it's really my creativity that's taught me that I can be much more than what my education told me I am. I'd like to make the argument that creativity is the most important tool we have. It lets us create who we are  and curate what is to come. I like to think    Thank you. I like to think of myself as a storyteller  where my past and my future are only stories  my stories  waiting to be told and retold. I hope all of you one day get a chance to share and write your own     year story. Thank you so much. Shukran   Applause ,Artist,201207,6.187237569060769
399,1642,1644,Raghava KK 2010,Raghava KK,male,My 5 lives as an artist,Feb 2010,1043,I think it was in my second grade that I was caught drawing the bust of a nude by Michelangelo. I was sent straight away to my school principal  and my school principal  a sweet nun  looked at my book with disgust  flipped through the pages  saw all the nudes    you know  I'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and I'd copy her    and the nun slapped me on my face and said   Sweet Jesus  this kid has already begun.  I had no clue what she was talking about  but it was convincing enough for me never to draw again until the ninth grade. Thanks to a really boring lecture  I started caricaturing my teachers in school. And  you know  I got a lot of popularity. I don't play sports. I'm really bad at sports. I don't have the fanciest gadgets at home. I'm not on top of the class. So for me  cartooning gave me a sense of identity. I got popular  but I was scared I'd get caught again. So what I did was I quickly put together a collage of all the teachers I had drawn  glorified my school principal  put him right on top  and gifted it to him. He had a good laugh at the other teachers and put it up on the notice board. This is a part of that. And I became a school hero. All my seniors knew me. I felt really special. I have to tell you a little bit about my family. That's my mother. I love her to bits. She's the one who taught me how to draw and  more importantly  how to love. She's a bit of a hippie. She said   Don't say that   but I'm saying it anyway. The rest of my family are boring academics  busy collecting Ivy League decals for our classic Ambassador car. My father's a little different. My father believed in a holistic approach to living  and  you know  every time he taught us  he'd say   I hate these books  because these books are hijacked by Industrial Revolution.  While he still held that worldview  I was     I got the best lawyer in town  my older brother Karthik  and I sat him down  and I said   Pa  from today onwards I've decided I'm going to be disciplined  I'm going to be curious  I'm going to learn something new every day  I'm going to be very hard working  and I'm not going to depend on you emotionally or financially.  And he was very impressed. He was all tearing up. Ready to hug me. And I said   Hold that thought.  I said   Can I quit school then   But  to cut a long story short  I quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist. I must have done about        caricatures. I would do birthday parties  weddings  divorces  anything for anyone who wanted to use my services. But  most importantly  while I was traveling  I taught children cartooning  and in exchange  I learned how to be spontaneous. And mad and crazy and fun. When I started teaching them  I said let me start doing this professionally. When I was    I started my own school. However  an    year old trying to start a school is not easy unless you have a big patron or a big supporter. So I was flipping through the pages of the Times of India when I saw that the Prime Minister of India was visiting my home town  Bangalore. And  you know  just like how every cartoonist knows Bush here  and if you had to meet Bush  it would be the funnest thing because his face was a cartoonist's delight. I had to meet my Prime Minister. I went to the place where his helicopter was about to land. I saw layers of security. I caricatured my way through three layers by just impressing the guards  but I got stuck. I got stuck at the third. And what happened was  to my luck  I saw a nuclear scientist at whose party I had done cartoons. I ran up to him  and said   Hello  sir. How do you do   He said   What are you doing here  Raghava   I said   I'm here to meet the Prime Minister.  He said   Oh  so am I.  I hopped into his car  and off we went through the remaining layers of security. Thank you. I sat him down  I caricatured him  and since then I've caricatured hundreds of celebrities. This is one I remember fondly. Salman Rushdie was pissed off I think because I altered the map of New York  if you notice. Anyway  the next slide I'm about to show you    Should I just turn that off  The next slide I'm about to show you  is a little more serious. I was hesitant to include this in my presentation because this cartoon was published soon after     . What was  for me  a very naive observation  turned out to be a disaster. That evening  I came home to hundreds of hate mails  hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this. I was also asked to leave the organization  a cartoonists' organization in America  that for me was my lifeline. That's when I realized  you know  cartoons are really powerful  art comes with responsibility. Anyway  what I did was I decided that I need to take a break. I quit my job at the papers  I closed my school  and I wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks  and I decided to go traveling. When I went traveling  I remember  I met this fabulous old man  who I met when I was caricaturing  who turned out to be an artist  in Italy. He invited me to his studio. He said   Come and visit.  When I went  I saw the ghastliest thing ever. I saw this dead  naked effigy of himself hanging from the ceiling. I said   Oh  my God. What is that   And I asked him  and he said   Oh  that thing  In the night  I die. In the morning  I am born again.  I thought he was koo koo  but something about that really stuck. I loved it. I thought there was something really beautiful about that. So I said   I am dead  so I need to be born again.  So  I wanted to be a painter like him  except  I don't know how to paint. So  I tried going to the art store. You know  there are a hundred types of brushes. Forget it  they will confuse you even if you know how to draw. So I decided  I'm going to learn to paint by myself. I'm going to show you a very quick clip to show you how I painted and a little bit about my city  Bangalore. They had to be larger than life. Everything had to be larger. The next painting was even bigger. And even bigger. And for me it was  I had to dance while I painted. It was so exciting. Except  I even started painting dancers. Here for example is a Flamenco dancer  except there was one problem. I didn't know the dance form  so I started following them  and I made some money  sold my paintings and would rush off to France or Spain and work with them. That's Pepe Linares  the renowned Flamenco singer. But I had one problem  my paintings never danced. As much energy as I put into them while making them  they never danced. So I decided    I had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning. I called my friends  painted on their bodies  and had them dance in front of a painting. And  all of a sudden  my paintings came alive. And then I was fortunate enough to actually perform this in California with Velocity Circus. And I sat like you guys there in the audience. And I saw my work come alive. You know  normally you work in isolation  and you show at a gallery  but here  the work was coming alive  and it had some other artists working with me. The collaborative effort was fabulous. I said  I'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody I meet. I started doing fashion. This is a fashion show we held in London. The best collaboration  of course  is with children. They are ruthless  they are honest  but they're full of energy and fun. This is a work  a library I designed for the Robin Hood Foundation. And I must say  I spent time in the Bronx working with these kids. And  in exchange for me working with them  they taught me how to be cool. I don't think I've succeeded  but they've taught me. They said   Stop saying sorry. Say  my bad.  Then I said  all this is good  but I want to paint like a real painter. American education is so expensive. I was in India  and I was walking down the streets  and I saw a billboard painter. And these guys paint humongous paintings  and they look really good. And I wondered how they did it from so close. So  one day I had the opportunity to meet one of these guys  and I said   How do you paint like that  Who taught you   And he said   Oh  it's very easy. I can teach you  but we're leaving the city  because billboard painters are a dying  extinct bunch of artists  because digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them.  I said  in exchange for education in how to paint  I will support them  and I started a company. And since then  I've been painting all over the place. This is a painting I did of my wife in my apartment. This is another painting. And  in fact  I started painting on anything  and started sending them around town. Since I mentioned my wife  the most important collaboration has been with her  Netra. Netra and I met when she was   . I must have been    and a half then  and it was love at first sight. I lived in India. She lived in America. She'd come every two months to visit me  and then I said I'm the man  I'm the man  and I have to reciprocate. I have to travel seven oceans  and I have to come and see you. I did that twice  and I went broke. So then I said   Nets  what do I do   She said   Why don't you send me your paintings  My dad knows a bunch of rich guys. We'll try and con them into buying it  and then...  But it turned out  after I sent the works to her  that her dad's friends  like most of you  are geeks. I'm joking. No  they were really big geeks  and they didn't know much about art. So Netra was stuck with    paintings of mine. So what we did was we rented a little van and we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it. She contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work. She made enough money  she sold off the whole collection and made enough money to move me for four years with lawyers  a company  everything  and she became my manager. That's us in New York. Notice one thing  we're equal here. Something happened along the line. But this brought me    with Netra managing my career    it brought me a lot of success. I was really happy. I thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar. I loved the attention. This is all the press we got  and we said  it's time to celebrate. And I said that the best way to celebrate is to marry Netra. I said   Let's get married.  And I said   Not just married. Let's invite everyone who's helped us  all the people who bought our work.  And you won't believe it  we put together a list of       people  who had made a difference    a ridiculous list  but I was determined to bring them to India  so    a lot of them were in India.     artists volunteered to help me with my wedding. We had fashion designers  installation artists  models  we had makeup artists  jewelry designers  all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation. And I had a special installation in tribute to my in laws. I had the vegetable carvers work on that for me. But all this excitement led to the press writing about us. We were in the papers  we're still in the news three years later  but  unfortunately  something tragic happened right after. My mother fell very ill. I love my mother and I was told all of a sudden that she was going to die. And they said you have to say bye to her  you have to do what you have to do. And I was devastated. I had shows booked up for another year. I was on a high. And I couldn't. I could not. My life was not exuberant. I could not live this larger than life person. I started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind. Of course  my work turned ugly  but another thing happened. I lost all my audiences. The Bollywood stars who I would party with and buy my work disappeared. The collectors  the friends  the press  everyone said   Nice  but thank you.   No thank you   was more like it. But I wanted people to actually feel my work from their gut  because I was painting it from my gut. If they wanted beauty  I said  this is the beauty I'm willing to give you. It's politicized. Of course  none of them liked it. My works also turned autobiographical. At this point  something else happened. A very  very dear friend of mine came out of the closet  and in India at that time  it was illegal to be gay  and it's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person. I was very upset. I remember the time when my mother used to dress me up as a little girl    that's me there    because she wanted a girl  and she has only boys. Anyway  I don't know what my friends are going to say after this talk. It's a secret. So  after this  my works turned a little violent. I talked about this masculinity that one need not perform. And I talked about the weakness of male sexuality. This time  not only did my collectors disappear  the political activists decided to ban me and to threaten me and to forbid me from showing. It turned nasty  and I'm a bit of a chicken. I can't deal with any threat. This was a big threat. So  I decided it was time to end and go back home. This time I said let's try something different. I need to be reborn again. And I thought the best way  as most of you know who have children  the best way to have a new lease on life  is to have a child. I decided to have a child  and before I did that  I quickly studied what can go wrong. How can a family get dysfunctional  And Rudra was born. That's my little son. And two magical things happened after he was born. My mother miraculously recovered after a serious operation  and this man was elected president of this country. You know I sat at home and I watched. I teared up and I said that's where I want to be. So Netra and I wound up our life  closed up everything we had  and we decided to move to New York. And this was just eight months ago. I moved back to New York  my work has changed. Everything about my work has become more whimsical. This one is called  What the Fuck Was I Thinking   It talks about mental incest. You know  I may appear to be a very nice  clean  sweet boy. But I'm not. I'm capable of thinking anything. But I'm very civil in my action  I assure you. These are just different cartoons. And  before I go  I want to tell you a little story. I was talking to mother and father this morning  and my dad said   I know you have so much you want to say  but you have to talk about your work with children.  So I said  okay. I work with children all over the world  and that's an entirely different talk  but I want to leave you with one story that really  really inspired me. I met Belinda when she was   . I was   . I was in Australia  and Belinda had cancer  and I was told she's not going to live very long. They  in fact  told me three weeks. I walk into her room  and there was a shy girl  and she was bald  and she was trying to hide her baldness. I whipped out my pen  and I started drawing on her head and I drew a crown for her. And then  we started talking  and we spent a lovely time    I told her how I ended up in Australia  how I backpacked and who I conned  and how I got a ticket  and all the stories. And I drew it out for her. And then I left. Belinda died and within a few days of her death  they published a book for her  and she used my cartoon on the cover. And she wrote a little note  she said   Hey Rags  thank you for the magic carpet ride around the world.  For me  my art is my magic carpet ride. I hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride  and touch children and be honest. Thank you so much.,Artist,201002,6.128313106796117
401,832,834,Raul Midon 2008,Raul Midon,male,"""Tembererana""",Jan 2008,627,It's really quite an honor to be here tonight  and I'm really glad that I stayed here and listened because I've really been inspired. And I'm going to play some songs for you tonight that are  literally  world premieres. I've been working on my new record and I've never played these songs for anybody except the microphone. This is a song that I wrote about the meaning of technology  which goes perfectly with this gathering. I started thinking about    when I was in college  especially as a blind person  doing a research paper was a major undertaking. You had to go to the library  see if you could get them to find the books for you  you know  footnotes and all that. Now you can just go on Google. Just look it up. I wish I had that when I was in college. Anyway  this is a song about  we have all this  but what are we going to do with it  It's called  All the Answers.    What is the weather in Cincinnati      What is the time in Tokyo      Who is this little child's daddy      And who the hell needs to know      Why do memories of you linger     when I'm trying to reach my goal      And why must I move my fingers     to the music in my soul      I don't know.     I don't have to know.     'Cause here I go ...     and I got all the answers     right here in my hand.     And I got all the answers     and I don't have to understand     'cause I got all the answers.     Think I'll rummage through the century     while I listen to the sea.     Oh  it's good to be so free      so free.     Who was mayor of Chicago     back in           And why did Shakespeare create Iago     to tear apart a love so pure      How can my dreams be so vivid     in a psychosonic way      Why must I become so livid     about the news I hear today      I don't know.     I don't have to know.     And here I go ...     'cause I got all the answers     right here in my hand.     And I got all the answers.     See  I don't have to understand     'cause I got all the answers.     I think I'll browse on through     the tabloid news     while I sip my tea.     Mm  it's good to be so free.     I never ever have to be alone.     I can do it all right here in my home.     Yeah  mm hmm ...     Everything that's ever been known      I can punch it up right here on my phone.     Freedom train  coming soon     right here in my living room     from Baton Rouge to Saskatoon     and all points in between.     'Cause I got all the answers     right here on my screen.     And I got all the answers  yeah.     I got every book and magazine.     I got all  I got all  I got all ...     I got all the answers      all the answers  oh yeah.     Uh huh ...     But I tell you what I'm going to do      I'm going to find the capitol of Peru     or the latitude of Kathmandu.     I'm gonna Google it     'cause everybody's doing it.     And then I'll rummage through the century.     I got all  I got all  I got all ...     I got all the answers.     Yeah  yeah     I got all the answers.   Thank you. Whew  It's a miracle I didn't make any mistakes on that song. That's the first time I've ever played it. It's a  feel the fear and do it anyway  kind of thing. This next song is a song that started out as a dream    a childhood dream. It was one of the titles that I was sort of thinking about calling my record  except there's a couple of problems. One thing is  it's unpronounceable. And it's a made up word. It's called  Tembererana.  And the song is based on what I think was my first childhood attempts to think about invisible forces. So  tembererana  was these dreams  in which I would be running away from bad feelings    is the only way I can put it. So this is called  Tembererana.  It's based on an Argentinian rhythm called  carnivalito.    A dream within a dream      a world within a world      the sound of a primal scream     travels out across the land.     Images flickering      the sound of the war machine      a procession of limousines     travels slowly across the land.     Another child could use a hand.     Reaching out from within     tembererana  hey  tembererana ...     Annihilation moves.     The earth is an open tomb.     The sound of the final boom     rumbles fiercely across the land.     Fear  you're the enemy.     Obliterating all but thee.     You see what you want to see.     Before I'm blinded  I will toast     the shade of power that I love most      the power of creation.     Tembererana  hey  tembererana ...     Da  da  da  da     Da  da  da  da  da  da  da     As a child  alone and afraid      escaping the impressions every feeling made      I would run  run away     into a world where the good was the aim of the game     and the sum of invisible power     had a name.     It's the same name.     Tembererana  hey  tembererana ...     Da  da  da  da  da  da  da     Tembere  tembere  tembere  tembererana     Tembere  tembere  tembere  tembererana  hey     Tembererana  hey     Tembererana ...  ,Guitarist,200801,6.154954954954955

Thank you so much. This is a song that came about because I think it's difficult to be in the world and not be aware of what's going on  and the wars and so forth. This song kind of came out of all of that. And I wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record  which I still stand by  but this has got something else in it. It's called  Peace on Earth.    There is no hope.     There is no future.     No faith in God to save the day.     There is no reason  no understanding     no sacred place to hide away.     There is no earnest conversation.     No words of wisdom from the wise.     There is no reconciliation     and no collective compromise.     Peace on Earth      that's what we want.     Peace on Earth      that's what we all say.     Peace on Earth.     Yet  there in the hallway     lurks the ghost of war.     He wants more  and more  and more  and more      and more  and more  and more  and more.     There is no darkness  no sunshine.     There is no great society.     There is no freedom without conviction.     There is no freedom to be free.     There is no heaven  no fire and brimstone.     There is no brotherhood of man.     There is no country  no one religion.     There is no universal plan.     Peace on Earth      that's what we want.

He wants more  and more  and more  and more      and more  and more  and more  and more  and more.     The answer is     mutual assured destruction      a balance of power      a weapon for everyone.     Mutual assured destruction     bringing peace to everyone.     Peace on Earth      that's what we want.     Peace on Earth      that's what we all say.     Peace on Earth.     There in the hallway      peace on Earth.     Peace on Earth.

403,1475,1477,Ray Kurzweil 2006,Ray Kurzweil,male,The accelerating power of technology,Nov 2006,1369,Well  it's great to be here. We've heard a lot about the promise of technology  and the peril. I've been quite interested in both. If we could convert  .   percent of the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy  we could meet all of our projected needs for     . We can't do that today because solar panels are heavy  expensive and very inefficient. There are nano engineered designs  which at least have been analyzed theoretically  that show the potential to be very lightweight  very inexpensive  very efficient  and we'd be able to actually provide all of our energy needs in this renewable way. Nano engineered fuel cells could provide the energy where it's needed. That's a key trend  which is decentralization  moving from centralized nuclear power plants and liquid natural gas tankers to decentralized resources that are environmentally more friendly  a lot more efficient and capable and safe from disruption. Bono spoke very eloquently  that we have the tools  for the first time  to address age old problems of disease and poverty. Most regions of the world are moving in that direction. In       in East Asia and the Pacific region  there were     million people living in poverty    that number now is under     million. The World Bank projects by       it will be under    million  which is a reduction of    percent. I did enjoy Bono's comment linking Haight Ashbury to Silicon Valley. Being from the Massachusetts high tech community myself  I'd point out that we were hippies also in the     s  although we hung around Harvard Square. But we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty  and I'm going to talk about those issues  if we have the will. Kevin Kelly talked about the acceleration of technology. That's been a strong interest of mine  and a theme that I've developed for some    years. I realized that my technologies had to make sense when I finished a project. That invariably  the world was a different place when I would introduce a technology. And  I noticed that most inventions fail  not because the R D department can't get it to work    if you look at most business plans  they will actually succeed if given the opportunity to build what they say they're going to build    and    percent of those projects or more will fail  because the timing is wrong    not all the enabling factors will be in place when they're needed. So I began to be an ardent student of technology trends  and track where technology would be at different points in time  and began to build the mathematical models of that. It's kind of taken on a life of its own. I've got a group of    people that work with me to gather data on key measures of technology in many different areas  and we build models. And you'll hear people say  well  we can't predict the future. And if you ask me  will the price of Google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now  that's very hard to say. Will WiMax CDMA G  be the wireless standard three years from now  That's hard to say. But if you ask me  what will it cost for one MIPS of computing in       or the cost to sequence a base pair of DNA in       or the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in       it turns out that those are very predictable. There are remarkably smooth exponential curves that govern price performance  capacity  bandwidth. And I'm going to show you a small sample of this  but there's really a theoretical reason why technology develops in an exponential fashion. And a lot of people  when they think about the future  think about it linearly. They think they're going to continue to develop a problem or address a problem using today's tools  at today's pace of progress  and fail to take into consideration this exponential growth. The Genome Project was a controversial project in     . We had our best Ph.D. students  our most advanced equipment around the world  we got         th of the project done  so how're we going to get this done in    years  And    years into the project  the skeptics were still going strong    says   You're two thirds through this project  and you've managed to only sequence a very tiny percentage of the whole genome.  But it's the nature of exponential growth that once it reaches the knee of the curve  it explodes. Most of the project was done in the last few years of the project. It took us    years to sequence HIV    we sequenced SARS in    days. So we are gaining the potential to overcome these problems. I'm going to show you just a few examples of how pervasive this phenomena is. The actual paradigm shift rate  the rate of adopting new ideas  is doubling every decade  according to our models. These are all logarithmic graphs  so as you go up the levels it represents  generally multiplying by factor of    or    . It took us half a century to adopt the telephone  the first virtual reality technology. Cell phones were adopted in about eight years. If you put different communication technologies on this logarithmic graph  television  radio  telephone were adopted in decades. Recent technologies    like the PC  the web  cell phones    were under a decade. Now this is an interesting chart  and this really gets at the fundamental reason why an evolutionary process    and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes    accelerate. They work through interaction    they create a capability  and then it uses that capability to bring on the next stage. So the first step in biological evolution  the evolution of DNA    actually it was RNA came first    took billions of years  but then evolution used that information processing backbone to bring on the next stage. So the Cambrian Explosion  when all the body plans of the animals were evolved  took only    million years. It was     times faster. And then evolution used those body plans to evolve higher cognitive functions  and biological evolution kept accelerating. It's an inherent nature of an evolutionary process. So Homo sapiens  the first technology creating species  the species that combined a cognitive function with an opposable appendage    and by the way  chimpanzees don't really have a very good opposable thumb    so we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip and fine motor coordination  and use our mental models to actually change the world and bring on technology. But anyway  the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years  and then working through interaction  evolution used  essentially  the technology creating species to bring on the next stage  which were the first steps in technological evolution. And the first step took tens of thousands of years    stone tools  fire  the wheel    kept accelerating. We always used then the latest generation of technology to create the next generation. Printing press took a century to be adopted  the first computers were designed pen on paper    now we use computers. And we've had a continual acceleration of this process. Now by the way  if you look at this on a linear graph  it looks like everything has just happened  but some observer says   Well  Kurzweil just put points on this graph that fall on that straight line.  So  I took    different lists from key thinkers  like the Encyclopedia Britannica  the Museum of Natural History  Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar on the same    and these people were not trying to make my point  these were just lists in reference works  and I think that's what they thought the key events were in biological evolution and technological evolution. And again  it forms the same straight line. You have a little bit of thickening in the line because people do have disagreements  what the key points are  there's differences of opinion when agriculture started  or how long the Cambrian Explosion took. But you see a very clear trend. There's a basic  profound acceleration of this evolutionary process. Information technologies double their capacity  price performance  bandwidth  every year. And that's a very profound explosion of exponential growth. A personal experience  when I was at MIT    computer taking up about the size of this room  less powerful than the computer in your cell phone. But Moore's Law  which is very often identified with this exponential growth  is just one example of many  because it's basically a property of the evolutionary process of technology. I put    famous computers on this logarithmic graph    by the way  a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth    that's another exponential. It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in       two years in the middle  we're now doubling it every one year. And that's exponential growth through five different paradigms. Moore's Law was just the last part of that  where we were shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit  but we had electro mechanical calculators  relay based computers that cracked the German Enigma Code  vacuum tubes in the     s predicted the election of Eisenhower  discreet transistors used in the first space flights and then Moore's Law. Every time one paradigm ran out of steam  another paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth. They were shrinking vacuum tubes  making them smaller and smaller. That hit a wall. They couldn't shrink them and keep the vacuum. Whole different paradigm    transistors came out of the woodwork. In fact  when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm  it creates research pressure to create the next paradigm. And because we've been predicting the end of Moore's Law for quite a long time    the first prediction said       until now it says     . But by the teen years  the features of transistors will be a few atoms in width  and we won't be able to shrink them any more. That'll be the end of Moore's Law  but it won't be the end of the exponential growth of computing  because chips are flat. We live in a three dimensional world  we might as well use the third dimension. We will go into the third dimension and there's been tremendous progress  just in the last few years  of getting three dimensional  self organizing molecular circuits to work. We'll have those ready well before Moore's Law runs out of steam. Supercomputers    same thing. Processor performance on Intel chips  the average price of a transistor          you could buy one transistor for a dollar. You could buy    million in     . It's pretty remarkable how smooth an exponential process that is. I mean  you'd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment  but this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior    countries accusing each other of dumping products  IPOs  bankruptcies  marketing programs. You would think it would be a very erratic process  and you have a very smooth outcome of this chaotic process. Just as we can't predict what one molecule in a gas will do    it's hopeless to predict a single molecule    yet we can predict the properties of the whole gas  using thermodynamics  very accurately. It's the same thing here. We can't predict any particular project  but the result of this whole worldwide  chaotic  unpredictable activity of competition and the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable. And we can predict these trends far into the future. Unlike Gertrude Stein's roses  it's not the case that a transistor is a transistor. As we make them smaller and less expensive  the electrons have less distance to travel. They're faster  so you've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors  so the cost of a cycle of one transistor has been coming down with a halving rate of  .  years. You add other forms of innovation and processor design  you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year. And that's basically deflation       percent deflation. And it's not just computers. I mean  it's true of DNA sequencing  it's true of brain scanning  it's true of the World Wide Web. I mean  anything that we can quantify  we have hundreds of different measurements of different  information related measurements    capacity  adoption rates    and they basically double every            months  depending on what you're looking at. In terms of price performance  that's a    to    percent deflation rate. And economists have actually started worrying about that. We had deflation during the Depression  but that was collapse of the money supply  collapse of consumer confidence  a completely different phenomena. This is due to greater productivity  but the economist says   But there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that. If you have    percent deflation  people may increase their volume        percent  but they won't keep up with it.  But what we're actually seeing is that we actually more than keep up with it. We've had    percent per year compounded growth in dollars in information technology over the last    years. I mean  people didn't build iPods for        dollars    years ago. As the price performance makes new applications feasible  new applications come to the market. And this is a very widespread phenomena. Magnetic data storage    that's not Moore's Law  it's shrinking magnetic spots  different engineers  different companies  same exponential process. A key revolution is that we're understanding our own biology in these information terms. We're understanding the software programs that make our body run. These were evolved in very different times    we'd like to actually change those programs. One little software program  called the fat insulin receptor gene  basically says   Hold onto every calorie  because the next hunting season may not work out so well.  That was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago. We'd like to actually turn that program off. They tried that in animals  and these mice ate ravenously and remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim. They didn't get diabetes  they didn't get heart disease  they lived    percent longer  they got the health benefits of caloric restriction without the restriction. Four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this  felt that would be interesting drug for the human market  and that's just one of the        genes that affect our biochemistry. We were evolved in an era where it wasn't in the interests of people at the age of most people at this conference  like myself  to live much longer  because we were using up the precious resources which were better deployed towards the children and those caring for them. So  life    long lifespans    like  that is to say  much more than       weren't selected for  but we are learning to actually manipulate and change these software programs through the biotechnology revolution. For example  we can inhibit genes now with RNA interference. There are exciting new forms of gene therapy that overcome the problem of placing the genetic material in the right place on the chromosome. There's actually a    for the first time now  something going to human trials  that actually cures pulmonary hypertension    a fatal disease    using gene therapy. So we'll have not just designer babies  but designer baby boomers. And this technology is also accelerating. It cost    dollars per base pair in       then a penny in     . It's now under a   th of a cent. The amount of genetic data    basically this shows that smooth exponential growth doubled every year  enabling the genome project to be completed. Another major revolution  the communications revolution. The price performance  bandwidth  capacity of communications measured many different ways  wired  wireless is growing exponentially. The Internet has been doubling in power and continues to  measured many different ways. This is based on the number of hosts. Miniaturization    we're shrinking the size of technology at an exponential rate  both wired and wireless. These are some designs from Eric Drexler's book    which we're now showing are feasible with super computing simulations  where actually there are scientists building molecule scale robots. One has one that actually walks with a surprisingly human like gait  that's built out of molecules. There are little machines doing things in experimental bases. The most exciting opportunity is actually to go inside the human body and perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions. And this is less futuristic than it may sound. These things have already been done in animals. There's one nano engineered device that cures type   diabetes. It's blood cell sized. They put tens of thousands of these in the blood cell    they tried this in rats    it lets insulin out in a controlled fashion  and actually cures type   diabetes. What you're watching is a design of a robotic red blood cell  and it does bring up the issue that our biology is actually very sub optimal  even though it's remarkable in its intricacy. Once we understand its principles of operation  and the pace with which we are reverse engineering biology is accelerating  we can actually design these things to be thousands of times more capable. An analysis of this respirocyte  designed by Rob Freitas  indicates if you replace    percent of your red blood cells with these robotic versions  you could do an Olympic sprint for    minutes without taking a breath. You could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours    so   Honey  I'm in the pool   will take on a whole new meaning. It will be interesting to see what we do in our Olympic trials. Presumably we'll ban them  but then we'll have the specter of teenagers in their high schools gyms routinely out performing the Olympic athletes. Freitas has a design for a robotic white blood cell. These are      circa scenarios  but they're not as futuristic as it may sound. There are four major conferences on building blood cell sized devices  there are many experiments in animals. There's actually one going into human trial  so this is feasible technology. If we come back to our exponential growth of computing        dollars of computing is now somewhere between an insect and a mouse brain. It will intersect human intelligence in terms of capacity in the     s  but that'll be the hardware side of the equation. Where will we get the software  Well  it turns out we can see inside the human brain  and in fact not surprisingly  the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year. And with the new generation of scanning tools  for the first time we can actually see individual inter neural fibers and see them processing and signaling in real time    but then the question is  OK  we can get this data now  but can we understand it  Doug Hofstadter wonders  well  maybe our intelligence just isn't great enough to understand our intelligence  and if we were smarter  well  then our brains would be that much more complicated  and we'd never catch up to it. It turns out that we can understand it. This is a block diagram of a model and simulation of the human auditory cortex that actually works quite well    in applying psychoacoustic tests  gets very similar results to human auditory perception. There's another simulation of the cerebellum    that's more than half the neurons in the brain    again  works very similarly to human skill formation. This is at an early stage  but you can show with the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain and the exponential improvement in the resolution of brain scanning  we will succeed in reverse engineering the human brain by the     s. We've already had very good models and simulation of about    regions out of the several hundred. All of this is driving exponentially growing economic progress. We've had productivity go from    dollars to     dollars per hour of labor in the last    years. E commerce has been growing exponentially. It's now a trillion dollars. You might wonder  well  wasn't there a boom and a bust  That was strictly a capital markets phenomena. Wall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology  which it was  but then six months later  when it hadn't revolutionized all business models  they figured  well  that was wrong  and then we had this bust. All right  this is a technology that we put together using some of the technologies we're involved in. This will be a routine feature in a cell phone. It would be able to translate from one language to another. So let me just end with a couple of scenarios. By      computers will disappear. They'll be so small  they'll be embedded in our clothing  in our environment. Images will be written directly to our retina  providing full immersion virtual reality  augmented real reality. We'll be interacting with virtual personalities. But if we go to       we really have the full maturity of these trends  and you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw in terms of generations of technology  which are getting faster and faster  we'll have at that point. I mean  we will have two to the   th power greater price performance  capacity and bandwidth of these technologies  which is pretty phenomenal. It'll be millions of times more powerful than it is today. We'll have completed the reverse engineering of the human brain        dollars of computing will be far more powerful than the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity. Computers will combine the subtle pan recognition powers of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior  in terms of doing analytic thinking  remembering billions of facts accurately. Machines can share their knowledge very quickly. But it's not just an alien invasion of intelligent machines. We are going to merge with our technology. These nano bots I mentioned will first be used for medical and health applications  cleaning up the environment  providing powerful fuel cells and widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment. But they'll also go inside our brain  interact with our biological neurons. We've demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this. So  for example  full immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system  the nano bots shut down the signals coming from your real senses  replace them with the signals that your brain would be receiving if you were in the virtual environment  and then it'll feel like you're in that virtual environment. You can go there with other people  have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses.  Experience beamers   I call them  will put their whole flow of sensory experiences in the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the Internet. You can plug in and experience what it's like to be someone else. But most importantly  it'll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology  which in some sense we're doing already. We routinely do intellectual feats that would be impossible without our technology. Human life expectancy is expanding. It was    in       and with this sort of biotechnology  nano technology revolutions  this will move up very rapidly in the years ahead. My main message is that progress in technology is exponential  not linear. Many    even scientists    assume a linear model  so they'll say   Oh  it'll be hundreds of years before we have self replicating nano technology assembly or artificial intelligence.  If you really look at the power of exponential growth  you'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand. And information technology is increasingly encompassing all of our lives  from our music to our manufacturing to our biology to our energy to materials. We'll be able to manufacture almost anything we need in the     s  from information  in very inexpensive raw materials  using nano technology. These are very powerful technologies. They both empower our promise and our peril. So we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems. Thank you very much.,"Inventor, futurist",200611,6.163398907103822
404,1478,1480,Ray Kurzweil 2009,Ray Kurzweil,male,A university for the coming singularity,Jun 2009,498,Information technology grows in an exponential manner. It's not linear. And our intuition is linear. When we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago we made linear predictions where that animal would be  and that worked fine. It's hardwired in our brains. But the pace of exponential growth is really what describes information technologies. And it's not just computation. There is a big difference between linear and exponential growth. If I take    steps linearly    one  two  three  four  five    I get to   . If I take    steps exponentially    two  four  eight        I get to a billion. It makes a huge difference. And that really describes information technology. When I was a student at MIT  we all shared one computer that took up a whole building. The computer in your cellphone today is a million times cheaper  a million times smaller  a thousand times more powerful. That's a billion fold increase in capability per dollar that we've actually experienced since I was a student. And we're going to do it again in the next    years. Information technology progresses through a series of S curves where each one is a different paradigm. So people say   What's going to happen when Moore's Law comes to an end   Which will happen around     . We'll then go to the next paradigm. And Moore's Law was not the first paradigm to bring exponential growth to computing. The exponential growth of computing started decades before Gordon Moore was even born. And it doesn't just apply to computation. It's really any technology where we can measure the underlying information properties. Here we have    famous computers. I put them in a logarithmic graph. The logarithmic scale hides the scale of the increase  because this represents trillions fold increase since the      census. In     s they were shrinking vacuum tubes  making them smaller and smaller. They finally hit a wall  they couldn't shrink the vacuum tube any more and keep the vacuum. And that was the end of the shrinking of vacuum tubes  but it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing. We went to the fourth paradigm  transistors  and finally integrated circuits. When that comes to an end we'll go to the sixth paradigm  three dimensional self organizing molecular circuits. But what's even more amazing  really  than this fantastic scale of progress  is that    look at how predictable this is. I mean this went through thick and thin  through war and peace  through boom times and recessions. The Great Depression made not a dent in this exponential progression. We'll see the same thing in the economic recession we're having now. At least the exponential growth of information technology capability will continue unabated. And I just updated these graphs. Because I had them through      in my book   The Singularity is Near.  So we updated them  so I could present it here  to     . And I was asked   Well aren't you nervous  Maybe it kind of didn't stay on this exponential progression.  I was a little nervous because maybe the data wouldn't be right  but I've done this now for    years  and it has stayed on this exponential progression. Look at this graph here.You could buy one transistor for a dollar in     . You can buy half a billion today  and they are actually better  because they are faster. But look at how predictable this is. And I'd say this knowledge is over fitting to past data. I've been making these forward looking predictions for about    years. And the cost of a transistor cycle  which is a measure of the price performance of electronics  comes down about every year. That's a    percent deflation rate. And it's also true of other examples  like DNA data or brain data. But we more than make up for that. We actually ship more than twice as much of every form of information technology. We've had    percent growth in constant dollars in every form of information technology for the last half century  despite the fact that you can get twice as much of it each year. This is a completely different example. This is not Moore's Law. The amount of DNA data we've sequenced has doubled every year. The cost has come down by half every year. And this has been a smooth progression since the beginning of the genome project. And halfway through the project  skeptics said   Well  this is not working out. You're halfway through the genome project and you've finished one percent of the project.  But that was really right on schedule. Because if you double one percent seven more times  which is exactly what happened  you get     percent. And the project was finished on time. Communication technologies     different ways to measure this  the number of bits being moved around  the size of the Internet. But this has progressed at an exponential pace. This is deeply democratizing. I wrote  over    years ago in  The Age of Intelligent Machines   when the Soviet Union was going strong  that it would be swept away by this growth of decentralized communication. And we will have plenty of computation as we go through the   st century to do things like simulate regions of the human brain. But where will we get the software  Some critics say   Oh  well software is stuck in the mud.  But we are learning more and more about the human brain. Spatial resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year. The amount of data we're getting about the brain is doubling every year. And we're showing that we can actually turn this data into working models and simulations of brain regions. There is about    regions of the brain that have been modeled  simulated and tested  the auditory cortex  regions of the visual cortex  cerebellum  where we do our skill formation  slices of the cerebral cortex  where we do our rational thinking. And all of this has fueled an increase  very smooth and predictable  of productivity. We've gone from    dollars to     dollars in constant dollars in the value of an average hour of human labor  fueled by this information technology. And we're all concerned about energy and the environment. Well this is a logarithmic graph. This represents a smooth doubling  every two years  of the amount of solar energy we're creating  particularly as we're now applying nanotechnology  a form of information technology  to solar panels. And we're only eight doublings away from it meeting     percent of our energy needs. And there is    thousand times more sunlight than we need. We ultimately will merge with this technology. It's already very close to us. When I was a student it was across campus  now it's in our pockets. What used to take up a building now fits in our pockets. What now fits in our pockets would fit in a blood cell in    years. And we will begin to actually deeply influence our health and our intelligence  as we get closer and closer to this technology. Based on that we are announcing  here at TED  in true TED tradition  Singularity University. It's a new university that's founded by Peter Diamandis  who is here in the audience  and myself. It's backed by NASA and Google  and other leaders in the high tech and science community. And our goal was to assemble the leaders  both teachers and students  in these exponentially growing information technologies  and their application. But Larry Page made an impassioned speech at our organizing meeting  saying we should devote this study to actually addressing some of the major challenges facing humanity. And if we did that  then Google would back this. And so that's what we've done. The last third of the nine week intensive summer session will be devoted to a group project to address some major challenge of humanity. Like for example  applying the Internet  which is now ubiquitous  in the rural areas of China or in Africa  to bringing health information to developing areas of the world. And these projects will continue past these sessions  using collaborative interactive communication. All the intellectual property that is created and taught will be online and available  and developed online in a collaborative fashion. Here is our founding meeting. But this is being announced today. It will be permanently headquartered in Silicon Valley  at the NASA Ames research center. There are different programs for graduate students  for executives at different companies. The first six tracks here    artificial intelligence  advanced computing technologies  biotechnology  nanotechnology    are the different core areas of information technology. Then we are going to apply them to the other areas  like energy  ecology  policy law and ethics  entrepreneurship  so that people can bring these new technologies to the world. So we're very appreciative of the support we've gotten from both the intellectual leaders  the high tech leaders  particularly Google and NASA. This is an exciting new venture. And we invite you to participate. Thank you very much.,"Inventor, futurist",200906,6.3041212121212125
415,239,241,Rives 2007,Rives,male,The  4 a.m. mystery,Jul 2007,537,This is a recent comic strip from the Los Angeles Times. The punch line   On the other hand  I don't have to get up at four every single morning to milk my Labrador.  This is a recent cover of New York Magazine. Best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment  births  strokes  heart disease  hip replacements    a.m. emergencies. And this is a song medley I put together    Did you ever notice that four in the morning has become some sort of meme or shorthand  It means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour. A time for inconveniences  mishaps  yearnings. A time for plotting to whack the chief of police  like in this classic scene from  The Godfather.  Coppola's script describes these guys as   exhausted in shirt sleeves. It is four in the morning.  A time for even grimmer stuff than that  like autopsies and embalmings in Isabel Allende's  The House of the Spirits.  After the breathtaking green haired Rosa is murdered  the doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians' paste. They worked until four o'clock in the morning. A time for even grimmer stuff than that  like in last April's New Yorker magazine. This short fiction piece by Martin Amis starts out   On September           he opened his eyes at   a.m. in Portland  Maine  and Mohamed Atta's last day began.  For a time that I find to be the most placid and uneventful hour of the day  four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press    across a lot of different media from a lot of big names. And it made me suspicious. I figured  surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world  really  aren't all defaulting back to this one easy trope like they invented it  right  Could it be there is something more going on here  Something deliberate  something secret  and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway  I say this guy    Alberto Giacometti  shown here with some of his sculptures on the Swiss     franc note. He did it with this famous piece from the New York Museum of Modern Art. Its title     The Palace at Four in the Morning        . Not just the earliest cryptic reference to four in the morning I can find. I believe that this so called first surrealist sculpture may provide an incredible key to virtually every artistic depiction of four in the morning to follow it. I call this The Giacometti Code  a TED exclusive. No  feel free to follow along on your Blackberries or your iPhones if you've got them. It works a little something like    this is a recent Google search for four in the morning. Results vary  of course. This is pretty typical. The top    results yield you four hits for Faron Young's song   It's Four in the Morning   three hits for Judi Dench's film   Four in the Morning   one hit for Wislawa Szymborska's poem   Four in the Morning.  But what  you may ask  do a Polish poet  a British Dame  a country music hall of famer all have in common besides this totally excellent Google ranking  Well  let's start with Faron Young    who was born incidentally in     . In       he shot himself in the head on December ninth    which incidentally is Judi Dench's birthday. But he didn't die on Dench's birthday. He languished until the following afternoon when he finally succumbed to a supposedly self inflicted gunshot wound at the age of       which incidentally is how old Alberto Giacometti was when he died. Where was Wislawa Szymborska during all this  She has the world's most absolutely watertight alibi. On that very day  December          while Mr. Four in the Morning  Faron Young  was giving up the ghost in Nashville  Tennessee  Ms. Four in the Morning    or one of them anyway    Wislawa Szymborska was in Stockholm  Sweden  accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature.     years to the day after the death of Alfred Nobel himself. Coincidence  No  it's creepy. Coincidence to me has a much simpler metric. That's like me telling you   Hey  you know the Nobel Prize was established in       which coincidentally is the same year Alberto Giacometti was born   No  not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm  but that does not mean there's not something going on at the highest possible levels. In fact there are people in this room who may not want me to show you this clip we're about to see. Video  Homer Simpson  We have a tennis court  a swimming pool  a screening room    You mean if I want pork chops  even in the middle of the night  your guy will fry them up  Herbert Powell  Sure  that's what he's paid for. Now do you need towels  laundry  maids  HS  Wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait    let me see if I got this straight. It is Christmas Day    a.m. There's a rumble in my stomach. Marge Simpson  Homer  please. Rives  Wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait. Let me see if I got this straight  Matt. When Homer Simpson needs to imagine the most remote possible moment of not just the clock  but the whole freaking calendar  he comes up with      on the birthday of the Baby Jesus. And no  I don't know how it works into the whole puzzling scheme of things  but obviously I know a coded message when I see one. I said  I know a coded message when I see one.

My speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out because as we worked between one and four in the morning on Inauguration Day  I was still changing it.  Sure you were  because you've prepared your entire life for this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you. And then    three paragraphs later we get this little beauty   We went back to Blair House to look at the speech for the last time.

And I noticed  he's not exactly around here today to face any tough questions. It could get awkward  right  I mean after all  this whole business happened on his watch. But if he were here    he might remind us  as he does in the wrap up to his fine autobiography  that on this day Bill Clinton began a journey    a journey that saw him go on to become the first Democrat president elected to two consecutive terms in decades.

421,655,657,Robert Full 2007,Robert Full,male,The sticky wonder of gecko feet,Nov 2007,1136,I want you to imagine that you're a student in my lab. What I want you to do is to create a biologically inspired design. And so here's the challenge  I want you to help me create a fully  D  dynamic  parameterized contact model. The translation of that is  could you help me build a foot  And it is a true challenge  and I do want you to help me. Of course  in the challenge there is a prize. It's not quite the TED Prize  but it is an exclusive t shirt from our lab. So please send me your ideas about how to design a foot. Now if we want to design a foot  what do we have to do  We have to first know what a foot is. If we go to the dictionary  it says   It's the lower extremity of a leg that is in direct contact with the ground in standing or walking  That's the traditional definition. But if you wanted to really do research  what do you have to do  You have to go to the literature and look up what's known about feet. So you go to the literature.  Laughter  Maybe you're familiar with this literature. The problem is  there are many  many feet. How do you do this  You need to survey all feet and extract the principles of how they work. And I want you to help me do that in this next clip. As you see this clip  look for principles  and also think about experiments that you might design in order to understand how a foot works. See any common themes  Principles  What would you do  What experiments would you run  Wow.  Applause  Our research on the biomechanics of animal locomotion has allowed us to make a blueprint for a foot. It's a design inspired by nature  but it's not a copy of any specific foot you just looked at  but it's a synthesis of the secrets of many  many feet. Now it turns out that animals can go anywhere. They can locomote on substrates that vary as you saw    in the probability of contact  the movement of that surface and the type of footholds that are present. If you want to study how a foot works  we're going to have to simulate those surfaces  or simulate that debris. When we did that  here's a new experiment that we did  we put an animal and had it run    this grass spider    on a surface with    percent of the contact area removed. But it didn't even slow down the animal. It's still running at the human equivalent of     miles per hour. Now how could it do that  Well  look more carefully. When we slow it down    times we see how the leg is hitting that simulated debris. The leg is acting as a foot. And in fact  the animal contacts other parts of its leg more frequently than the traditionally defined foot. The foot is distributed along the whole leg. You can do another experiment where you can take a cockroach with a foot  and you can remove its foot. I'm passing some cockroaches around. Take a look at their feet. Without a foot  here's what it does. It doesn't even slow down. It can run the same speed without even that segment. No problem for the cockroach    they can grow them back  if you care. How do they do it  Look carefully  this is slowed down     times  and watch what it's doing with the rest of its leg. It's acting  again  as a distributed foot    very effective. Now  the question we had is  how general is a distributed foot  And the next behavior I'll show you of this animal just stunned us the first time that we saw it. Journalists  this is off the record  it's embargoed. Take a look at what that is  That's a bipedal octopus that's disguised as a rolling coconut. It was discovered by Christina Huffard and filmed by Sea Studios  right here from Monterey. We've also described another species of bipedal octopus. This one disguises itself as floating algae. It walks on two legs and it holds the other arms up in the air so that it can't be seen. And look what it does with its foot to get over challenging terrain. It uses that beautiful distributed foot to make it as if those obstacles are not even there    truly extraordinary. In       Escher made this drawing. He thought he created an animal fantasy. But we know that art imitates life  and it turns out nature  three million years ago  evolved the next animal. It's a shrimp like animal called the stomatopod  and here's how it moves on the beaches of Panama  it actually rolls  and it can even roll uphill. It's the ultimate distributed foot  its whole body in this case is acting like its foot. So  if we want to then  to our blueprint  add the first important feature  we want to add distributed foot contact. Not just with the traditional foot  but also the leg  and even of the body. Can this help us inspire the design of novel robots  We biologically inspired this robot  named RHex  built by these extraordinary engineers over the last few years. RHex's foot started off to be quite simple  then it got tuned over time  and ultimately resulted in this half circle. Why is that  The video will show you. Watch where the robot  now  contacts its leg in order to deal with this very difficult terrain. What you'll see  in fact  is that it's using that half circle leg as a distributed foot. Watch it go over this. You can see it here well on this debris. Extraordinary. No sensing  all the control is built right into the tuned legs. Really simple  but beautiful. Now  you might have noticed something else about the animals when they were running over the rough terrain. And my assistant's going to help me here. When you touched the cockroach leg    can you get the microphone for him  When you touched the cockroach leg  what did it feel like  Did you notice something  Boy  Spiny. Robert Full  It's spiny  right  It's really spiny  isn't it  It sort of hurts. Maybe we could give it to our curator and see if he'd be brave enough to touch the cockroach. Chris Anderson  Did you touch it  RF  So if you look carefully at this  what you see is that they have spines and until a few weeks ago  no one knew what they did. They assumed that they were for protection and for sensory structures. We found that they're for something else    here's a segment of that spine. They're tuned such that they easily collapse in one direction to pull the leg out from debris  but they're stiff in the other direction so they capture disparities in the surface. Now crabs don't miss footholds  because they normally move on sand    until they come to our lab. And where they have a problem with this kind of mesh  because they don't have spines. The crabs are missing spines  so they have a problem in this kind of rough terrain. But of course  we can deal with that because we can produce artificial spines. We can make spines that catch on simulated debris and collapse on removal to easily pull them out. We did that by putting these artificial spines on crabs  as you see here  and then we tested them. Do we really understand that principle of tuning  The answer is  yes  This is slowed down    fold  and the crab just zooms across that simulated debris. A little better than nature. So to our blueprint  we need to add tuned spines. Now will this help us think about the design of more effective climbing robots  Well  here's RHex  RHex has trouble on rails    on smooth rails  as you see here. So why not add a spine  My colleagues did this at U. Penn. Dan Koditschek put some steel nails    very simple version    on the robot  and here's RHex  now  going over those steel    those rails. No problem  How does it do it  Let's slow it down and you can see the spines in action. Watch the leg come around  and you'll see it grab on right there. It couldn't do that before  it would just slip and get stuck and tip over. And watch again  right there    successful. Now just because we have a distributed foot and spines doesn't mean you can climb vertical surfaces. This is really  really difficult. But look at this animal do it  One of the ones I'm passing around is climbing up this vertical surface that's a smooth metal plate. It's extraordinary how fast it can do it    but if you slow it down  you see something that's quite extraordinary. It's a secret. The animal effectively climbs by slipping and look    and doing  actually  terribly  with respect to grabbing on the surface. It looks  in fact  like it's swimming up the surface. We can actually model that behavior better as a fluid  if you look at it. The distributed foot  actually  is working more like a paddle. The same is true when we looked at this lizard running on fluidized sand. Watch its feet. It's actually functioning as a paddle even though it's interacting with a surface that we normally think of as a solid. This is not different from what my former undergraduate discovered when she figured out how lizards can run on water itself. Can you use this to make a better robot  Martin Buehler did    who's now at Boston Dynamics    he took this idea and made RHex to be Aqua RHex. So here's RHex with paddles  now converted into an incredibly maneuverable swimming robot. For rough surfaces  though  animals add claws. And you probably feel them if you grabbed it. Did you touch it  CA  I did. RF  And they do really well at grabbing onto surfaces with these claws. Mark Cutkosky at Stanford University  one of my collaborators  is an extraordinary engineer who developed this technique called Shape Deposition Manufacturing  where he can imbed claws right into an artificial foot. And here's the simple version of a foot for a new robot that I'll show you in a bit. So to our blueprint  let's attach claws. Now if we look at animals  though  to be really maneuverable in all surfaces  the animals use hybrid mechanisms that include claws  and spines  and hairs  and pads  and glue  and capillary adhesion and a whole bunch of other things. These are all from different insects. There's an ant crawling up a vertical surface. Let's look at that ant. This is the foot of an ant. You see the hairs and the claws and this thing here. This is when its foot's in the air. Watch what happens when the foot goes onto your sandwich. You see what happens  That pad comes out. And that's where the glue is. Here from underneath is an ant foot  and when the claws don't dig in  that pad automatically comes out without the ant doing anything. It just extrudes. And this was a hard shot to get    I think this is the shot of the ant foot on the superstrings. So it's pretty tough to do. This is what it looks like close up    here's the ant foot  and there's the glue. And we discovered this glue may be an interesting two phase mixture. It certainly helps it to hold on. So to our blueprint  we stick on some sticky pads. Now you might think for smooth surfaces we get inspiration here. Now we have something better here. The gecko's a really great example of nanotechnology in nature. These are its feet. They're    almost look alien. And the secret  which they stick on with  involves their hairy toes. They can run up a surface at a meter per second  take    steps in that one second    you can hardly see them. If we slow it down  they attach their feet at eight milliseconds  and detach them in    milliseconds. And when you watch how they detach it  it is bizarre. They peel away from the surface like you'd peel away a piece of tape. Very strange. How do they stick  If you look at their feet  they have leaf like structures called linalae with millions of hairs. And each hair has the worst case of split ends possible. It has a hundred to a thousand split ends  and that's the secret  because it allows intimate contact. The gecko has a billion of these     nanometer sized split ends. And they don't stick by glue  or they don't work like Velcro  or they don't work with suction. We discovered they work by intermolecular forces alone. So to our blueprint  we split some hairs. This has inspired the design of the first self cleaning dry adhesive    the patent issued  we're happy to say. And here's the simplest version in nature  and here's my collaborator Ron Fearing's attempt at an artificial version of this dry adhesive made from polyurethane. And here's the first attempt to have it work on some load. There's enormous interest in this in a variety of different fields. You could think of a thousand possible uses  I'm sure. Lots of people have  and we're excited about realizing this as a product. We have imagined products  for example  this one  we imagined a bio inspired Band Aid  where we took the glue off the Band Aid. We took some hairs from a molting gecko  put three rolls of them on here  and then made this Band Aid. This is an undergraduate volunteer    we have        undergraduates so we can choose among them    that's actually just a red pen mark. But it makes an incredible Band Aid. It's aerated  it can be peeled off easily  it doesn't cause any irritation  it works underwater. I think this is an extraordinary example of how curiosity based research    we just wondered how they climbed up something    can lead to things that you could never imagine. It's just an example of why we need to support curiosity based research. Here you are  pulling off the Band Aid. So we've redefined  now  what a foot is. The question is  can we use these secrets  then  to inspire the design of a better foot  better than one that we see in nature  Here's the new project  we're trying to create the first climbing search and rescue robot    no suction or magnets    that can only move on limited kinds of surfaces. I call the new robot RiSE  for  Robot in Scansorial Environment     that's a climbing environment    and we have an extraordinary team of biologists and engineers creating this robot. And here is RiSE. It's six legged and has a tail. Here it is on a fence and a tree. And here are RiSE's first steps on an incline. You have the audio  You can hear it go up. And here it is coming up at you  in its first steps up a wall. Now it's only using its simplest feet here  so this is very new. But we think we got the dynamics right of the robot. Mark Cutkosky  though  is taking it a step further. He's the one able to build this shape deposition manufactured feet and toes. The next step is to make compliant toes  and try to add spines and claws and set it for dry adhesives. So the idea is to first get the toes and a foot right  attempt to make that climb  and ultimately put it on the robot. And that's exactly what he's done. He's built  in fact  a climbing foot bot inspired by nature. And here's Cutkosky's and his amazing students' design. So these are tuned toes    there are six of them  and they use the principles that I just talked about collectively for the blueprint. So this is not using any suction  any glue  and it will ultimately  when it's attached to the robot    it's as biologically inspired as the animal    hopefully be able to climb any kind of a surface. Here you see it  next  going up the side of a building at Stanford. It's sped up    again  it's a foot climbing. It's not the whole robot yet  we're working on it    now you can see how it's attaching. These tuned structures allow the spines  friction pads and ultimately the adhesive hairs to grab onto very challenging  difficult surfaces. And so they were able to get this thing    this is now sped up    times    can you imagine it trying to go up and rescue somebody at that upper floor  OK  You can visualize this now  it's not impossible. It's a very challenging task. But more to come later. To finish  we've gotten design secrets from nature by looking at how feet are built. We've learned we should distribute control to smart parts. Don't put it all in the brain  but put some of the control in tuned feet  legs and even body. That nature uses hybrid solutions  not a single solution  to these problems  and they're integrated and beautifully robust. And third  we believe strongly that we do not want to mimic nature but instead be inspired by biology  and use these novel principles with the best engineering solutions that are out there to make    potentially    something better than nature. So there's a clear message  whether you care about a fundamental  basic research of really interesting  bizarre  wonderful animals  or you want to build a search and rescue robot that can help you in an earthquake  or to save someone in a fire  or you care about medicine  we must preserve nature's designs. Otherwise these secrets will be lost forever. Thank you.,Biologist,200711,6.082411764705879
422,1248,1250,Robert Full 2008,Robert Full,male,Robots inspired by cockroach ingenuity,Jun 2008,1201,Welcome. If I could have the first slide  please  Contrary to calculations made by some engineers  bees can fly  dolphins can swim  and geckos can even climb up the smoothest surfaces. Now  what I want to do  in the short time I have  is to try to allow each of you to experience the thrill of revealing nature's design. I get to do this all the time  and it's just incredible. I want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation. The challenge of looking at nature's designs    and I'll tell you the way that we perceive it  and the way we've used it. The challenge  of course  is to answer this question  what permits this extraordinary performance of animals that allows them basically to go anywhere  And if we could figure that out  how can we implement those designs  Well  many biologists will tell engineers  and others  organisms have millions of years to get it right  they're spectacular  they can do everything wonderfully well. So  the answer is bio mimicry  just copy nature directly. We know from working on animals that the truth is that's exactly what you don't want to do    because evolution works on the just good enough principle  not on a perfecting principle. And the constraints in building any organism  when you look at it  are really severe. Natural technologies have incredible constraints. Think about it. If you were an engineer and I told you that you had to build an automobile  but it had to start off to be this big  then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way. Or think about the fact that if you build an automobile  I'll tell you that you also    inside it    have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile. And you can absolutely never  absolutely never  because of history and the inherited plan  start with a clean slate. So  organisms have this important history. Really evolution works more like a tinkerer than an engineer. And this is really important when you begin to look at animals. Instead  we believe you need to be inspired by biology. You need to discover the general principles of nature  and then use these analogies when they're advantageous. This is a real challenge to do this  because animals  when you start to really look inside them    how they work    appear hopelessly complex. There's no detailed history of the design plans  you can't go look it up anywhere. They have way too many motions for their joints  too many muscles. Even the simplest animal we think of  something like an insect  and they have more neurons and connections than you can imagine. How can you make sense of this  Well  we believed    and we hypothesized    that one way animals could work simply  is if the control of their movements tended to be built into their bodies themselves. What we discovered was that two   four   six  and eight legged animals all produce the same forces on the ground when they move. They all work like this kangaroo  they bounce. And they can be modeled by a spring mass system that we call the spring mass system because we're biomechanists. It's actually a pogo stick. They all produce the pattern of a pogo stick. How is that true  Well  a human  one of your legs works like two legs of a trotting dog  or works like three legs  together as one  of a trotting insect  or four legs as one of a trotting crab. And then they alternate in their propulsion  but the patterns are all the same. Almost every organism we've looked at this way    you'll see next week  I'll give you a hint  there'll be an article coming out that says that really big things like T. rex probably couldn't do this  but you'll see that next week. Now  what's interesting is the animals  then    we said    bounce along the vertical plane this way  and in our collaborations with Pixar  in  A Bug's Life   we discussed the bipedal nature of the characters of the ants. And we told them  of course  they move in another plane as well. And they asked us this question. They say   Why model just in the sagittal plane or the vertical plane  when you're telling us these animals are moving in the horizontal plane   This is a good question. Nobody in biology ever modeled it this way. We took their advice and we modeled the animals moving in the horizontal plane as well. We took their three legs  we collapsed them down as one. We got some of the best mathematicians in the world from Princeton to work on this problem. And we were able to create a model where animals are not only bouncing up and down  but they're also bouncing side to side at the same time. And many organisms fit this kind of pattern. Now  why is this important to have this model  Because it's very interesting. When you take this model and you perturb it  you give it a push  as it bumps into something  it self stabilizes  with no brain or no reflexes  just by the structure alone. It's a beautiful model. Let's look at the mathematics. That's enough  The animals  when you look at them running  appear to be self stabilizing like this  using basically springy legs. That is  the legs can do computations on their own  the control algorithms  in a sense  are embedded in the form of the animal itself. Why haven't we been more inspired by nature and these kinds of discoveries  Well  I would argue that human technologies are really different from natural technologies  at least they have been so far. Think about the typical kind of robot that you see. Human technologies have tended to be large  flat  with right angles  stiff  made of metal. They have rolling devices and axles. There are very few motors  very few sensors. Whereas nature tends to be small  and curved  and it bends and twists  and has legs instead  and appendages  and has many muscles and many  many sensors. So it's a very different design. However  what's changing  what's really exciting    and I'll show you some of that next    is that as human technology takes on more of the characteristics of nature  then nature really can become a much more useful teacher. And here's one example that's really exciting. This is a collaboration we have with Stanford. And they developed this new technique  called Shape Deposition Manufacturing. It's a technique where they can mix materials together and mold any shape that they like  and put in the material properties. They can embed sensors and actuators right in the form itself. For example  here's a leg  the clear part is stiff  the white part is compliant  and you don't need any axles there or anything. It just bends by itself beautifully. So  you can put those properties in. It inspired them to show off this design by producing a little robot they named Sprawl. Our work has also inspired another robot  a biologically inspired bouncing robot  from the University of Michigan and McGill named RHex  for robot hexapod  and this one's autonomous. Let's go to the video  and let me show you some of these animals moving and then some of the simple robots that have been inspired by our discoveries. Here's what some of you did this morning  although you did it outside  not on a treadmill. Here's what we do. This is a death's head cockroach. This is an American cockroach you think you don't have in your kitchen. This is an eight legged scorpion  six legged ant  forty four legged centipede. Now  I said all these animals are sort of working like pogo sticks    they're bouncing along as they move. And you can see that in this ghost crab  from the beaches of Panama and North Carolina. It goes up to four meters per second when it runs. It actually leaps into the air  and has aerial phases when it does it  like a horse  and you'll see it's bouncing here. What we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human like Richard  or a cockroach  or a crab  or a kangaroo  the relative leg stiffness of that spring is the same for everything we've seen so far. Now  what good are springy legs then  What can they do  Well  we wanted to see if they allowed the animals to have greater stability and maneuverability. So  we built a terrain that had obstacles three times the hip height of the animals that we're looking at. And we were certain they couldn't do this. And here's what they did. The animal ran over it and it didn't even slow down  It didn't decrease its preferred speed at all. We couldn't believe that it could do this. It said to us that if you could build a robot with very simple  springy legs  you could make it as maneuverable as any that's ever been built. Here's the first example of that. This is the Stanford Shape Deposition Manufactured robot  named Sprawl. It has six legs    there are the tuned  springy legs. It moves in a gait that an insect uses  and here it is going on the treadmill. Now  what's important about this robot  compared to other robots  is that it can't see anything  it can't feel anything  it doesn't have a brain  yet it can maneuver over these obstacles without any difficulty whatsoever. It's this technique of building the properties into the form. This is a graduate student. This is what he's doing to his thesis project    very robust  if a graduate student does that to his thesis project. This is from McGill and University of Michigan. This is the RHex  making its first outing in a demo. Same principle  it only has six moving parts  six motors  but it has springy  tuned legs. It moves in the gait of the insect. It has the middle leg moving in synchrony with the front  and the hind leg on the other side. Sort of an alternating tripod  and they can negotiate obstacles just like the animal. Robert Full  It'll go on different surfaces    here's sand    although we haven't perfected the feet yet  but I'll talk about that later. Here's RHex entering the woods. Again  this robot can't see anything  it can't feel anything  it has no brain. It's just working with a tuned mechanical system  with very simple parts  but inspired from the fundamental dynamics of the animal. I presented this to the jet propulsion lab at NASA  and they said that they had no ability to go down craters to look for ice  and life  ultimately  on Mars. And he said    especially with legged robots  because they're way too complicated. Nothing can do that. And I talk next. I showed them this video with the simple design of RHex here. And just to convince them we should go to Mars in       I tinted the video orange just to give them the sense of being on Mars. Another reason why animals have extraordinary performance  and can go anywhere  is because they have an effective interaction with the environment. The animal I'm going to show you  that we studied to look at this  is the gecko. We have one here and notice its position. It's holding on. Now I'm going to challenge you. I'm going show you a video. One of the animals is going to be running on the level  and the other one's going to be running up a wall. Which one's which  They're going at a meter a second. How many think the one on the left is running up the wall  Okay. The point is it's really hard to tell  isn't it  It's incredible  we looked at students do this and they couldn't tell. They can run up a wall at a meter a second     steps per second  and they look like they're running on the level. How do they do this  It's just phenomenal. The one on the right was going up the hill. How do they do this  They have bizarre toes. They have toes that uncurl like party favors when you blow them out  and then peel off the surface  like tape. Like if we had a piece of tape now  we'd peel it this way. They do this with their toes. It's bizarre  This peeling inspired iRobot    that we work with    to build Mecho Geckos. Here's a legged version and a tractor version  or a bulldozer version. Let's see some of the geckos move with some video  and then I'll show you a little bit of a clip of the robots. Here's the gecko running up a vertical surface. There it goes  in real time. There it goes again. Obviously  we have to slow this down a little bit. You can't use regular cameras. You have to take       pictures per second to see this. And here's some video at       frames per second. Now  I want you to look at the animal's back. Do you see how much it's bending like that  We can't figure that out    that's an unsolved mystery. We don't know how it works. If you have a son or a daughter that wants to come to Berkeley  come to my lab and we'll figure this out. Okay  send them to Berkeley because that's the next thing I want to do. Here's the gecko mill. It's a see through treadmill with a see through treadmill belt  so we can watch the animal's feet  and videotape them through the treadmill belt  to see how they move. Here's the animal that we have here  running on a vertical surface. Pick a foot and try to watch a toe  and see if you can see what the animal's doing. See it uncurl and then peel these toes. It can do this in    milliseconds. It's unbelievable. Here are the robots that they inspire  the Mecho Geckos from iRobot. First we'll see the animals toes peeling    look at that. And here's the peeling action of the Mecho Gecko. It uses a pressure sensitive adhesive to do it. Peeling in the animal. Peeling in the Mecho Gecko    that allows them climb autonomously. Can go on the flat surface  transition to a wall  and then go onto a ceiling. There's the bulldozer version. Now  it doesn't use pressure sensitive glue. The animal does not use that. But that's what we're limited to  at the moment. What does the animal do  The animal has weird toes. And if you look at the toes  they have these little leaves there  and if you blow them up and zoom in  you'll see that's there's little striations in these leaves. And if you zoom in     times  you'll see it looks like a rug. And if you blow that up  and zoom in     times  you see there are hairs there  tiny hairs. And if you look carefully  those tiny hairs have striations. And if you zoom in on those        times  you'll see each hair has split ends. And if you blow those up  they have these little structures on the end. The smallest branch of the hairs looks like spatulae  and an animal like that has one billion of these nano size split ends  to get very close to the surface. In fact  there's the diameter of your hair    a gecko has two million of these  and each hair has     to       split ends. Think of the contact of that that's possible. We were fortunate to work with another group at Stanford that built us a special manned sensor  that we were able to measure the force of an individual hair. Here's an individual hair with a little split end there. When we measured the forces  they were enormous. They were so large that a patch of hairs about this size    the gecko's foot could support the weight of a small child  about    pounds  easily. Now  how do they do it  We've recently discovered this. Do they do it by friction  No  force is too low. Do they do it by electrostatics  No  you can change the charge    they still hold on. Do they do it by interlocking  That's kind of a like a Velcro like thing. No  you can put them on molecular smooth surfaces    they don't do it. How about suction  They stick on in a vacuum. How about wet adhesion  Or capillary adhesion  They don't have any glue  and they even stick under water just fine. If you put their foot under water  they grab on. How do they do it then  Believe it or not  they grab on by intermolecular forces  by Van der Waals forces. You know  you probably had this a long time ago in chemistry  where you had these two atoms  they're close together  and the electrons are moving around. That tiny force is sufficient to allow them to do that because it's added up so many times with these small structures. What we're doing is  we're taking that inspiration of the hairs  and with another colleague at Berkeley  we're manufacturing them. And just recently we've made a breakthrough  where we now believe we're going to be able to create the first synthetic  self cleaning  dry adhesive. Many companies are interested in this. We also presented to Nike even. We'll see where this goes. We were so excited about this that we realized that that small size scale    and where everything gets sticky  and gravity doesn't matter anymore    we needed to look at ants and their feet  because one of my other colleagues at Berkeley has built a six millimeter silicone robot with legs. But it gets stuck. It doesn't move very well. But the ants do  and we'll figure out why  so that ultimately we'll make this move. And imagine  you're going to be able to have swarms of these six millimeter robots available to run around. Where's this going  I think you can see it already. Clearly  the Internet is already having eyes and ears  you have web cams and so forth. But it's going to also have legs and hands. You're going to be able to do programmable work through these kinds of robots  so that you can run  fly and swim anywhere. We saw David Kelly is at the beginning of that with his fish. So  in conclusion  I think the message is clear. If you need a message  if nature's not enough  if you care about search and rescue  or mine clearance  or medicine  or the various things we're working on  we must preserve nature's designs  otherwise these secrets will be lost forever.

423,1664,1666,Robert Gupta 2010,Robert Gupta,male,"Music is medicine, music is sanity",Mar 2010,383,One day  Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music. And the source was a man  an African American man  charming  rugged  homeless  playing a violin that only had two strings. And I'm telling a story that many of you know  because Steve's columns became the basis for a book  which was turned into a movie  with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez  and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers  the Juilliard trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia. Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard  he suffered a complete breakdown  and    years later he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men  but how music helped shape that bond  and ultimately was instrumental    if you'll pardon the pun    in helping Nathaniel get off the streets. I met Mr. Ayers in       two years ago  at Walt Disney Concert Hall. He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies  and came backstage and introduced himself. He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series  all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony. And we got talking about music  and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me. Now  I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs  and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life. But as a result now  he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes  the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days  wandering the streets of Skid Row  exposed to its horrors  with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him. And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall    he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes  he was lost. And he was talking about invisible demons and smoke  and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep. And I was afraid  not for myself  but I was afraid that I was going to lose him  that he was going to sink into one of his states  and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy. So  I just started playing. And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto. And as I played  I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel's eyes. It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical  a chemical reaction  for which my playing the music was its catalyst. And Nathaniel's manic rage was transformed into understanding  a quiet curiosity and grace. And in a miracle  he lifted his own violin and he started playing  by ear  certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete    Mendelssohn  Tchaikovsky  Sibelius. And we started talking about music  from Bach to Beethoven and Brahms  Bruckner  all the B's  from Bart k  all the way up to Esa Pekka Salonen. And I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music  but he related to this music at a personal level. He spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic. And through playing music and talking about music  this man had transformed from the paranoid  disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the charming  erudite  brilliant  Juilliard trained musician. Music is medicine. Music changes us. And for Nathaniel  music is sanity. Because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity  into reality. And that is an escape from his tormented state. And I understood that this was the very essence of art. This was the very reason why we made music  that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core  our emotions  and through our artistic lens  through our creativity  we're able to shape those emotions into reality. And the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us  inspires and unites us. And for Nathaniel  music brought him back into a fold of friends. The redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him  that recognized his talents and respected him. And I will always make music with Nathaniel  whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row  because he reminds me why I became a musician. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you. Thanks. Robert Gupta. Robert Gupta  I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists. So  please forgive me.,Violinist,201003,6.209203980099501
431,346,348,Ronny Edry 2012,Ronny Edry,male,Israel and Iran: A love story?,Dec 2012,876,On March     this year  I posted this poster on Facebook. This is an image of me and my daughter holding the Israeli flag. I will try to explain to you about the context of why and when I posted. A few days ago  I was sitting waiting on the line at the grocery store  and the owner and one of the clients were talking to each other  and the owner was explaining to the client that we're going to get        missiles on Israel. And the client was saying  no  it's        a day. We have this war with Iran coming for    years now  and we have people  you know  afraid. It's like every year it's the last minute that we can do something about the war with Iran. It's like  if we don't act now  it's too late forever  for    years now. So at some point it became  you know  to me  I'm a graphic designer  so I made posters about it and I posted the one I just showed you before. Most of the time  I make posters  I post them on Facebook  my friends like it  don't like it  most of the time don't like it  don't share it  don't nothing  and it's another day. So I went to sleep  and that was it for me. And later on in the night  I woke up because I'm always waking up in the night  and I went by the computer and I see all these red dots  you know  on Facebook  which I've never seen before. And I was like   What's going on   So I come to the computer and I start looking on  and suddenly I see many people talking to me  most of them I don't know  and a few of them from Iran  which is    What  Because you have to understand  in Israel we don't talk with people from Iran. We don't know people from Iran. It's like  on Facebook  you have friends only from    it's like your neighbors are your friends on Facebook. And now people from Iran are talking to me. So I start answering this girl  and she's telling me she saw the poster and she asked her family to come  because they don't have a computer  she asked her family to come to see the poster  and they're all sitting in the living room crying. So I'm like  whoa. I ask my wife to come  and I tell her  you have to see that. People are crying  and she came  she read the text  and she started to cry. And everybody's crying now.  Laughter  So I don't know what to do  so my first reflex  as a graphic designer  is  you know  to show everybody what I'd just seen  and people started to see them and to share them  and that's how it started. The day after  when really it became a lot of talking  I said to myself  and my wife said to me  I also want a poster  so this is her.  Laughter  Because it's working  put me in a poster now. But more seriously  I was like  okay  these ones work  but it's not just about me  it's about people from Israel who want to say something. So I'm going to shoot all the people I know  if they want  and I'm going to put them in a poster and I'm going to share them. So I went to my neighbors and friends and students and I just asked them  give me a picture  I will make you a poster. And that's how it started. And that's how  really  it's unleashed  because suddenly people from Facebook  friends and others  just understand that they can be part of it. It's not just one dude making one poster  it's    we can be part of it  so they start sending me pictures and ask me   Make me a poster. Post it. Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too.  It became  you know  at some point it was really  really intense. I mean  so many pictures  so I asked friends to come  graphic designers most of them  to make posters with me  because I didn't have the time. It was a huge amount of pictures. So for a few days  that's how my living room was. And we received Israeli posters  Israeli images  but also lots of comments  lots of messages from Iran. And we took these messages and we made posters out of it  because I know people  They don't read  they see images. If it's an image  they may read it. So here are a few of them. of a girl who has been raised in Iran to walk on an Israeli flag to enter her school every morning  and now that she sees the posters that we're sending  she starts    she said that she changed her mind  and now she loves that blue  she loves that star  and she loves that flag  talking about the Israeli flag  and she wished that we'd meet and come to visit one another  and just a few days after I posted the first poster. The day after  Iranians started to respond with their own posters. They have graphic designers. What   Laughter  Crazy  crazy. So you can see they are still shy  they don't want to show their faces  but they want to spread the message. They want to respond. They want to say the same thing. So. And now it's communication. It's a two way story. It's Israelis and Iranians sending the same message  one to each other. This never happened before  and this is two people supposed to be enemies  we're on the verge of a war  and suddenly people on Facebook are starting to say   I like this guy. I love those guys.  And it became really big at some point. And then it became news. Because when you're seeing the Middle East  you see only the bad news. And suddenly  there is something that was happening that was good news. So the guys on the news  they say   Okay  let's talk about this.  And they just came  and it was so much  I remember one day  Michal  she was talking with the journalist  and she was asking him   Who's gonna see the show  And he said   Everybody.  So she said   Everybody in Palestine  in where  Israel  Who is everybody   Everybody.  They said   Syria    Syria.   Lebanon   Lebanon.  At some point  he just said      million people are going to see you today. It's everybody.  The Chinese. And we were just at the beginning of the story. Something crazy also happened. Every time a country started talking about it  like Germany  America  wherever  a page on Facebook popped up with the same logo with the same stories  so at the beginning we had  Iran Loves Israel   which is an Iranian sitting in Tehran  saying   Okay  Israel loves Iran  I give you Iran Loves Israel.  You have Palestine Loves Israel. You have Lebanon that just    a few days ago. And this whole list of pages on Facebook dedicated to the same message  to people sending their love  one to each other. The moment I really understood that something was happening  a friend of mine told me   Google the word 'Israel.'  And those were the first images on those days that popped up from Google when you were typing   Israel  or  Iran.  We really changed how people see the Middle East. Because you're not in the Middle East. You're somewhere over there  and then you want to see the Middle East  so you go on Google and you say   Israel   and they give you the bad stuff. And for a few days you got those images. Today the Israel Loves Iran page is this number          and two million people last week went on the page and shared  liked  I don't know  commented on one of the photos. So for five months now  that's what we are doing  me  Michal  a few of my friends  are just making images. We're showing a new reality by just making images because that's how the world perceives us. They see images of us  and they see bad images. So we're working on making good images. End of story. Look at this one. This is the Iran Loves Israel page. This is not the Israel Loves Iran. This is not my page. This is a guy in Tehran on the day of remembrance of the Israeli fallen soldier putting an image of an Israeli soldier on his page. This is the enemy. What  And it's going both ways. It's like  we are showing respect  one to each other. And we're understanding. And you show compassion. And you become friends. And at some point  you become friends on Facebook  and you become friends in life. You can go and travel and meet people. And I was in Munich a few weeks ago. I went there to open an exposition about Iran and I met there with people from the page that told me   Okay  you're going to be in Europe  I'm coming. I'm coming from France  from Holland  from Germany   of course  and from Israel people came  and we just met there for the first time in real life. I met with people that are supposed to be my enemies for the first time. And we just shake hands  and have a coffee and a nice discussion  and we talk about food and basketball. And that was the end of it. Remember that image from the beginning  At some point we met in real life  and we became friends. And it goes the other way around. Some girl that we met on Facebook never been in Israel  born and raised in Iran  lives in Germany  afraid of Israelis because of what she knows about us  decides after a few months of talking on the Internet with some Israelis to come to Israel  and she gets on the plane and arrives at Ben Gurion and says   Okay  not that big a deal.  So a few weeks ago  the stress is getting higher  so we start this new campaign called  Not ready to die in your war.  I mean  it's plus minus the same message  but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it. And again  something amazing happened  something that we didn't have on the first wave of the campaign. Now people from Iran  the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent  you know  their foot and half their faces  now they're sending their faces  and they're saying   Okay  no problem  we're into it. We are with you.  Just read where those guys are from. And for every guy from Israel  you've got someone from Iran. Just people sending their pictures. Crazy  yes  So    So you may ask yourself  who is this dude  My name is Ronny Edry  and I'm     I'm an Israeli  I'm a father of two  I'm a husband  and I'm a graphic designer. I'm teaching graphic design. And I'm not that naive  because a lot of the time I've been asked  many times I've been asked   Yeah  but  this is really naive  sending flowers over  I mean     I was in the army. I was in the paratroopers for three years  and I know how it looks from the ground. I know how it can look really bad. So to me  this is the courageous thing to do  to try to reach the other side before it's too late  because when it's going to be too late  it's going to be too late. And sometimes war is inevitable  sometimes  but maybe  with  effort  we can avoid it. Maybe as people  because especially in Israel  we're in a democracy. We have the freedom of speech  and maybe that little thing can change something. And really  we can be our own ambassadors. We can just send a message and hope for the best. So I want to ask Michal  my wife  to come with me on the stage just to make with you one image  because it's all about images. And maybe that image will help us change something. Just raise that. Exactly. And I'm just going to take a picture of it  and I'm just going to post it on Facebook with kind of  Israelis for peace  or something. Oh my God. Don't cry. Thank you guys.,Graphic Designer,201212,6.102785977859776
435,875,877,Ross Lovegrove 2006,Ross Lovegrove,male,"Organic design, inspired by nature",Aug 2006,1161,My name is Lovegrove. I only know nine Lovegroves  two of which are my parents. They are first cousins  and you know what happens when  you know    So there's a terribly weird freaky side to me  which I'm fighting with all the time. So to try and get through today  I've kind of disciplined myself with an    minute talk. I was hanging on to have a pee. I thought perhaps if I was hanging on long enough  that would guide me through the    minutes. OK. I am known as Captain Organic and that's a philosophical position as well as an aesthetic position. But today what I'd like to talk to you about is that love of form and how form can touch people's soul and emotion. Not very long ago  not many thousands of years ago  we actually lived in caves  and I don't think we've lost that coding system. We respond so well to form. But I'm interested in creating intelligent form. I'm not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design. This artificially induced consumerism    I think it's atrocious. My world is the world of people like Amory Lovins  Janine Benyus  James Watson. I'm in that world  but I work purely instinctively. I'm not a scientist. I could have been  perhaps  but I work in this world where I trust my instincts. So I am a   st century translator of technology into products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with. And we should be developing things    we should be developing packaging for ideas which elevate people's perceptions and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth and translate into products for everyday use. So  the water bottle. I'll begin with this concept of what I call DNA. DNA  Design  Nature  Art. These are the three things that condition my world. Here is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci      years ago  before photography. It shows how observation  curiosity and instinct work to create amazing art. Industrial design is the art form of the   st century. People like Leonardo    there have not been many    had this amazingly instinctive curiosity. I work from a similar position. I don't want to sound pretentious saying that  but this is my drawing made on a digital pad a couple of years ago    well into the   st century      years later. It's my impression of water. Impressionism being the most valuable art form on the planet as we know it      million dollars  easily  for a Monet. I use  now  a whole new process. A few years ago I reinvented my process to keep up with people like Greg Lynn  Thom Mayne  Zaha Hadid  Rem Koolhaas    all these people that I think are persevering and pioneering with fantastic new ideas of how to create form. This is all created digitally. Here you see the machining  the milling of a block of acrylic. This is what I show to the client to say   That's what I want to do.  At that point  I don't know if that's possible at all. It's a seductor  but I just feel in my bones that that's possible. So we go  we look at the tooling. We look at how that is produced. These are the invisible things that you never see in your life. This is the background noise of industrial design. That is like an Anish Kapoor flowing through a Richard Serra. It is more valuable than the product in my eyes. I don't have one. When I do make some money  I'll have one machined for myself. This is the final product. When they sent it to me  I thought I'd failed. It felt like nothing. It has to feel like nothing. It was when I put the water in that I realized that I'd put a skin on water itself. It's an icon of water itself  and it elevates people's perception of contemporary design. Each bottle is different  meaning the water level will give you a different shape. It's mass individualism from a single product. It fits the hand. It fits arthritic hands. It fits children's hands. It makes the product strong  the tessellation. It's a millefiori of ideas. In the future  they will look like that  because we need to move away from those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things  perhaps  in life. Biopolymers  these new ideas for materials  will come into play in probably a decade. It doesn't look as cool  does it  But I can live up to that. I don't have a problem with that. I design for that condition  biopolymers. It's the future. I took this video in Cape Town last year. This is the freaky side coming out. I have this special interest in things like this  which blow my mind. I don't know whether to  you know  drop to my knees  cry  I don't know what I think. But I just know that nature    nature improves with ever greater purpose that which once existed  and that strangeness is a consequence of innovative thinking. When I look at these things  they look pretty normal to me. But these things evolved over many years  and what we're trying to do    I get three weeks to design a telephone. How the hell do I do that  when you get these things that take hundreds of millions of years to evolve  How do you condense that  It comes back to instinct. I'm not talking about designing telephones that look like that and I'm not looking at designing architecture like that. I'm just interested in natural growth patterns and the beautiful forms that only nature really creates. How that flows through me and how that comes out is what I'm trying to understand. This is a scan through the human forearm. It's then blown up through rapid prototyping to reveal its cellular structure. I have these in my office. My office is a mixture of the Natural History Museum and a NASA space lab. It's a weird  kind of freaky place. This is one of my specimens. This is made    bone is made from a mixture of inorganic minerals and polymers. I studied cooking in school for four years  and in that experience  which was called  domestic science   it was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science qualification. Actually  I put marijuana in everything I cooked    And I had access to all the best girls. It was fabulous. All the guys in the rugby team couldn't understand. Anyway    this is a meringue. This is another sample I have. A meringue is made exactly the same way  in my estimation  as a bone. It's made from polysaccharides and proteins. If you pour water on that  it dissolves. Could we be manufacturing from foodstuffs in the future  Not a bad idea. I don't know. I need to talk to Janine and a few other people about that  but I believe instinctively that that meringue can become something  a car    I don't know. I'm also interested in growth patterns  the unbridled way that nature grows things so you're not restricted by form at all. These interrelated forms  they do inspire everything I do  although I might end up making something incredibly simple. This is a detail of a chair that I've designed in magnesium. It shows this interlocution of elements and the beauty of  kind of  engineering and biological thinking  shown pretty much as a bone structure. Any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object. It's the world's first chair made in magnesium. It cost  .  million dollars to develop. It's called  Go   by Bernhardt  USA. It went into Time magazine in      as the new language of the   st century. Boy. For somebody growing up in Wales in a little village  that's enough. It shows how you make one holistic form  like the car industry  and then you break up what you need. This is an absolutely beautiful way of working. It's a godly way of working. It's organic and it's essential. It's an absolutely fat free design  and when you look at it  you see human beings. When that moves into polymers  you can change the elasticity  the fluidity of the form. This is an idea for a gas injected  one piece polymer chair. What nature does is it drills holes in things. It liberates form. It takes away anything extraneous. That's what I do. I make organic things which are essential. And they look funky  too    but I don't set out to make funky things because I think that's an absolute disgrace. I set out to look at natural forms. If you took the idea of fractal technology further  take a membrane  shrinking it down constantly like nature does    that could be a seat for a chair. It could be a sole for a sports shoe. It could be a car blending into seats. Wow. Let's go for it. That's the kind of stuff. This is what exists in nature. Observation now allows us to bring that natural process into the design process every day. That's what I do. This is a show that's currently on in Tokyo. It's called  Superliquidity.  It's my sculptural investigation. It's like   st century Henry Moore. When you see a Henry Moore  still  your hair stands up. There's some amazing spiritual connect. If he was a car designer  phew  we'd all be driving one. In his day  he was the highest taxpayer in Britain. That is the power of organic design. It contributes immensely to our    sense of being  our sense of relationships with things  our sensuality and  you know  the sort of    even the sort of socio erotic side  which is very important. This is my artwork. This is all my process. These actually are sold as artwork. They're very big prints. But this is how I get to that object. Ironically  that object was made by the Killarney process  which is a brand new process here for the   st century  and I can hear Greg Lynn laughing his socks off as I say that. I'll tell you about that later. When I look into these data images  I see new things. It's self inspired. Diatomic structures  radiolaria  the things that we couldn't see but we can do now    these  again  are cored out. They're made virtually from nothing. They're made from silica. Why not structures from cars like that  Coral  all these natural forces  take away what they don't need and they deliver maximum beauty. We need to be in that realm. I want to do stuff like that. This is a new chair which should come on the market in September. It's for a company called Moroso in Italy. It's a gas injected polymer chair. Those holes you see there are very filtered down  watered down versions of the extremity of the diatomic structures. It goes with the flow of the polymer and you'll see    there's an image coming up right now that shows the full thing. It's great to have companies in Italy who support this way of dreaming. If you see the shadows that come through that  they're actually probably more important than the product  but it's the minimum it takes. The coring out of the back lets you breathe. It takes away any material you don't need and it actually garners flexure too. I was going to break into a dance then. This is some current work I'm doing. I'm looking at single surface structures and how they stretch and flow. It's based on furniture typologies  but that's not the end motivation. It's made from aluminum ... as opposed to aluminium  and it's grown. It's grown in my mind  and then it's grown in terms of the whole process that I go through. This is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry  who build parts for Bentleys and so on. It's being built as we speak and it will be on show in Phillips next year in New York. I have a big show with Phillips Auctioneers. When I see these animations  oh Jesus  I'm blown away. This is what goes on in my studio everyday. I walk    I'm traveling. I come back. Some guy's got that on a computer    there's this like  oh my goodness. So I try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio. This kind of effervescent    fully charged sense of soup that delivers ideas. Single surface products. Furniture's a good one. How you grow legs out of a surface. I would love to build this one day and perhaps I'd like to build it also out of flour  sugar  polymer  wood chips    I don't know  human hair. I don't know. I'd love a go at that. I don't know. If I just got some time. That's the weird side coming out again. A lot of companies don't understand that. Three weeks ago I was with Sony in Tokyo. They said   Give us the dream. What is our dream  How do we beat Apple   I said   You don't copy Apple  that's for sure. You get into biopolymers.  They looked straight through me. What a waste. Anyway. No  it's true. Fuck them. You know  I mean    I'm delivering  they're not taking. I've had this image    years. I've had this image of a water droplet for    years  sitting on a hot bed. That is an image of a car for me. That's the car of the future. It's a water droplet. I've been banging on about this like I can't believe. Cars are all wrong. I'm going to show you something a bit weird now. They laughed everywhere over the world I showed this. The only place that didn't laugh was Moscow. Cars are made from        components. How ridiculous is that  Couldn't you make that from      It's got a vacuum formed  carbon nylon pan. Everything's holistically integrated. It opens and closes like a bread bin. There is no engine. There's a solar panel on the back and there are batteries in the wheels  they're fitted like Formula  . You take them off your wall  you plug them in. Off you go. A three wheeled car  slow  feminine  transparent  so you can see the people in there. You drive different. You see that thing. You do. You do. And not anesthetized  separated from life. There's a hole at the front and there's a reason for that. It's a city car. You drive along. You get out. You drive on to a proboscis. You get out. It lifts you up. It presents the solar panel to the sun  and at night  it's a street lamp. That's what happens if you get inspired by the street lamp first  and do the car second. I can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages  floating around on the ground  driven by AI. When I showed this in South Africa  everybody afterwards was going   Hey  car on a stick. Like this.  Can you imagine  A car on a stick. If you put it next to contemporary architecture  it feels totally natural to me. And that's what I do with my furniture. I'm not putting Charles Eames' furniture in buildings anymore. I'm trying to build furniture which fits architecture. I'm trying to build transportation systems. I work on aircraft for Airbus  I do all this sort of stuff trying to force these natural  inspired by nature dreams home. I'm going to finish on two things. This is the stereolithography of a staircase. It's a little bit of a dedication to James  James Watson. I built this thing for my studio. It cost me         dollars to build this. Most people go and buy the Aston Martin. I built this. This is the data that goes with that. Incredibly complex. Took about two years  because I'm looking for fat free design. Lean  efficient things. Healthy products. This is built by composites. It's a single element which rotates around to create a holistic element  and this is a carbon fiber handrail which is only supported in two places. Modern materials allow us to do modern things. This is a shot in the studio. This is how it looks pretty much every day. You wouldn't want to have a fear of heights coming down it. There is virtually no handrail. It doesn't pass any standards. Who cares  And it has an internal handrail which gives it its strength. It's this holistic integration. That's my studio. It's subterranean. It's in Notting Hill  next to all the crap    the prostitutes and all that stuff. It's next to David Hockney's original studio. It has a lighting system that changes throughout the day. My guys go out for lunch. The door's open. They come back in  because it's normally raining and they prefer to stay in. This is my studio. Elephant skull from Oxford University      . I bought that last year. They're very difficult to find. If anybody's got a whale skeleton they want to sell me  I'll put it in the studio. So I'm just going to interject a little bit with some of the things that you'll see in the video. It's a homemade video  made it myself at three o'clock in the morning just to show you how my real world is. You never see that. You never see architects or designers showing you their real world. This is called a  Plasnet.  It's a new bio polycarbonate chair I'm doing in Italy. World's first bamboo bike with folding handlebars. We should all be riding one of these. As China buys all these crappy cars  we should be riding things like this. Counterbalance. Like I say  it's a cross between Natural History Museum and a NASA laboratory. It's full of prototypes and objects. It's self inspirational  again. I mean  the rare times when I'm there  I do enjoy it. And I get lots and lots of kids coming. I'm a contaminator for all those children of investment bankers    wankers. Sorry. That's a solar seed. It's a concept for new architecture. That thing on the top is the world's first solar powered garden lamp    the first produced. Giles Revell should be talking here today    amazing photography of things you can't see. The first sculptural model I made for that thing in Tokyo. Lots of stuff. There's a little leaf chair    that golden looking thing is called  Leaf.  It's made from Kevlar. On the wall is my book called  Supernatural   which allows me to remember what I've done  because I forget. There's an aerated brick I did in Limoges last year  in Concepts for New Ceramics in Architecture. Gernot Oberfell  working at three o'clock in the morning    and I don't pay overtime. Overtime is the passion of design  so join the club or don't. No  it's true. People like Tom and Greg    we're traveling like you can't    we fit it all in. I don't know how we do it. Next week I'm at Electrolux in Sweden  then I'm in Beijing on Friday. You work that one out. And when I see Ed's photographs  I think  why the hell am I going to China  It's true. It's true. Because there's a soul in this whole thing. We need to have a new instinct for the   st century. We need to combine all this stuff. If all the people who were talking over this period worked on a car together  it would be a joy  absolute joy. So there's a new X light system I'm doing in Japan. There's Tuareg shoes from North Africa. There's a Kifwebe mask. These are my sculptures. A copper jelly mold. It sounds like some quiz show or something  doesn't it  So  it's going to end. Thank you  James  for your great inspiration. Thank you very much.,Industrial designer,200608,6.178773809523817
438,1659,1661,Sam Harris 2010,Sam Harris,male,Science can answer moral questions,Mar 2010,1371,I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values. Now  it's generally understood that questions of morality    questions of good and evil and right and wrong    are questions about which science officially has no opinion. It's thought that science can help us get what we value  but it can never tell us what we ought to value. And  consequently  most people    I think most people probably here    think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life  questions like   What is worth living for    What is worth dying for    What constitutes a good life   So  I'm going to argue that this is an illusion    that the separation between science and human values is an illusion    and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history. Now  it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values  because science deals with facts  and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres. It's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be. But I think this is quite clearly untrue. Values are a certain kind of fact. They are facts about the well being of conscious creatures. Why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks  Why don't we feel compassion for rocks  It's because we don't think rocks can suffer. And if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects  as indeed we are  it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering. Now  the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim  This is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects. And there's no notion  no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes. Even if you get your values from religion  even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death    either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell    you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes. And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim  which  of course  may or may not be true. Now  to speak about the conditions of well being in this life  for human beings  we know that there is a continuum of such facts. We know that it's possible to live in a failed state  where everything that can go wrong does go wrong    where mothers cannot feed their children  where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration  where people are murdered indiscriminately. And we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic  to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable. And we know    we know    that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space. Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea  Probably not. Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye  so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors  Probably not. There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish  whether or not we understand these truths. And morality relates to these truths. So  in talking about values we are talking about facts. Now  of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels    from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements. But if we're going to talk about human well being we are  of necessity  talking about the human brain. Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain    whatever happens after death. Even if the suicide bomber does get    virgins in the afterlife  in this life  his personality    his rather unfortunate personality    is the product of his brain. So the contributions of culture    if culture changes us  as indeed it does  it changes us by changing our brains. And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can  at least in principle  be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind    neuroscience  psychology  etc. So  what I'm arguing is that value's reduced to facts    to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings. And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings. And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape  with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well being of conscious creatures  both personal and collective. And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well being that we rarely access  that few people access. And these await our discovery. Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual. Perhaps there are other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them. Now  let me be clear about what I'm not saying. I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space  or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question. I don't think  for instance  that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child  or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities  or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense. But if questions affect human well being then they do have answers  whether or not we can find them. And just admitting this    just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish    will change the way we talk about morality  and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future. For instance  there are    states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal  where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board  hard  and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin. And hundreds of thousands of children  incidentally  are subjected to this every year. The locations of these enlightened districts  I think  will fail to surprise you. We're not talking about Connecticut. And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious. The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod  lest we spoil the child    this is in Proverbs    and     and I believe    . But we can ask the obvious question  Is it a good idea  generally speaking  to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior  Is there any doubt that this question has an answer  and that it matters  Now  many of you might worry that the notion of well being is truly undefined  and seemingly perpetually open to be re construed. And so  how therefore can there be an objective notion of well being  Well  consider by analogy  the concept of physical health. The concept of physical health is undefined. As we just heard from Michael Specter  it has changed over the years. When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably   . It's now around    in the developed world. There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age     will be considered a profound disability. People will send you donations when you're in that condition. Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open  genuinely open for revision  does not make it vacuous. The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science. Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape  There may be equivalent ways to thrive  there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing. Now  why wouldn't this undermine an objective morality  Well think of how we talk about food  I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat. There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food. But there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison. The fact that there are many right answers to the question   What is food   does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition. Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions. So  for instance  if it's really wrong to lie  it must always be wrong to lie  and if you can find an exception  well then there's no such thing as moral truth. Why would we think this  Consider  by analogy  the game of chess. Now  if you're going to play good chess  a principle like   Don't lose your Queen   is very good to follow. But it clearly admits some exceptions. There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do. There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do. And yet  chess is a domain of perfect objectivity. The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all. Now  this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere. Consider the great problem of women's bodies  What to do about them  Well this is one thing you can do about them  You can cover them up. Now  it is the position  generally speaking  of our intellectual community that while we may not like this  we might think of this as  wrong  in Boston or Palo Alto  who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags  And who are we to say  even  that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable  or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way  Well  who are we not to say this  Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well being that we have to be non judgmental about a practice like this  I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil    women should be able to wear whatever they want  as far as I'm concerned. But what does voluntary mean in a community where  when a girl gets raped  her father's first impulse  rather often  is to murder her out of shame  Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute  Your daughter gets raped  and what you want to do is kill her. What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing  Now  to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society. For instance  this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world. Now  granted  for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images. But if we are in a reflective mood  we can ask   Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies   I mean  is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children  Probably not. OK  so perhaps there's some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance. Perhaps there are many such places    again  given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape. But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak. Now the irony  from my perspective  is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another. And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind  not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well being. In fact  the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering. This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue. But the demagogues are right about one thing  We need a universal conception of human values. Now  what stands in the way of this  Well  one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality    especially secular  academic  scientist types. When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives. So  for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion  and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness. On the other hand  we have someone like Ted Bundy  Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women. So  we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time. Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say   Well  there's nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about    really right about    or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science. He likes chocolate  he likes vanilla. There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other.  Notice that we don't do this in science. On the left you have Edward Witten. He's a string theorist. If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around  in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten. The other half will tell you they don't like the question. So  what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said  String theory is bogus. It doesn't resonate with me. It's not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale. I'm not a fan.  Well  nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist  I don't understand string theory. I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory. I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member. But this is just the point. Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded. That is what it is to have a domain of expertise. That is what it is for knowledge to count. How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise  or moral talent  or moral genius even  How have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count  How have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering  Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering  No. How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well being  So  this  I think  is what the world needs now. It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing  and morality relates to that domain of facts. It is possible for individuals  and even for whole cultures  to care about the wrong things  which is to say that it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering. Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality. We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less  and they will one day mean nothing. We live in a world filled with destructive technology  and this technology cannot be uninvented  it will always be easier to break things than to fix them. It seems to me  therefore  patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads  or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes. We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life. And to do that  we have to admit that these questions have answers. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  So  some combustible material there. Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world  hearing some of this  may well be doing the screaming with rage thing  after as well  some of them. Language seems to be really important here. When you're talking about the veil  you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags. I've lived in the Muslim world  spoken with a lot of Muslim women. And some of them would say something else. They would say   No  you know  this is a celebration of female specialness  it helps build that and it's a result of the fact that     and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view     that male lust is not to be trusted.  I mean  can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist  Sam Harris  Yeah  well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence  watching the clock ticking  but the question is  What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations  and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself  And so  if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil  or a very funny hat  or tattoo their face    I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want  but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under. And so I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it  especially when it's     degrees out and you're wearing a full burqa. CA  A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress. But can you reconcile that  I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn't become one dimensional  where we all have to think the same. Paint your picture of what rolling the clock    years forward      years forward  how you would like to think of the world  balancing moral progress with richness. SH  Well  I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail  then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail. So  we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion  and we're going to understand the factors that encourage it    whether they're genetic  whether they're how people talk to one another  whether they're economic systems  and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space. So  everything is not going to be up for grabs. It's not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well educated in the context of men who do desire women. I mean I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea    but at a certain point we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them. Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems  And I think there are clearly right answers to that. CA  And if the results come out that actually they do  are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues  SH  Well yeah  modulo one obvious fact  that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system. So  you can say like   Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend  I chopped his head off. And that was the most compassionate thing I could do.  If you get all those parts aligned  yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love. But again  then we have to talk about well being in a larger context. It's all of us in this together  not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus. CA  Sam  this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours. We don't have that  but maybe another time. Thank you for coming to TED. SH  Really an honor. Thank you.,Neuroscientist and philosopher,201003,5.959032597266037
448,1690,1692,Sebastian Wernicke 2010,Sebastian Wernicke,male,"Lies, damned lies and statistics (about TEDTalks)",Apr 2010,336,If you go on the TED website  you can currently find there over a full week of TEDTalk videos  over  .  million words of transcripts and millions of user ratings. And that's a huge amount of data. And it got me wondering  If you took all this data and put it through statistical analysis  could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk  Could you create the ultimate TEDTalk  And also  could you create the worst possible TEDTalk that they would still let you get away with  To find this out  I looked at three things  I looked at the topic that you should choose  I looked at how you should deliver it and the visuals onstage. Now  with the topic  There's a whole range of topics you can choose  but you should choose wisely  because your topic strongly correlates with how users will react to your talk. Now  to make this more concrete  let's look at the list of top    words that statistically stick out in the most favorite TEDTalks and in the least favorite TEDTalks. So if you came here to talk about how French coffee will spread happiness in our brains  that's a go. Whereas  if you wanted to talk about your project involving oxygen  girls  aircraft    actually  I would like to hear that talk   Laughter  but statistics say it's not so good. Oh  well. If you generalize this  the most favorite TEDTalks are those that feature topics we can connect with  both easily and deeply  such as happiness  our own body  food  emotions. And the more technical topics  such as architecture  materials and  strangely enough  men  those are not good topics to talk about. How should you deliver your talk  TED is famous for keeping a very sharp eye on the clock  so they're going to hate me for revealing this  because  actually  you should talk as long as they will let you.  Laughter  Because the most favorite TEDTalks are  on average  over    percent longer than the least favorite ones. And this holds true for all ranking lists on TED.com except if you want to have a talk that's beautiful  inspiring or funny. Then  you should be brief.  Laughter  But other than that  talk until they drag you off the stage. Now  while ... While you're pushing the clock  there's a few rules to obey. I found these rules out by comparing the statistics of four word phrases that appear more often in the most favorite TEDTalks as opposed to the least favorite TEDTalks. I'll give you three examples. First of all  I must  as a speaker  provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you  instead of saying what I can't have. Secondly  it's imperative that you do not cite The New York Times. And finally  it's okay for the speaker    that's the good news    to fake intellectual capacity. If I don't understand something  I can just say   etc.  etc.  You'll all stay with me. It's perfectly fine. Now  let's go to the visuals. The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker. And analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite TED speakers  you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average  make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed up than the average TED speaker. Slides are okay  though you might consider going for props. And now the most important thing  that is the mood onstage. Color plays a very important role. Color closely correlates with the ratings that talks get on the website. For example  fascinating talks contain a statistically high amount of exactly this blue color   Laughter  much more than the average TEDTalk. Ingenious TEDTalks  much more this green color  etc.  et. Now  personally  I think I'm not the first one who has done this analysis  but I'll leave this to your good judgment. So  now it's time to put it all together and design the ultimate TEDTalk. Now  since this is TEDActive  and I learned from my analysis that I should actually give you something  I will not impose the ultimate or worst TEDTalk on you  but rather give you a tool to create your own. And I call this tool the TEDPad. And the TEDPad is a matrix of     specifically selected  highly curated sentences that you can easily piece together to get your own TEDTalk. You only have to make one decision  and that is  Are you going to use the white version for very good TEDTalks  about creativity  human genius  Or are you going to go with a black version  which will allow you to create really bad TEDTalks  mostly about blogs  politics and stuff  So  download it and have fun with it. Now I hope you enjoy the session. I hope you enjoy designing your own ultimate and worst possible TEDTalks. And I hope some of you will be inspired for next year to create this  which I really want to see. Thank you very much.,Data scientist,201004,6.285347826086959
450,2,4,Sergey Brin + Larry Page 2007,Sergey Brin + Larry Page,male,The genesis of Google,May 2007,1205,Sergey Brin  I want to discuss a question I know that's been pressing on many of your minds. We spoke to you last several years ago. And before I get started today  since many of you are wondering  I just wanted to get it out of the way. The answer is boxers. Now I hope all of you feel better. Do you know what this might be  Does anyone know what that is  Audience  Yes. SB  What is it  Audience  It's people logging on to Google around the world. SB  Wow  OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it. But this is what helped me see it. This is what we run at the office  that actually runs real time. Here it's slightly logged. But here you can see around the world how people are using Google. And every one of those rising dots represents probably about        searches  or something like that. And they're labeled by color right now  by language. So you can see  here we are in the U.S.  and they're all coming up red. There we are in Monterey    hopefully I can get it right. You can see that Japan is busy at night  right there. We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese. There's a lot of activity in China. There's a lot of activity in India. There's some in the Middle East  the little pockets. And Europe  which is right now in the middle of the day  is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages. Now you can also see  if I turn this around here    hopefully I won't shake the world too much. But you can also see  there are places where there's not so much. Australia  because there just aren't very many people there. And this is something that we should really work on  which is Africa  which is just a few trickles  basically in South Africa and a few other urban cities. But basically  what we've noticed is these queries  which come in at thousands per second  are available everywhere there is power. And pretty much everywhere there is power  there is the Internet. And even in Antarctica    well  at least this time of year    we from time to time will see a query rising up. And if we had it plotted correctly  I think the International Space Station would have it  too. So this is some of the challenge that we have here  is you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the    there we go. This is how we have to move the bits around to actually get the people the answers to their questions. You can see that there's a lot of data running around. It has to go all over the world  through fibers  through satellites  through all kinds of connections. And it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies as low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good. But you can see also  once again    so some places are much more wired than others  and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S.  going up over to Asia  Europe in the other direction  and so forth. Now what I would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like. And if we can switch to slides    all right  here we go. So this is slowed down. This is what one second looks like. And this is what we spend a lot of our time doing  is just making sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load. Now  each one of those queries has an interesting life and tale of its own. I mean  it could be somebody's health  it could be somebody's career  something important to them. And it could potentially be something as important as tomato sauce  or in this case  ketchup. So this is a query that we had    I guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others. You can see that it got started right here. In the U.S. and Spain  it was popular at the same time. But it didn't have quite the same pickup in the U.S. as it did in Spain. And then from Spain  it went to Italy  and then Germany got excited  and maybe right now the U.K. is enjoying it. And so I guess the U.S. finally  finally started to like it  too. And I just wanted to play it for you. Anyway  you can all enjoy it for yourselves    hopefully that search will work. As a part of    you know  part of what we want to do to grow our company is to have more searches. And what that means is we want to have more people who are healthy and educated. More animals  if they start doing searches as well. But partly  we want to make the world a better place  and so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation  and we're in the process of setting that up. We also have a program already called Google Grants that now serves over     different charities around the world  and these are some of the charities that are on there. And it's something I'm very excited to be a part of. In fact  many of the organizations that are here    the Acumen Fund  I think ApproTEC we have running  I'm not sure if that one's up yet    and many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants. They run Google ads  and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know. One of the earlier results that we got    we have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village of    Vietnamese girls for their education  and that was one of the earliest results. And as I said  now there have been many  many stories that have come in  because we do have hundreds of charities in there  and the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor. Now does anybody know who this is  A ha  Audience  Orkut. SB  Yes  Somebody got it. This is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut  Do we have any  Okay  not very many people know about it. I'll explain it in a second. This is one of our engineers. We find that they work better when they're submerged and covered with leaves. That's how we churn those products out. Orkut had a vision to create a social network. I know all of you are thinking   Yet another social network.  But it was a dream of his  and we  basically  when people really want to do something  well  we generally let them. So this is what he built. We just released it in a test phase last month  and it's been taking off. This is our VP of Engineering. You can see the red hair  and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there. And these are all of his friends. So this is how    we just deployed it    we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service  and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out. And now we've grown to over         members. And they spread  actually  very quickly  even outside the U.S. You can see  even though the U.S. is still the majority here    though  by the way  search wise  it's only about    percent of our traffic    but it's already going to Japan  and the U.K.  and Europe  and all the rest of the countries. So it's a fun little project. There are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these. But it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it goes. And    well  I'll leave you in suspense. Larry  you can explain this one. Larry Page  Thank you  Sergey. So one of the things    both Sergey and I went to a Montessori school  and I think  for some reason  this has been incorporated in Google. And Sergey mentioned Orkut  which is something that  you know  Orkut wanted to do in his time  and we call this    at Google  we've embodied this as  the    percent time   and the idea is  for    percent of your time  if you're working at Google  you can do what you think is the best thing to do. And many  many things at Google have come out of that  such as Orkut and also Google News. And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this. Mendel  who was supposed to be teaching high school students  actually  you know  discovered the laws of genetics    as a hobby  basically. So many  many useful things come out of this. And News  which I just mentioned  was started by a researcher. And he just    he    after       he got really interested in the news. And he said   Why don't I look at the news better   And so he started clustering it by category  and then he started using it  and then his friends started using it. And then  besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom  we made it a Googlette  which is basically a small project at Google. So it'd be like three people  or something like that  and they would try to make a product. And we wouldn't really be sure if it's going to work or not. And in News' case  you know  they had a couple of people working on it for a while  and then more and more people started using it  and then we put it out on the Internet  and more and more people started using it. And now it's a real  full blown project with more people on it. And this is how we keep our innovation running. I think usually  as companies get bigger  they find it really hard to have small  innovative projects. And we had this problem  too  for a while  and we said   Oh  we really need a new concept.  You know  the Googlettes    that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not  but we hope it will  and if we do enough of them  some of them will really work and turn out  such as News. But then we had a problem because then we had over     projects. And I don't know about all of you  but I have trouble keeping     things in my head at once. And we found that if we just wrote all of them down and ordered them    and these are kind of made up. Don't really pay attention to them. For example  the  Buy Iceland  was from a media article. We would never do such a crazy thing  but    in any case  we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them  that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be. And this was kind of a surprise to me  but we found that as long as you keep the     things in your head  which you did by writing them down  that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources. And so that's basically what we've done since we instituted that a few years ago  and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative and still stay reasonably well organized. The other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important  and so naturally  people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities. I just wanted to highlight a couple of things that are new  or you might not know about. And the top thing  actually  is the Deskbar. So this is a new    how many of you use the Google Toolbar  Raise your hands. How many of you use the Deskbar  All right  see  You guys should try it out. But if you go to our site and search for  Deskbar   you'll get this. And the idea is  instead of a toolbar  it's just present all the time on your screen on the bottom  and you can do searches really easily. And it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar. Thank you  Sergey. This is another example of a project that somebody at Google was really passionate about  and they just  they got going  and it's really  really a great product  and really taking off. Google Answers is something we started  which is really cool  which lets you    for five to     dollars  you can type a question in  and then there's a pool of researchers that go out and research it for you  and it's guaranteed and all that  and you can get actually very good answers to things without spending all that time yourself. Froogle lets you search shopping information  and Blogger lets you publish things. But all of these    well  these were all sort of innovative things that we did that    you know  we try many  many different things in our company. We also like to innovate in our physical space  and we noticed in meetings  you know  you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off  and they're noisy  so people shut them off. And we didn't like that  so we actually  in maybe a couple of weeks  we built these little enclosures that enclosed the projectors  and so we can leave them on all the time and they're completely silent. And as a result  we were able to build some software that also lets us manage a meeting  so when you walk into a meeting room now  it lists all the meetings that are happening  you can very easily take notes  and they just get emailed automatically to all the people that were present in the meeting. And as we become more of a global company  we find these things really affect us    you know  can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room  And things like that. And simple things like this can really make a big difference. We also have a lot of engineers in those meetings  and they don't always do their laundry as much as they should. And so we found it was pretty helpful to have laundry machines  for our younger employees especially  and ... we also allow dogs and things like that  and we've had  I think  a really fun culture at our company  which helps people work and enjoy what they're doing. This is actually our  cult picture.  I just wanted to show quickly. We had this on our website for a while  but we found that after we put it on our website  we didn't get any job applications anymore. But anyway  every year we've taken the whole company on a ski trip. A lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other  and informally. And I think we've done a good job encouraging that. It makes it a really fun place to work. Along with our logos  too  which I think really embody our culture when we change things. In the early days  we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand  you know  because  you know  you'd never want to change your logo. You want it to be consistent. And we said   Well  that doesn't sound so much fun. Why don't we try changing it every day   One of the things that really excites me about what we're doing now is we have this thing called AdSense  and this is a little bit foreshadowing    this is from before Dean dropped out. But the idea is  like  on a newspaper  for example  we show you relevant ads. And this is hard to read  but this says  Battle for New Hampshire  Howard Dean for President     articles on Howard Dean. And these ads are generated automatically    like in this case  on the Washington Post    from the content on the site. And so we use our over         advertisers and millions of advertisements  so we pick the one that's most relevant to what you're actually looking at  much as we do on search. So the idea is we can make advertising useful  not just annoying  right  And the nice thing about this  we have a self serve program  and many thousands of websites have signed up  and this let's them really make money. And I    you know  there's a number of people I met    I met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party  and he said   You know  I wasn't making any money. I just put this thing on my site and I'm making        dollars a month. And  you know  thank you. I don't have to do my other job now.  And I think this is really important for us  because it makes the Internet work better. It makes content get better  it makes searching work better  when people can really make their livelihood from producing great content. So this session is supposed to be about the future  so I'd thought I'd talk at least briefly about it. And the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search  you really have to be smart. Because you can type  you know  any kind of thing into Google  and you expect an answer back  right  But finding things is tricky  and so you really want intelligence. And in fact  the ultimate search engine would be smart. It would be artificial intelligence. And so that's something we work on  and we even have some people who are excited enough and crazy enough to work on it now  and that's really their goal. So we always hope that Google will be smart  but we're always surprised when other people think that it is. And so I just wanted to give a funny example of this. This is a blog from Iraq  and it's not really what I'm going to talk about  but I just wanted to show you an example. Maybe  Sergey  you can highlight this. So we decided    actually  the highlight's right there. Oh  thank you. So   related searches   right there. You can't see it that well  but we decided we should put in this feature into our AdSense ads  called  related searches.  And so we'd say  you know   Did you mean 'search for'     what is this  in this case   Saddam Hussein   because this blog is about Iraq    and you know  in addition to the ads  and we thought this would be a great idea. And so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed  and he said   You know  I'm sleeping a lot.  He was just kind of writing about his life. And our algorithms    not a person  of course  but our algorithms  our computers    read his blog and decided that the related search was   I am bored.  And he read this  and he thought a person had decided that he was boring  and it was very unfortunate  and he said   You know  what are these  you know  bastards at Google doing  Why don't they like my blog   And so then we read his blog  which was getting    you know  sort of going from bad to worse  and we said the related search was   Retards.  And then  you know  he got even more mad  and he wrote    like  started swearing and so on. And then we produced  You suck.  And finally  it ended with  Kiss my ass.  And so basically  he thought he was dealing with something smart  and of course  you know  we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out  and it didn't quite work  and we don't have this feature anymore. So with that  maybe I can switch back to the world. I wanted to end just by saying that there's a couple things that really make me excited to be involved with Google  and one of those is that we're able to make money largely through advertising  and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that was that we're able to serve everyone in the world without worrying about  you know  places that don't have as much money. So we don't have to worry about our products being sold  for example  for less money in places that are poor  and then they get re imported into the U.S.    for example  with the drug industry. And I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search  and I think that's a tremendous  tremendous benefit. The other thing I wanted to mention just briefly is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility to provide people the right information  and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine    that we should provide very objective information. And so in our search results  we never accept payment for our search results. We accept payment for advertising  and we mark it as such. And that's unlike many of our competitors. And I think decisions we're able to make like that have a tremendous impact on the world  and it makes me really proud to be involved with Google. So thank you.,,200705,6.230646929824562
451,1759,1761,Seth Godin 2007,Seth Godin,male,How to get your ideas to spread,Apr 2007,1012,I'm going to give you four specific examples  I'm going to cover at the end about how a company called Silk tripled their sales  how an artist named Jeff Koons went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact  to how Frank Gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect. And one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years    a record label I started that had a CD called  Sauce.  Before I can do that I've got to tell you about sliced bread  and a guy named Otto Rohwedder. Now  before sliced bread was invented in the     s I wonder what they said  Like the greatest invention since the telegraph or something. But this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread  and he focused  like most inventors did  on the patent part and the making part. And the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this    that for the first    years after sliced bread was available no one bought it  no one knew about it  it was a complete and total failure. And the reason is that until Wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread  no one wanted it. That the success of sliced bread  like the success of almost everything we've talked about at this conference  is not always about what the patent is like  or what the factory is like    it's about can you get your idea to spread  or not. And I think that the way you're going to get what you want  or cause the change that you want to change  to happen  is to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread. And it doesn't matter to me whether you're running a coffee shop or you're an intellectual  or you're in business  or you're flying hot air balloons. I think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do. That what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion. That people who can spread ideas  regardless of what those ideas are  win. When I talk about it I usually pick business  because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation  and because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score. But I want you to forgive me when I use these examples because I'm talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do. At the heart of spreading ideas is TV and stuff like TV. TV and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way. I call it the  TV industrial complex.  The way the TV industrial complex works  is you buy some ads  interrupt some people  that gets you distribution. You use the distribution you get to sell more products. You take the profit from that to buy more ads. And it goes around and around and around  the same way that the military industrial complex worked a long time ago. That model of  and we heard it yesterday    if we could only get onto the homepage of Google  if we could only figure out how to get promoted there  or grab that person by the throat  and tell them about what we want to do. If we did that then everyone would pay attention  and we would win. Well  this TV industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours. I mean  all of these products succeeded because someone figured out how to touch people in a way they weren't expecting  in a way they didn't necessarily want  with an ad  over and over again until they bought it. And the thing that's happened is  they canceled the TV industrial complex. That just over the last few years  what anybody who markets anything has discovered is that it's not working the way that it used to. This picture is really fuzzy  I apologize  I had a bad cold when I took it. But the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child. I go to the deli  I'm sick  I need to buy some medicine. The brand manager for that blue product spent     million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year.     million dollars interrupting me with TV commercials and magazine ads and Spam and coupons and shelving allowances and spiff    all so I could ignore every single message. And I ignored every message because I don't have a pain reliever problem. I buy the stuff in the yellow box because I always have. And I'm not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem  because I don't care. Here's a magazine called  Hydrate.  It's     pages about water. Articles about water  ads about water. Imagine what the world was like    years ago  with just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek. Now there are magazines about water. New product from Coke Japan  water salad. Coke Japan comes out with a new product every three weeks  because they have no idea what's going to work and what's not. I couldn't have written this better myself. It came out four days ago    I circled the important parts so you can see them here. They've come out... Arby's is going to spend    million dollars promoting an oven mitt with the voice of Tom Arnold  hoping that that will get people to go to Arby's and buy a roast beef sandwich. Now  I had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated TV commercial featuring Tom Arnold  that would get you to get in your car  drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich. Now  this is Copernicus  and he was right  when he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea.  The world revolves around me.  Me  me  me  me. My favorite person    me. I don't want to get email from anybody  I want to get  memail.  So consumers  and I don't just mean people who buy stuff at the Safeway  I mean people at the Defense Department who might buy something  or people at  you know  the New Yorker who might print your article. Consumers don't care about you at all  they just don't care. Part of the reason is    they've got way more choices than they used to  and way less time. And in a world where we have too many choices and too little time  the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff. And my parable here is you're driving down the road and you see a cow  and you keep driving because you've seen cows before. Cows are invisible. Cows are boring. Who's going to stop and pull over and say     Oh  look  a cow.  Nobody. But if the cow was purple    isn't that a great special effect  I could do that again if you want. If the cow was purple  you'd notice it for a while. I mean  if all cows were purple you'd get bored with those  too. The thing that's going to decide what gets talked about  what gets done  what gets changed  what gets purchased  what gets built  is   Is it remarkable   And  remarkable  is a really cool word  because we think it just means  neat   but it also means  worth making a remark about.  And that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going. That two of the hottest cars in the United States is a        dollar giant car  big enough to hold a Mini in its trunk. People are paying full price for both  and the only thing they have in common is that they don't have anything in common. Every week  the number one best selling DVD in America changes. It's never  The Godfather   it's never  Citizen Kane   it's always some third rate movie with some second rate star. But the reason it's number one is because that's the week it came out. Because it's new  because it's fresh. People saw it and said  I didn't know that was there  and they noticed it. Two of the big success stories of the last    years in retail    one sells things that are super expensive in a blue box  and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them. The only thing they have in common is that they're different. We're now in the fashion business  no matter what we do for a living  we're in the fashion business. And people in the fashion business know what it's like to be in the fashion business    they're used to it. The rest of us have to figure out how to think that way. How to understand that it's not about interrupting people with big full page ads  or insisting on meetings with people. But it's a totally different sort of process that determines which ideas spread  and which ones don't. They sold a billion dollars' worth of Aeron chairs by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair. They turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought  to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work. This guy  Lionel Poil ne  the most famous baker in the world    he died two and a half months ago  and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend. He lived in Paris. Last year  he sold    million dollars' worth of French bread. Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned  by one baker at a time  in a wood fired oven. And when Lionel started his bakery  the French pooh pooh ed it. They didn't want to buy his bread. It didn't look like  French bread.  It wasn't what they expected. It was neat  it was remarkable  and slowly  it spread from one person to another person until finally  it became the official bread of three star restaurants in Paris. Now he's in London  and he ships by FedEx all around the world. What marketers used to do is make average products for average people. That's what mass marketing is. Smooth out the edges  go for the center  that's the big market. They would ignore the geeks  and God forbid  the laggards. It was all about going for the center. But in a world where the TV industrial complex is broken  I don't think that's a strategy we want to use any more. I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they're really good at ignoring you. But market to these people because they care. These are the people who are obsessed with something. And when you talk to them  they'll listen  because they like listening    it's about them. And if you're lucky  they'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve  and it'll spread. It'll spread to the entire curve. They have something I call  otaku     it's a great Japanese word. It describes the desire of someone who's obsessed to say  drive across Tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place  because that's what they do  they get obsessed with it. To make a product  to market an idea  to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn't have a constituency with an otaku  is almost impossible. Instead  you have to find a group that really  desperately cares about what it is you have to say. Talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends. There's a hot sauce otaku  but there's no mustard otaku. That's why there's lots and lots of kinds of hot sauces  and not so many kinds of mustard. Not because it's hard to make interesting mustard    you could make interesting mustard    but people don't  because no one's obsessed with it  and thus no one tells their friends. Krispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out. It has a strategy  and what they do is  they enter a city  they talk to the people  with the otaku  and then they spread through the city to the people who've just crossed the street. This yoyo right here cost     dollars  but it sleeps for    minutes. Not everybody wants it but they don't care. They want to talk to the people who do  and maybe it'll spread. These guys make the loudest car stereo in the world. It's as loud as a     jet. You can't get in  the car's got bulletproof glass  because it'll blow out the windshield otherwise. But the fact remains that when someone wants to put a couple of speakers in their car  if they've got the otaku or they've heard from someone who does  they go ahead and they pick this. It's really simple    you sell to the people who are listening  and just maybe  those people tell their friends. So when Steve Jobs talks to        people at his keynote  who are all tuned in from     countries watching his two hour commercial    that's the only thing keeping his company in business    it's that those        people care desperately enough to watch a two hour commercial  and then tell their friends. Pearl Jam     albums released in the last two years. Every one made a profit. How  They only sell them on their website. Those people who buy them have the otaku  and then they tell their friends  and it spreads and it spreads. This hospital crib cost        dollars     times the standard. But hospitals are buying it faster than any other model. Hard Candy nail polish  doesn't appeal to everybody  but to the people who love it  they talk about it like crazy. This paint can right here saved the Dutch Boy paint company  making them a fortune. It costs    percent more than regular paint because Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about  because it's remarkable. They didn't just slap a new ad on the product  they changed what it meant to build a paint product. AmIhotornot.com    everyday         people go to this site  run by two volunteers  and I can tell you they are hard graders    They didn't get this way by advertising a lot. They got this way by being remarkable  sometimes a little too remarkable. And this picture frame has a cord going out the back  and you plug it into the wall. My father has this on his desk  and he sees his grandchildren everyday  changing constantly. And every single person who walks into his office hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk. And one person at a time  the idea spreads. These are not diamonds  not really. They're made from  cremains.  After you're cremated you can have yourself made into a gem. Oh  you like my ring  It's my grandmother. Fastest growing business in the whole mortuary industry. But you don't have to be Ozzie Osborne    you don't have to be super outrageous to do this. What you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them. A couple of quick rules to wrap up. The first one is  Design is free when you get to scale. The people who come up with stuff that's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them. Number two  The riskiest thing you can do now is be safe. Proctor and Gamble knows this  right  The whole model of being Proctor and Gamble is always about average products for average people. That's risky. The safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes  be remarkable. And being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do. Very good is boring. Very good is average. It doesn't matter whether you're making a record album  or you're an architect  or you have a tract on sociology. If it's very good  it's not going to work  because no one's going to notice it. So my three stories. Silk put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section. Sales tripled. Why  Milk  milk  milk  milk  milk    not milk. For the people who were there and looking at that section  it was remarkable. They didn't triple their sales with advertising  they tripled it by doing something remarkable. That is a remarkable piece of art. You don't have to like it  but a    foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of New York City is remarkable. Frank Gehry didn't just change a museum  he changed an entire city's economy by designing one building that people from all over the world went to see. Now  at countless meetings at  you know  the Portland City Council  or who knows where  they said  we need an architect    can we get Frank Gehry  Because he did something that was at the fringes. And my big failure  I came out with an entire    A record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in SACD  this remarkable new format    and I marketed it straight to people with        dollar stereos. People with        dollar stereos don't like new music. So what you need to do is figure out who does care. Who is going to raise their hand and say   I want to hear what you're doing next   and sell something to them. The last example I want to give you. This is a map of Soap Lake  Washington. As you can see  if that's nowhere  it's in the middle of it. But they do have a lake. And people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake. They don't anymore. So the founding fathers said   We've got some money to spend. What can we build here   And like most committees  they were going to build something pretty safe. And then an artist came to them    this is a true artist's rendering    he wants to build a    foot tall lava lamp in the center of town. That's a purple cow  that's something worth noticing. I don't know about you  but if they build it  that's where I'm going to go. Thank you very much for your attention.,Marketer and author,200704,6.10900289017341
458,577,579,Sherwin Nuland 2007,Sherwin Nuland,male,How electroshock therapy changed me,Oct 2007,1307,I'd like to do pretty much what I did the first time  which is to choose a light hearted theme. Last time  I talked about death and dying. This time  I'm going to talk about mental illness. But it has to be technological  so I'll talk about electroshock therapy.  Laughter  You know  ever since man had any notion that some of his other people  his colleagues  could be different  could be strange  could be severely depressed or what we now recognize as schizophrenia  he was certain that this kind of illness had to come from evil spirits getting into the body. So  the way of treating these diseases in early times was to  in some way or other  exorcise those evil spirits  and this is still going on  as you know. But it wasn't enough to use the priests. When medicine became somewhat scientific  in about     BC  with Hippocrates and those boys  they tried to look for herbs  plants that would literally shake the bad spirits out. So  they found certain plants that could cause convulsions. And the herbals  the botanical books of up to the late Middle Ages  the Renaissance are filled with prescriptions for causing convulsions to shake the evil spirits out. Finally  in about the sixteenth century  a physician whose name was Theophrastus Bombastus Aureolus von Hohenheim  called Paracelsus  a name probably familiar to some people here    found that he could predict the degree of convulsion by using a measured amount of camphor to produce the convulsion. Can you imagine going to your closet  pulling out a mothball  and chewing on it if you're feeling depressed  It's better than Prozac  but I wouldn't recommend it. So what we see in the seventeenth  eighteenth century is the continued search for medications other than camphor that'll do the trick. Well  along comes Benjamin Franklin  and he comes close to convulsing himself with a bolt of electricity off the end of his kite. And so people begin thinking in terms of electricity to produce convulsions. And then  we fast forward to about       when three Italian psychiatrists  who were largely treating depression  began to notice among their patients  who were also epileptics  that if they had an epileptic    a series of epileptic fits  a lot of them in a row    the depression would very frequently lift. Not only would it lift  but it might never return. So they got very interested in producing convulsions  measured types of convulsions. And they thought   Well  we've got electricity  we'll plug somebody into the wall. That always makes hair stand up and people shake a lot.  So  they tried it on a few pigs  and none of the pigs were killed. So  they went to the police and they said   We know that at the Rome railroad station  there are all these lost souls wandering around  muttering gibberish. Can you bring one of them to us   Someone who is  as the Italians say   cagoots.  So they found this  cagoots  guy  a    year old man who was really hopelessly schizophrenic  who was known  had been known for months  to be literally defecating on himself  talking nothing that made any sense  and they brought him into the hospital. So these three psychiatrists  after about two or three weeks of observation  laid him down on a table  connected his temples to a very small source of current. They thought   Well  we'll try    volts  two tenths of a second. That's not going to do anything terrible to him.  So they did that. Well  I have the following from a firsthand observer  who told me this about    years ago  when I was thinking about these things for some research project of mine. He said   This fellow     remember  he wasn't even put to sleep     after this major grand mal convulsion  sat right up  looked at these three fellas and said  'What the fuck are you assholes trying to do '   If I could only say that in Italian. Well  they were happy as could be  because he hadn't said a rational word in the weeks of observation. So they plugged him in again  and this time they used     volts for half a second. And to their amazement  after it was over  he began speaking like he was perfectly well. He relapsed a little bit  they gave him a series of treatments  and he was essentially cured. But of course  having schizophrenia  within a few months  it returned. But they wrote a paper about this  and everybody in the Western world began using electricity to convulse people who were either schizophrenic or severely depressed. It didn't work very well on the schizophrenics  but it was pretty clear in the '  s and by the middle of the '  s that electroconvulsive therapy was very  very effective in the treatment of depression. And of course  in those days  there were no antidepressant drugs  and it became very  very popular. They would anesthetize people  convulse them  but the real difficulty was that there was no way to paralyze muscles. So people would have a real grand mal seizure. Bones were broken. Especially in old  fragile people  you couldn't use it. And then in the     s  late     s  the so called muscle relaxants were developed by pharmacologists  and it got so that you could induce a complete convulsion  an electroencephalographic convulsion    you could see it on the brain waves    without causing any convulsion in the body except a little bit of twitching of the toes. So again  it was very  very popular and very  very useful. Well  you know  in the middle '  s  the first antidepressants came out. Tofranil was the first. In the late '  s  early '  s  there were others  and they were very effective. And patients' rights groups seemed to get very upset about the kinds of things that they would witness. And so the whole idea of electroconvulsive  electroshock therapy disappeared  but has had a renaissance in the last    years. And the reason that it has had a renaissance is that probably about    percent of the people  severe depressives  do not respond  regardless of what is done for them. Now  why am I telling you this story at this meeting  I'm telling you this story  because actually ever since Richard called me and asked me to talk about    as he asked all of his speakers    to talk about something that would be new to this audience  that we had never talked about  never written about  I've been planning this moment. This reason really is that I am a man who  almost    years ago  had his life saved by two long courses of electroshock therapy. And let me tell you this story. I was  in the     s  in a marriage. To use the word bad would be perhaps the understatement of the year. It was dreadful. There are  I'm sure  enough divorced people in this room to know about the hostility  the anger  who knows what. Being someone who had had a very difficult childhood  a very difficult adolescence    it had to do with not quite poverty but close. It had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke English  no one could read or write English. It had to do with death and disease and lots of other things. I was a little prone to depression. So  as things got worse  as we really began to hate each other  I became progressively depressed over a period of a couple of years  trying to save this marriage  which was inevitably not to be saved. Finally  I would schedule    all my major surgical cases  I was scheduling them for     one o'clock in the afternoon  because I couldn't get out of bed before about    o'clock. And anybody who's been depressed here knows what that's like. I couldn't even pull the covers off myself. Well  you're in a university medical center  where everybody knows everybody  and it's perfectly clear to my colleagues  so my referrals began to decrease. As my referrals began to decrease  I clearly became increasingly depressed until I thought  my God  I can't work anymore. And  in fact  it didn't make any difference because I didn't have any patients anymore. So  with the advice of my physician  I had myself admitted to the acute care psychiatric unit of our university hospital. And my colleagues  who had known me since medical school in that place  said   Don't worry  chap. Six weeks  you're back in the operating room. Everything's going to be great.  Well  you know what bovine stercus is  That proved to be a lot of bovine stercus. I know some people who got tenure in that place with lies like that. So I was one of their failures. But it wasn't that simple. Because by the time I got out of that unit  I was not functional at all. I could hardly see five feet in front of myself. I shuffled when I walked. I was bowed over. I rarely bathed. I sometimes didn't shave. It was dreadful. And it was clear    not to me  because nothing was clear to me at that time anymore    that I would need long term hospitalization in that awful place called a mental hospital. So I was admitted  in       in the spring of       to the Institute of Living  which used to be called the Hartford Retreat. It was founded in the eighteenth century  the largest psychiatric hospital in the state of Connecticut  other than the huge public hospitals that existed at that time. And they tried everything they had. They tried the usual psychotherapy. They tried every medication available in those days. And they did have Tofranil and other things    Mellaril  who knows what. Nothing happened except that I got jaundiced from one of these things. And finally  because I was well known in Connecticut  they decided they better have a meeting of the senior staff. All the senior staff got together  and I later found out what happened. They put all their heads together and they decided that there was nothing that could be done for this surgeon who had essentially separated himself from the world  who by that time had become so overwhelmed  not just with depression and feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy  but with obsessional thinking  obsessional thinking about coincidences. And there were particular numbers that every time I saw them  just got me dreadfully upset    all kinds of ritualistic observances  just awful  awful stuff. Remember when you were a kid  and you had to step on every line  Well  I was a grown man who had all of these rituals  and it got so there was a throbbing  there was a ferocious fear in my head. You've seen this painting by Edvard Munch  The Scream. Every moment was a scream. It was impossible. So they decided there was no therapy  there was no treatment. But there was one treatment  which actually had been pioneered at the Hartford hospital in the early     s  and you can imagine what it was. It was pre frontal lobotomy. So they decided    I didn't know this  again  I found this out later    that the only thing that could be done was for this    year old man to have a pre frontal lobotomy. Well  as in all hospitals  there was a resident assigned to my case. He was    years old  and he would meet with me two or three times a week. And of course  I had been there  what  three or four months at the time. And he asked to meet with the senior staff  and they agreed to meet with him because he was very well thought of in that place. They thought he had a really extraordinary future. And he dug in his heels and said   No. I know this man better than any of you. I have met with him over and over again. You've just seen him from time to time. You've read reports and so forth. I really honestly believe that the basic problem here is pure depression  and all of the obsessional thinking comes out of it. And you know  of course  what'll happen if you do a pre frontal lobotomy. Any of the results along the spectrum  from pretty bad to terrible  terrible  terrible is going to happen. If he does the best he can  he will have no further obsessions  probably no depression  but his affect will be dulled  he will never go back to surgery  he will never be the loving father that he was to his two children  his life will be changed. If he has the usual result  he will end up like 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.' And you know about that  just essentially in a stupor the rest of his life.  Well  he said   Can't we try a course of electroshock therapy   And you know why they agreed  They agreed to humor him. They just thought   Well  we'll give a course of   . And so we'll lose a little time. Big deal. It doesn't make any difference.  So they gave the course of     and the first    the usual course  incidentally  was six to eight and still is six to eight. Plugged me into the wires  put me to sleep  gave me the muscle relaxant. Six didn't work. Seven didn't work. Eight didn't work. At nine  I noticed    and it's wonderful that I could notice anything    I noticed a change. And at     I noticed a real change. And he went back to them  and they agreed to do another   . Again  not a single one of them    I think there are about seven or eight of them    thought this would do any good. They thought this was a temporary change. But  lo and behold  by     by     there were demonstrable differences in the way I felt. By    and     I was sleeping through the night. And by     I had the sense  I really had the sense that I could overcome this  that I was now strong enough that by an act of will  I could blow the obsessional thinking away. I could blow the depression away. And I've never forgotten    I never will forget    standing in the kitchen of the unit  it was a Sunday morning in January of       standing in the kitchen by myself and thinking   I've got the strength now to do this.  It was as though those tightly coiled wires in my head had been disconnected and I could think clearly. But I need a formula. I need some thing to say to myself when I begin thinking obsessionally  obsessively. Well  the Gilbert and Sullivan fans in this room will remember  Ruddigore   and they will remember Mad Margaret  and they will remember that she was married to a fellow named Sir Despard Murgatroyd. And she used to go nuts  every five minutes or so in the play  and he said to her   We must have a word to bring you back to reality  and the word  my dear  will be 'Basingstoke.'  So every time she got a little nuts  he would say   Basingstoke   And she would say   Basingstoke  it is.  And she would be fine for a little while. Well  you know  I'm from the Bronx. I can't say  Basingstoke.  But I had something better. And it was very simple. It was   Ah  fuck it   at least for me. And it worked    my God  it worked. Every time I would begin thinking obsessionally    again  once more  after    shock treatments    I would say   Ah  fuck it.  And things got better and better  and within three or four months  I was discharged from that hospital  and I joined a group of surgeons where I could work with other people in the community  not in New Haven  but fairly close by. I stayed there for three years. At the end of three years  I went back to New Haven  had remarried by that time. I brought my wife with me  actually  to make sure I could get through this. My children came back to live with us. We had two more children after that. Resuscitated the career  even better than it had been before. Went right back into the university and began to write books. Well  you know  it's been a wonderful life. It's been  as I said  close to    years. I stopped doing surgery about six years ago and became a full time writer  as many people know. But it's been very exciting. It's been very happy. Every once in a while  I have to say   Ah  fuck it.  Every once in a while  I get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional. So  I'm not free of all of this. But it's worked. It's always worked. Why have I chosen  after never  ever talking about this  to talk about it now  Well  those of you who know some of these books know that one is about death and dying  one is about the human body and the human spirit  one is about the way mystical thoughts are constantly in our minds  and they have always to do with my own personal experiences. One might think reading these books    and I've gotten thousands of letters about them by people who do think this    that based on my life's history as I've portrayed in the books  my early life's history  I am someone who has overcome adversity. That I am someone who has drunk  drank  drunk of the bitter dregs of near disaster in childhood and emerged not just unscathed but strengthened. I really have it figured out  so that I can advise people about death and dying  so that I can talk about mysticism and the human spirit. And I've always felt guilty about that. I've always felt that somehow I was an impostor because my readers don't know what I have just told you. It's known by some people in New Haven  obviously  but it is not generally known. So one of the reasons that I have come here to talk about this today is to    frankly  selfishly    unburden myself and let it be known that this is not an untroubled mind that has written all of these books. But more importantly  I think  is the fact that a very significant proportion of people in this audience are under     and there are many  of course  who are well over   . For people under     and it looks to me like almost all of you    I would say all of you    are either on the cusp of a magnificent and exciting career or right into a magnificent and exciting career  anything can happen to you. Things change. Accidents happen. Something from childhood comes back to haunt you. You can be thrown off the track. I hope it happens to none of you  but it will probably happen to a small percentage of you. To those to whom it doesn't happen  there will be adversities. If I  with the bleakness of spirit  with no spirit  that I had in the     s and no possibility of recovery  as far as that group of very experienced psychiatrists thought  if I can find my way back from this  believe me  anybody can find their way back from any adversity that exists in their lives. And for those who are older  who have lived through perhaps not something as bad as this  but who have lived through difficult times  perhaps where they lost everything  as I did  and started out all over again  some of these things will seem very familiar. There is recovery. There is redemption. And there is resurrection. There are resurrection themes in every society that has ever been studied  and it is because not just only do we fantasize about the possibility of resurrection and recovery  but it actually happens. And it happens a lot. Perhaps the most popular resurrection theme  outside of specifically religious ones  is the one about the phoenix  the ancient story of the phoenix  who  every     years  resurrects itself from its own ashes to go on to live a life that is even more beautiful than it was before.

459,1385,1387,Sherwin Nuland 2009,Sherwin Nuland,male,The extraordinary power of ordinary people,Jan 2009,657,You know  I am so bad at tech that my daughter    who is now       when she was five  was overheard by me to say to a friend of hers  If it doesn't bleed when you cut it  my daddy doesn't understand it. So  the assignment I've been given may be an insuperable obstacle for me  but I'm certainly going to try. What have I heard during these last four days  This is my third visit to TED. One was to TEDMED  and one  as you've heard  was a regular TED two years ago. I've heard what I consider an extraordinary thing that I've only heard a little bit in the two previous TEDs  and what that is is an interweaving and an interlarding  an intermixing  of a sense of social responsibility in so many of the talks    global responsibility  in fact  appealing to enlightened self interest  but it goes far beyond enlightened self interest. One of the most impressive things about what some  perhaps     of the speakers have been talking about is the realization  as you listen to them carefully  that they're not saying  Well  this is what we should do  this is what I would like you to do. It's  This is what I have done because I'm excited by it  because it's a wonderful thing  and it's done something for me and  of course  it's accomplished a great deal. It's the old concept  the real Greek concept  of philanthropy in its original sense  phil anthropy  the love of humankind. And the only explanation I can have for some of what you've been hearing in the last four days is that it arises  in fact  out of a form of love. And this gives me enormous hope. And hope  of course  is the topic that I'm supposed to be speaking about  which I'd completely forgotten about until I arrived. And when I did  I thought  well  I'd better look this word up in the dictionary. So  Sarah and I    my wife    walked over to the public library  which is four blocks away  on Pacific Street  and we got the OED  and we looked in there  and there are    definitions of hope  none of which really hits you between the eyes as being the appropriate one. And  of course  that makes sense  because hope is an abstract phenomenon  it's an abstract idea  it's not a concrete word. Well  it reminds me a little bit of surgery. If there's one operation for a disease  you know it works. If there are    operations  you know that none of them work. And that's the way it is with definitions of words. If you have appendicitis  they take your appendix out  and you're cured. If you've got reflux oesophagitis  there are    procedures  and Joe Schmo does it one way and Will Blow does it another way  and none of them work  and that's the way it is with this word  hope. They all come down to the idea of an expectation of something good that is due to happen. And you know what I found out  The Indo European root of the word hope is a stem  K E U    we would spell it K E U  it's pronounced koy    and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from. But what it means in the original Indo European is a change in direction  going in a different way. And I find that very interesting and very provocative  because what you've been hearing in the last couple of days is the sense of going in different directions  directions that are specific and unique to problems. There are different paradigms. You've heard that word several times in the last four days  and everyone's familiar with Kuhnian paradigms. So  when we think of hope now  we have to think of looking in other directions than we have been looking. There's another    not definition  but description  of hope that has always appealed to me  and it was one by V clav Havel in his perfectly spectacular book  Breaking the Peace   in which he says that hope does not consist of the expectation that things will come out exactly right  but the expectation that they will make sense regardless of how they come out. I can't tell you how reassured I was by the very last sentence in that glorious presentation by Dean Kamen a few days ago. I wasn't sure I heard it right  so I found him in one of the inter sessions. He was talking to a very large man  but I didn't care. I interrupted  and I said   Did you say this   He said   I think so.  So  here's what it is  I'll repeat it.  The world will not be saved by the Internet.  It's wonderful. Do you know what the world will be saved by  I'll tell you. It'll be saved by the human spirit. And by the human spirit  I don't mean anything divine  I don't mean anything supernatural    certainly not coming from this skeptic. What I mean is this ability that each of us has to be something greater than herself or himself  to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something that at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not capable of. On an elemental level  we have all felt that spirituality at the time of childbirth. Some of you have felt it in laboratories  some of you have felt it at the workbench. We feel it at concerts. I've felt it in the operating room  at the bedside. It is an elevation of us beyond ourselves. And I think that it's going to be  in time  the elements of the human spirit that we've been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days. And if there's anything that has permeated this room  it is precisely that. I'm intrigued by a concept that was brought to life in the early part of the   th century    actually  in the second decade of the   th century    by a    year old poet whose name was Percy Shelley. Now  we all think that Shelley obviously is the great romantic poet that he was  many of us tend to forget that he wrote some perfectly wonderful essays  too  and the most well remembered essay is one called  A Defence of Poetry.  Now  it's about five  six  seven  eight pages long  and it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page  but somewhere on the second page he begins talking about the notion that he calls  moral imagination.  And here's what he says  roughly translated  A man    generic man    a man  to be greatly good  must imagine clearly. He must see himself and the world through the eyes of another  and of many others. See himself and the world    not just the world  but see himself. What is it that is expected of us by the billions of people who live in what Laurie Garrett the other day so appropriately called despair and disparity  What is it that they have every right to ask of us  What is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves  out of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit  Well  you know precisely what it is. There's a great deal of argument about whether we  as the great nation that we are  should be the policeman of the world  the world's constabulary  but there should be virtually no argument about whether we should be the world's healer. There has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past four days. So  if we are to be the world's healer  every disadvantaged person in this world    including in the United States    becomes our patient. Every disadvantaged nation  and perhaps our own nation  becomes our patient. So  it's fun to think about the etymology of the word  patient.  It comes initially from the Latin patior  to endure  or to suffer. So  you go back to the old Indo European root again  and what do you find  The Indo European stem is pronounced payen    we would spell it P A E N    and  lo and behold  mirabile dictu  it is the same root as the word compassion comes from  P A E N. So  the lesson is very clear. The lesson is that our patient    the world  and the disadvantaged of the world    that patient deserves our compassion. But beyond our compassion  and far greater than compassion  is our moral imagination and our identification with each individual who lives in that world  not to think of them as a huge forest  but as individual trees. Of course  in this day and age  the trick is not to let each tree be obscured by that Bush in Washington that can get    can get in the way. So  here we are. We are  should be  morally committed to being the healer of the world. And we have had examples over and over and over again    you've just heard one in the last    minutes    of people who have not only had that commitment  but had the charisma  the brilliance    and I think in this room it's easy to use the word brilliant  my God    the brilliance to succeed at least at the beginning of their quest  and who no doubt will continue to succeed  as long as more and more of us enlist ourselves in their cause. Now  if we're talking about medicine  and we're talking about healing  I'd like to quote someone who hasn't been quoted. It seems to me everybody in the world's been quoted here  Pogo's been quoted  Shakespeare's been quoted backwards  forwards  inside out. I would like to quote one of my own household gods. I suspect he never really said this  because we don't know what Hippocrates really said  but we do know for sure that one of the great Greek physicians said the following  and it has been recorded in one of the books attributed to Hippocrates  and the book is called  Precepts.  And I'll read you what it is. Remember  I have been talking about  essentially philanthropy  the love of humankind  the individual humankind and the individual humankind that can bring that kind of love translated into action  translated  in some cases  into enlightened self interest. And here he is        years ago   Where there is love of humankind  there is love of healing.  We have seen that here today with the sense  with the sensitivity    and in the last three days  and with the power of the indomitable human spirit. Thank you very much.,Doctor,200901,6.1004896907216475
462,653,655,Siddharthan Chandran 2014,Siddharthan Chandran,male,Can the damaged brain repair itself?,Feb 2014,921,I'm very pleased to be here today to talk to you all about how we might repair the damaged brain  and I'm particularly excited by this field  because as a neurologist myself  I believe that this offers one of the great ways that we might be able to offer hope for patients who today live with devastating and yet untreatable diseases of the brain. So here's the problem. You can see here the picture of somebody's brain with Alzheimer's disease next to a healthy brain  and what's obvious is  in the Alzheimer's brain  ringed red  there's obvious damage    atrophy  scarring. And I could show you equivalent pictures from other disease  multiple sclerosis  motor neuron disease  Parkinson's disease  even Huntington's disease  and they would all tell a similar story. And collectively these brain disorders represent one of the major public health threats of our time. And the numbers here are really rather staggering. At any one time  there are    million people today living with one of these brain diseases  and the annual cost globally is     billion dollars. I mean  just think about that. That's greater than one percent of the global GDP. And it gets worse  because all these numbers are rising because these are by and large age related diseases  and we're living longer. So the question we really need to ask ourselves is  why  given the devastating impact of these diseases to the individual  never mind the scale of the societal problem  why are there no effective treatments  Now in order to consider this  I first need to give you a crash course in how the brain works. So in other words  I need to tell you everything I learned at medical school. But believe me  this isn't going to take very long. Okay   Laughter  So the brain is terribly simple  it's made up of four cells  and two of them are shown here. There's the nerve cell  and then there's the myelinating cell  or the insulating cell. It's called oligodendrocyte. And when these four cells work together in health and harmony  they create an extraordinary symphony of electrical activity  and it is this electrical activity that underpins our ability to think  to emote  to remember  to learn  move  feel and so on. But equally  each of these individual four cells alone or together  can go rogue or die  and when that happens  you get damage. You get damaged wiring. You get disrupted connections. And that's evident here with the slower conduction. But ultimately  this damage will manifest as disease  clearly. And if the starting dying nerve cell is a motor nerve  for example  you'll get motor neuron disease. So I'd like to give you a real life illustration of what happens with motor neuron disease. So this is a patient of mine called John. John I saw just last week in the clinic. And I've asked John to tell us something  about what were his problems that led to the initial diagnosis of motor neuron disease. John  I was diagnosed in October in       and the main problem was a breathing problem  difficulty breathing. Siddharthan Chandran  I don't know if you caught all of that  but what John was telling us was that difficulty with breathing led eventually to the diagnosis of motor neuron disease. So John's now    months further down in that journey  and I've now asked him to tell us something about his current predicament. John  What I've got now is  the breathing's gotten worse. I've got weakness in my hands   my arms and my legs. So basically I'm in a wheelchair most of the time. SC  John's just told us he's in a wheelchair most of the time. So what these two clips show is not just the devastating consequence of the disease  but they also tell us something about the shocking pace of the disease  because in just    months  a fit adult man has been rendered wheelchair  and respirator dependent. And let's face it  John could be anybody's father  brother or friend. So that's what happens when the motor nerve dies. But what happens when that myelin cell dies  You get multiple sclerosis. So the scan on your left is an illustration of the brain  and it's a map of the connections of the brain  and superimposed upon which are areas of damage. We call them lesions of demyelination. But they're damage  and they're white. So I know what you're thinking here. You're thinking   My God  this bloke came up and said he's going to talk about hope  and all he's done is give a really rather bleak and depressing tale.  I've told you these diseases are terrible. They're devastating  numbers are rising  the costs are ridiculous  and worst of all  we have no treatment. Where's the hope  Well  you know what  I think there is hope. And there's hope in this next section  of this brain section of somebody else with M.S.  because what it illustrates is  amazingly  the brain can repair itself. It just doesn't do it well enough. And so again  there are two things I want to show you. First of all is the damage of this patient with M.S. And again  it's another one of these white masses. But crucially  the area that's ringed red highlights an area that is pale blue. But that area that is pale blue was once white. So it was damaged. It's now repaired. Just to be clear  It's not because of doctors. It's in spite of doctors  not because of doctors. This is spontaneous repair. It's amazing and it's occurred because there are stem cells in the brain  even  which can enable new myelin  new insulation  to be laid down over the damaged nerves. And this observation is important for two reasons. The first is it challenges one of the orthodoxies that we learnt at medical school  or at least I did  admittedly last century  which is that the brain doesn't repair itself  unlike  say  the bone or the liver. But actually it does  but it just doesn't do it well enough. And the second thing it does  and it gives us a very clear direction  of travel for new therapies    I mean  you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know what to do here. You simply need to find ways of promoting the endogenous  spontaneous repair that occurs anyway. So the question is  why  if we've known that for some time  as we have  why do we not have those treatments  And that in part reflects the complexity of drug development. Now  drug development you might think of as a rather expensive but risky bet  and the odds of this bet are roughly this  they're        to one against  because you need to screen about        compounds to find that one potential winner. And then you need to spend    years and spend over a billion dollars  and even then  you may not have a winner. So the question for us is  can you change the rules of the game and can you shorten the odds  And in order to do that  you have to think  where is the bottleneck in this drug discovery  And one of the bottlenecks is  early in drug discovery. All that screening occurs in animal models. But we know that the proper  study of mankind is man  to borrow from Alexander Pope. So the question is  can we study these diseases using human material  And of course  absolutely we can. We can use stem cells  and specifically we can use human stem cells. And human stem cells are these extraordinary but simple cells that can do two things  they can self renew or make more of themselves  but they can also become specialized to make bone  liver or  crucially  nerve cells  maybe even the motor nerve cell or the myelin cell. And the challenge has long been  can we harness the power  the undoubted power of these stem cells in order to realize their promise for regenerative neurology  And I think we can now  and the reason we can is because there have been several major discoveries in the last        years. One of them was here in Edinburgh  and it must be the only celebrity sheep  Dolly. So Dolly was made in Edinburgh  and Dolly was an example of the first cloning of a mammal from an adult cell. But I think the even more significant breakthrough for the purposes of our discussion today was made in      by a Japanese scientist called Yamanaka. And what Yamaka did  in a fantastic form of scientific cookery  was he showed that four ingredients  just four ingredients  could effectively convert any cell  adult cell  into a master stem cell. And the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate  because what it means that from anybody in this room  but particularly patients  you could now generate a bespoke  personalized tissue repair kit. Take a skin cell  make it a master pluripotent cell  so you could then make those cells that are relevant to their disease  both to study but potentially to treat. Now  the idea of that at medical school    this is a recurring theme  isn't  it  me and medical school    would have been ridiculous  but it's an absolute reality today. And I see this as the cornerstone of regeneration  repair and hope. And whilst we're on the theme of hope  for those of you who might have failed at school  there's hope for you as well  because this is the school report of John Gerdon.   I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist  on his present showing this is quite ridiculous.   So they didn't think much of him then. But what you may not know is that he  got the Nobel Prize for medicine just three months ago. So to return to the original problem  what is the opportunity of these stem cells  or this disruptive technology  for repairing the damaged brain  which we call regenerative neurology  I think there are two ways you can think about this  as a fantastic   st century drug discovery tool  and or as a form of therapy. So I want to tell you a little bit about both of those in the next few moments. Drug discovery in a dish is how people often talk about this. It's very simple  You take a patient with a disease  let's say motor neuron disease  you take a skin sample  you do the pluripotent reprogramming  as I've already told you  and you generate live motor nerve cells. That's straightforward  because that's what pluripotent cells can do. But crucially  you can then compare their behavior to their equivalent but healthy counterparts  ideally from an unaffected relative. That way  you're matching for genetic variation. And that's exactly what we did here. This was a collaboration with colleagues  in London  Chris Shaw  in the U.S.   Steve Finkbeiner and Tom Maniatis. And what you're looking at  and this is amazing  these are living  growing  motor nerve cells from a patient with motor neuron disease. It happens to be an inherited form. I mean  just imagine that. This would have been unimaginable    years ago. So apart from seeing them grow and put out processes  we can also engineer them so that they fluoresce  but crucially  we can then track their individual health and compare the diseased motor nerve cells to the healthy ones. And when you do all that and put it together  you realize that the diseased ones  which is represented in the red line  are two and a half times more likely to die than the healthy counterpart. And the crucial point about this is that you then have a fantastic assay to discover drugs  because what would you ask of the drugs  and you could do this through a high throughput automated screening system  you'd ask the drugs  give me one thing  find me a drug that will bring the red line closer to the blue line  because that drug will be a high value candidate that you could probably take direct to human trial and almost bypass that bottleneck that I've told you about in drug discovery with the animal models  if that makes sense. It's fantastic. But I want to come back to how you might use stem cells directly to repair damage. And again there are two ways to think about this  and they're not mutually exclusive. The first  and I think in the long run the one that will give us the biggest dividend  but it's not thought of that way just yet  is to think about those stem cells that are already in your brain  and I've told you that. All of us have stem cells in the brain  even the diseased brain  and surely the smart way forward is to find ways that you can promote and activate those stem cells in your brain already to react and respond appropriately to damage to repair it. That will be the future. There will be drugs that will do that. But the other way is to effectively parachute in cells  transplant them in  to replace dying or lost cells  even in the brain. And I want to tell you now an experiment  it's a clinical trial that we did  which recently completed  which is with colleagues in UCL  David Miller in particular. So this study was very simple. We took patients with multiple sclerosis and asked a simple question  Would stem cells from the bone marrow be protective of their nerves  So what we did was we took this bone marrow  grew up the stem cells in the lab  and then injected them back into the vein. I'm making this sound really simple. It took five years off a lot of people  okay  And it put gray hair on me and caused all kinds of issues. But conceptually  it's essentially simple. So we've given them into the vein  right  So in order to measure whether this was successful or not  we measured the optic nerve as our outcome measure. And that's a good thing to measure in M.S.  because patients with M.S. sadly suffer with problems with vision    loss of vision  unclear vision. And so we measured the size of the optic nerve using the scans with David Miller three times       months  six months  and before the infusion    and you can see the gently declining red line. And that's telling you that the optic nerve is shrinking  which makes sense  because their nerves are dying. We then gave the stem cell infusion and repeated the measurement twice    three months and six months    and to our surprise  almost  the line's gone up. That suggests that the intervention has been protective. I don't think myself that what's happened is that those stem cells have made new myelin or new nerves. What I think they've done is they've promoted the endogenous stem cells  or precursor cells  to do their job  wake up  lay down new myelin. So this is a proof of concept. I'm very excited about that. So I just want to end with the theme I began on  which was regeneration and hope. So here I've asked John what his hopes are for the future. John  I would hope that sometime in the future through the research that you people are doing  we can come up with a cure so that people like me can lead a normal life. SC  I mean  that speaks volumes. But I'd like to close by first of all thanking John    thanking John for allowing me to share his insights and these clips with you all. But I'd also like to add to John and to others that my own view is  I'm hopeful for the future. I do believe that the disruptive technologies like stem cells that I've tried to explain to you do offer very real hope. And I do think that the day that we might be able to repair the damaged brain is sooner than we think. Thank you.,Regenerative neurologist,201402,5.740414012738854
465,1309,1311,Stefan Sagmeister 2008,Stefan Sagmeister,male,Designing with slogans,Sep 2008,11,I was here about four years ago  talking about the relationship of design and happiness. At the very end of it  I showed a list under that title. I learned very few things in addition since but made a whole number of them into projects since. These are inflatable monkeys in every city in Scotland   Everybody always thinks they are right.  They were combined in the media.  Drugs are fun in the beginning but become a drag later on.  We're doing changing media. This is a projection that can see the viewer as the viewer walks by. You can't help but actually ripping that spider web apart. All of these things are pieces of graphic design. We do them for our clients. They are commissioned. I would never have the money to actually pay for the installment or pay for all the billboards or the production of these  so there's always a client attached to them. These are        coat hangers in a street that's lined with fashion stores.  Worrying solves nothing.   Money does not make me happy  appeared first as double page spreads in a magazine. The printer lost the file  didn't tell us. When the magazine    actually  when I got the subscription    it was    following pages. It said   Money does does make me happy.  And a friend of mine in Austria felt so sorry for me that he talked the largest casino owner in Linz into letting us wrap his building. So this is the big pedestrian zone in Linz. It just says  Money   and if you look down the side street  it says   does not make me happy.  We had a show that just came down last week in New York. We steamed up the windows permanently  and every hour we had a different designer come in and write these things that they've learned into the steam in the window. Everybody participated    Milton Glaser  Massimo Vignelli. Singapore was quite in discussion. This is a little spot that we filmed there that's to be displayed on the large JumboTrons in Singapore. And  of course  it's one that's dear to my heart  because all of these sentiments    some banal  some a bit more profound    all originally had come out of my diary. And I do go often into the diary and check if I wanted to change something about the situation. If it's    see it for a long enough time  I actually do something about it. And the very last one is a billboard. This is our roof in New York  the roof of the studio. This is newsprint plus stencils that lie on the newsprint. We let that lie around in the sun. As you all know  newsprint yellows significantly in the sun. After a week  we took the stencils and the leaves off  shipped the newsprints to Lisbon to a very sunny spot  so on day one the billboard said   Complaining is silly. Either act or forget.  Three days later it faded  and a week later  no more complaining anywhere. Thank you so much.,Graphic designer,200809,5.968245614035088
466,1834,1836,Stefan Sagmeister 2007,Stefan Sagmeister,male,Happiness by design,Apr 2007,918,About    years ago  I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong. And at the time I was very superstitious. So  upon landing    this was still at the old Hong Kong airport that's Kai Tak  when it was smack in the middle of the city    I thought   If I see something good  I'm going to have a great time here in my two weeks. And if I see something negative  I'm going to be miserable  indeed.  So the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard. And I actually went to see some of the design companies in Hong Kong in my stay there. And it turned out that    I just went to see  you know  what they are doing in Hong Kong. But I actually walked away with a great job offer. And I flew back to Austria  packed my bags  and  another week later  I was again on my way to Hong Kong still superstitions and thinking   Well  if that 'Winner' billboard is still up  I'm going to have a good time working here. But if it's gone  it's going to be really miserable and stressful.  So it turned out that not only was the billboard still up but they had put this one right next to it. On the other hand  it also taught me where superstition gets me because I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong. However  I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life    of  you know  I think what the conference brochure refers to as  moments that take your breath away.  And since I'm a big list maker  I actually listed them all. Now  you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them and I won't read them for you. I know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people's happinesses. What I did do  though is  I actually looked at them from a design standpoint and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design. And  very surprisingly  over half of them had  actually  something to do with design. So there are  of course  two different possibilities. There's one from a consumer's point of view    where I was happy while experiencing design. And I'll just give you one example. I had gotten my first Walkman. This is     . My brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle that he was willing to borrow to me freely. And The Police's  Synchronicity  cassette had just been released and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz. So you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman. And I remember it as a true moment of happiness. You know  of course  they are related to this combination of at least two of them being  you know  design objects. And  you know  there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be  you know  situated somewhere here    right in there between Delight and Bliss. Now  there is the other part  from a designer's standpoint    if you're happy while actually doing it. And one way to see how happy designers are when they're designing could be to look at the authors' photos on the back of their monographs  So  according to this  the Australians and the Japanese as well as the Mexicans are very happy. While  somewhat  the Spaniards ... and  I think  particularly  the Swiss don't seem to be doing all that well. Last November  a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum  in a skyscraper  up on the   th floor. And their inaugural exhibit was called  Happiness.  And I went  very eagerly  to see it  because    well  also  with an eye on this conference. And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas. Under  Arcadia   they showed things like this  from the Edo period    a hundred ways to write  happiness  in different forms. Or they had this apple by Yoko Ono    that  of course  later on was  you know  made into the label for The Beatles. Under  Nirvana  they showed this Constable painting. And there was a little    an interesting theory about abstraction. This is a blue field    it's actually an Yves Klein painting. And the theory was that if you abstract an image  you really  you know open as much room for the un representable    and  therefore  you know  are able to involve the viewer more. Then  under  Desire   they showed these Shunsho paintings    also from the Edo period    ink on silk. And  lastly  under  Harmony   they had this   th century mandala from Tibet. Now  what I took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness. And I felt a little bit cheated  because the visualization    that's a really easy thing to do. And  you know  my studio    we've done it all the time. This is  you know  a book. A happy dog    and you take it out  it's an aggressive dog. It's a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne. Or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face. You know  that's not a big deal to accomplish. It has gotten to the point where  you know  within advertising or within the movie industry   happy  has gotten such a bad reputation that if you actually want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic  you almost would have to  you know  do it from a cynical point of view. This is  you know  the movie poster. Or we  a couple of weeks ago  designed a box set for The Talking Heads where the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has  very much  a dark side to it. Much  much more difficult is this  where the designs actually can evoke happiness    and I'm going to just show you three that actually did this for me. This is a campaign done by a young artist in New York  who calls himself  True.  Everybody who has ridden the New York subway system will be familiar with these signs  True printed his own version of these signs. Met every Wednesday at a subway stop with    of his friends. They divided up the different subway lines and added their own version. So this is one. Now  the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs. So you're you're really bored in the subway  and you kind of stare at something. And it takes you a while until it actually    you realize that this says something different than what it normally says. I mean  that's  at least  how it made me happy. Now  True is a real humanitarian. He didn't want any of his friends to be arrested  so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card. And also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody    sort of like pretending that it's an art project financed by The Metropolitan Transit Authority. Another New York project. This is at P.S.      a sculpture that's basically a square room by James Turrell  that has a retractable ceiling. Opens up at dusk and dawn every day. You don't see the horizon. You're just in there  watching the incredible  subtle changes of color in the sky. And the room is truly something to be seen. People's demeanor changes when they go in there. And  for sure  I haven't looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there. There are  of course  more than those three projects that I'm showing here. I would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz'  Cloud  a couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy  as well. But my last project is  again  from a young designer in New York. He's from Korea originally. And he took it upon himself to print        speech bubbles    empty speech bubbles stickers  large ones and small ones. And he goes around New York and just puts them  empty as they are  on posters. And other people go and fill them in. This one says   Please let me die in peace.  I think that was    the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good. This is on a musician poster  that says   I am concerned that my CD will not sell more than         units and that  as a result  my recoupable advance from my label will be taken from me  after which  my contract will be cancelled  and I'll be back doing Journey covers on Bleecker Street.  I think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins. Jee gets to have his project  the public gets a sweeter environment  and different public gets a place to express itself  and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads. Well  there was a question  of course  that was on my mind for a while  You know  can I do more of the things that I like doing in design and less of the ones that I don't like to be doing  Which brought me back to my list making    you know  just to see what I actually like about my job. You know  one is  just working without pressure. Then  working concentrated  without being frazzled. Or  as Nancy said before  like really immerse oneself into it. Try not to get stuck doing the same thing    or try not get stuck behind the computer all day. This is  you know  related to it  getting out of the studio. Then  of course  trying to  you know  work on things where the content is actually important for me. And being able to enjoy the end results. And then I found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained all the things that I thought I learned in my life so far. And  just about at that time  an Austrian magazine called and asked if we would want to do six spreads    design six spreads that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine  And the whole thing just fell together. So I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned    in this case   Everything I do always comes back to me     and we made these spreads right out of this. So it was   Everything I do always comes back to me.  A couple of weeks ago  a French company asked us to design five billboards for them. Again  we could supply the content for it. So I just picked another one. And this was two weeks ago. We flew to Arizona    the designer who works with me  and myself    and photographed this one. So it's   Trying to look good limits my life.  And then we did one more of these. This is  again  for a magazine  dividing pages. This is   Having     this is the same thing  it's just  you know  photographed from the side. This is from the front. Then it's   guts.  Again  it's the same thing     guts  is just the same room  reworked. Then it's   always works out.  Then it's  for   with the light on. And it's  me.  Thank you so much.,Graphic designer,200704,6.159057971014493
472,1595,1597,Steven Johnson 2007,Steven Johnson,male,"How the ""ghost map"" helped end a killer disease",Jan 2007,554,If you haven't ordered yet  I generally find the rigatoni with the spicy tomato sauce goes best with diseases of the small intestine. So  sorry    it just feels like I should be doing stand up up here because of the setting. No  what I want to do is take you back to      in London for the next few minutes  and tell the story    in brief    of this outbreak  which in many ways  I think  helped create the world that we live in today  and particularly the kind of city that we live in today. This period in       in the middle part of the   th century  in London's history  is incredibly interesting for a number of reasons. But I think the most important one is that London was this city of  .  million people  and it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point. But it was also the largest city that had ever been built. And so the Victorians were trying to live through and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living  this scale of living that we  you know  now call  metropolitan living.  And it was in many ways  at this point in the mid     s  a complete disaster. They were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with an Elizabethan public infrastructure. So people  for instance  just to gross you out for a second  had cesspools of human waste in their basement. Like  a foot to two feet deep. And they would just kind of throw the buckets down there and hope that it would somehow go away  and of course it never really would go away. And all of this stuff  basically  had accumulated to the point where the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in. It was an amazingly smelly city. Not just because of the cesspools  but also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people. Not just the horses  but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk  that they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic until literally their milk ran out and they died  and then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street. So  you would just walk around London at this point and just be overwhelmed with this stench. And what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system became convinced that it was the smell that was killing everybody  that was creating these diseases that would wipe through the city every three or four years. And cholera was really the great killer of this period. It arrived in London in       and every four or five years another epidemic would take                people in London and throughout the U.K. And so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem. We had to get rid of the smell. And so  in fact  they concocted a couple of early  you know  founding public health interventions in the system of the city  one of which was called the  Nuisances Act   which they got everybody as far as they could to empty out their cesspools and just pour all that waste into the river. Because if we get it out of the streets  it'll smell much better  and    oh right  we drink from the river. So what ended up happening  actually  is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera because  as we now know  cholera is actually in the water. It's a waterborne disease  not something that's in the air. It's not something you smell or inhale  it's something you ingest. And so one of the founding moments of public health in the   th century effectively poisoned the water supply of London much more effectively than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing. So this was the state of London in       and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions  and in the midst of all this scientific confusion about what was actually killing people  it was a very talented classic   th century multi disciplinarian named John Snow  who was a local doctor in Soho in London  who had been arguing for about four or five years that cholera was  in fact  a waterborne disease  and had basically convinced nobody of this. The public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say. And he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies  but nothing had really stuck. And part of    what's so interesting about this story to me is that in some ways  it's a great case study in how cultural change happens  how a good idea eventually comes to win out over much worse ideas. And Snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored. And then on one day  August   th of       a young child  a five month old girl whose first name we don't know  we know her only as Baby Lewis  somehow contracted cholera  came down with cholera at    Broad Street. You can't really see it in this map  but this is the map that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book. It's in the middle of Soho  in this working class neighborhood  this little girl becomes sick and it turns out that the cesspool  that they still continue to have  despite the Nuisances Act  bordered on an extremely popular water pump  local watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of Soho  that all the residents from Soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to. And so this little girl inadvertently ended up contaminating the water in this popular pump  and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of England erupted about two or three days later. Literally     percent of the neighborhood died in seven days  and much more would have died if people hadn't fled after the initial outbreak kicked in. So it was this incredibly terrifying event. You had these scenes of entire families dying over the course of    hours of cholera  alone in their one room apartments  in their little flats. Just an extraordinary  terrifying scene. Snow lived near there  heard about the outbreak  and in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast because he thought an outbreak that concentrated could actually potentially end up convincing people that  in fact  the real menace of cholera was in the water supply and not in the air. He suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably involve a single point source. One single thing that everybody was going to because it didn't have the traditional slower path of infections that you might expect. And so he went right in there and started interviewing people. He eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure  who's kind of the other protagonist of the book    this guy  Henry Whitehead  who was a local minister  who was not at all a man of science  but was incredibly socially connected  he knew everybody in the neighborhood. And he managed to track down  Whitehead did  many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump  or who hadn't drunk water from the pump. And eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak. He found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick. People who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick. And he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods  people who hadn't  you know  percentages of people who hadn't  but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see. Something that would take in a sense a higher level view of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood. And so he created this map  which basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods as black bars at each address. And you can see in this map  the pump right at the center of it and you can see that one of the residences down the way had about    people dead. And the map is actually a little bit bigger. As you get further and further away from the pump  the deaths begin to grow less and less frequent. And so you can see this something poisonous emanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance. And so  with the help of this map  and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that Whitehead did  eventually  actually  the authorities slowly started to come around. It took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story  but by       when the next big cholera outbreak came to London  the authorities had been convinced    in part because of this story  in part because of this map    that in fact the water was the problem. And they had already started building the sewers in London  and they immediately went to this outbreak and they told everybody to start boiling their water. And that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since. So  part of this story  I think    well  it's a terrifying story  it's a very dark story and it's a story that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world. It's also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic  which is to say that it's possible to solve these problems if we listen to reason  if we listen to the kind of wisdom of these kinds of maps  if we listen to people like Snow and Whitehead  if we listen to the locals who understand what's going on in these kinds of situations. And what it ended up doing is making the idea of large scale metropolitan living a sustainable one. When people were looking at    percent of their neighborhoods dying in the space of seven days  there was a widespread consensus that this couldn't go on  that people weren't meant to live in cities of  .  million people. But because of what Snow did  because of this map  because of the whole series of reforms that happened in the wake of this map  we now take for granted that cities have    million people  cities like this one are in fact sustainable things. We don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself quite the way that  you know  Rome did  and be    percent of its size in     years or     years. And so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map. It's a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life  the life that we're enjoying here today.

473,1251,1253,Steven Levitt 2008,Steven Levitt,male,Surprising stats about child carseats,Jun 2008,1100,Once upon a time  there was a dread disease that afflicted children. And in fact  among all the diseases that existed in this land  it was the worst. It killed the most children. And along came a brilliant inventor  a scientist  who came up with a partial cure for that disease. And it wasn't perfect. Many children still died  but it was certainly better than what they had before. And one of the good things about this cure was that it was free  virtually free  and was very easy to use. But the worst thing about it was that you couldn't use it on the youngest children  on infants  and on one year olds. And so  as a consequence  a few years later  another scientist    perhaps maybe this scientist not quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him  but building on the invention of the first one    came up with a second cure. And the beauty of the second cure for this disease was that it could be used on infants and one year olds. And the problem with this cure was it was very expensive  and it was very complicated to use. And although parents tried as hard as they could to use it properly  almost all of them ended up using it wrong in the end. But what they did  of course  since it was so complicated and expensive  they only used it on the zero year olds and the one year olds. And they kept on using the existing cure that they had on the two year olds and up. And this went on for quite some time. People were happy. They had their two cures. Until a particular mother  whose child had just turned two  died of this disease. And she thought to herself   My child just turned two  and until the child turned two  I had always used this complicated  expensive cure  you know  this treatment. And then the child turned two  and I started using the cheap and easy treatment  and I wonder     and she wondered  like all parents who lose children wonder     if there isn't something that I could have done  like keep on using that complicated  expensive cure.  And she told all the other people  and she said   How could it possibly be that something that's cheap and simple works as well as something that's complicated and expensive   And the people thought   You know  you're right. It probably is the wrong thing to do to switch and use the cheap and simple solution.  And the government  they heard her story and the other people  and they said   Yeah  you're right  we should make a law. We should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment and not let anybody use this on their children.  And the people were happy. They were satisfied. For many years this went along  and everything was fine. But then along came a lowly economist  who had children himself  and he used the expensive and complicated treatment. But he knew about the cheap and simple one. And he thought about it  and the expensive one didn't seem that great to him. So he thought   I don't know anything about science  but I do know something about data  so maybe I should go and look at the data and see whether this expensive and complicated treatment actually works any better than the cheap and simple one.  And lo and behold  when he went through the data  he found that it didn't look like the expensive  complicated solution was any better than the cheap one  at least for the children who were two and older    the cheap one still didn't work on the kids who were younger. And so  he went forth to the people and he said   I've made this wonderful finding  it looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution  and by doing so we could save ourselves     million dollars a year  and we could spend that on our children in other ways.  And the parents were very unhappy  and they said   This is a terrible thing  because how can the cheap and easy thing be as good as the hard thing   And the government was very upset. And in particular  the people who made this expensive solution were very upset because they thought   How can we hope to compete with something that's essentially free  We would lose all of our market.  And people were very angry  and they called him horrible names. And he decided that maybe he should leave the country for a few days  and seek out some more intelligent  open minded people in a place called Oxford  and come and try and tell the story at that place. And so  anyway  here I am. It's not a fairy tale. It's a true story about the United States today  and the disease I'm referring to is actually motor vehicle accidents for children. And the free cure is adult seatbelts  and the expensive cure    the     million dollar a year cure    is child car seats. And what I'd like to talk to you about today is some of the evidence why I believe this to be true  that for children two years old and up  there really is no real benefit    proven benefit    of car seats  in spite of the incredible energy that has been devoted toward expanding the laws and making it socially unacceptable to put your children into seatbelts. And then talk about why    what is it that makes that true  And then  finally talk a little bit about a third way  about another technology  which is probably better than anything we have  but which    there hasn't been any enthusiasm for adoption precisely because people are so enamored with the current car seat solution. OK. So  many times when you try to do research on data  it records complicated stories    it's hard to find in the data. It doesn't turn out to be the case when you look at seatbelts versus car seats. So the United States keeps a data set of every fatal accident that's happened since     . So in every car crash in which at least one person dies  they have information on all of the people. So if you look at that data    it's right up on the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration's website    you can just look at the raw data  and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence that's in favor of car seats for children aged two and up. So  here is the data. Here I have  among two  to six year olds    anyone above six  basically no one uses car seats  so you can't compare      .  percent of the children who are unrestrained in a crash in which at least one person dies  themselves die. If you put a child in a car seat    .  percent of the children die. If they're wearing a lap and shoulder belt  in this raw data    .  percent die. And interestingly  wearing a lap only seatbelt    .  percent die. And actually  the theory tells you that the lap only seatbelt's got to be worse than the lap and shoulder belt. And that just reminds you that when you deal with raw data  there are hundreds of confounding variables that may be getting in the way. So what we do in the study is    and this is just presenting the same information  but turned into a figure to make it easier. So the yellow bar represents car seats  the orange bar lap and shoulder  and the red bar lap only seatbelts. And this is all relative to unrestrained    the bigger the bar  the better. Okay. So  this is the data I just showed  OK  So the highest bar is what you're striving to beat. So you can control for the basic things  like how hard the crash was  what seat the child was sitting in  etc.  the age of the child. And that's that middle set of bars. And so  you can see that the lap only seatbelts start to look worse once you do that. And then finally  the last set of bars  which are really controlling for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash              different characteristics of the crash. And what you find is that the car seats and the lap and shoulder belts  when it comes to saving lives  fatalities look exactly identical. And the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well. And it's not just overall. It's very robust to anything you want to look at. One thing that's interesting  if you look at frontal impact crashes    when the car crashes  the front hits into something    indeed  what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better. And I think this isn't just chance. In order to have the car seat approved  you need to pass certain federal standards  all of which involve slamming your car into a direct frontal crash. But when you look at other types of crashes  like rear impact crashes  indeed  the car seats don't perform as well. And I think that's because they've been optimized to pass  as we always expect people to do  to optimize relative to bright line rules about how affected the car will be. And the other thing you might argue is   Well  car seats have got a lot better over time. And so if we look at recent crashes    the whole data set is almost    years' worth of data    you won't see it in the recent crashes. The new car seats are far  far better.  But indeed  in recent crashes the lap and shoulder seatbelts  actually  are doing even better than the car seats. They say   Well  that's impossible  that can't be.  And the line of argument  if you ask parents  is   But car seats are so expensive and complicated  and they have this big tangle of latches  how could they possibly not work better than seatbelts because they are so expensive and complicated   It's kind of an interesting logic  I think  that people use. And the other logic  they say   Well  the government wouldn't have told us  to  use them if they weren't much better.  But what's interesting is the government telling us to use them is not actually based on very much. It really is based on some impassioned pleas of parents whose children died after they turned two  which has led to the passage of all these laws    not very much on data. So you can only get so far  I think  in telling your story by using these abstract statistics. And so I had some friends over to dinner  and I was asking    we had a cookout    I was asking them what advice they might have for me about proving my point. They said   Why don't you run some crash tests   And I said   That's a great idea.  So we actually tried to commission some crash tests. And it turns out that as we called around to the independent crash test companies around the country  none of them wanted to do our crash test because they said  some explicitly  some not so explicitly   All of our business comes from car seat manufacturers. We can't risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats.  Now  eventually  one did. Under the conditions of anonymity  they said they would be happy to do this test for us    so anonymity  and       dollars per seat that we crashed. And so  we went to Buffalo  New York  and here is the precursor to it. These are the crash test dummies  waiting for their chance to take the center stage. And then  here's how the crash test works. Here  they don't actually crash the entire car  you know    it's not worth ruining a whole car to do it. So they just have these bench seats  and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it. So I just wanted you to look at this. And I think this gives you a good idea of why parents think car seats are so great. Look at the kid in the car seat. Does he not look content  ready to go  like he could survive anything  And then  if you look at the kid in back  it looks like he's already choking before the crash even happens. It's hard to believe  when you look at this  that that kid in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash. So this is going to be a crash where they're going to slam this thing forward into a wall at    miles an hour  and see what happens. OK  So  let me show you what happens. These are three year old dummies  by the way. So here    this is the car seat. Now watch two things  watch how the head goes forward  and basically hits the knees    and this is in the car seat    and watch how the car seat flies around  in the rebound  up in the air. The car seat's moving all over the place. Bear in mind there are two things about this. This is a car seat that was installed by someone who has installed       car seats  who knew exactly how to do it. And also it turned out these bench seats are the very best way to install car seats. Having a flat back makes it much easier to install them. And so this is a test that's very much rigged in favor of the car seat  OK  So  that kid in this crash fared very well. The federal standards are that you have to score below a       to be an approved car seat on this crash  in some metric of units which are not important. And this crash would have been about a    . So this car seat was actually an above average car seat from Consumer Reports  and did quite well. So the next one. Now  this is the kid  same crash  who is in the seatbelt. He hardly moves at all  actually  relative to the other child. The funny thing is  the cam work is terrible because they've only set it up to do the car seats  and so  they actually don't even have a way to move the camera so you can see the kid that's on the rebound. Anyway  it turns out that those two crashes  that actually the three year old did slightly worse. So  he gets about a     out of    you know  on this range    relative to a     and something. But still  if you just took that data from that crash to the federal government  and said   I have invented a new car seat. I would like you to approve it for selling   then they would say   This is a fantastic new car seat  it works great. It only got a      it could have gotten as high up as a      .  And this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat. So  in some sense  what this is suggesting is that it's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong  which is putting children at risk. It's just that  fundamentally  the car seats aren't doing much. So here's the crash. So these are timed at the same time  so you can see that it takes much longer with the car seat    at rebound  it takes a lot longer    but there's just a lot less movement for child who's in the seatbelt. So  I'll show you the six year old crashes as well. The six year old is in a car seat  and it turns out that looks terrible  but that's great. That's like a      OK  So that kid would do fine in the crash. Nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all. And then here's the six year old in the seatbelt  and in fact  they get exactly within  you know  within one or two points of the same. So really  for the six year old  the car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever. That's some more evidence  so in some sense    I was criticized by a scientist  who said   You could never publish a study with an n of     meaning those four crashes. So I wrote him back and I said   What about an n of          Because I had the other        other real world crashes. And I just think that it's interesting that the idea of using real world crashes  which is very much something that economists think would be the right thing to do  is something that scientists don't actually  usually think    they would rather use a laboratory  a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies  than actually    years of data of what we've seen with children and with car seats. And so I think the answer to this puzzle is that there's a much better solution out there  that's gotten nobody excited because everyone is so delighted with the way car seats are presumably working. And if you think from a design perspective  about going back to square one  and say   I just want to protect kids in the back seat.  I don't there's anyone in this room who'd say   Well  the right way to start would be  let's make a great seat belt for adults. And then  let's make this really big contraption that you have to rig up to it in this daisy chain.  I mean  why not start    who's sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids  But essentially  do something like this  which I don't know exactly how much it would cost to do  but there's no reason I could see why this should be much more expensive than a regular car seat. It's just actually    you see  this is folding up    it's behind the seat. You've got a regular seat for adults  and then you fold it down  and the kid sits on top  and it's integrated. It seems to me that this can't be a very expensive solution  and it's got to work better than what we already have. So the question is  is there any hope for adoption of something like this  which would presumably save a lot of lives  And I think the answer  perhaps  lies in a story. The answer both to why has a car seat been so successful  and why this may someday be adopted or not  lies in a story that my dad told me  relating to when he was a doctor in the U.S. Air Force in England. And this is a long time ago  you were allowed to do things then you can't do today. So  my father would have patients come in who he thought were not really sick. And he had a big jar full of placebo pills that he would give them  and he'd say   Come back in a week  if you still feel lousy.  OK  and most of them would not come back  but some of them would come back. And when they came back  he  still convinced they were not sick  had another jar of pills. In this jar were huge horse pills. They were almost impossible to swallow. And these  to me  are the analogy for the car seats. People would look at these and say   Man  this thing is so big and so hard to swallow. If this doesn't make me feel better  you know  what possibly could   And it turned out that most people wouldn't come back  because it worked. But every once in a while  there was still a patient convinced that he was sick  and he'd come back. And my dad had a third jar of pills. And the jar of pills he had  he said  were the tiniest little pills he could find  so small you could barely see them. And he would say  listen  I know I gave you that huge pill  that complicated  hard to swallow pill before  but now I've got one that's so potent  that is really tiny and small and almost invisible. It's almost like this thing here  which you can't even see.  And it turned out that never  in all the times my dad gave out this pill  the really tiny pill  did anyone ever come back still complaining of sickness. So  my dad always took that as evidence that this little  teeny  powerful pill had the ultimate placebo effect. And in some sense  if that's the right story  I think integrated car seats you will see  very quickly  becoming something that everyone has. The other possible conclusion is  well  maybe after coming to my father three times  getting sent home with placebos  he still felt sick  he went and found another doctor. And that's completely possible. And if that's the case  then I think we're stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come. Thank you very much. we don't necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life  it's also to prevent lots of serious injury. Your data looks at fatalities. It doesn't look at serious injury. Is there any data to show that child seats are actually less effective  or just as effective as seatbelts for serious injury  Because that would prove your case.  Steven Levitt  Yeah  that's a great question. In my data  and in another data set I've looked at for New Jersey crashes  I find very small differences in injury. So in this data  it's statistically insignificant differences in injury between car seats and lap and shoulder belts. In the New Jersey data  which is different  because it's not just fatal crashes  but all crashes in New Jersey that are reported  it turns out that there is a    percent difference in injuries  but generally they're the minor injuries. Now  what's interesting  I should say this as a disclaimer  there is medical literature that is very difficult to resolve with this other data  which suggests that car seats are dramatically better. And they use a completely different methodology that involves    after the crash occurs  they get from the insurance companies the names of the people who were in the crash  and they call them on the phone  and they asked them what happened. And I really can't resolve  yet  and I'd like to work with these medical researchers to try to understand how there can be these differences  which are completely at odds with one another. But it's obviously a critical question. The question is even if    are there enough serious injuries to make these cost effective  It's kind of tricky. Even if they're right  it's not so clear that they're so cost effective.,Economist,200806,5.795463917525775
474,1290,1292,Steven Levitt 2006,Steven Levitt,male,The freakonomics of crack dealing,Sep 2006,1268,You'll be happy to know that I'll be talking not about my own tragedy  but other people's tragedy. It's a lot easier to be lighthearted about other people's tragedy than your own  and I want to keep it in the spirit of the conference. So  if you believe the media accounts  being a drug dealer in the height of the crack cocaine epidemic was a very glamorous life  in the words of Virginia Postrel. There was money  there was drugs  guns  women  you know  you name it    jewelry  bling bling    it had it all. What I'm going to tell you today is that  in fact  based on    years of research  a unique opportunity to go inside a gang    to see the actual books  the financial records of the gang    that the answer turns out not to be that being in the gang was a glamorous life. But I think  more realistically  that being in a gang    selling drugs for a gang    is perhaps the worst job in all of America. And that's what I'd like to convince you of today. So there are three things I want to do. First  I want to explain how and why crack cocaine had such a profound influence on inner city gangs. Secondly  I want to tell you how somebody like me came to be able to see the inner workings of a gang    an interesting story  I think. And then third  I want to tell you  in a very superficial way  about some of the things we found when we actually got to look at the financial records  the books  of the gang. So before I do that  just one warning  which is that this presentation has been rated 'R' by the Motion Picture Association of America. It contains adult themes  adult language. Given who is up on the stage  you'll be delighted to know that  in fact  there'll be no nudity    Unexpected wardrobe malfunctions aside. So let me start by talking about crack cocaine  and how it transformed the gang. To do that  you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine  in the early '  s  and look at it from the perspective of a gang leader. Being a gang leader in the inner city wasn't such a bad deal in the mid '  s    the early '  s  let me say. Now  you had a lot of power  and you got to beat people up    you got a lot of prestige  a lot of respect. But the thing is  there was no money in it. The gang had no way to make money. You couldn't charge dues to the people in the gang  because the people in the gang didn't have any money. You couldn't really make any money selling marijuana    marijuana's too cheap  it turns out. You can't get rich selling marijuana. You couldn't sell cocaine  cocaine's a great product    powdered cocaine    but you've got to know rich white people. And most of the inner city gang members didn't know any rich white people  so couldn't sell to that market. You couldn't really do petty crime  either. Turns out  petty crime's a terrible way to make a living. As a result  as a gang leader  you had  you know  power    it's a pretty good life    but the thing was  in the end  you were living at home with your mother. And so it wasn't really a career. There were limits to how powerful and important you could be if you had to live at home with your mother. Then along comes crack cocaine. And in the words of Malcolm Gladwell  crack cocaine was the extra chunky version of tomato sauce for the inner city. Because crack cocaine was an unbelievable innovation. I don't have time to talk about it today  but if you think about it  I would say that in the last    years  of every invention or innovation that's occurred in this country  the biggest one in terms of impact on the well being of people who live in the inner city  was crack cocaine. And for the worse    not for the better  but for the worse. It had a huge impact on life. So what was it about crack cocaine  It was a brilliant way of getting the brain high. Because you could smoke crack cocaine    you can't smoke powdered cocaine    and smoking is a much more efficient mechanism of delivering a high than snorting it. And it turned out there was this audience that didn't know it wanted crack cocaine  but when it came  it really did. And it was a perfect drug  you could buy the cocaine that went into it for a dollar  sell it for five dollars. Highly addictive    the high was very short. So for fifteen minutes  you get this great high  and then when you come down  all you want to do is get high again. It created a wonderful market. And for the people who were there running the gang  it was a great way  seemingly  to make a lot of money. At least for the people on the top. So this is where we enter the picture. Not really me    I'm really a bit player in all this. My co author  Sudhir Venkatesh  is the main character. He was a math major in college who had a good heart  and decided he wanted to get a sociology PhD  came to the University of Chicago. Now  the three months before he came to Chicago  he had spent following the Grateful Dead. And in his own words  he  looked like a freak.  He's a South Asian    very dark skinned South Asian. Big man  and he had hair  in his words   down to his ass.  Defied all kinds of boundaries  Was he black or white  Was he man or woman  He was really a curious sight to be seen. So he showed up at the University of Chicago  and the famous sociologist William Julius Wilson was doing a book that involved surveying people all across Chicago. He took one look at Sudhir  who was going to go do some surveys for him  and decided he knew exactly the place to send him  which was to one of the toughest  most notorious housing projects not just in Chicago  but in the entire United States. So Sudhir  the suburban boy who had never really been in the inner city  dutifully took his clipboard and walked down to this housing project  gets to the first building. The first building  Well  there's nobody there. But he hears some voices up in the stairwell  so he climbs up the stairwell  comes around the corner  and finds a group of young African American men playing dice. This is about       peak of the crack epidemic. This is a very dangerous job  being in a gang. You don't like to be surprised. You don't like to be surprised by people who come around the corner. And the mantra was  shoot first  ask questions later. Now  Sudhir was lucky    he was such a freak  and that clipboard probably saved his life  because they figured no other rival gang member would be coming up to shoot at them with a clipboard. So his greeting was not particularly warm  but they did say  well  OK    let's hear your questions on your survey. So    I kid you not    the first question on the survey that he was sent to ask was   How do you feel about being poor and Black in America   Makes you wonder about academics. So the choice of answers were   A  Very Good B  Good C  Bad D  Very Bad  What Sudhir found out is  in fact  that the real answer was the following   A  Very Good B  Good C  Bad D  Very Bad E  Fuck you  The survey was not  in the end  going to be what got Sudhir off the hook. He was held hostage overnight in the stairwell. There was a lot of gunfire  there were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the gang members. By morning  the gang leader arrived  checked out Sudhir  decided he was no threat  and they let him go home. So Sudhir went home  took a shower  took a nap. And you and I  probably  faced with the situation  would think   I guess I'm going to write my dissertation on The Grateful Dead  I've been following them for the last three months.  Sudhir  on the other hand  got right back  walked down to the housing project  went up to the second floor  and said   Hey  guys  I had so much fun hanging out with you last night  I wonder if I could do it again tonight.  And that was the beginning of what turned out to be a beautiful relationship that involved Sudhir living in the housing project on and off for    years  hanging out in crack houses  going to jail with the gang members  having the windows shot out of his car  having the police break into his apartment and steal his computer disks    you name it. But ultimately  the story has a happy ending for Sudhir  who became one of the most respected sociologists in the country. And especially for me  as I sat in my office with my Excel spreadsheet open  waiting for Sudhir to come and deliver to me the latest load of data that he would get from the gang. It was one of the most unequal co authoring relationships ever    But I was glad to be the beneficiary of it. So what did we find  What did we find in the gang  Well  let me say one thing  We really got access to everybody in the gang. We got an inside look at the gang  from the very bottom up to the very top. They trusted Sudhir  in ways that really no academic has ever    or really anybody  any outsider    has ever earned the trust of these gangs  to the point where they actually opened up what was most interesting for me    their books  the financial records they kept. They made them available to us  and we not only could study them  but we could ask them questions about what was in them. So if I have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time I have what the bottom line of what I take away from the gang is  it's that  if I had to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization  it would be that the gang is just like McDonald's  in a lot of different respects    the restaurant McDonald's. So first  in one way  which isn't maybe the most interesting way  but it's a good way to start    is in the way it's organized  the hierarchy of the gang  the way it looks. So here's what the org chart of the gang looks like. I don't know if you know much about org charts  but if you were to assign a stripped down and simplified McDonald's org chart  this is exactly what it would look like. It's amazing  but the top level of the gang  they actually call themselves the  Board of Directors.  And Sudhir says it's not like these guys had a very sophisticated view of what happened in American corporate life  but they had seen movies like  Wall Street   and they had learned a little bit about what it was like to be in the real world. Now  below that board of directors  you've got essentially what are regional VPs    people who control  say  the South Side of Chicago  or the West Side of Chicago. Sudhir got to know very well the guy who had the unfortunate assignment of trying to take the Iowa franchise  which  it turned out  for this black gang  was not one of the more brilliant financial endeavors they undertook. But the thing that really makes the gang seem like McDonald's is its franchisees. The guys who are running the local gangs    the four square block by four square block areas    they're just like the guys  in some sense  who are running the McDonald's. They are the entrepreneurs. They get the exclusive property rights to control the drug selling. They get the name of the gang behind them  for merchandising and marketing. And they're the ones who basically make the profit or lose a profit  depending on how good they are at running the business. Now  the group I really want you to think about  though  are the ones at the bottom    the foot soldiers. These are the teenagers  typically  who'd be standing out on the street corner  selling the drugs. Extremely dangerous work. And important to note is that almost all of the weight  all of the people in this organization are at the bottom    just like McDonald's. So in some sense  the foot soldiers are a lot like the people who are taking your order at McDonald's  and it's not just by chance that they're like them. In fact  in these neighborhoods  they'd be the same people. So the same kids who are working in the gang were actually  at the very same time  typically working part time at a place like McDonald's. Which already foreshadows the main result that I've talked about  about what a crappy job it was  being in the gang. Because obviously  if being in the gang were such a wonderful  lucrative job  why in the world would these guys moonlight at McDonald's  So what do the wages look like  You might be surprised. But based on being able to talk to them and to see their records  this is what it looks like in terms of the wages. The hourly wage the foot soldiers were earning was   .   an hour. It was below the minimum wage. And this is well documented. It's easy to see by the patterns of consumption they have. It really is not fiction    it's fact. There was very little money in the gang  especially at the bottom. Now if you managed to rise up  say  and be that local leader  the guy who's the equivalent of the McDonald's franchisee  you'd be making         dollars a year. And that  in some ways  was the best job you could hope to get if you were growing up in one of these neighborhoods as a young black male. If you managed to rise to the very top          or         dollars a year is what you'd hope to make. Truly  you would be a great success story. And one of the sad parts of this is that  indeed  among the many other ramifications of crack cocaine is that the most talented individuals in these communities    this is what they were striving for. They weren't trying to make it in legitimate ways  because there were no legitimate channels out. This was the best way out. And it actually was the right choice  probably  to try to make it out this way. You look at this  the relationship to McDonald's breaks down here. The money looks about the same. Why is it such a bad job  Well  the reason it's such a bad job is that there's somebody shooting at you a lot of the time. So  with shooting at you  what are the death rates  We found  in our gang    and admittedly  this was not really a standard situation  this was a time of intense violence  of a lot of gang wars  as this gang actually became quite successful. But there were costs. And so the death rate    not to mention the rate of being arrested  sent to prison  being wounded    the death rate in our sample was seven percent per person per year. You're in the gang for four years  you expect to die with about a    percent likelihood. That is about as high as you can get. So for comparison's purposes  let's think about some other walk of life you may expect might be extremely risky. Let's say that you were a murderer and you were convicted of murder  and you're sent to death row. It turns out  the death rates on death row from all causes  including execution  two percent a year. So it's a lot safer being on death row than it is selling drugs out on the street. That gives you some pause  for those of you who believe that a death penalty's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime. To give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack    and I'm not really focusing on the negatives  but really  there's another story to tell you there    if you look at the death rates just of random  young black males growing up in the inner city in the United States  the death rates during crack were about one percent. That's extremely high. And this is violent death    it's unbelievable  in some sense. To put it into perspective  if you compare this to the soldiers in Iraq  for instance  right now fighting the war   .  percent. So in some very literal way  the young black men who were growing up in this country were living in a war zone  very much in the sense that the soldiers over in Iraq are fighting in a war. So why in the world  you might ask  would anybody be willing to stand out on a street corner selling drugs for   .   an hour  with a    percent chance of dying over the next four years  Why would they do that  And I think there are a couple answers. I think the first one is that they got fooled by history. It used to be the gang was a rite of passage  that the young people controlled the gang  that as you got older  you dropped out of the gang. So what happened was  the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time    the people who happened to be leading the gang in the mid to late '  s    became very  very wealthy. And so the logical thing to think was that they are going to age out of the gang like everybody else has  and the next generation is going to take over and get the wealth. There are striking similarities  I think  to the Internet boom. The first set of people in Silicon Valley got very  very rich. And then all of my friends said   Maybe I should go do that  too.  And they were willing to work very cheap for stock options that never came. In some sense  that's what happened  exactly  to the set of people we were looking at. They were willing to start at the bottom  just like  say  a first year lawyer at a law firm is willing to start at the bottom  work    hour weeks for not that much money  because they think they're going to make partner. But the rules changed  and they never got to make partner. Indeed  the same people who were running all of the major gangs in the late     s are still running the major gangs in Chicago today. They never passed on any of the wealth  So everybody got stuck at that   .   an hour job  and it turned out to be a disaster. The other thing the gang was very good at was marketing and trickery. And so for instance  one thing the gang would do is    the gang leaders would have big entourages  and they'd drive fancy cars and have fancy jewelry. So what Sudhir eventually realized as he hung out with them more  is that  really  they didn't own those cars    they just leased them  because they couldn't afford to own the fancy cars. And they didn't really have gold jewelry  they had gold plated jewelry. It goes back to  you know  the real real versus the fake real. And really  they did all sorts of things to trick the young people into thinking what a great deal the gang was going to be. So for instance  they would give a    year old kid a whole roll of bills to hold. That    year old kid would say to his friends   Hey  look at all the money I got in the gang.  It wasn't his money    until he spent it  and then he was in debt to the gang  and was sort of an indentured servant for a while. So I have a couple minutes. Let me do one last thing I hadn't thought I'd have time to do  which is to talk about what we learned more generally about economics  from the study of the gang. So  economists tend to talk in technical words. Often  our theories fail quite miserably when we over the data  but what's kind of interesting is that in this setting  it turned out that some of the economic theories that worked not so well in the real economy worked very well in the drug economy  in some sense  because it's unfettered capitalism. Here's an economic principle. This is one of the basic ideas in labor economics  called a  compensating differential.  It's the idea that the increment to wages that a worker requires to leave him indifferent between performing two tasks  one which is more unpleasant than the other. Compensating differential    it's why we think garbagemen might be paid more than people who work in parks. The words of one of the members of the gang  I think  make this clear. So it turns out    I'm sort of getting ahead of myself    it turns out  in the gang  when there's a war going on  they actually pay the foot soldiers twice as much money. It's exactly this concept. Because they're not willing to be at risk. And the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely  he says   Would you stand around here when all this shit ...     the shooting     ... if all this shit's going on  No  right  So if I gonna be asked to put my life on the line  then front me the cash  man.  I think the gang member says it much more articulately than the economist  about what's going on. Here's another one. Economists talk about game theory  that every two person game has a Nash equilibrium. Here's the translation you get from the gang member. They're talking about the decision of why they don't go shoot    One thing that turns out to be a great business tactic in the gang  if you go and just shoot guns in the air in the other gang's territory    people are afraid to go buy drugs there  they're going to come into your neighborhood. Here's what he says about why they don't do that   If we start shooting around there  the other gang's territory  nobody  I mean  you dig it  nobody gonna step on their turf. But we gotta be careful  'cause they can shoot around here too and then we all fucked.  So that's the same concept. Then again  sometimes economists get it wrong. One thing we observed in the data is that it looked like    the gang leader always got paid. No matter how bad it was economically  he always got himself paid. We had some theories related to cash flow  and lack of access to capital markets  and things like that. Then we asked the gang member   Why is it you always get paid and your workers don't always get paid   His response is   You got all these niggers below you who want your job  you dig  If you start taking losses  they see you as weak and shit.  And I thought about it and said   CEOs often pay themselves million dollar bonuses  even when companies are losing a lot of money. And it never would really occur to an economist that this idea of 'weak and shit' could really be important.  Maybe  weak and shit  is an important hypothesis that needs more analysis.

475,413,415,Steven Pinker 2007,Steven Pinker,male,What our language habits reveal,Sep 2007,1042,This is a picture of Maurice Druon  the Honorary Perpetual Secretary of L'Academie francaise  the French Academy. He is splendidly attired in his        dollar uniform  befitting the role of the French Academy as legislating the correct usage in French and perpetuating the language. The French Academy has two main tasks  it compiles a dictionary of official French. They're now working on their ninth edition  which they began in       and they've reached the letter P. They also legislate on correct usage  such as the proper term for what the French call  email   which ought to be  courriel.  The World Wide Web  the French are told  ought to be referred to as  la toile d'araignee mondiale     the Global Spider Web    recommendations that the French gaily ignore. Now  this is one model of how language comes to be  namely  it's legislated by an academy. But anyone who looks at language realizes that this is a rather silly conceit  that language  rather  emerges from human minds interacting from one another. And this is visible in the unstoppable change in language    the fact that by the time the Academy finishes their dictionary  it will already be well out of date. We see it in the constant appearance of slang and jargon  of the historical change in languages  in divergence of dialects and the formation of new languages. So language is not so much a creator or shaper of human nature  so much as a window onto human nature. In a book that I'm currently working on  I hope to use language to shed light on a number of aspects of human nature  including the cognitive machinery with which humans conceptualize the world and the relationship types that govern human interaction. And I'm going to say a few words about each one this morning. Let me start off with a technical problem in language that I've worried about for quite some time    and indulge me in my passion for verbs and how they're used. The problem is  which verbs go in which constructions  The verb is the chassis of the sentence. It's the framework onto which the other parts are bolted. Let me give you a quick reminder of something that you've long forgotten. An intransitive verb  such as  dine   for example  can't take a direct object. You have to say   Sam dined   not   Sam dined the pizza.  A transitive verb mandates that there has to be an object there   Sam devoured the pizza.  You can't just say   Sam devoured.  There are dozens or scores of verbs of this type  each of which shapes its sentence. So  a problem in explaining how children learn language  a problem in teaching language to adults so that they don't make grammatical errors  and a problem in programming computers to use language is which verbs go in which constructions. For example  the dative construction in English. You can say   Give a muffin to a mouse   the prepositional dative. Or   Give a mouse a muffin   the double object dative.  Promise anything to her    Promise her anything   and so on. Hundreds of verbs can go both ways. So a tempting generalization for a child  for an adult  for a computer is that any verb that can appear in the construction   subject verb thing to a recipient  can also be expressed as  subject verb recipient thing.  A handy thing to have  because language is infinite  and you can't just parrot back the sentences that you've heard. You've got to extract generalizations so you can produce and understand new sentences. This would be an example of how to do that. Unfortunately  there appear to be idiosyncratic exceptions. You can say   Biff drove the car to Chicago   but not   Biff drove Chicago the car.  You can say   Sal gave Jason a headache   but it's a bit odd to say   Sal gave a headache to Jason.  The solution is that these constructions  despite initial appearance  are not synonymous  that when you crank up the microscope on human cognition  you see that there's a subtle difference in meaning between them. So   give the X to the Y   that construction corresponds to the thought  cause X to go to Y.  Whereas  give the Y the X  corresponds to the thought  cause Y to have X.  Now  many events can be subject to either construal  kind of like the classic figure ground reversal illusions  in which you can either pay attention to the particular object  in which case the space around it recedes from attention  or you can see the faces in the empty space  in which case the object recedes out of consciousness. How are these construals reflected in language  Well  in both cases  the thing that is construed as being affected is expressed as the direct object  the noun after the verb. So  when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere    where you're doing something to the muffin    you say   Give the muffin to the mouse.  When you construe it as  cause the mouse to have something   you're doing something to the mouse  and therefore you express it as   Give the mouse the muffin.  So which verbs go in which construction    the problem with which I began    depends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motion or a kind of possession change. To give something involves both causing something to go and causing someone to have. To drive the car only causes something to go  because Chicago's not the kind of thing that can possess something. Only humans can possess things. And to give someone a headache causes them to have the headache  but it's not as if you're taking the headache out of your head and causing it to go to the other person  and implanting it in them. You may just be loud or obnoxious  or some other way causing them to have the headache. So  that's an example of the kind of thing that I do in my day job. So why should anyone care  Well  there are a number of interesting conclusions  I think  from this and many similar kinds of analyses of hundreds of English verbs. First  there's a level of fine grained conceptual structure  which we automatically and unconsciously compute every time we produce or utter a sentence  that governs our use of language. You can think of this as the language of thought  or  mentalese.  It seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts  which govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs    not only in English  but in all other languages    fundamental concepts such as space  time  causation and human intention  such as  what is the means and what is the ends  These are reminiscent of the kinds of categories that Immanuel Kant argued are the basic framework for human thought  and it's interesting that our unconscious use of language seems to reflect these Kantian categories. Doesn't care about perceptual qualities  such as color  texture  weight and speed  which virtually never differentiate the use of verbs in different constructions. An additional twist is that all of the constructions in English are used not only literally  but in a quasi metaphorical way. For example  this construction  the dative  is used not only to transfer things  but also for the metaphorical transfer of ideas  as when we say   She told a story to me  or  told me a story    Max taught Spanish to the students  or  taught the students Spanish.  It's exactly the same construction  but no muffins  no mice  nothing moving at all. It evokes the container metaphor of communication  in which we conceive of ideas as objects  sentences as containers  and communication as a kind of sending. As when we say we  gather  our ideas  to  put  them  into  words  and if our words aren't  empty  or  hollow   we might get these ideas  across  to a listener  who can  unpack  our words to  extract  their  content.  And indeed  this kind of verbiage is not the exception  but the rule. It's very hard to find any example of abstract language that is not based on some concrete metaphor. For example  you can use the verb  go  and the prepositions  to  and  from  in a literal  spatial sense.  The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul.  You can also say   Biff went from sick to well.  He needn't go anywhere. He could have been in bed the whole time  but it's as if his health is a point in state space that you conceptualize as moving. Or   The meeting went from three to four   in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line. Likewise  we use  force  to indicate not only physical force  as in   Rose forced the door to open   but also interpersonal force  as in   Rose forced Sadie to go   not necessarily by manhandling her  but by issuing a threat. Or   Rose forced herself to go   as if there were two entities inside Rose's head  engaged in a tug of a war. Second conclusion is that the ability to conceive of a given event in two different ways  such as  cause something to go to someone  and  causing someone to have something   I think is a fundamental feature of human thought  and it's the basis for much human argumentation  in which people don't differ so much on the facts as on how they ought to be construed. Just to give you a few examples   ending a pregnancy  versus  killing a fetus    a ball of cells  versus  an unborn child    invading Iraq  versus  liberating Iraq    redistributing wealth  versus  confiscating earnings.  And I think the biggest picture of all would take seriously the fact that so much of our verbiage about abstract events is based on a concrete metaphor and see human intelligence itself as consisting of a repertoire of concepts    such as objects  space  time  causation and intention    which are useful in a social  knowledge intensive species  whose evolution you can well imagine  and a process of metaphorical abstraction that allows us to bleach these concepts of their original conceptual content    space  time and force    and apply them to new abstract domains  therefore allowing a species that evolved to deal with rocks and tools and animals  to conceptualize mathematics  physics  law and other abstract domains. Well  I said I'd talk about two windows on human nature    the cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world  and now I'm going to say a few words about the relationship types that govern human social interaction  again  as reflected in language. And I'll start out with a puzzle  the puzzle of indirect speech acts. Now  I'm sure most of you have seen the movie  Fargo.  And you might remember the scene in which the kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer  is asked to show his driver's license and holds his wallet out with a    dollar bill extending at a slight angle out of the wallet. And he says   I was just thinking that maybe we could take care of it here in Fargo   which everyone  including the audience  interprets as a veiled bribe. This kind of indirect speech is rampant in language. For example  in polite requests  if someone says   If you could pass the guacamole  that would be awesome   we know exactly what he means  even though that's a rather bizarre concept being expressed.  Would you like to come up and see my etchings   I think most people understand the intent behind that. And likewise  if someone says   Nice store you've got there. It would be a real shame if something happened to it     we understand that as a veiled threat  rather than a musing of hypothetical possibilities. So the puzzle is  why are bribes  polite requests  solicitations and threats so often veiled  No one's fooled. Both parties know exactly what the speaker means  and the speaker knows the listener knows that the speaker knows that the listener knows  etc.  etc. So what's going on  I think the key idea is that language is a way of negotiating relationships  and human relationships fall into a number of types. There's an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist Alan Fiske  in which relationships can be categorized  more or less  into communality  which works on the principle  what's mine is thine  what's thine is mine   the kind of mindset that operates within a family  for example  dominance  whose principle is  don't mess with me   reciprocity   you scratch my back  I'll scratch yours   and sexuality  in the immortal words of Cole Porter   Let's do it.  Now  relationship types can be negotiated. Even though there are default situations in which one of these mindsets can be applied  they can be stretched and extended. For example  communality applies most naturally within family or friends  but it can be used to try to transfer the mentality of sharing to groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it. For example  in brotherhoods  fraternal organizations  sororities  locutions like  the family of man   you try to get people who are not related to use the relationship type that would ordinarily be appropriate to close kin. Now  mismatches    when one person assumes one relationship type  and another assumes a different one    can be awkward. If you went over and you helped yourself to a shrimp off your boss' plate  for example  that would be an awkward situation. Or if a dinner guest after the meal pulled out his wallet and offered to pay you for the meal  that would be rather awkward as well. In less blatant cases  there's still a kind of negotiation that often goes on. In the workplace  for example  there's often a tension over whether an employee can socialize with the boss  or refer to him or her on a first name basis. If two friends have a reciprocal transaction  like selling a car  it's well known that this can be a source of tension or awkwardness. In dating  the transition from friendship to sex can lead to  notoriously  various forms of awkwardness  and as can sex in the workplace  in which we call the conflict between a dominant and a sexual relationship  sexual harassment.  Well  what does this have to do with language  Well  language  as a social interaction  has to satisfy two conditions. You have to convey the actual content    here we get back to the container metaphor. You want to express the bribe  the command  the promise  the solicitation and so on  but you also have to negotiate and maintain the kind of relationship you have with the other person. The solution  I think  is that we use language at two levels  the literal form signals the safest relationship with the listener  whereas the implicated content    the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform    allows the listener to derive the interpretation which is most relevant in context  which possibly initiates a changed relationship. The simplest example of this is in the polite request. If you express your request as a conditional     if you could open the window  that would be great     even though the content is an imperative  the fact that you're not using the imperative voice means that you're not acting as if you're in a relationship of dominance  where you could presuppose the compliance of the other person. On the other hand  you want the damn guacamole. By expressing it as an if then statement  you can get the message across without appearing to boss another person around. And in a more subtle way  I think  this works for all of the veiled speech acts involving plausible deniability  the bribes  threats  propositions  solicitations and so on. One way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like if language    where it could only be used literally. And you can think of it in terms of a game theoretic payoff matrix. Put yourself in the position of the kidnapper wanting to bribe the officer. There's a high stakes in the two possibilities of having a dishonest officer or an honest officer. If you don't bribe the officer  then you will get a traffic ticket    or  as is the case of  Fargo   worse    whether the honest officer is honest or dishonest. Nothing ventured  nothing gained. In that case  the consequences are rather severe. On the other hand  if you extend the bribe  if the officer is dishonest  you get a huge payoff of going free. If the officer is honest  you get a huge penalty of being arrested for bribery. So this is a rather fraught situation. On the other hand  with indirect language  if you issue a veiled bribe  then the dishonest officer could interpret it as a bribe  in which case you get the payoff of going free. The honest officer can't hold you to it as being a bribe  and therefore  you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket. So you get the best of both worlds. And a similar analysis  I think  can apply to the potential awkwardness of a sexual solicitation  and other cases where plausible deniability is an asset. I think this affirms something that's long been known by diplomats    namely  that the vagueness of language  far from being a bug or an imperfection  actually might be a feature of language  one that we use to our advantage in social interactions. So to sum up  language is a collective human creation  reflecting human nature  how we conceptualize reality  how we relate to one another. And then by analyzing the various quirks and complexities of language  I think we can get a window onto what makes us tick. Thank you very much.,Linguist,200709,6.024639865996642
476,424,426,Steven Pinker 2007,Steven Pinker,male,The surprising decline in violence,Sep 2007,1148,Images like this  from the Auschwitz concentration camp  have been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century and have given us a new understanding of who we are  where we've come from and the times we live in. During the twentieth century  we witnessed the atrocities of Stalin  Hitler  Mao  Pol Pot  Rwanda and other genocides  and even though the twenty first century is only seven years old  we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur and the daily horrors of Iraq. This has led to a common understanding of our situation  namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence  and perhaps that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from  to our peril. Here is an example from an op ed on Thanksgiving  in the Boston Globe a couple of years ago  where the writer wrote   The Indian life was a difficult one  but there were no employment problems  community harmony was strong  substance abuse unknown  crime nearly non existent  what warfare there was between tribes was largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate or wholesale slaughter.  Now  you're all familiar with this treacle. We teach it to our children. We hear it on television and in storybooks. Now  the original title of this session was   Everything You Know Is Wrong   and I'm going to present evidence that this particular part of our common understanding is wrong  that  in fact  our ancestors were far more violent than we are  that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time  and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence. Now  in the decade of Darfur and Iraq  a statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory and obscene. But I'm going to try to convince you that that is the correct picture. The decline of violence is a fractal phenomenon. You can see it over millennia  over centuries  over decades and over years  although there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset of the Age of Reason in the sixteenth century. One sees it all over the world  although not homogeneously. It's especially evident in the West  beginning with England and Holland around the time of the Enlightenment. Let me take you on a journey of several powers of       from the millennium scale to the year scale    to try to persuade you of this. Until        years ago  all humans lived as hunter gatherers  without permanent settlements or government. And this is the state that's commonly thought to be one of primordial harmony. But the archaeologist Lawrence Keeley  looking at casualty rates among contemporary hunter gatherers  which is our best source of evidence about this way of life  has shown a rather different conclusion. Here is a graph that he put together showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare in a number of foraging  or hunting and gathering societies. The red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die at the hands of another man  as opposed to passing away of natural causes  in a variety of foraging societies in the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest. And they range from a rate of almost a    percent chance that a man will die at the hands of another man to  in the case of the Gebusi  only a    percent chance. The tiny  little blue bar in the lower left hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from United States and Europe in the twentieth century  and includes all the deaths of both World Wars. If the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailed during the   th century  there would have been two billion deaths rather than     million. Also at the millennium scale  we can look at the way of life of early civilizations such as the ones described in the Bible. And in this supposed source of our moral values  one can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare  such as the following from Numbers      And they warred against the Midianites as the Lord commanded Moses  and they slew all the males. And Moses said unto them  'Have you saved all the women alive  Now  therefore  kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him  but all the women children that have not know a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves.'  In other words  kill the men  kill the children  if you see any virgins  then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them. You can find four or five passages in the Bible of this ilk. Also in the Bible  one sees that the death penalty was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality  adultery  blasphemy  idolatry  talking back to your parents    Well  let's click the zoom lens down one order of magnitude  and look at the century scale. Although we don't have statistics for warfare throughout the Middle Ages to modern times  we know just from conventional history    the evidence was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction in socially sanctioned forms of violence. For example  any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture were routine forms of criminal punishment. The kind of infraction today that would give you a fine  in those days would result in your tongue being cut out  your ears being cut off  you being blinded  a hand being chopped off and so on. There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment  burning at the stake  disemboweling  breaking on the wheel  being pulled apart by horses and so on. The death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non violent crimes  criticizing the king  stealing a loaf of bread. Slavery  of course  was the preferred labor saving device  and cruelty was a popular form of entertainment. Perhaps the most vivid example was the practice of cat burning  in which a cat was hoisted on a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire  and the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat  howling in pain  was burned to death. What about one on one murder  Well  there  there are good statistics  because many municipalities recorded the cause of death. The criminologist Manuel Eisner scoured all of the historical records across Europe for homicide rates in any village  hamlet  town  county that he could find  and he supplemented them with national data  when nations started keeping statistics. He plotted on a logarithmic scale  going from     deaths per         people per year  which was approximately the rate of homicide in the Middle Ages. And the figure plummets down to less than one homicide per         people per year in seven or eight European countries. Then  there is a slight uptick in the     s. The people who said that rock 'n' roll would lead to the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that. But there was a decline from at least two orders of magnitude in homicide from the Middle Ages to the present  and the elbow occurred in the early sixteenth century. Let's click down now to the decade scale. According to non governmental organizations that keep such statistics  since       in Europe and the Americas  there has been a steep decline in interstate wars  in deadly ethnic riots or pogroms  and in military coups  even in South America. Worldwide  there's been a steep decline in deaths in interstate wars. The yellow bars here show the number of deaths per war per year from      to the present. And  as you can see  the death rate goes down from        deaths per conflict per year in the     s to less than       deaths per conflict per year in this decade  as horrific as it is. Even in the year scale  one can see a decline of violence. Since the end of the Cold War  there have been fewer civil wars  fewer genocides    indeed  a    percent reduction since post World War II highs    and even a reversal of the     s uptick in homicide and violent crime. This is from the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics. You can see that there is a fairly low rate of violence in the '  s and the '  s  then it soared upward for several decades  and began a precipitous decline  starting in the     s  so that it went back to the level that was last enjoyed in     . President Clinton  if you're here  thank you. So the question is  why are so many people so wrong about something so important  I think there are a number of reasons. One of them is we have better reporting. The Associated Press is a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the Earth than sixteenth century monks were. There's a cognitive illusion. We cognitive psychologists know that the easier it is to recall specific instances of something  the higher the probability that you assign to it. Things that we read about in the paper with gory footage burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying in their beds of old age. There are dynamics in the opinion and advocacy markets  no one ever attracted observers  advocates and donors by saying things just seem to be getting better and better. There's guilt about our treatment of native peoples in modern intellectual life  and an unwillingness to acknowledge there could be anything good about Western culture. And of course  our change in standards can outpace the change in behavior. One of the reasons violence went down is that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time. That's a process that seems to be continuing  but if it outstrips behavior by the standards of the day  things always look more barbaric than they would have been by historic standards. So today  we get exercised    and rightly so    if a handful of murderers get executed by lethal injection in Texas after a    year appeal process. We don't consider that a couple of hundred years ago  they may have been burned at the stake for criticizing the king after a trial that lasted    minutes  and indeed  that that would have been repeated over and over again. Today  we look at capital punishment as evidence of how low our behavior can sink  rather than how high our standards have risen. Well  why has violence declined  No one really knows  but I have read four explanations  all of which  I think  have some grain of plausibility. The first is  maybe Thomas Hobbes got it right. He was the one who said that life in a state of nature was  solitary  poor  nasty  brutish and short.  Not because  he argued  humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative  but because of the logic of anarchy. In a state of anarchy  there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively  before they invade you. More recently  Thomas Schelling gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling in the basement. Being a good American  he has a pistol in the nightstand  pulls out his gun  and walks down the stairs. And what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand. Now  each one of them is thinking   I don't really want to kill that guy  but he's about to kill me. Maybe I had better shoot him  before he shoots me  especially since  even if he doesn't want to kill me  he's probably worrying right now that I might kill him before he kills me.  And so on. Hunter gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought  and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first. Now  one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence. You don't strike first  but you have a publicly announced policy that you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded. The only thing is that it's liable to having its bluff called  and therefore can only work if it's credible. To make it credible  you must avenge all insults and settle all scores  which leads to the cycles of bloody vendetta. Life becomes an episode of  The Sopranos.  Hobbes' solution  the  Leviathan   was that if authority for the legitimate use of violence was vested in a single democratic agency    a leviathan    then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack  because any kind of aggression will be punished  leaving its profitability as zero. That would remove the temptation to invade preemptively  out of fear of them attacking you first. It removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation to make your deterrent threat credible. And therefore  it would lead to a state of peace. Eisner    the man who plotted the homicide rates that you failed to see in the earlier slide    argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in Europe coincided with the rise of centralized states. So that's a bit of a support for the leviathan theory. Also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence in zones of anarchy  in failed states  collapsed empires  frontier regions  mafias  street gangs and so on. The second explanation is that in many times and places  there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap. In earlier times  when suffering and early death were common in one's own life  one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them on others. And as technology and economic efficiency make life longer and more pleasant  one puts a higher value on life in general. This was an argument from the political scientist James Payne. A third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero sum game  and was worked out in the book  Nonzero  by the journalist Robert Wright. Wright points out that in certain circumstances  cooperation or non violence can benefit both parties in an interaction  such as gains in trade when two parties trade their surpluses and both come out ahead  or when two parties lay down their arms and split the so called peace dividend that results in them not having to fight the whole time. Wright argues that technology has increased the number of positive sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in  by allowing the trade of goods  services and ideas over longer distances and among larger groups of people. The result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead  and violence declines for selfish reasons. As Wright put it   Among the many reasons that I think that we should not bomb the Japanese is that they built my mini van.  The fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book called  The Expanding Circle   by the philosopher Peter Singer  who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense of empathy  an ability to treat other peoples' interests as comparable to one's own. Unfortunately  by default we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family. People outside that circle are treated as sub human  and can be exploited with impunity. But  over history  the circle has expanded. One can see  in historical record  it expanding from the village  to the clan  to the tribe  to the nation  to other races  to both sexes  and  in Singer's own arguments  something that we should extend to other sentient species. The question is  if this has happened  what has powered that expansion  And there are a number of possibilities  such as increasing circles of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for. The logic of the golden rule    the more you think about and interact with other people  the more you realize that it is untenable to privilege your interests over theirs  at least not if you want them to listen to you. You can't say that my interests are special compared to yours  anymore than you can say that the particular spot that I'm standing on is a unique part of the universe because I happen to be standing on it that very minute. It may also be powered by cosmopolitanism  by histories  and journalism  and memoirs  and realistic fiction  and travel  and literacy  which allows you to project yourself into the lives of other people that formerly you may have treated as sub human  and also to realize the accidental contingency of your own station in life  the sense that  there but for fortune go I.  Whatever its causes  the decline of violence  I think  has profound implications. It should force us to ask not just  why is there war  But also  why is there peace  Not just  what are we doing wrong  But also  what have we been doing right  Because we have been doing something right  and it sure would be good to find out what it is. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  I loved that talk. I think a lot of people here in the room would say that that expansion of    that you were talking about  that Peter Singer talks about  is also driven by  just by technology  by greater visibility of the other  and the sense that the world is therefore getting smaller. I mean  is that also a grain of truth  Steven Pinker  Very much. It would fit both in Wright's theory  that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation over larger and larger circles. But also  I think it helps us imagine what it's like to be someone else. I think when you read these horrific tortures that were common in the Middle Ages  you think  how could they possibly have done it  how could they have not have empathized with the person that they're disemboweling  But clearly  as far as they're concerned  this is just an alien being that does not have feelings akin to their own. Anything  I think  that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person. CA  Well  Steve  I would love every news media owner to hear that talk at some point in the next year. I think it's really important. Thank you so much.

477,1307,1309,Steven Pinker 2008,Steven Pinker,male,Human nature and the blank slate,Sep 2008,1284,A year ago  I spoke to you about a book that I was just in the process of completing  that has come out in the interim  and I would like to talk to you today about some of the controversies that that book inspired. The book is called  The Blank Slate   based on the popular idea that the human mind is a blank slate  and that all of its structure comes from socialization  culture  parenting  experience. The  blank slate  was an influential idea in the   th century. Here are a few quotes indicating that   Man has no nature   from the historian Jose Ortega y Gasset   Man has no instincts   from the anthropologist Ashley Montagu   The human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to none   from the late scientist Stephen Jay Gould. There are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind is a blank slate  and some of them just come from common sense. As many people have told me over the years  anyone who's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperaments and talents  it doesn't all come from the outside. Oh  and anyone who has both a child and a house pet has surely noticed that the child  exposed to speech  will acquire a human language  whereas the house pet won't  presumably because of some innate different between them. And anyone who's ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that the minds of men and the minds of women are not indistinguishable. There are also  I think  increasing results from the scientific study of humans that  indeed  we're not born blank slates. One of them  from anthropology  is the study of human universals. If you've ever taken anthropology  you know that it's a    kind of an occupational pleasure of anthropologists to show how exotic other cultures can be  and that there are places out there where  supposedly  everything is the opposite to the way it is here. But if you instead look at what is common to the world's cultures  you find that there is an enormously rich set of behaviors and emotions and ways of construing the world that can be found in all of the world's       odd cultures. The anthropologist Donald Brown has tried to list them all  and they range from aesthetics  affection and age statuses all the way down to weaning  weapons  weather  attempts to control  the color white and a worldview. Also  genetics and neuroscience are increasingly showing that the brain is intricately structured. This is a recent study by the neurobiologist Paul Thompson and his colleagues in which they    using MRI    measured the distribution of gray matter    that is  the outer layer of the cortex    in a large sample of pairs of people. They coded correlations in the thickness of gray matter in different parts of the brain using a false color scheme  in which no difference is coded as purple  and any color other than purple indicates a statistically significant correlation. Well  this is what happens when you pair people up at random. By definition  two people picked at random can't have correlations in the distribution of gray matter in the cortex. This is what happens in people who share half of their DNA    fraternal twins. And as you can see  large amounts of the brain are not purple  showing that if one person has a thicker bit of cortex in that region  so does his fraternal twin. And here's what happens if you get a pair of people who share all their DNA    namely  clones or identical twins. And you can see huge areas of cortex where there are massive correlations in the distribution of gray matter. Now  these aren't just differences in anatomy  like the shape of your ear lobes  but they have consequences in thought and behavior that are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by Charles Addams   Separated at birth  the Mallifert twins meet accidentally.  As you can see  there are two inventors with identical contraptions in their lap  meeting in the waiting room of a patent attorney. Now  the cartoon is not such an exaggeration  because studies of identical twins who were separated at birth and then tested in adulthood show that they have astonishing similarities. And this happens in every pair of identical twins separated at birth ever studied    but much less so with fraternal twins separated at birth. My favorite example is a pair of twins  one of whom was brought up as a Catholic in a Nazi family in Germany  the other brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad. When they walked into the lab in Minnesota  they were wearing identical navy blue shirts with epaulettes  both of them liked to dip buttered toast in coffee  both of them kept rubber bands around their wrists  both of them flushed the toilet before using it as well as after  and both of them liked to surprise people by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump. Now    the story might seem to good to be true  but when you administer batteries of psychological tests  you get the same results    namely  identical twins separated at birth show quite astonishing similarities. Now  given both the common sense and scientific data calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question  why should it have been such an appealing notion  Well  there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial. The foremost is that if we're blank slates  then  by definition  we are equal  because zero equals zero equals zero. But if something is written on the slate  then some people could have more of it than others  and according to this line of thinking  that would justify discrimination and inequality. Another political fear of human nature is that if we are blank slates  we can perfect mankind    the age old dream of the perfectibility of our species through social engineering. Whereas  if we're born with certain instincts  then perhaps some of them might condemn us to selfishness  prejudice and violence. Well  in the book  I argue that these are  in fact  non sequiturs. And just to make a long story short  first of all  the concept of fairness is not the same as the concept of sameness. And so when Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence   We hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are created equal   he did not mean  We hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are clones.  Rather  that all men are equal in terms of their rights  and that every person ought to be treated as an individual  and not prejudged by the statistics of particular groups that they may belong to. Also  even if we were born with certain ignoble motives  they don't automatically lead to ignoble behavior. That is because the human mind is a complex system with many parts  and some of them can inhibit others. For example  there's excellent reason to believe that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense  and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us to profit from the lessons of history. So even if people did have impulses towards selfishness or greed  that's not the only thing in the skull  and there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them. In the book  I go over controversies such as this one  and a number of other hot buttons  hot zones  Chernobyls  third rails  and so on    including the arts  cloning  crime  free will  education  evolution  gender differences  God  homosexuality  infanticide  inequality  Marxism  morality  Nazism  parenting  politics  race  rape  religion  resource depletion  social engineering  technological risk and war. And needless to say  there were certain risks in taking on these subjects. When I wrote a first draft of the book  I circulated it to a number of colleagues for comments  and here are some of the reactions that I got   Better get a security camera for your house.   Don't expect to get any more awards  job offers or positions in scholarly societies.   Tell your publisher not to list your hometown in your author bio.   Do you have tenure   Well  the book came out in October  and nothing terrible has happened. I    I like    There was indeed reason to be nervous  and there were moments in which I did feel nervous  knowing the history of what has happened to people who've taken controversial stands or discovered disquieting findings in the behavioral sciences. There are many cases  some of which I talk about in the book  of people who have been slandered  called Nazis  physically assaulted  threatened with criminal prosecution for stumbling across or arguing about controversial findings. And you never know when you're going to come across one of these booby traps. My favorite example is a pair of psychologists who did research on left handers  and published some data showing that left handers are  on average  more susceptible to disease  more prone to accidents and have a shorter lifespan. It's not clear  by the way  since then  whether that is an accurate generalization  but the data at the time seemed to support that. Well  pretty soon they were barraged with enraged letters  death threats  ban on the topic in a number of scientific journals  coming from irate left handers and their advocates  and they were literally afraid to open their mail because of the venom and vituperation that they had inadvertently inspired. Well  the night is young  but the book has been out for half a year  and nothing terrible has happened. None of the dire professional consequences has taken place    I haven't been exiled from the city of Cambridge. But what I wanted to talk about are two of these hot buttons that have aroused the strongest response in the    odd reviews that The Blank Slate has received. I'll just put that list up for a few seconds  and see if you can guess which two    I would estimate that probably two of these topics inspired probably    percent of the reaction in the various reviews and radio interviews. It's not violence and war  it's not race  it's not gender  it's not Marxism  it's not Nazism. They are  the arts and parenting. So let me tell you what aroused such irate responses  and I'll let you decide if whether they    the claims are really that outrageous. Let me start with the arts. I note that among the long list of human universals that I presented a few slides ago are art. There is no society ever discovered in the remotest corner of the world that has not had something that we would consider the arts. Visual arts    decoration of surfaces and bodies    appears to be a human universal. The telling of stories  music  dance  poetry    found in all cultures  and many of the motifs and themes that give us pleasure in the arts can be found in all human societies  a preference for symmetrical forms  the use of repetition and variation  even things as specific as the fact that in poetry all over the world  you have lines that are very close to three seconds long  separated by pauses. Now  on the other hand  in the second half of the   th century  the arts are frequently said to be in decline. And I have a collection  probably    or    headlines  from highbrow magazines deploring the fact that the arts are in decline in our time. I'll give you a couple of representative quotes   We can assert with some confidence that our own period is one of decline  that the standards of culture are lower than they were    years ago  and that the evidences of this decline are visible in every department of human activity.  That's a quote from T. S. Eliot  a little more than    years ago. And a more recent one   The possibility of sustaining high culture in our time is becoming increasing problematical. Serious book stores are losing their franchise  nonprofit theaters are surviving primarily by commercializing their repertory  symphony orchestras are diluting their programs  public television is increasing its dependence on reruns of British sitcoms  classical radio stations are dwindling  museums are resorting to blockbuster shows  dance is dying.  That's from Robert Brustein  the famous drama critic and director  in The New Republic about five years ago. Well  in fact  the arts are not in decline. I don't think this will as a surprise to anyone in this room  but by any standard they have never been flourishing to a greater extent. There are  of course  entirely new art forms and new media  many of which you've heard over these few days. By any economic standard  the demand for art of all forms is skyrocketing  as you can tell from the price of opera tickets  by the number of books sold  by the number of books published  the number of musical titles released  the number of new albums and so on. The only grain of truth to this complaint that the arts are in decline come from three spheres. One of them is in elite art since the     s    say  the kinds of works performed by major symphony orchestras  where most of the repertory is before       or the works shown in major galleries and prestigious museums. In literary criticism and analysis  probably    or    years ago  literary critics were a kind of cultural hero  now they're kind of a national joke. And the humanities and arts programs in the universities  which by many measures  indeed are in decline. Students are staying away in droves  universities are disinvesting in the arts and humanities. Well  here's a diagnosis. They didn't ask me  but by their own admission  they need all the help that they can get. And I would like to suggest that it's not a coincidence that this supposed decline in the elite arts and criticism occurred in the same point in history in which there was a widespread denial of human nature. A famous quotation can be found    if you look on the web  you can find it in literally scores of English core syllabuses     In or about December       human nature changed.  A paraphrase of a quote by Virginia Woolf  and there's some debate as to what she actually meant by that. But it's very clear  looking at these syllabuses  that    it's used now as a way of saying that all forms of appreciation of art that were in place for centuries  or millennia  in the   th century were discarded. The beauty and pleasure in art    probably a human universal    were    began to be considered saccharine  or kitsch  or commercial. Barnett Newman had a famous quote that  the impulse of modern art is the desire to destroy beauty     which was considered bourgeois or tacky. And here's just one example. I mean  this is perhaps a representative example of the visual depiction of the female form in the   th century  here is a representative example of the depiction of the female form in the   th century. And  as you can see  there    something has changed in the way the elite arts appeal to the senses. Indeed  in movements of modernism and post modernism  there was visual art without beauty  literature without narrative and plot  poetry without meter and rhyme  architecture and planning without ornament  human scale  green space and natural light  music without melody and rhythm  and criticism without clarity  attention to aesthetics and insight into the human condition. Let me give just you an example to back up that last statement. But here  there    one of the most famous literary English scholars of our time is the Berkeley professor  Judith Butler. And here is an example of one of her analyses   The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition  convergence and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure  and marked a shift from the form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects ...  Well  you get the idea. By the way  this is one sentence    you can actually parse it. Well  the argument in  The Blank Slate  was that elite art and criticism in the   th century  although not the arts in general  have disdained beauty  pleasure  clarity  insight and style. People are staying away from elite art and criticism. What a puzzle    I wonder why. Well  this turned out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book. Someone asked me whether I stuck it in in order to deflect ire from discussions of gender and Nazism and race and so on. I won't comment on that. But it certainly inspired an energetic reaction from many university professors. Well  the other hot button is parenting. And the starting point is the    for that discussion was the fact that we have all been subject to the advice of the parenting industrial complex. Now  here is    here is a representative quote from a besieged mother   I'm overwhelmed with parenting advice. I'm supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids so I can instill in them a physical fitness habit so they'll grow up to be healthy adults. And I'm supposed to do all kinds of intellectual play so they'll grow up smart. And there are all kinds of play    clay for finger dexterity  word games for reading success  large motor play  small motor play. I feel like I could devote my life to figuring out what to play with my kids.  I think anyone who's recently been a parent can sympathize with this mother. Well  here's some sobering facts about parenting. Most studies of parenting on which this advice is based are useless. They're useless because they don't control for heritability. They measure some correlation between what the parents do  how the children turn out and assume a causal relation  that the parenting shaped the child. Parents who talk a lot to their kids have kids who grow up to be articulate  parents who spank their kids have kids who grow up to be violent and so on. And very few of them control for the possibility that parents pass on genes for    that increase the chances a child will be articulate or violent and so on. Until the studies are redone with adoptive children  who provide an environment but not genes to their kids  we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid. The genetically controlled studies have some sobering results. Remember the Mallifert twins  separated at birth  then they meet in the patent office    remarkably similar. Well  what would have happened if the Mallifert twins had grown up together  You might think  well  then they'd be even more similar  because not only would they share their genes  but they would also share their environment. That would make them super similar  right  Wrong. Identical twins  or any siblings  who are separated at birth are no less similar than if they had grown up together. Everything that happens to you in a given home over all of those years appears to leave no permanent stamp on your personality or intellect. A complementary finding  from a completely different methodology  is that adopted siblings reared together    the mirror image of identical twins reared apart  they share their parents  their home  their neighborhood  don't share their genes    end up not similar at all. OK    two different bodies of research with a similar finding. What it suggests is that children are shaped not by their parents over the long run  but in part    only in part    by their genes  in part by their culture    the culture of the country at large and the children's own culture  namely their peer group    as we heard from Jill Sobule earlier today  that's what kids care about    and  to a very large extent  larger than most people are prepared to acknowledge  by chance  chance events in the wiring of the brain in utero  chance events as you live your life. So let me conclude with just a remark to bring it back to the theme of choices. I think that the sciences of human nature    behavioral genetics  evolutionary psychology  neuroscience  cognitive science    are going to  increasingly in the years to come  upset various dogmas  careers and deeply held political belief systems. And that presents us with a choice. The choice is whether certain facts about humans  or topics  are to be considered taboos  forbidden knowledge  where we shouldn't go there because no good can come from it  or whether we should explore them honestly. I have my own answer to that question  which comes from a great artist of the   th century  Anton Chekhov  who said   Man will become better when you show him what he is like.  And I think that the argument can't be put any more eloquently than that. Thank you very much.,Linguist,200809,6.010654545454546
479,1721,1723,Stewart Brand + Mark Z. Jacobson 2010,Stewart Brand + Mark Z. Jacobson,male,Debate: Does the world need nuclear energy?,Jun 2010,1365,Chris Anderson  We're having a debate. The debate is over the proposition   What the world needs now is nuclear energy.  True or false  And before we have the debate  I'd like to actually take a show of hands    on balance  right now  are you for or against this  So those who are  yes   raise your hand.  For.  Okay  hands down. Those who are against  raise your hands. Okay  I'm reading that at about    to    in favor at the start. Which means we're going to take a vote at the end and see how that shifts  if at all. So here's the format  They're going to have six minutes each  and then after one little  quick exchange between them  I want two people on each side of this debate in the audience to have    seconds to make one short  crisp  pungent  powerful point. So  in favor of the proposition  possibly shockingly  is one of  truly  the founders of the environmental movement  a long standing TEDster  the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog  someone we all know and love  Stewart Brand. Stewart Brand  Whoa. The saying is that with climate  those who know the most are the most worried. With nuclear  those who know the most are the least worried. A classic example is James Hansen  a NASA climatologist pushing for     parts per million carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. He came out with a wonderful book recently called  Storms of My Grandchildren.  And Hansen is hard over for nuclear power  as are most climatologists who are engaging this issue seriously. This is the design situation  a planet that is facing climate change and is now half urban. Look at the client base for this. Five out of six of us live in the developing world. We are moving to cities. We are moving up in the world. And we are educating our kids  having fewer kids  basically good news all around. But we move to cities  toward the bright lights  and one of the things that is there that we want  besides jobs  is electricity. And if it isn't easily gotten  we'll go ahead and steal it. This is one of the most desired things by poor people all over the world  in the cities and in the countryside. Electricity for cities  at its best  is what's called baseload electricity. That's where it is on all the time. And so far there are only three major sources of that    coal and gas  hydro electric  which in most places is maxed out    and nuclear. I would love to have something in the fourth place here  but in terms of constant  clean  scalable energy   solar  and wind and the other renewables aren't there yet because they're inconstant. Nuclear is and has been for    years. Now  from an environmental standpoint  the main thing you want to look at is what happens to the waste from nuclear and from coal  the two major sources of electricity. If all of your electricity in your lifetime came from nuclear  the waste from that lifetime of electricity would go in a Coke can    a pretty heavy Coke can  about two pounds. But one day of coal adds up to one hell of a lot of carbon dioxide in a normal one gigawatt coal fired plant. Then what happens to the waste  The nuclear waste typically goes into a dry cask storage out back of the parking lot at the reactor site because most places don't have underground storage yet. It's just as well  because it can stay where it is. While the carbon dioxide  vast quantities of it  gigatons  goes into the atmosphere where we can't get it back    yet    and where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about. So when you add up the greenhouse gases in the lifetime of these various energy sources  nuclear is down there with wind and hydro  below solar and way below  obviously  all the fossil fuels. Wind is wonderful  I love wind. I love being around these big wind generators. But one of the things we're discovering is that wind  like solar  is an actually relatively dilute source of energy. And so it takes a very large footprint on the land  a very large footprint in terms of materials  five to    times what you'd use for nuclear  and typically to get one gigawatt of electricity is on the order of     square miles of wind farm. In places like Denmark and Germany  they've maxed out on wind already. They've run out of good sites. The power lines are getting overloaded. And you peak out. Likewise  with solar  especially here in California  we're discovering that the    solar farm schemes that are going forward want to basically bulldoze       square miles of southern California desert. Well  as an environmentalist  we would rather that didn't happen. It's okay on frapped out agricultural land. Solar's wonderful on rooftops. But out in the landscape  one gigawatt is on the order of    square miles of bulldozed desert. When you add all these things up    Saul Griffith did the numbers and figured out what would it take to get    clean terawatts of energy from wind  solar and biofuels  and that area would be roughly the size of the United States  an area he refers to as  Renewistan.  A guy who's added it up all this very well is David Mackay  a physicist in England  and in his wonderful book   Sustainable Energy   among other things  he says   I'm not trying to be pro nuclear. I'm just pro arithmetic.  In terms of weapons  the best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy. We have been taking down the Russian warheads  turning it into electricity. Ten percent of American electricity comes from decommissioned warheads. We haven't even started the American stockpile. I think of most interest to a TED audience would be the new generation of reactors that are very small  down around    to     megawatts. This is one from Toshiba. Here's one the Russians are already building that floats on a barge. And that would be very interesting in the developing world. Typically  these things are put in the ground. They're referred to as nuclear batteries. They're incredibly safe  weapons proliferation proof and all the rest of it. Here is a commercial version from New Mexico called the Hyperion  and another one from Oregon called NuScale. Babcock   Wilcox that make nuclear reactors  here's an integral fast reactor. Thorium reactor that Nathan Myhrvold's involved in. The governments of the world are going to have to decide that coals need to be made expensive  and these will go ahead. And here's the future. CA  Okay. Okay. So arguing against  a man who's been at the nitty  gritty heart of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years. In       he discovered that soot was probably the second leading cause of global warming  after CO . His team have been making detailed calculations of the relative impacts of different energy sources. His first time at TED  possibly a disadvantage    we shall see    from Stanford  Professor Mark Jacobson. Good luck. Mark Jacobson  Thank you. So my premise here is that nuclear energy puts out more carbon dioxide  puts out more air pollutants  enhances mortality more and takes longer to put up than real renewable energy systems  namely wind  solar  geothermal power  hydro tidal wave power. And it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation. So let's start just by looking at the CO  emissions from the life cycle. CO e emissions are equivalent emissions of all the greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming and converted to CO . And if you look  wind and concentrated solar have the lowest CO  emissions  if you look at the graph. Nuclear    there are two bars here. One is a low estimate  and one is a high estimate. The low estimate is the nuclear energy industry estimate of nuclear. The high is the average of     scientific  peer reviewed studies. And this is just the CO  from the life cycle. If we look at the delays  it takes between    and    years to put up a nuclear power plant from planning to operation. This includes about three and a half to six years for a site permit. and another two and a half to four years for a construction permit and issue  and then four to nine years for actual construction. And in China  right now  they're putting up five gigawatts of nuclear. And the average  just for the construction time of these  is  .  years on top of any planning times. While you're waiting around for your nuclear  you have to run the regular electric power grid  which is mostly coal in the United States and around the world. And the chart here shows the difference between the emissions from the regular grid  resulting if you use nuclear  or anything else  versus wind  CSP or photovoltaics. Wind takes about two to five years on average  same as concentrated solar and photovoltaics. So the difference is the opportunity cost of using nuclear versus wind  or something else. So if you add these two together  alone  you can see a separation that nuclear puts out at least nine to    times more CO  equivalent emissions than wind energy. And this doesn't even account for the footprint on the ground. If you look at the air pollution health effects  this is the number of deaths per year in      just from vehicle exhaust. Let's say we converted all the vehicles in the United States to battery electric vehicles  hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or flex fuel vehicles run on E  . Well  right now in the United States     to         people die per year from air pollution  and vehicles are about        of those. In       the number will go down to        due to improvements. And so  on the right  you see gasoline emissions  the death rates of     . If you go to corn or cellulosic ethanol  you'd actually increase the death rate slightly. If you go to nuclear  you do get a big reduction  but it's not as much as with wind and concentrated solar. Now if you consider the fact that nuclear weapons proliferation is associated with nuclear energy proliferation  because we know for example  India and Pakistan developed nuclear weapons secretly by enriching uranium in nuclear energy facilities. North Korea did that to some extent. Iran is doing that right now. And Venezuela would be doing it if they started with their nuclear energy facilities. If you do a large scale expansion of nuclear energy across the world  and as a result there was just one nuclear bomb created that was used to destroy a city such as Mumbai or some other big city  megacity  the additional death rates due to this averaged over    years and then scaled to the population of the U.S. would be this. So  do we need this  The next thing is  What about the footprint  Stewart mentioned the footprint. Actually  the footprint on the ground for wind is by far the smallest of any energy source in the world. That  because the footprint  as you can see  is just the pole touching the ground. And you can power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet with        to         five megawatt wind turbines. That would take between one and three square kilometers of footprint on the ground  entirely. The spacing is something else. That's the footprint that is always being confused. People confuse footprint with spacing. As you can see from these pictures  the spacing between can be used for multiple purposes including agricultural land  range land or open space. Over the ocean  it's not even land. Now if we look at nuclear     Laughter  With nuclear  what do we have  We have facilities around there. You also have a buffer zone that's    square kilometers. And you have the uranium mining that you have to deal with. Now if we go to the area  lots is worse than nuclear or wind. For example  cellulosic ethanol  to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet  this is how much land you would need. That's cellulosic  second generation biofuels from prairie grass. Here's corn ethanol. It's smaller. This is based on ranges from data  but if you look at nuclear  it would be the size of Rhode Island to power the U.S. vehicle fleet. For wind  there's a larger area  but much smaller footprint. And of course  with wind  you could put it all over the East Coast  offshore theoretically  or you can split it up. And now  if you go back to looking at geothermal  it's even smaller than both  and solar is slightly larger than the nuclear spacing  but it's still pretty small. And this is to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet. To power the entire world with    percent wind  you would need about one percent of world land. Matching the reliability  base load is actually irrelevant. We want to match the hour by hour power supply. You can do that by combining renewables. This is from real data in California  looking at wind data and solar data. And it considers just using existing hydro to match the hour by hour power demand. Here are the world wind resources. There's five to    times more wind available worldwide than we need for all the world. So then here's the final ranking. And one last slide I just want to show. This is the choice  You can either have wind or nuclear. If you use wind  you guarantee ice will last. Nuclear  the time lag alone will allow the Arctic to melt and other places to melt more. And we can guarantee a clean  blue sky or an uncertain future with nuclear power. CA  All right. So while they're having their comebacks on each other    and yours is slightly short because you slightly overran    I need two people from either side. So if you're for this  if you're for nuclear power  put up two hands. If you're against  put up one. And I want two of each for the mics. Now then  you guys have    you have a minute comeback on him to pick up a point he said  challenge it  whatever. SB  I think a point of difference we're having  Mark  has to do with weapons and energy. These diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow putting out a lot of greenhouse gases    a lot of those studies include   Well of course war will be inevitable and therefore we'll have cities burning and stuff like that   which is kind of finessing it a little bit  I think. The reality is that there's  what     nations that have nuclear power  Of those  seven have nuclear weapons. In every case  they got the weapons before they got the nuclear power. There are two nations  North Korea and Israel  that have nuclear weapons and don't have nuclear power at all. The places that we would most like to have really clean energy occur are China  India  Europe  North America  all of which have sorted out their situation in relation to nuclear weapons. So that leaves a couple of places like Iran  maybe Venezuela  that you would like to have very close surveillance of anything that goes on with fissile stuff. Pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we really know where all of the fissile material is  and we can move toward zero weapons left  once we know all that. CA  Mark     seconds  either on that or on anything Stewart said. MJ  Well we know India and Pakistan had nuclear energy first  and then they developed nuclear weapons secretly in the factories. So the other thing is  we don't need nuclear energy. There's plenty of solar and wind. You can make it reliable  as I showed with that diagram. That's from real data. And this is an ongoing research. This is not rocket science. Solving the world's problems can be done  if you really put your mind to it and use clean  renewable energy. There's absolutely no need for nuclear power. CA  We need someone for. Rod Beckstrom  Thank you Chris. I'm Rod Beckstrom  CEO of ICANN. I've been involved in global warming policy since       when I joined the board of Environmental Defense Fund that was one of the crafters of the Kyoto Protocol. And I want to support Stewart Brand's position. I've come around in the last    years. I used to be against nuclear power. I'm now supporting Stewart's position  softly  from a risk management standpoint  agreeing that the risks of overheating the planet outweigh the risk of nuclear incident  which certainly is possible and is a very real problem. However  I think there may be a win win solution here where both parties can win this debate  and that is  we face a situation where it's carbon caps on this planet or die. And in the United States Senate  we need bipartisan support    only one or two votes are needed    to move global warming through the Senate  and this room can help. So if we get that through  then Mark will solve these problems. Thanks Chris. CA  Thank you Rod Beckstrom. Against. David Fanton  Hi  I'm David Fanton. I just want to say a couple quick things. The first is  be aware of the propaganda. The propaganda from the industry has been very  very strong. And we have not had the other side of the argument fully aired so that people can draw their own conclusions. Be very aware of the propaganda. Secondly  think about this. If we build all these nuclear power plants  all that waste is going to be on hundreds  if not thousands  of trucks and trains  moving through this country every day. Tell me they're not going to have accidents. Tell me that those accidents aren't going to put material into the environment that is poisonous for hundreds of thousands of years. And then tell me that each and every one of those trucks and trains isn't a potential terrorist target. CA  Thank you. For. Anyone else for  Go. Alex  Hi  I'm Alex. I just wanted to say  I'm  first of all  renewable energy's biggest fan. I've got solar PV on my roof. I've got a hydro conversion at a watermill that I own. And I'm  you know  very much  pro  that kind of stuff. However  there's a basic arithmetic problem here. The capability of the sun shining  the wind blowing and the rain falling  simply isn't enough to add up. So if we want to keep the lights on  we actually need a solution which is going to keep generating all of the time. I campaigned against nuclear weapons in the '  s  and I continue to do so now. But we've got an opportunity to recycle them into something more useful that enables us to get energy all of the time. And  ultimately  the arithmetic problem isn't going to go away. We're not going to get enough energy from renewables alone. We need a solution that generates all of the time. If we're going to keep the lights on  nuclear is that solution. CA  Thank you. Anyone else against  Man  The last person who was in favor made the premise that we don't have enough alternative renewable resources. And our  against  proponent up here made it very clear that we actually do. And so the fallacy that we need this resource and we can actually make it in a time frame that is meaningful is not possible. I will also add one other thing. Ray Kurzweil and all the other talks    we know that the stick is going up exponentially. So you can't look at state of the art technologies in renewables and say   That's all we have.  Because five years from now  it will blow you away what we'll actually have as alternatives to this horrible  disastrous nuclear power. CA  Point well made. Thank you. So each of you has really just a couple sentences       seconds each to sum up. Your final pitch  Stewart. SB  I loved your  It all balances out  chart that you had there. It was a sunny day and a windy night. And just now in England they had a cold spell. All of the wind in the entire country shut down for a week. None of those things were stirring. And as usual  they had to buy nuclear power from France. Two gigawatts comes through the Chunnel. This keeps happening. I used to worry about the        year factor. And the fact is  we're going to use the nuclear waste we have for fuel in the fourth generation of reactors that are coming along. And especially the small reactors need to go forward. I heard from Nathan Myhrvold    and I think here's the action point    it'll take an act of Congress to make the Nuclear Regulatory Commission start moving quickly on these small reactors  which we need very much  here and in the world. MJ  So we've analyzed the hour by hour power demand and supply  looking at solar  wind  using data for California. And you can match that demand  hour by hour  for the whole year almost. Now  with regard to the resources  we've developed the first wind map of the world  from data alone  at    meters. We know what the wind resources are. You can cover    percent. Fifteen percent of the entire U.S. has wind at fast enough speeds to be cost competitive. And there's much more solar than there is wind. There's plenty of resource. You can make it reliable. CA  Okay. So  thank you  Mark. So if you were in Palm Springs ... Shameless. Shameless. Shameless. So  people of the TED community  I put it to you that what the world needs now is nuclear energy. All those in favor  raise your hands. And all those against. Ooooh. Now that is    my take on that ... Just put up ... Hands up  people who changed their minds during the debate  who voted differently. Those of you who changed your mind in favor of  for  put your hands up. Okay. So here's the read on it. Both people won supporters  but on my count  the mood of the TED community shifted from about    to    to about    to    in favor  in favor. You both won. I congratulate both of you. Thank you for that.,,201006,5.806625141562855
484,1857,1859,Susan Savage-Rumbaugh 2007,Susan Savage-Rumbaugh,female,The gentle genius of bonobos,Apr 2007,1031,I work with a species called  Bonobo.  And I'm happy most of the time  because I think this is the happiest species on the planet. It's kind of a well kept secret. This species lives only in the Congo. And they're not in too many zoos  because of their sexual behavior. Their sexual behavior is too human like for most of us to be comfortable with. But    actually  we have a lot to learn from them  because they're a very egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society. And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside. It permeates their entire life. And it's used for communication. And it's used for conflict resolution. And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of  divided our lives up into lots of parts. We divided our world up with lots of categories. And so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit. But I don't think that we were that way initially. There are many people who think that the animal world is hard wired and that there's something very  very special about man. Maybe it's his ability to have causal thought. Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to have language. Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics. Well  I don't know. There were Tasmanians who were discovered around the     s and they had no fire. They had no stone tools. To our knowledge they had no music. So when you compare them to the Bonobo  the Bonobo is a little hairier. He doesn't stand quite as upright. But there are a lot of similarities. And I think that as we look at culture  we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are. And I don't really think it's in our biology  I think we've attributed it to our biology  but I don't really think it's there. So what I want to do now is introduce you to a species called the Bonobo. This is Kanzi. He's a Bonobo. Right now  he's in a forest in Georgia. His mother originally came from a forest in Africa. And she came to us when she was just at puberty  about six or seven years of age. Now this shows a Bonobo on your right  and a chimpanzee on your left. Clearly  the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking. The Bonobo  although shorter than us and their arms still longer  is more upright  just as we are. This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy. As you can see  there's not a lot of difference between the way a Bonobo walks and the way an early australopithecine would have walked. As they turn toward us you'll see that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter and doesn't have to rotate quite so much from side to side. So the    the bipedal gait is a little easier. And now we see all four. Video  Narrator  The wild Bonobo lives in central Africa  in the jungle encircled by the Congo River. Canopied trees as tall as    meters      feet  grow densely in the area. It was a Japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo  almost three decades ago. Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee. Slim bodied  Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures. Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them. One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally. What's more  they are able to walk upright for long distances. Susan Savage Rumbaugh  video   Let's go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame. SS  This is Kanzi and I  in the forest. None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained. None of them are tricks. They all happened to be captured on film spontaneously  by NHK of Japan. We have eight Bonobos. Video  Look at all this stuff that's here for our campfire. SS  An entire family at our research centre. Video  You going to help get some sticks  Good. We need more sticks  too. I have a lighter in my pocket if you need one. That's a wasps' nest. You can get it out. I hope I have a lighter. You can use the lighter to start the fire. SS  So Kanzi is very interested in fire. He doesn't do it yet without a lighter  but I think if he saw someone do it  he might be able to do    make a fire without a lighter. He's learning about how to keep a fire going. He's learning the uses for a fire  just by watching what we do with fire. This is a smile on the face of a Bonobo. These are happy vocalizations. Video  You're happy. You're very happy about this part. You've got to put some water on the fire. You see the water  Good job. SS  Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack. But he likes to carry things from place to place. Video  Austin  I hear you saying  Austin.  SS  He talks to other Bonobos at the lab  long distance  farther than we can hear. This is his sister. This is her first time to try to drive a golf cart. Video  Goodbye. SS  She's got the pedals down  but not the wheel. She switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel  rather than turns it. Like us  she knows that that individual in the mirror is her. Video  Narrator  By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human  and documenting their development across two decades  scientists are exploring how cultural forces may have operated during human evolution. His name is Nyota. It means  star  in Swahili. Panbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors. In the wild  the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring. Here Panbanisha uses scissors  instead of her hands  to groom Nyota. Very impressive. Subtle maneuvering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this. Nyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself. Realizing that Nyota might get hurt  Panbanisha  like any human mother  carefully tugs to get the scissors back. He can now cut through tough animal hide. SS  Kanzi's learned to make stone tools. Video  Kanzi now makes his tools  just as our ancestors may have made them  two and a half million years ago    by holding the rocks in both hands  to strike one against the other. He has learned that by using both hands and aiming his glancing blows  he can make much larger  sharper flakes. Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough. The tough hide is difficult to cut  even with a knife. The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making  but difficult to handle  requiring great skill. Kanzi's rock is from Gona  Ethiopia and is identical to that used by our African ancestors two and a half million years ago. These are the rocks Kanzi used and these are the flakes he made. The flat sharp edges are like knife blades. Compare them to the tools our ancestors used  they bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi's. Panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods. She keeps staring out the window. SS  This is    let me show you something we didn't think they would do. Video  For several days now  Panbanisha has not been outside. SS  I normally talk about language. Video  Then Panbanisha does something unexpected. SS  But since I'm advised not to do what I normally do  I haven't told you that these apes have language. It's a geometric language. Video  She takes a piece of chalk and begins writing something on the floor. What is she writing  SS  She's also saying the name of that  with her voice. Video  Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again. SS  These are her symbols on her keyboard. They speak when she touches them. Video  Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go.  A frame  represents a hut in the woods. Compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard. Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor. SS  video   Very nice. Beautiful  Panbanisha. SS  At first we didn't really realize what she was doing  until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it. Video  This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods. The curved line is very similar to the lexigram. The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents  collar.  It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out. SS  That's an institutional requirement. Video  This symbol is not as clear as the others  but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line and several straight lines. Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said  by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk. Panbanisha watched. Soon she began to write as well. The Bonobo's abilities have stunned scientists around the world. How did they develop  SS  video   We found that the most important thing for permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them. It's simply to use language around them  because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others  that are important to you  are saying to you. Once you have that capacity  the ability to produce language comes rather naturally and rather freely. So we want to create an environment in which Bonobos  like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting    we want to create an environment in which they have fun  and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them. Narrator  This environment brings out unexpected potential in Kanzi and Panbanisha. Panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica  until Nyota  now one year old  steals it. Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth. Is he looking for where the sound came from  Dr. Sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity to flourish. This time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano. She wasn't forced to learn the piano  she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest. Researcher  Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm listening. Do that real fast part that you did. Yeah  that part. Narrator  Kanzi plays the xylophone  using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr. Sue's singing. Kanzi and Panbanisha are stimulated by this fun filled environment  which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities. Researcher  OK  now get the monsters. Get them. Take the cherries too. Now watch out  stay away from them now. Now you can chase them again. Time to chase them. Now you have to stay away. Get away. Run away. Run. Now we can chase them again. Go get them. Oh no  Good Kanzi. Very good. Thank you so much. Narrator  None of us  Bonobo or human  can possibly even imagine  SS  So we have a bi species environment  we call it a  panhomoculture.  We're learning how to become like them. We're learning how to communicate with them  in really high pitched tones. We're learning that they probably have a language in the wild. And they're learning to become like us. Because we believe that it's not biology  it's culture. So we're sharing tools and technology and language with another species.

494,1122,1124,Tim Harford 2016,Tim Harford,male,How frustration can make us more creative,Jan 2016,927,Late in January       a    year old German girl called Vera Brandes walked out onto the stage of the Cologne Opera House. The auditorium was empty. It was lit only by the dim  green glow of the emergency exit sign. This was the most exciting day of Vera's life. She was the youngest concert promoter in Germany  and she had persuaded the Cologne Opera House to host a late night concert of jazz from the American musician  Keith Jarrett.       people were coming. And in just a few hours  Jarrett would walk out on the same stage  he'd sit down at the piano and without rehearsal or sheet music  he would begin to play. But right now  Vera was introducing Keith to the piano in question  and it wasn't going well. Jarrett looked to the instrument a little warily  played a few notes  walked around it  played a few more notes  muttered something to his producer. Then the producer came over to Vera and said ...  If you don't get a new piano  Keith can't play.  There'd been a mistake. The opera house had provided the wrong instrument. This one had this harsh  tinny upper register  because all the felt had worn away. The black notes were sticking  the white notes were out of tune  the pedals didn't work and the piano itself was just too small. It wouldn't create the volume that would fill a large space such as the Cologne Opera House. So Keith Jarrett left. He went and sat outside in his car  leaving Vera Brandes to get on the phone to try to find a replacement piano. Now she got a piano tuner  but she couldn't get a new piano. And so she went outside and she stood there in the rain  talking to Keith Jarrett  begging him not to cancel the concert. And he looked out of his car at this bedraggled  rain drenched German teenager  took pity on her  and said   Never forget ... only for you.  And so a few hours later  Jarrett did indeed step out onto the stage of the opera house  he sat down at the unplayable piano and began. Within moments it became clear that something magical was happening. Jarrett was avoiding those upper registers  he was sticking to the middle tones of the keyboard  which gave the piece a soothing  ambient quality. But also  because the piano was so quiet  he had to set up these rumbling  repetitive riffs in the bass. And he stood up twisting  pounding down on the keys  desperately trying to create enough volume to reach the people in the back row. It's an electrifying performance. It somehow has this peaceful quality  and at the same time it's full of energy  it's dynamic. And the audience loved it. Audiences continue to love it because the recording of the K ln Concert is the best selling piano album in history and the best selling solo jazz album in history. Keith Jarrett had been handed a mess. He had embraced that mess  and it soared. But let's think for a moment about Jarrett's initial instinct. He didn't want to play. Of course  I think any of us  in any remotely similar situation  would feel the same way  we'd have the same instinct. We don't want to be asked to do good work with bad tools. We don't want to have to overcome unnecessary hurdles. But Jarrett's instinct was wrong  and thank goodness he changed his mind. And I think our instinct is also wrong. I think we need to gain a bit more appreciation for the unexpected advantages of having to cope with a little mess. So let me give you some examples from cognitive psychology  from complexity science  from social psychology  and of course  rock 'n' roll. So cognitive psychology first. We've actually known for a while that certain kinds of difficulty  certain kinds of obstacle  can actually improve our performance. For example  the psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer  a few years ago  teamed up with high school teachers. And he asked them to reformat the handouts that they were giving to some of their classes. So the regular handout would be formatted in something straightforward  such as Helvetica or Times New Roman. But half these classes were getting handouts that were formatted in something sort of intense  like Haettenschweiler  or something with a zesty bounce  like Comic Sans italicized. Now  these are really ugly fonts  and they're difficult fonts to read. But at the end of the semester  students were given exams  and the students who'd been asked to read the more difficult fonts  had actually done better on their exams  in a variety of subjects. And the reason is  the difficult font had slowed them down  forced them to work a bit harder  to think a bit more about what they were reading  to interpret it ... and so they learned more. Another example. The psychologist Shelley Carson has been testing Harvard undergraduates for the quality of their attentional filters. What do I mean by that  What I mean is  imagine you're in a restaurant  you're having a conversation  there are all kinds of other conversations going on in the restaurant  you want to filter them out  you want to focus on what's important to you. Can you do that  If you can  you have good  strong attentional filters. But some people really struggle with that. Some of Carson's undergraduate subjects struggled with that. They had weak filters  they had porous filters    let a lot of external information in. And so what that meant is they were constantly being interrupted by the sights and the sounds of the world around them. If there was a television on while they were doing their essays  they couldn't screen it out. Now  you would think that that was a disadvantage ... but no. When Carson looked at what these students had achieved  the ones with the weak filters were vastly more likely to have some real creative milestone in their lives  to have published their first novel  to have released their first album. These distractions were actually grists to their creative mill. They were able to think outside the box because their box was full of holes. Let's talk about complexity science. So how do you solve a really complex    the world's full of complicated problems    how do you solve a really complicated problem  For example  you try to make a jet engine. There are lots and lots of different variables  the operating temperature  the materials  all the different dimensions  the shape. You can't solve that kind of problem all in one go  it's too hard. So what do you do  Well  one thing you can do is try to solve it step by step. So you have some kind of prototype and you tweak it  you test it  you improve it. You tweak it  you test it  you improve it. Now  this idea of marginal gains will eventually get you a good jet engine. And it's been quite widely implemented in the world. So you'll hear about it  for example  in high performance cycling  web designers will talk about trying to optimize their web pages  they're looking for these step by step gains. That's a good way to solve a complicated problem. But you know what would make it a better way  A dash of mess. You add randomness  early on in the process  you make crazy moves  you try stupid things that shouldn't work  and that will tend to make the problem solving work better. And the reason for that is the trouble with the step by step process  the marginal gains  is they can walk you gradually down a dead end. And if you start with the randomness  that becomes less likely  and your problem solving becomes more robust. Let's talk about social psychology. So the psychologist Katherine Phillips  with some colleagues  recently gave murder mystery problems to some students  and these students were collected in groups of four and they were given dossiers with information about a crime    alibis and evidence  witness statements and three suspects. And the groups of four students were asked to figure out who did it  who committed the crime. And there were two treatments in this experiment. In some cases these were four friends  they all knew each other well. In other cases  three friends and a stranger. And you can see where I'm going with this. Obviously I'm going to say that the groups with the stranger solved the problem more effectively  which is true  they did. Actually  they solved the problem quite a lot more effectively. So the groups of four friends  they only had a       chance of getting the answer right. Which is actually not that great    in multiple choice  for three answers       's not good. The three friends and the stranger  even though the stranger didn't have any extra information  even though it was just a case of how that changed the conversation to accommodate that awkwardness  the three friends and the stranger  they had a    percent chance of finding the right answer. That's quite a big leap in performance. But I think what's really interesting is not just that the three friends and the stranger did a better job  but how they felt about it. So when Katherine Phillips interviewed the groups of four friends  they had a nice time  they also thought they'd done a good job. They were complacent. When she spoke to the three friends and the stranger  they had not had a nice time    it's actually rather difficult  it's rather awkward ... and they were full of doubt. They didn't think they'd done a good job even though they had. And I think that really exemplifies the challenge that we're dealing with here. Because  yeah    the ugly font  the awkward stranger  the random move ... these disruptions help us solve problems  they help us become more creative. But we don't feel that they're helping us. We feel that they're getting in the way ... and so we resist. And that's why the last example is really important. So I want to talk about somebody from the background of the world of rock 'n' roll. And you may know him  he's actually a TED ster. His name is Brian Eno. He is an ambient composer    rather brilliant. He's also a kind of catalyst behind some of the great rock 'n' roll albums of the last    years. He's worked with David Bowie on  Heroes   he worked with U  on  Achtung Baby  and  The Joshua Tree   he's worked with DEVO  he's worked with Coldplay  he's worked with everybody. And what does he do to make these great rock bands better  Well  he makes a mess. He disrupts their creative processes. It's his role to be the awkward stranger. It's his role to tell them that they have to play the unplayable piano. And one of the ways in which he creates this disruption is through this remarkable deck of cards    I have my signed copy here    thank you  Brian. They're called The Oblique Strategies  he developed them with a friend of his. And when they're stuck in the studio  Brian Eno will reach for one of the cards. He'll draw one at random  and he'll make the band follow the instructions on the card. So this one ...  Change instrument roles.  Yeah  everyone swap instruments    Drummer on the piano    Brilliant  brilliant idea.  Look closely at the most  embarrassing details. Amplify them.   Make a sudden  destructive  unpredictable action. Incorporate.  These cards are disruptive. Now  they've proved their worth in album after album. The musicians hate them. So Phil Collins was playing drums on an early Brian Eno album. He got so frustrated he started throwing beer cans across the studio. Carlos Alomar  great rock guitarist  working with Eno on David Bowie's  Lodger  album  and at one point he turns to Brian and says   Brian  this experiment is stupid.  But the thing is it was a pretty good album  but also  Carlos Alomar     years later  now uses The Oblique Strategies. And he tells his students to use The Oblique Strategies because he's realized something. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it isn't helping you. The strategies actually weren't a deck of cards originally  they were just a list    list on the recording studio wall. A checklist of things you might try if you got stuck. The list didn't work. Know why  Not messy enough. Your eye would go down the list and it would settle on whatever was the least disruptive  the least troublesome  which of course misses the point entirely. And what Brian Eno came to realize was  yes  we need to run the stupid experiments  we need to deal with the awkward strangers  we need to try to read the ugly fonts. These things help us. They help us solve problems  they help us be more creative. But also ... we really need some persuasion if we're going to accept this. So however we do it ... whether it's sheer willpower  whether it's the flip of a card or whether it's a guilt trip from a German teenager  all of us  from time to time  need to sit down and try and play the unplayable piano.

495,2005,2007,Tim Harford 2011,Tim Harford,male,"Trial, error and the God complex",Jul 2011,1064,It's the Second World War. A German prison camp. And this man  Archie Cochrane  is a prisoner of war and a doctor  and he has a problem. The problem is that the men under his care are suffering from an excruciating and debilitating condition that Archie doesn't really understand. The symptoms are this horrible swelling up of fluids under the skin. But he doesn't know whether it's an infection  whether it's to do with malnutrition. He doesn't know how to cure it. And he's operating in a hostile environment. And people do terrible things in wars. The German camp guards  they've got bored. They've taken to just firing into the prison camp at random for fun. On one particular occasion  one of the guards threw a grenade into the prisoners' lavatory while it was full of prisoners. He said he heard suspicious laughter. And Archie Cochrane  as the camp doctor  was one of the first men in to clear up the mess. And one more thing  Archie was suffering from this illness himself. So the situation seemed pretty desperate. But Archie Cochrane was a resourceful person. He'd already smuggled vitamin C into the camp  and now he managed to get hold of supplies of marmite on the black market. Now some of you will be wondering what marmite is. Marmite is a breakfast spread beloved of the British. It looks like crude oil. It tastes ... zesty. And importantly  it's a rich source of vitamin B  . So Archie splits the men under his care as best he can into two equal groups. He gives half of them vitamin C. He gives half of them vitamin B  . He very carefully and meticulously notes his results in an exercise book. And after just a few days  it becomes clear that whatever is causing this illness  marmite is the cure. So Cochrane then goes to the Germans who are running the prison camp. Now you've got to imagine at the moment    forget this photo  imagine this guy with this long ginger beard and this shock of red hair. He hasn't been able to shave    a sort of Billy Connolly figure. Cochrane  he starts ranting at these Germans in this Scottish accent    in fluent German  by the way  but in a Scottish accent    and explains to them how German culture was the culture that gave Schiller and Goethe to the world. And he can't understand how this barbarism can be tolerated  and he vents his frustrations. And then he goes back to his quarters  breaks down and weeps because he's convinced that the situation is hopeless. But a young German doctor picks up Archie Cochrane's exercise book and says to his colleagues   This evidence is incontrovertible. If we don't supply vitamins to the prisoners  it's a war crime.  And the next morning  supplies of vitamin B   are delivered to the camp  and the prisoners begin to recover. Now I'm not telling you this story because I think Archie Cochrane is a dude  although Archie Cochrane is a dude. I'm not even telling you the story because I think we should be running more carefully controlled randomized trials in all aspects of public policy  although I think that would also be completely awesome. I'm telling you this story because Archie Cochrane  all his life  fought against a terrible affliction  and he realized it was debilitating to individuals and it was corrosive to societies. And he had a name for it. He called it the God complex. Now I can describe the symptoms of the God complex very  very easily. So the symptoms of the complex are  no matter how complicated the problem  you have an absolutely overwhelming belief that you are infallibly right in your solution. Now Archie was a doctor  so he hung around with doctors a lot. And doctors suffer from the God complex a lot. Now I'm an economist  I'm not a doctor  but I see the God complex around me all the time in my fellow economists. I see it in our business leaders. I see it in the politicians we vote for    people who  in the face of an incredibly complicated world  are nevertheless absolutely convinced that they understand the way that the world works. And you know  with the future billions that we've been hearing about  the world is simply far too complex to understand in that way. Well let me give you an example. Imagine for a moment that  instead of Tim Harford in front of you  there was Hans Rosling presenting his graphs. You know Hans  the Mick Jagger of TED. And he'd be showing you these amazing statistics  these amazing animations. And they are brilliant  it's wonderful work. But a typical Hans Rosling graph  think for a moment  not what it shows  but think instead about what it leaves out. So it'll show you GDP per capita  population  longevity  that's about it. So three pieces of data for each country    three pieces of data. Three pieces of data is nothing. I mean  have a look at this graph. This is produced by the physicist Cesar Hidalgo. He's at MIT. Now you won't be able to understand a word of it  but this is what it looks like. Cesar has trolled the database of over       different products  and he's used techniques of network analysis to interrogate this database and to graph relationships between the different products. And it's wonderful  wonderful work. You show all these interconnections  all these interrelations. And I think it'll be profoundly useful in understanding how it is that economies grow. Brilliant work. Cesar and I tried to write a piece for The New York Times Magazine explaining how this works. And what we learned is Cesar's work is far too good to explain in The New York Times Magazine. Five thousand products    that's still nothing. Five thousand products    imagine counting every product category in Cesar Hidalgo's data. Imagine you had one second per product category. In about the length of this session  you would have counted all      . Now imagine doing the same thing for every different type of product on sale in Walmart. There are         there. It would take you all day. Now imagine trying to count every different specific product and service on sale in a major economy such as Tokyo  London or New York. It's even more difficult in Edinburgh because you have to count all the whisky and the tartan. If you wanted to count every product and service on offer in New York    there are    billion of them    it would take you     years. This is how complex the economy we've created is. And I'm just counting toasters here. I'm not trying to solve the Middle East problem. The complexity here is unbelievable. And just a piece of context    the societies in which our brains evolved had about     products and services. You could count them in five minutes. So this is the complexity of the world that surrounds us. This perhaps is why we find the God complex so tempting. We tend to retreat and say   We can draw a picture  we can post some graphs  we get it  we understand how this works.  And we don't. We never do. Now I'm not trying to deliver a nihilistic message here. I'm not trying to say we can't solve complicated problems in a complicated world. We clearly can. But the way we solve them is with humility    to abandon the God complex and to actually use a problem solving technique that works. And we have a problem solving technique that works. Now you show me a successful complex system  and I will show you a system that has evolved through trial and error. Here's an example. This baby was produced through trial and error. I realize that's an ambiguous statement. Maybe I should clarify it. This baby is a human body  it evolved. What is evolution  Over millions of years  variation and selection  variation and selection    trial and error  trial and error. And it's not just biological systems that produce miracles through trial and error. You could use it in an industrial context. So let's say you wanted to make detergent. Let's say you're Unilever and you want to make detergent in a factory near Liverpool. How do you do it  Well you have this great big tank full of liquid detergent. You pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle. You create a spray of detergent. Then the spray dries. It turns into powder. It falls to the floor. You scoop it up. You put it in cardboard boxes. You sell it at a supermarket. You make lots of money. How do you design that nozzle  It turns out to be very important. Now if you ascribe to the God complex  what you do is you find yourself a little God. You find yourself a mathematician  you find yourself a physicist    somebody who understands the dynamics of this fluid. And he will  or she will  calculate the optimal design of the nozzle. Now Unilever did this and it didn't work    too complicated. Even this problem  too complicated. But the geneticist Professor Steve Jones describes how Unilever actually did solve this problem    trial and error  variation and selection. You take a nozzle and you create    random variations on the nozzle. You try out all     you keep the one that works best. You create    variations on that one. You try out all   . You keep the one that works best. You try out    variations on that one. You see how this works  right  And after    generations  you have this incredible nozzle. It looks a bit like a chess piece    functions absolutely brilliantly. We have no idea why it works  no idea at all. And the moment you step back from the God complex    let's just try to have a bunch of stuff  let's have a systematic way of determining what's working and what's not    you can solve your problem. Now this process of trial and error is actually far more common in successful institutions than we care to recognize. And we've heard a lot about how economies function. The U.S. economy is still the world's greatest economy. How did it become the world's greatest economy  I could give you all kinds of facts and figures about the U.S. economy  but I think the most salient one is this  ten percent of American businesses disappear every year. That is a huge failure rate. It's far higher than the failure rate of  say  Americans. Ten percent of Americans don't disappear every year. Which leads us to conclude American businesses fail faster than Americans  and therefore American businesses are evolving faster than Americans. And eventually  they'll have evolved to such a high peak of perfection that they will make us all their pets    if  of course  they haven't already done so. I sometimes wonder. But it's this process of trial and error that explains this great divergence  this incredible performance of Western economies. It didn't come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge. It's come through trial and error. Now I've been sort of banging on about this for the last couple of months  and people sometimes say to me   Well Tim  it's kind of obvious. Obviously trial and error is very important. Obviously experimentation is very important. Now why are you just wandering around saying this obvious thing   So I say  okay  fine. You think it's obvious  I will admit it's obvious when schools start teaching children that there are some problems that don't have a correct answer. Stop giving them lists of questions every single one of which has an answer. And there's an authority figure in the corner behind the teacher's desk who knows all the answers. And if you can't find the answers  you must be lazy or stupid. When schools stop doing that all the time  I will admit that  yes  it's obvious that trial and error is a good thing. When a politician stands up campaigning for elected office and says   I want to fix our health system. I want to fix our education system. I have no idea how to do it. I have half a dozen ideas. We're going to test them out. They'll probably all fail. Then we'll test some other ideas out. We'll find some that work. We'll build on those. We'll get rid of the ones that don't.     when a politician campaigns on that platform  and more importantly  when voters like you and me are willing to vote for that kind of politician  then I will admit that it is obvious that trial and error works  and that    thank you. Until then  until then I'm going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the God complex. Because it's so hard to admit our own fallibility. It's so uncomfortable. And Archie Cochrane understood this as well as anybody. There's this one trial he ran many years after World War II. He wanted to test out the question of  where is it that patients should recover from heart attacks  Should they recover in a specialized cardiac unit in hospital  or should they recover at home  All the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down. They had the God complex in spades. They knew that their hospitals were the right place for patients  and they knew it was very unethical to run any kind of trial or experiment. Nevertheless  Archie managed to get permission to do this. He ran his trial. And after the trial had been running for a little while  he gathered together all his colleagues around his table  and he said   Well  gentlemen  we have some preliminary results. They're not statistically significant. But we have something. And it turns out that you're right and I'm wrong. It is dangerous for patients to recover from heart attacks at home. They should be in hospital.  And there's this uproar  and all the doctors start pounding the table and saying   We always said you were unethical  Archie. You're killing people with your clinical trials. You need to shut it down now. Shut it down at once.  And there's this huge hubbub. Archie lets it die down. And then he says   Well that's very interesting  gentlemen  because when I gave you the table of results  I swapped the two columns around. It turns out your hospitals are killing people  and they should be at home. Would you like to close down the trial now  or should we wait until we have robust results   Tumbleweed rolls through the meeting room. But Cochrane would do that kind of thing. And the reason he would do that kind of thing is because he understood it feels so much better to stand there and say   Here in my own little world  I am a god  I understand everything. I do not want to have my opinions challenged. I do not want to have my conclusions tested.  It feels so much more comfortable simply to lay down the law. Cochrane understood that uncertainty  that fallibility  that being challenged  they hurt. And you sometimes need to be shocked out of that. Now I'm not going to pretend that this is easy. It isn't easy. It's incredibly painful. And since I started talking about this subject and researching this subject  I've been really haunted by something a Japanese mathematician said on the subject. So shortly after the war  this young man  Yutaka Taniyama  developed this amazing conjecture called the Taniyama Shimura Conjecture. It turned out to be absolutely instrumental many decades later in proving Fermat's Last Theorem. In fact  it turns out it's equivalent to proving Fermat's Last Theorem. You prove one  you prove the other. But it was always a conjecture. Taniyama tried and tried and tried and he could never prove that it was true. And shortly before his   th birthday in       Yutaka Taniyama killed himself. His friend  Goro Shimura    who worked on the mathematics with him    many decades later  reflected on Taniyama's life. He said   He was not a very careful person as a mathematician. He made a lot of mistakes. But he made mistakes in a good direction. I tried to emulate him  but I realized it is very difficult to make good mistakes.  Thank you.,"Economist, journalist and broadcaster",201107,5.6791508052708615
496,1221,1223,Tod Machover + Dan Ellsey 2008,Tod Machover + Dan Ellsey,male,Inventing instruments that unlock new music,Apr 2008,1218,The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal. It means a lot to us. But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it  but you make it yourself. So  that's my first idea. And we all know about the Mozart effect    the idea that's been around for the last five to    years    that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby  in utero   that it'll raise our IQ points            percent. Great idea  but it doesn't work at all. So  you can't just listen to music  you have to make it somehow. And I'd add to that  that it's not just making it  but everybody  each of us  everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way  and that's one of the main parts of my work. So  with the MIT Media Lab  for quite a while now  we've been engaged in a field called active music. What are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience  not just listening  but making music  And we started by making instruments for some of the world's greatest performers    we call these hyperinstruments    for Yo Yo Ma  Peter Gabriel  Prince  orchestras  rock bands. Instruments where they're all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument  so the instrument knows how it's being played. And just by changing the interpretation and the feeling  I can turn my cello into a voice  or into a whole orchestra  or into something that nobody has ever heard before. When we started making these  I started thinking  why can't we make wonderful instruments like that for everybody  people who aren't fantastic Yo Yo Mas or Princes  So  we've made a whole series of instruments. One of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera. It's a whole orchestra of about     instruments  all designed for anybody to play using natural skill. So  you can play a video game  drive through a piece of music  use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound  touch a special surface to make melodies  use your voice to make a whole aura. And when we make the Brain Opera  we invite the public to come in  to try these instruments and then collaborate with us to help make each performance of the Brain Opera. We toured that for a long time. It is now permanently in Vienna  where we built a museum around it. And that led to something which you probably do know. Guitar Hero came out of our lab  and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface  people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music  and playing it over and over and over again. So  the model works  but it's only the tip of the iceberg  because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want to make music in something like Guitar Hero. And music is very fun  but it's also transformative. It's very  very important. Music can change your life  more than almost anything. It can change the way you communicate with others  it can change your body  it can change your mind. So  we're trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero. We are very involved in education. We have a long term project called Toy Symphony  where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive  but for little kids  so the kids will fall in love with making music  want to spend their time doing it  and then will demand to know how it works  how to make more  how to create. So  we make squeezy instruments  like these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers  Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms    they gather your rhythm  and like hot potato  you send your rhythm to your friends  who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing    and a software package called Hyperscore  which lets anybody use lines and color to make quite sophisticated music. Extremely easy to use  but once you use it  you can go quite deep    music in any style. And then  by pressing a button  it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces. We've had good enough  really  very powerful effects with kids around the world  and now people of all ages  using Hyperscore. So  we've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activities in a much broader context  for all kinds of people who don't usually have the opportunity to make music. So  one of the growing fields that we're working on at the Media Lab right now is music  mind and health. A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called  Musicophilia . It's on sale in the bookstore. It's a great book. If you haven't seen it  it's worth reading. He's a pianist himself  and he details his whole career of looking at and observing incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples' lives in unusual situations. So we know  for instance  that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to. Maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones  you can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror  or can't tell anyone in their family  but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing. And with that you can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities. Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes  movement to people with Parkinson's disease. It's very powerful for depression  schizophrenia  many  many things. So  we're working on understanding those underlying principles and then building activities which will let music really improve people's health. And we do this in many ways. We work with many different hospitals. One of them is right near Boston  called Tewksbury Hospital. It's a long term state hospital  where several years ago we started working with Hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities. This has become a central part of the treatment at Tewksbury hospital  so everybody there clamors to work on musical activities. It's the activity that seems to accelerate people's treatment the most and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community. I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on. Video  They're manipulating each other's rhythms. It's a real experience  not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms  but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group. To get their hands on music  to shape it themselves  change it  to experiment with it  to make their own music. So Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly. Everybody can experience music in a profound way  we just have to make different tools. The third idea I want to share with you is that music  paradoxically  I think even more than words  is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are. I love giving talks  although strangely I feel more nervous giving talks than playing music. If I were here playing cello  or playing on a synth  or sharing my music with you  I'd be able to show things about myself that I can't tell you in words  more personal things  perhaps deeper things. I think that's true for many of us  and I want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have  from ourselves to the outside world. The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now  called Death and the Powers. And it's a big opera  one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now. And it's about a man  rich  successful  powerful  who wants to live forever. So  he figures out a way to download himself into his environment  actually into a series of books. So this guy wants to live forever  he downloads himself into his environment. The main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera and the entire stage becomes the main character. It becomes his legacy. And the opera is about what we can share  what we can pass on to others  to the people we love  and what we can't. Every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument  like this chandelier. It takes up the whole stage. It looks like a chandelier  but it's actually a robotic music instrument. So  as you can see in this prototype  gigantic piano strings  each string is controlled with a little robotic element    either little bows that stroke the strings  propellers that tickle the strings  acoustic signals that vibrate the strings. We also have an army of robots on stage. These robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character  Simon Powers  and his family. There are a whole series of them  kind of like a Greek chorus. They observe the action. We've designed these square robots that we're testing right now at MIT called OperaBots. These OperaBots follow my music. They follow the characters. They're smart enough  we hope  not to bump into each other. They go off on their own. And then they can also  when you snap  line up exactly the way you'd like to. Even though they're cubes  they actually have a lot of personality. The largest set piece in the opera is called The System. It's a series of books. Every single book is robotic  so they all move  they all make sound  and when you put them all together  they turn into these walls  which have the gesture and the personality of Simon Powers. So he's disappeared  but the whole physical environment becomes this person. This is how he's chosen to represent himself. The books also have high packed LEDs on the spines. So it's all display. And here's the great baritone James Maddalena as he enters The System. This is a sneak preview. This premieres in Monaco    it's in September     . If by any chance you can't make it  another idea with this project    here's this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form  through music and through the environment. But we're also making this available both online and in public spaces  as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love. So instead of being grand opera  this opera will turn into what we're thinking of as personal opera. And  if you're going to make a personal opera  what about a personal instrument  Everything I've shown you so far    whether it's a hyper cello for Yo Yo Ma or squeezy toy for a child    the instruments stayed the same and are valuable for a certain class of person  a virtuoso  a child. But what if I could make an instrument that could be adapted to the way I personally behave  to the way my hands work  to what I do very skillfully  perhaps  to what I don't do so skillfully  I think that this is the future of interface  it's the future of music  the future of instruments. And I'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage  so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like. So  can you give a hand to Adam Boulanger  Ph.D. student from the MIT Media Lab  and Dan Ellsey. Dan  thanks to TED and to Bombardier Flexjet  Dan is here with us today all the way from Tewksbury. He's a resident at Tewksbury Hospital. This is by far the farthest he's strayed from Tewksbury Hospital  I can tell you that  because he's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music. So  first of all  Dan  do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are  Dan Ellsey  Hello. My name is Dan Ellsey. I am    years old and I have cerebral palsy. I have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software. Tod Machover  And we're really excited to have you here  really Dan.  Applause  So we met Dan about three years ago  three and a half years ago  when we started working at Tewksbury. Everybody we met there was fantastic  did fantastic music. Dan had never made music before  and it turned out he was really fantastic at it. He's a born composer. He's very shy  too. So  turned out he's a fantastic composer  and over the last few years has been a constant collaborator of ours. He has made many  many pieces. He makes his own CDs. Actually  he is quite well known in the Boston area    mentors people at the hospital and children  locally  in how to make their own music. And I'll let Adam tell you. So  Adam is a Ph.D. student at MIT  an expert in music technology and medicine. And Adam and Dan have become close collaborators. What Adam's been working on for this last period is not only how to have Dan be able easily to make his own pieces  but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument. So  you want to say a little bit about how you guys work  Adam Boulanger  Yes. So  Tod and I entered into a discussion following the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressive person  and he's an intelligent and creative person. And it's in his face  it's in his breathing  it's in his eyes. How come he can't perform one of his pieces of music  That's our responsibility  and it doesn't make sense. So we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance  with precision  with control  and despite his physical disability  to be able to do that  to be able to perform his piece of music. So  the process and the technology    basically  first we needed an engineering solution. So  you know  we have a FireWire camera  it looked at an infrared pointer. We went with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan was already used to with his speaking controller. And this was actually the least interesting part of the work  you know  the design process. We needed an input  we needed continuous tracking  in the software  we look at the types of shapes he's making. But  then was the really interesting aspect of the work  following the engineering part  where  basically  we're coding over Dan's shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out  you know  how does Dan move  What's useful to him as an expressive motion  You know  what's his metaphor for performance  What types of things does he find important to control and convey in a piece of music  So all the parameter fitting  and really the technology was stretched at that point to fit just Dan. And  you know  I think this is a perspective shift. It's not that our technologies    they provide access  they allow us to create pieces of creative work. But what about expression  What about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work  You know  do our technologies allow us to express  Do they provide structure for us to do that  And  you know  that's a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere. So  you know  with Dan  we needed a new design process  a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform. And so that's what we'll do today. TM  So let's do it. So Dan do you want to tell everyone about what you're going to play now  DE  This is  My Eagle Song.  TM  So Dan is going to play a piece of his  called  My Eagle Song . In fact  this is the score for Dan's piece  completely composed by Dan in Hyperscore. So he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into Hyperscore. He's incredibly fast at it  too  faster than I am  in fact. TM  He's really modest  too. So he can go in Hyperscore. You start out by making melodies and rhythms. He can place those exactly where he wants. Each one gets a color. He goes back into the composition window  draws the lines  places everything the way he wants to. Looking at the Hyperscore  you can see it also  you can see where the sections are  something might continue for a while  change  get really crazy and then end up with a big bang at the end. So that's the way he made his piece  and as Adam says  we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece. It's going to be looked at by this camera  analyze his movements  it's going to let Dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to. And you're also going to notice a visual on the screen. We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring. But instead of making it very literal  showing you exactly the camera tracing  we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement  and shows the way it's being analyzed. I think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from what Dan's doing  but I think it will also show you  if you look at that movement  that when Dan makes music  his motions are very purposeful  very precise  very disciplined and they're also very beautiful. So  in hearing this piece  as I mentioned before  the most important thing is the music's great  and it'll show you who Dan is. So  are we ready Adam  AB  Yeah. TM  OK  now Dan will play his piece  My Eagle Song  for you. TM  Bravo.,,200804,6.41874538745388
498,1460,1462,Tom Shannon 2009,Tom Shannon,male,Anti-gravity sculpture,May 2009,665,This is a sculpture I made  which is a way of  kind of  freeing a form into an object that has different degrees of freedom. So  it can balance on a point. This is a bronze ball  an aluminum arm here  and then this wooden disk. And the wooden disk was really thought about as something that you'd want to hold on to  and that would glide easily through your hands. The aluminum is because it's very light. The bronze is nice hard  durable material that could roll on the ground. Inside of the bronze ball there's a lead weight that is free swinging on an axle that's on two bearings that pass in between  across it  like this  that counterbalance this weight. So it allows it to roll. And the sphere has that balance property that it always sort of stays still and looks the same from every direction. But if you put something on top of it  it disbalances it. And so it would tip over. But in this case because the interior is free swinging in relation to the sphere  it can stand up on one point. And then there was a second level to this object  which is that it    I wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in  which is the diameter of the Moon and the diameter of the Earth in proportion to each other. I was exploring  really early on  wanting to make things float in the air. And I thought up a lot of ideas. This is sculpture that I made that    it's magnetically levitated. The thing is  is that it's slightly dangerous. Normally it's sort of cordoned off when it's in a museum. But it's uh    let's see if I can manipulate it a little bit without  um    oops. So this is just floating  floating on a permanent magnetic field  which stabilizes it in all directions. Except there is a slight tether here  which keeps it from going over the top of its field. It's sort of surfing on a magnetic field at the crest of a wave. And that's what supports the object and keeps it stable. I think we could roll the tape  admin. I have a sort of a collection of videos that I took of different installations  which I could narrate. This is a sculpture of the Sun and the Earth  in proportion. Representing that eight and a half minutes that it takes light and gravity to connect the two. So here is the Earth. It's a little less than a millimeter that was turned of solid bronze. And here is a similar sculpture. That's the Sun at that end. And then in a series of    balls  it reduces  proportionately    each ball and the spaces between them reduce proportionately  until they get down to this little Earth. This is in a sculpture park in Taejon. This one is about the Moon and then the distance to the Earth  in proportion also. This is a little stone ball  floating. As you can see the little tether  that it's also magnetically levitated. And then this is the first part of    this is     spheres  since the Sun is     times the diameter of the Earth. And so this is the size of the Sun. And then each of these little spheres is the size of the Earth in proportion to the Sun. It's made up of    concentric shells. Each one has    spheres. This is in the courtyard of a twelfth century alchemist. I was thinking that the Sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist.  Laughter  So this  again  is on the subject    a slice from the equator of the Earth. And then the Moon in the center  and it's floating. And this is in France. This is in Sapporo. It's balancing on a shaft and a ball  right at the center of gravity  or just slightly above the center of gravity  which means that the lower half of the object is just a little bit more weighty. So you can see it rotating here. It weighs about a ton or over a ton. It's made of stainless steel  quite thick. But it's being balanced like that in equilibrium. It's susceptible to motion by the air currents. This is another species of work that I do. These are these arrays. These spheres are all suspended  but they have magnets horizontally in them that make them all like compasses. So all the red sides  for example  face one direction  south. And the blue side  the compliment  faces the other way. So as you turn around you're seeing different colors. This is based on the structure of a diamond. It was a diamond cell structure was the point of departure. And then there were kind of large spaces in the hollows between the atoms. And so I placed one more element of each one of them. These were white spheres. Then I had video projectors that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres. So they would catch parts of the images  and make sort of three dimensional color volumes  as you walk through it  through the object. This is something I did of a tactile communication system. It was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture  and then putting it into a communication system. This is an idea of moving a sculpture  a ball  that would be directed around the room by a computer. This is a clock I designed. It has Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion Map edited here. It turns once per day in synchrony with the Earth. And then  this is like projects that are harder to build. This has a diamond bottomed lake. So it's a floating island with water  fresh water  that can fly from place to place. This would be grown  I suppose  with nanotechnology in the future sometime. In the course of doing my work I sort of have a broad range of interests. And some of it is just the idea of creating media    media as a sculpture  something that would keep the sculpture fresh and ever changing  by just creating the media that the sculpture is made of. And I had a lot of    always interested in the concept of a crystal ball. And the idea that you could see things inside of a crystal ball and predict the future    or a television set  where it's sort of like a magic box where anything can appear. I had thought about  a long time ago  in the late '  s    when I was just starting out  I was under the influence of thinking about Buckminster Fuller's grand project for an electric globe across from the United Nations    and other things that were happening  the space program at that time  and Whole Earth Catalog  things like that. I was thinking about mass produced spherical television sets that could be linked to orbiting camera satellites. So if we could roll the next film here. This has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations. But this the current version of it  is a flying airship that is about    meters in diameter  about     feet in diameter. The whole surface of it is covered with    million diodes  red  blue  and green  that allow you to have a high resolution picture  visible in daylight. I came with a plan. I brought it to Paul MacCready's company AeroVironment to do a feasibility study  and they analyzed it  and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it. So we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen. This is the control room inside of the ship. The idea of this air genie is  it's something that can just transform and become anything. It's like a traveling show. It has speakers on it. And it has cameras over the surface of it. So it can see its environment  and then it can mimic its environment and disappear. Here the legs are retracting. The cabin is open or closed  as you like. It weighs about    tons. It has on board generators. It can generate about a million kilowatts  in order to be bright enough to be visible in daylight. The idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show. It really would be dedicated to the arts and to interacting. There would be on board a crew of artists  musicians  that would allow the thing to become actually kind of a conscious object that would respond to the moment  and to interact as an entity that was aware  that could communicate. It's completely silent and nonpolluting. It has electric motors with a novel propulsion system. It could be interacted with large crowds in different ways. Primarily I would be interested in how it would interact with  say  going to a college campus  and then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences  the world  the situation of the globe. The default image on the object would probably be a high resolution Earth image. But then one could interact with that and show plate tectonics or global warming issues  or migrations    all of the things that we're concerned with today. And then at night the idea is that it would be used as kind of a rave situation  where the people could cut loose  and the music and the lights  and everything. So it could land in a park  for example. Or this could represent a college green. And then it would have a corresponding website that would show the itinerary of this. And so interacting with the same kind of imagery. It would also be able to be an open code  so people could interact with it. It would be forum for people's ideas about what they would like to see on a giant screen of this type. So that's pretty much it. Okay. Thank you.,Sculptor,200905,6.4666666666666615
499,1628,1630,"Tom Shannon, John Hockenberry 2010","Tom Shannon, John Hockenberry",male,The painter and the pendulum,Feb 2010,788,John Hockenberry  It's great to be here with you  Tom. And I want to start with a question that has just been consuming me since I first became familiar with your work. In you work there's always this kind of hybrid quality of a natural force in some sort of interplay with creative force. Are they ever in equilibrium in the way that you see your work  Tom Shannon  Yeah  the subject matter that I'm looking for  it's usually to solve a question. I had the question popped into my head  What does the cone that connects the sun and the Earth look like if you could connect the two spheres  And in proportion  what would the size of the sphere and the length  and what would the taper be to the Earth  And so I went about and made that sculpture  turning it out of solid bronze. And I did one that was about    feet long. The sun end was about four inches in diameter  and then it tapered over about    feet to about a millimeter at the Earth end. And so for me  it was really exciting just to see what it looks like if you could step outside and into a larger context  as though you were an astronaut  and see these two things as an object  because they are so intimately bound  and one is meaningless without the other. JH  Is there a relief in playing with these forces  And I'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is in playing with these forces. TS  Well  like the magnetically levitated objects    like that silver one there  that was the result of hundreds of experiments with magnets  trying to find a way to make something float with the least possible connection to the ground. So I got it down to just one tether to be able to support that. JH  Now is this electromagnetic here  or are these static  TS  Those are permanent magnets  yeah. JH  Because if the power went out  there would just be a big noise. TS  Yeah. It's really unsatisfactory having plug in art. JH  I agree. TS  The magnetic works are a combination of gravity and magnetism  so it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces that influence everything. The sun has a tremendous field that extends way beyond the planets and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from the sun. So there's this huge invisible shape structures that magnetism takes in the universe. But with the pendulum  it allows me to manifest these invisible forces that are holding the magnets up. My sculptures are normally very simplified. I try to refine them down to very simple forms. But the paintings become very complex  because I think the fields that are supporting them  they're billowing  and they're interpenetrating  and they're interference patterns. JH  And they're non deterministic. I mean  you don't know necessarily where you're headed when you begin  even though the forces can be calculated. So the evolution of this    I gather this isn't your first pendulum. TS  No.  JH  No.  TS  The first one I did was in the late   's  and I just had a simple cone with a spigot at the bottom of it. I threw it into an orbit  and it only had one color  and when it got to the center  the paint kept running out  so I had to run in there  didn't have any control over the spigot remotely. So that told me right away  I need a remote control device. But then I started dreaming of having six colors. I sort of think about it as the DNA    these colors  the red  blue  yellow  the primary colors and white and black. And if you put them together in different combinations    just like printing in a sense  like how a magazine color is printed    and put them under certain forces  which is orbiting them or passing them back and forth or drawing with them  these amazing things started appearing. JH  It looks like we're loaded for bear here. TS  Yeah  well let's put a couple of canvases. I'll ask a couple of my sons to set up the canvases here. I want to just say    so this is Jack  Nick and Louie. JH  Thanks guys. TS  So here are the    JH  All right  I'll get out of the way here. TS  I'm just going to throw this into an orbit and see if I can paint everybody's shoes in the front. JH  Whoa. That is ... ooh  nice. TS  So something like this. I'm doing this as a demo  and it's more playful  but inevitably  all of this can be used. I can redeem this painting  just continuing on  doing layers upon layers. And I keep it around for a couple of weeks  and I'm contemplating it  and I'll do another session with it and bring it up to another level  where all of this becomes the background  the depth of it. JH  That's fantastic. So the valves at the bottom of those tubes there are like radio controlled airplane valves. TS  Yes  they're servos with cams that pinch these rubber tubes. And they can pinch them very tight and stop it  or you can have them wide open. And all of the colors come out one central port at the bottom. You can always be changing colors  put aluminum paint  or I could put anything into this. It could be tomato sauce  or anything could be dispensed    sand  powders or anything like that. JH  So many forces there. You've got gravity  you've got the centrifugal force  you've got the fluid dynamics. Each of these beautiful paintings  are they images in and of themselves  or are they records of a physical event called the pendulum approaching the canvas  TS  Well  this painting here  I wanted to do something very simple  a simple  iconic image of two ripples interfering. So the one on the right was done first  and then the one on the left was done over it. And then I left gaps so you could see the one that was done before. And then when I did the second one  it really disturbed the piece    these big blue lines crashing through the center of it    and so it created a kind of tension and an overlap. There are lines in front of the one on the right  and there are lines behind the one on the left  and so it takes it into different planes. What it's also about  just the little events  the events of the interpenetration of    JH  Two stars  or    TS  Two things that happened    there's an interference pattern  and then a third thing happens. There are shapes that come about just by the marriage of two events that are happening  and I'm very interested in that. Like the occurrence of moire patterns. Like this green one  this is a painting I did about    years ago  but it has some    see  in the upper third    there are these moires and interference patterns that are radio kind of imagery. And that's something that in painting I've never seen done. I've never seen a representation of a kind of radio interference patterns  which are so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives. JH  Is that a literal part of the image  or is my eye making that interference pattern    is my eye completing that interference pattern  TS  It is the paint actually  makes it real. It's really manifested there. If I throw a very concentric circle  or concentric ellipse  it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines  which get closer and closer together  which describes how gravity works. There's something very appealing about the exactitude of science that I really enjoy. And I love the shapes that I see in scientific observations and apparatus  especially astronomical forms and the idea of the vastness of it  the scale  is very interesting to me. My focus in recent years has kind of shifted more toward biology. Some of these paintings  when you look at them very close  odd things appear that really look like horses or birds or crocodiles  elephants. There are lots of things that appear. When you look into it  it's sort of like looking at cloud patterns  but sometimes they're very modeled and highly rendered. And then there are all these forms that we don't know what they are  but they're equally well resolved and complex. So I think  conceivably  those could be predictive. Because since it has the ability to make forms that look like forms that we're familiar with in biology  it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with. And maybe it's the kind of forms we'll discover underneath the surface of Mars  where there are probably lakes with fish swimming under the surface. JH  Oh  let's hope so. Oh  my God  let's. Oh  please  yes. Oh  I'm so there. You know  it seems at this stage in your life  you also very personally are in this state of confrontation with a sort of dissonant    I suppose it's an electromagnetic force that somehow governs your Parkinson's and this creative force that is both the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of arc of your whole life. Is that relevant to your work  TS  As it turns out  this device kind of comes in handy  because I don't have to have the fine motor skills to do  that I can operate slides  which is more of a mental process. I'm looking at it and making decisions  It needs more red  it needs more blue  it needs a different shape. And so I make these creative decisions and can execute them in a much  much simpler way. I mean  I've got the symptoms. I guess Parkinson's kind of creeps up over the years  but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms. In my case  my left hand has a significant tremor and my left leg also. I'm left handed  and so I draw. All my creations really start on small drawings  which I have thousands of  and it's my way of just thinking. I draw with a simple pencil  and at first  the Parkinson's was really upsetting  because I couldn't get the pencil to stand still. JH  So you're not a gatekeeper for these forces. You don't think of yourself as the master of these forces. You think of yourself as the servant. TS  Nature is    well  it's a godsend. It just has so much in it. And I think nature wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature  humans are of the universe. The universe is in our mind  and our minds are in the universe. And we are expressions of the universe  basically. As humans  ultimately being part of the universe  we're kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency of the universe. And to interface with it  with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do  giving them pigment and paint just like an artist  it's a good ally. It's a terrific studio assistant. JH  Well  I love the idea that somewhere within this idea of fine motion and control with the traditional skills that you have with your hand  some sort of more elemental force gets revealed  and that's the beauty here. Tom  thank you so much. It's been really  really great. TS  Thank you  John.,,201002,6.3143967828418255
500,1580,1582,Tom Wujec 2009,Tom Wujec,male,Learn to use the 13th-century astrolabe,Nov 2009,533,As technology progresses  and as it advances  many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent  make us smarter and more connected to the world. And what I'd like to argue is that that's not necessarily the case  as progress is simply a word for change  and with change you gain something  but you also lose something. And to really illustrate this point  what I'd like to do is to show you how technology has dealt with a very simple  a very common  an everyday question. And that question is this. What time is it  What time is it  If you glance at your iPhone  it's so simple to tell the time. But  I'd like to ask you  how would you tell the time if you didn't have an iPhone  How would you tell the time  say      years ago  How would you do it  Well  the way you would do it is by using a device that's called an astrolabe. So  an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world. But  at the time  in the   th century  it was the gadget of the day. It was the world's first popular computer. And it was a device that  in fact  is a model of the sky. So  the different parts of the astrolabe  in this particular type  the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars. The plate corresponds to a coordinate system. And the mater has some scales and puts it all together. If you were an educated child  you would know how to not only use the astrolabe  you would also know how to make an astrolabe. And we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe  the first technical manual in the English language  was written by Geoffrey Chaucer. Yes  that Geoffrey Chaucer  in       to his little Lewis  his    year old son. And in this book  little Lewis would know the big idea. And the central idea that makes this computer work is this thing called stereographic projection. And basically  the concept is  how do you represent the three dimensional image of the night sky that surrounds us onto a flat  portable  two dimensional surface. The idea is actually relatively simple. Imagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe  and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere. Each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole  onto a flat surface  where it is then recorded. So the North Star corresponds to the center of the device. The ecliptic  which is the path of the sun  moon  and planets correspond to an offset circle. The bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete. And the altitude corresponds to the plate system. Now  the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection. The real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems so they fit perfectly. There is the position of the sun  moon and planets on the movable rete. And then there is their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate. Okay  So how would you use this device  Well  let me first back up for a moment. This is an astrolabe. Pretty impressive  isn't it  And so  this astrolabe is on loan from us from the Oxford School of    Museum of History. And you can see the different components. This is the mater  the scales on the back. This is the rete. Okay. Do you see that  That's the movable part of the sky. And in the back you can see a spider web pattern. And that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky. This is a rule device. And on the back are some other devices  measuring tools and scales  to be able to make some calculations. Okay  You know  I've always wanted one of these. For my thesis I actually built one of these out of paper. And this one  this is a replica from a   th century device. And it's worth probably about three MacBook Pros. But a real one would cost about as much as my house  and the house next to it  and actually every house on the block  on both sides of the street  maybe a school thrown in  and some    you know  a church. They are just incredibly expensive. But let me show you how to work this device. So let's go to step one. First thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky  if you're telling time at night. So  tonight  if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle. And there is a bright star called Deneb. So let's select Deneb. Second  is you measure the altitude of Deneb. So  step two  I hold the device up  and then I sight its altitude there so I can see it clearly now. And then I measure its altitude. So  it's about    degrees. You can't see it from over there. Step three is identify the star on the front of the device. Deneb is there. I can tell. Step four is I then move the rete  move the sky  so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back. Okay  so when that happens everything lines up. I have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky. Okay  So  it is  in a sense  holding a model of the universe in my hands. And then finally  I take a rule  and move the rule to a date line which then tells me the time here. Right. So  that's how the device is used. So  I know what you're thinking   That's a lot of work  isn't it  Isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time   as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time. But there is a difference between the two  because with your iPod you can tell    or your iPhone  you can tell exactly what the time is  with precision. The way little Lewis would tell the time is by a picture of the sky. He would know where things would fit in the sky. He would not only know what time it was  he would also know where the sun would rise  and how it would move across the sky. He would know what time the sun would rise  and what time it would set. And he would know that for essentially every celestial object in the heavens. So  in computer graphics and computer user interface design  there is a term called affordances. So  affordances are the qualities of an object that allow us to perform an action with it. And what the astrolabe does is it allows us  it affords us  to connect to the night sky  to look up into the night sky and be much more    to see the visible and the invisible together. So  that's just one use. Incredible  there is probably          uses. In fact  there is a text  and that has over a thousand uses of this first computer. On the back there is scales and measurements for terrestrial navigation. You can survey with it. The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it. It can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types. And it would take a full university course to illustrate it. Astrolabes have an incredible history. They are over       years old. The concept of stereographic projection originated in     B.C. And the astrolabes come in many different sizes and shapes and forms. There is portable ones. There is large display ones. And I think what is common to all astrolabes is that they are beautiful works of art. There is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable. Astrolabes  like every technology  do evolve over time. So  the earliest retes  for example  were very simple and primitive. And advancing retes became cultural emblems. This is one from Oxford. And I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical  and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical  or random sky. How cool is that  This is just amazing. So  would little Lewis have an astrolabe  Probably not one made of brass. He would have one made out of wood  or paper. And the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket. So  what does the astrolabe inspire  Well  I think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful people were  our forebears were  years and years ago. It's just an incredible device. Every technology advances. Every technology is transformed and moved by others. And what we gain with a new technology  of course  is precision and accuracy. But what we lose  I think  is an accurate    a felt sense of the sky  a sense of context. Knowing the sky  knowing your relationship with the sky  is the center of the real answer to knowing what time it is. So  it's    I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices. And so  what can you learn from these devices  Well  primarily that there is a subtle knowledge that we can connect with the world. And astrolabes return us to this subtle sense of how things all fit together  and also how we connect to the world. Thanks very much.,Designer,200911,6.481698113207548
501,1684,1686,Tom Wujec 2010,Tom Wujec,male,"Build a tower, build a team",Apr 2010,398,Several years ago here at TED  Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge. And the idea's pretty simple  Teams of four have to build the tallest free standing structure out of    sticks of spaghetti  one yard of tape  one yard of string and a marshmallow. The marshmallow has to be on top. And  though it seems really simple  it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly. And so  I thought this was an interesting idea  and I incorporated it into a design workshop. And it was a huge success. And since then  I've conducted about    design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects  even the CTOs of the Fortune     and there's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration  and I'd like to share some of them with you. So  normally  most people begin by orienting themselves to the task. They talk about it  they figure out what it's going to look like  they jockey for power. Then they spend some time planning  organizing  they sketch and they lay out spaghetti. They spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever growing structures. And then finally  just as they're running out of time  someone takes out the marshmallow  and then they gingerly put it on top  and then they stand back  and    ta da     they admire their work. But what really happens  most of the time  is that the  ta da  turns into an  uh oh   because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse. So there are a number of people who have a lot more  uh oh  moments than others  and among the worst are recent graduates of business school. They lie  they cheat  they get distracted and they produce really lame structures. And of course there are teams that have a lot more  ta da  structures  and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten. And it's pretty amazing. As Peter tells us  not only do they produce the tallest structures  but they're the most interesting structures of them all. So the question you want to ask is  How come  Why  What is it about them  And Peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of Spaghetti  Inc. Right  They don't spend time jockeying for power. But there's another reason as well. And the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan  right  And then they execute on it. And then what happens is  when they put the marshmallow on the top  they run out of time and what happens  It's a crisis. Sound familiar  Right. What kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow  and they build prototypes  successive prototypes  always keeping the marshmallow on top  so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way. Designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process. And with each version  kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn't work. So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential  but let's look at how different teams perform. So the average for most people is around    inches  business schools students  about half of that  lawyers  a little better  but not much better than that  kindergarteners  better than most adults. Who does the very best  Architects and engineers  thankfully. Thirty nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen. And why is it  Because they understand triangles and self reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures. So CEOs  a little bit better than average  but here's where it gets interesting. If you put you put an executive admin. on the team  they get significantly better. It's incredible. You know  you look around  you go   Oh  that team's going to win.  You can just tell beforehand. And why is that  Because they have special skills of facilitation. They manage the process  they understand the process. And any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team's performance. Specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success. If you have    teams that typically perform  you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures. And I tried something interesting. I thought  let's up the ante  once. So I offered a        dollar prize of software to the winning team. So what do you think happened to these design students  What was the result  Here's what happened  Not one team had a standing structure. If anyone had built  say  a one inch structure  they would have taken home the prize. So  isn't that interesting  That high stakes have a strong impact. We did the exercise again with the same students. What do you think happened then  So now they understand the value of prototyping. So the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best. They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time. So there's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success. So  you might ask  Why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge  And the reason is  I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects. And what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions. Because  frankly  every project has its own marshmallow  doesn't it  The challenge provides a shared experience  a common language  a common stance to build the right prototype. And so  this is the value of the experience  of this so simple exercise. And those of you who are interested may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com. It's a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows. There's step by step instructions on this. There are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system. There's world records that are on this as well. And the fundamental lesson  I believe  is that design truly is a contact sport. It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task  and that we apply the very best of our thinking  our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand. And sometimes  a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an  uh oh  moment to a  ta da  moment. And that can make a big difference. Thank you very much.,Designer,201004,6.2844214876033035
503,555,557,VS Ramachandran 2007,VS Ramachandran,male,3 clues to understanding your brain,Oct 2007,1356,Well  as Chris pointed out  I study the human brain  the functions and structure of the human brain. And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails. Here is this mass of jelly  three pound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand  and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space. It can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity. And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self awareness  which I think is the holy grail of neuroscience  of neurology  and hopefully  someday  we'll understand how that happens. OK  so how do you study this mysterious organ  I mean  you have     billion nerve cells  little wisps of protoplasm  interacting with each other  and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness. How does this happen  Well  there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain. One approach  the one we use mainly  is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain  where there's been a genetic change in a small region of the brain. What then happens is not an across the board reduction in all your mental capacities  a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability. What you get is a highly selective loss of one function  with other functions being preserved intact  and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function. So you can then map function onto structure  and then find out what the circuitry's doing to generate that particular function. So that's what we're trying to do. So let me give you a few striking examples of this. In fact  I'm giving you three examples  six minutes each  during this talk. The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome. If you look at the first slide there  that's the temporal lobes  frontal lobes  parietal lobes  OK    the lobes that constitute the brain. And if you look  tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes    you can't see it there    is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus. And that's been called the face area in the brain  because when it's damaged  you can no longer recognize people's faces. You can still recognize them from their voice and say   Oh yeah  that's Joe   but you can't look at their face and know who it is  right  You can't even recognize yourself in the mirror. I mean  you know it's you because you wink and it winks  and you know it's a mirror  but you don't really recognize yourself as yourself. OK. Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus. But there's another rare syndrome  so rare  in fact  that very few physicians have heard about it  not even neurologists. This is called the Capgras delusion  and that is a patient  who's otherwise completely normal  has had a head injury  comes out of coma  otherwise completely normal  he looks at his mother and says   This looks exactly like my mother  this woman  but she's an impostor. She's some other woman pretending to be my mother.  Now  why does this happen  Why would somebody    and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects  but when he sees his mother  his delusion kicks in and says  it's not mother. Now  the most common interpretation of this  which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks  is a Freudian view  and that is that this chap    and the same argument applies to women  by the way  but I'll just talk about guys. When you're a little baby  a young baby  you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother. This is the so called Oedipus complex of Freud. I'm not saying I believe this  but this is the standard Freudian view. And then  as you grow up  the cortex develops  and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother. Thank God  or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother. And then what happens is  there's a blow to your head  damaging the cortex  allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge  flaming to the surface  and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother. And you say   My God  if this is my mom  how come I'm being sexually turned on  She's some other woman. She's an impostor.  It's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain. This has never made much sense to me  this argument. It's very ingenious  as all Freudian arguments are       but didn't make much sense because I have seen the same delusion  a patient having the same delusion  about his pet poodle. He'll say   Doctor  this is not Fifi. It looks exactly like Fifi  but it's some other dog.  Right  Now  you try using the Freudian explanation there. You'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans  or some such thing  which is quite absurd  of course. Now  what's really going on  So  to explain this curious disorder  we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain. Normally  visual signals come in  into the eyeballs  go to the visual areas in the brain. There are  in fact     areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision  and after processing all that  the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus  where you perceive faces. There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces. You can call it the face area of the brain  right  I talked about that earlier. Now  when that area's damaged  you lose the ability to see faces  right  But from that area  the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system  the emotional core of the brain  and that structure  called the amygdala  gauges the emotional significance of what you're looking at. Is it prey  Is it predator  Is it mate  Or is it something absolutely trivial  like a piece of lint  or a piece of chalk  or a    I don't want to point to that  but    or a shoe  or something like that  OK  Which you can completely ignore. So if the amygdala is excited  and this is something important  the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system. Your heart starts beating faster. You start sweating to dissipate the heat that you're going to create from muscular exertion. And that's fortunate  because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating. So I can determine  when you're looking at something  whether you're excited or whether you're aroused  or not  OK  And I'll get to that in a minute. So my idea was  when this chap looks at an object  when he looks at his    any object for that matter  it goes to the visual areas and  however  and it's processed in the fusiform gyrus  and you recognize it as a pea plant  or a table  or your mother  for that matter  OK  And then the message cascades into the amygdala  and then goes down the autonomic nervous system. But maybe  in this chap  that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system  the emotional core of the brain  is cut by the accident. So because the fusiform is intact  the chap can still recognize his mother  and says   Oh yeah  this looks like my mother.  But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers  he says   But how come  if it's my mother  I don't experience a warmth   Or terror  as the case may be  Right  And therefore  he says   How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions  This can't be my mother. It's some strange woman pretending to be my mother.  How do you test this  Well  what you do is  if you take any one of you here  and put you in front of a screen  and measure your galvanic skin response  and show pictures on the screen  I can measure how you sweat when you see an object  like a table or an umbrella. Of course  you don't sweat. If I show you a picture of a lion  or a tiger  or a pinup  you start sweating  right  And  believe it or not  if I show you a picture of your mother    I'm talking about normal people    you start sweating. You don't even have to be Jewish. Now  what happens if you show this patient  You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response. Tables and chairs and lint  nothing happens  as in normal people  but when you show him a picture of his mother  the galvanic skin response is flat. There's no emotional reaction to his mother  because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut. So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal  his emotions are normal    he'll laugh  he'll cry  so on and so forth    but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor. It's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do  take a bizarre  seemingly incomprehensible  neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard Freudian view is wrong  that  in fact  you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain. By the way  if this patient then goes  and mother phones from an adjacent room    phones him    and he picks up the phone  and he says   Wow  mom  how are you  Where are you   There's no delusion through the phone. Then  she approaches him after an hour  he says   Who are you  You look just like my mother.  OK  The reason is there's a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers  and that's not been cut by the accident. So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother  no problem. When he sees her in person  he says it's an impostor. OK  how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain  Is it nature  genes  or is it nurture  And we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb. And you all know what a phantom limb is. When an arm is amputated  or a leg is amputated  for gangrene  or you lose it in war    for example  in the Iraq war  it's now a serious problem    you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm  and that's called a phantom arm or a phantom leg. In fact  you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body. Believe it or not  even with internal viscera. I've had patients with the uterus removed    hysterectomy    who have a phantom uterus  including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month. And in fact  one student asked me the other day   Do they get phantom PMS   A subject ripe for scientific enquiry  but we haven't pursued that. OK  now the next question is  what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments  One of the things we've found was  about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom. It'll pat his brother on the shoulder  it'll answer the phone when it rings  it'll wave goodbye. These are very compelling  vivid sensations. The patient's not delusional. He knows that the arm is not there  but  nevertheless  it's a compelling sensory experience for the patient. But however  about half the patients  this doesn't happen. The phantom limb    they'll say   But doctor  the phantom limb is paralyzed. It's fixed in a clenched spasm and it's excruciatingly painful. If only I could move it  maybe the pain will be relieved.  Now  why would a phantom limb be paralyzed  It sounds like an oxymoron. But when we were looking at the case sheets  what we found was  these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs  the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury. The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed  was cut  by say  a motorcycle accident. So the patient had an actual arm  which is painful  in a sling for a few months or a year  and then  in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm  the surgeon amputates the arm  and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains  right  And this is a serious clinical problem. Patients become depressed. Some of them are driven to suicide  OK  So  how do you treat this syndrome  Now  why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb  When I looked at the case sheet  I found that they had an actual arm  and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut  and the actual arm had been paralyzed  and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation  and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself. Why does this happen  When the arm was intact  but paralyzed  the brain sends commands to the arm  the front of the brain  saying   Move   but it's getting visual feedback saying   No.  Move. No. Move. No. Move. No. And this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain  and we call this learned paralysis  OK  The brain learns  because of this Hebbian  associative link  that the mere command to move the arm creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm. And then  when you've amputated the arm  this learned paralysis carries over into your body image and into your phantom  OK  Now  how do you help these patients  How do you unlearn the learned paralysis  so you can relieve him of this excruciating  clenching spasm of the phantom arm  Well  we said  what if you now send the command to the phantom  but give him visual feedback that it's obeying his command  right  Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain  the phantom cramp. How do you do that  Well  virtual reality. But that costs millions of dollars. So  I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars  but don't tell my funding agencies. OK  What you do is you create what I call a mirror box. You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle  and then you put the phantom    so my first patient  Derek  came in. He had his arm amputated    years ago. He had a brachial avulsion  so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed  lying in a sling for a year  and then the arm was amputated. He had a phantom arm  excruciatingly painful  and he couldn't move it. It was a paralyzed phantom arm. So he came there  and I gave him a mirror like that  in a box  which I call a mirror box  right  And the patient puts his phantom left arm  which is clenched and in spasm  on the left side of the mirror  and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror  and makes the same posture  the clenched posture  and looks inside the mirror. And what does he experience  He looks at the phantom being resurrected  because he's looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror  and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected.  Now   I said   now  look  wiggle your phantom    your real fingers  or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror.  He's going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving  right  That's obvious  but the astonishing thing is  the patient then says   Oh my God  my phantom is moving again  and the pain  the clenching spasm  is relieved.  And remember  my first patient who came in       thank you.  Applause  My first patient came in  and he looked in the mirror  and I said   Look at your reflection of your phantom.  And he started giggling  he says   I can see my phantom.  But he's not stupid. He knows it's not real. He knows it's a mirror reflection  but it's a vivid sensory experience. Now  I said   Move your normal hand and phantom.  He said   Oh  I can't move my phantom. You know that. It's painful.  I said   Move your normal hand.  And he says   Oh my God  my phantom is moving again. I don't believe this  And my pain is being relieved.  OK  And then I said   Close your eyes.  He closes his eyes.  And move your normal hand.   Oh  nothing. It's clenched again.   OK  open your eyes.   Oh my God  oh my God  it's moving again   So  he was like a kid in a candy store. So  I said  OK  this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input  but I'm not going to get a Nobel Prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb. It's a completely useless ability  if you think about it. But then I started realizing  maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology  like stroke  focal dystonias    there may be a learned component to this  which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror. So  I said   Look  Derek     well  first of all  the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain    I said   Look  Derek  take it home and practice with it for a week or two. Maybe  after a period of practice  you can dispense with the mirror  unlearn the paralysis  and start moving your paralyzed arm  and then  relieve yourself of pain.  So he said OK  and he took it home. I said   Look  it's  after all  two dollars. Take it home.  So  he took it home  and after two weeks  he phones me  and he said   Doctor  you're not going to believe this.  I said   What   He said   It's gone.  I said   What's gone   I thought maybe the mirror box was gone. He said   No  no  no  you know this phantom I've had for the last    years  It's disappeared.  And I said    I got worried  I said  my God  I mean I've changed this guy's body image  what about human subjects  ethics and all of that  And I said   Derek  does this bother you   He said   No  last three days  I've not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain  no clenching  no phantom forearm pain  all those pains are gone away. But the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder  and your box doesn't reach.   So  can you change the design and put it on my forehead  so I can  you know  do this and eliminate my phantom fingers   He thought I was some kind of magician. Now  why does this happen  It's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict. It's getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back. On the other hand  there's no proprioception  muscle signals saying that there is no arm  right  And your motor command saying there is an arm  and  because of this conflict  the brain says  to hell with it  there is no phantom  there is no arm  right  It goes into a sort of denial    it gates the signals. And when the arm disappears  the bonus is  the pain disappears because you can't have disembodied pain floating out there  in space. So  that's the bonus. Now  this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in Helsinki  so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain  and indeed  people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation. Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers  nothing you can do about it. But  it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis  and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors. This has also gone through clinical trials  helping lots and lots of patients. OK  let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk  which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia. This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century. He was a cousin of Charles Darwin. He pointed out that certain people in the population  who are otherwise completely normal  had the following peculiarity  every time they see a number  it's colored. Five is blue  seven is yellow  eight is chartreuse  nine is indigo  OK  Bear in mind  these people are completely normal in other respects. Or C sharp    sometimes  tones evoke color. C sharp is blue  F sharp is green  another tone might be yellow  right  Why does this happen  This is called synesthesia. Galton called it synesthesia  a mingling of the senses. In us  all the senses are distinct. These people muddle up their senses. Why does this happen  One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing. Synesthesia runs in families  so Galton said this is a hereditary basis  a genetic basis. Secondly  synesthesia is about    and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture  which is about creativity    synesthesia is eight times more common among artists  poets  novelists and other creative people than in the general population. Why would that be  I'm going to answer that question. It's never been answered before. OK  what is synesthesia  What causes it  Well  there are many theories. One theory is they're just crazy. Now  that's not really a scientific theory  so we can forget about it. Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads  right  Now  there may be some truth to this  because it's much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego. OK. Now  the third theory is that    well  let's ask ourselves what's really going on in synesthesia. All right  So  we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain  in the fusiform gyrus. So we said  there's some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain. So  every time you see a number  you see a corresponding color  and that's why you get synesthesia. Now remember    why does this happen  Why would there be crossed wires in some people  Remember I said it runs in families  That gives you the clue. And that is  there is an abnormal gene  a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring. In all of us  it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else. So  every brain region is wired to every other region  and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain. So  if there's a gene causing this trimming and if that gene mutates  then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas. And if it's between number and color  you get number color synesthesia. If it's between tone and color  you get tone color synesthesia. So far  so good. Now  what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain  so everything is cross connected  Well  think about what artists  novelists and poets have in common  the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking  linking seemingly unrelated ideas  such as   It is the east  and Juliet is the Sun.  Well  you don't say  Juliet is the sun  does that mean she's a glowing ball of fire  I mean  schizophrenics do that  but it's a different story  right  Normal people say  she's warm like the sun  she's radiant like the sun  she's nurturing like the sun. Instantly  you've found the links. Now  if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain  then it's going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia. And  hence  the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets  artists and novelists. OK  it's a very phrenological view of synesthesia. The last demonstration    can I take one minute  OK. I'm going to show you that you're all synesthetes  but you're in denial about it. Here's what I call Martian alphabet. Just like your alphabet  A is A  B is B  C is C. Different shapes for different phonemes  right  Here  you've got Martian alphabet. One of them is Kiki  one of them is Buba. Which one is Kiki and which one is Buba  How many of you think that's Kiki and that's Buba  Raise your hands. Well  it's one or two mutants. How many of you think that's Buba  that's Kiki  Raise your hands. Ninety nine percent of you. Now  none of you is a Martian. How did you do that  It's because you're all doing a cross model synesthetic abstraction  meaning you're saying that that sharp inflection    ki ki  in your auditory cortex  the hair cells being excited    Kiki  mimics the visual inflection  sudden inflection of that jagged shape. Now  this is very important  because what it's telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive    it's just    it looks like a silly illusion  but these photons in your eye are doing this shape  and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern  but the brain is able to extract the common denominator. It's a primitive form of abstraction  and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain  because when that's damaged  these people lose the ability to engage in Buba Kiki  but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor. If you ask this guy  what     all that glitters is not gold   what does that mean   The patient says   Well  if it's metallic and shiny  it doesn't mean it's gold. You have to measure its specific gravity  OK   So  they completely miss the metaphorical meaning. So  this area is about eight times the size in higher    especially in humans    as in lower primates. Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus  because it's the crossroads between hearing  vision and touch  and it became enormous in humans. And something very interesting is going on. And I think it's a basis of many uniquely human abilities like abstraction  metaphor and creativity. All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia  we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging  and by studying patients and asking the right questions. Thank you. Sorry about that.,,200710,5.814026402640272
505,348,350,Vusi Mahlasela 2007,Vusi Mahlasela,male,"""Thula Mama""",Aug 2007,483,I d like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa    those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid. And  of course  I m dedicating it also to my grandmother  whom I think really played quite a lot of important roles  especially for me when I was an activist  and being harassed by the police. You will recall that in       June     the students of South Africa boycotted the language of Afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor  as they were sort of like really told that they must do everything in Afrikaans    biology  mathematics    and what about our languages  And the students wanted to speak to the government  and police answered with bullets. So every year  June     we will commemorate all those comrades or students who died. And I was very young then. I think I was    years  and I started asking questions  and that s when my political education started. And I joined  later on  the youth organization under the African National Congress. So as part of organizing this and whatever  this commemoration  the police will round us up as they call us leaders. And I used to run away from home  when I know that maybe the police might be coming around the ninth or   th of June or so. And my grandmother one time said   No  look  you re not going to run away. This is your place  you stay here.  And indeed  the police came    because they ll just arrest us and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like  after the   th or so. So it was on the   th of June  and they came  and they surrounded the house  and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house  and opened the kitchen door. And she said to them   Vusi's here  and you're not going to take him tonight. I'm tired of you having to come here  harassing us  while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes. He is here  and you're not going to take him. I've got a bowl full of boiling water    the first one who comes in here  gets it.  And they left.   Thula Mama  Thula Mama  Thula Mama  Thula Mama.     Through the mist of the tears in your eyes on my childhood memory      I know the truth in your smile      I know the truth in your smile      piercing through the gloom of my ignorance.     Oh  there is a mama lying down sleeping     you're very ill and your heart crying.     Wondering  wondering  wondering  wondering where is this world coming to.     Is it right the children have to fend for themselves  No  no  no  no  no. no.     Is it right heaping trouble on an old lady's head      So unlucky faceless people.     Thula Mama Mama  Thula Mama.

516,1479,1481,Yann Arthus-Bertrand 2009,Yann Arthus-Bertrand,male,A wide-angle view of fragile Earth,Jun 2009,840,I have a big impact on the planet to travel here by plane. I emitted  in the atmosphere  nine tons of CO   that is the weight of two elephants. I came here to speak about ecology  and I emitted as much CO  as a Frenchman in one year. So what do I have to do  I have to kill a Frenchman when I come back at home  I have to do my carbon offset in another way  like I do every time. In fact my work is to show our impact on our planet. I'm going to show you some examples of the last pictures I've done in the last year. Alberta sand oil  a lot of pollution. You know the problem  we don't want to believe what we know. In Alberta people work nonstop     hours by seven to extract as much oil as they can. We know about the end of oil. Oil sand is not a long term solution. But we use three times more oil than we find every year. We don't want to believe what we know. Deny. Coral reef in New Caledonia.     percent of the coral may be wiped out before      because of global warming. And you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature  and are very important for the biodiversity of the sea. North Pole. I've done this picture last summer. It was impossible to do this picture    years ago. Now there is a new way open between Atlantic and Pacific. The thickness of the Arctic decreased more than    percent since     . There is a new face of Kilimanjaro without ice. Sad picture. It lost    percent of its ice. According to scientists  in     years all the mountain glacier will be gone. Glaciers are very important for the life on earth. Like Al Gore told you  two billion people live on the water from the glacier of Himalaya. Return of fish men. One fifth of human kind depend on fish to live. Today now    percent of the fish stock are over exploited. According to FAO  if we don't change our system of fishing the main sea resources will be gone in     . We don't want to believe what we know. The beautiful picture  by  unclear  in Africa. One human of six have not enough to eat in the world. One billion people have not enough to eat. In Africa  corn is one of the main foods in many places. Here in America     percent of the corn cultivated is used to feed animals or to do oil. Palm tree plantation in Borneo. Every year we lose    thousand square miles in deforestation. Refugee camp in Darfur. Today we have    million refugees in the world. According to the U.N.  we speak about     million refugees in     . I always show my pictures in the street. We have done already     exhibitions in the cities. But how to understand the world without the voice of people  Landscape was not enough. It was obvious to me to do another work. I launched a project named Six Billion Others. I sent around the world six cameramen asking the same question  the same crucial question  about life. We have done five thousand interviews. I'm going to show you this. Man  The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life  It's when my dad told me   Here  I give you this girl as your fiance.  Woman  Love  Love is nice if you can have it. Second Man  Romeo and Juliet  Sassi and Panno  Dodi and Diana  Heer and Ranjha  this is love  Third Man  My greatest fear is ... Woman  You're asking me a hard question. Fourth Man  I live happily because what else should I do  Fifth Man  The first thing I remember ...  Sixth Man  That's how I learned  by my mother   Fifth Man  ... from my childhood   Sixth Man  that you should respect humans.  Fifth Man  we were having fun  biking.  Sixth Man  I will never forget those words.  Seventh Man  We invented stories  we flew around the world  while remaining in our attic. Eighth Man  I had a big laugh today. Ninth Man  You see  family is ... it's awful.   th Man  In the word life  you have the life.   th Man  Who am I  Isn't that the biggest question    th Man  If I was to go back to Iraq and speak to the people  I'd have to bow down and kiss their feet. Just as that woman tried to kiss my feet when we were taking her sons. I feel ashamed. And I feel humbled by their strength. And I will forever feel a need to make reparations to Iraq. Second Woman  Dad  Mom  I grew up. You shouldn't worry about me. Dad doesn't need to go to work. My family ... What can I say  At the moment  my family is very poor  my life here in Shenzhen is just about showing myself that I can earn more and to let my parents stay and have something to live on. I don't want them to spend their whole lives in poverty. If someday I can achieve something  I would like to say thank you daddy and mommy. Thank you. Thank you for having fed me and raised me  and for making my life of today. Thank you.   th Man  After seven years now of being in a wheelchair  I've done more in life being in a chair than out of a chair. I still surf. I sail the world. I freedive. After many people said I couldn't do that. And I think that comes from connecting with nature  connecting with the energy of life  because we're all disabled in some way on the planet    spiritually  mentally or physically. I got the easy part.   th Man  Let's say that you and me like each other. You come from elsewhere. You don't know me. I don't know you. We talk without lying. If I do like you  I give you one cow and many other things and we become friends. How can we make it all by ourselves  YAB  You can also go to the website  answer    respond to the questions also. Forty crucial questions. Now I am going to speak to you about my movie. For the last three years  I was shooting the earth for the movie. The name of the movie is  Home      Maison.  It is about the state of the planet. It's a fantastic story of life on the earth. I'm very proud to show you the teaser. Video  This Earth is four and a half billion years old. These plants  several hundred million years old. And we humans have been walking upright for only     thousand years. We've managed to adapt  and have conquered the whole planet. For generations  we've been raising our children  not unlike millions of other species living beside us. For the past    years I've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers from high up in the sky. Our life is tied to the well being of our planet. We depend on water  forests  deserts  oceans. Fishing  breeding  farming are still the world's foremost human occupations. And what binds us together is far greater than what divides us. We all share the same need for the earth's gifts    the same wish to rise above ourselves  and become better. And yet we carry on raising walls to keep us apart. Today our greatest battle is to protect the natural offerings of our planet. In less than    years we've altered it more thoroughly than in the entire history of mankind. Half of the world's forests have vanished. Water resources are running low. Intensive farming is depleting soils. Our energy sources are not sustainable. The climate is changing. We are endangering ourselves. We're only trying to improve our lives. But the wealth gaps are growing wider. We haven't yet understood that we're going at a much faster pace than the planet can sustain. We know that solutions are available today. We all have the power to change this trend for the better. So what are we waiting for  YAB  Luc Besson is the producer of the movie. But it is not a normal movie. The film is going to be distributed free. This film has no copyright. On the five of June  the environment day  everybody can download the movie on Internet. The film is given for free to the distributor for TV and theater to show it the fifth of June. There is no business on this movie. It is also available for school  cities  NGOs and you. We have to believe what we know. Let me tell you something. It's too late to be pessimistic    really too late. We have all a part of the solutions. To finish  I would like to welcome the      th baby born since the beginning of this talk. Merci beaucoup. I love you.,Photographer,200906,6.1777234042553175
519,1328,1330,Zach Kaplan + Keith Schacht 2008,Zach Kaplan + Keith Schacht,male,Toys and materials from the future,Oct 2008,937,Zach Kaplan  Keith and I lead a research team. We investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties. Over the last three years  we found over     of these things  and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for TED. Of these six  the first one that we're going to talk about is in the black envelope you're holding. It comes from a company in Japan called GelTech. Now go ahead and open it up. Keith Schacht  Now be sure and take the two pieces apart. What's unexpected about this is that it's soft  but it's also a strong magnet. Zach and I have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this. We spent a long time thinking about why this is  and it's just recently that we realized  it's when we see something unexpected  it changes our understanding of the way things work. As you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time  if you assume that all magnets had to be hard  then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work. ZK  Now  it's important to understand what the unexpected properties are. But to really think about the implications of what this makes possible  we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world. So  a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors. If you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material    if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise  and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed. Imagine taking the same material  but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker. You know  this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door  in your closet  and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf. For me  I really love this idea. If you come to my apartment and see my closet  I'm sure you'd figure out why  it's a mess. KS  Seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications    it helps you see why this is significant  what the potential is. But we've found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference. ZK  It was like six months ago that Keith and I were out in L.A.  and we were at Starbucks having coffee with Roman Coppola. He works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company  The Directors Bureau. As we were talking  Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side. And we were showing him the same gel magnet that you're holding in your hand    and you know  we shared the same ideas. And you could see it in his face  Roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder  he opens it up and Keith and I look in  and he starts showing us concepts that he's been working on. These things just get him really excited. And so we're looking at these concepts  and we were just like  whoa  this guy's good. Because the way that he presented the concept    his approach was totally different than ours. He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now. When we were going in the car back to the airport  we were thinking  why was this so powerful  And as we thought about it more  we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience  just as if you saw it on TV. So  for TED we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future. Narrator  Do you have a need for speed  Inventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically levitating board down a waterslide so fast  so tall  that when you hit the bottom  it uses brakes to stop. Aqua Rocket  coming this summer. KS  Now  we showed the concept to a few people before this  and they asked us  when's it coming out  So I just wanted to let you know  it's not actually coming out  just the concept is. ZK  So now  when we dream up these concepts  it's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint. So I just want to quickly explain how this would work. This is the magnetically levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial. The gel that you're holding would be lining the bottom of the board. Now this is important for two reasons. One  the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that  if it were to hit the rider in the head  it wouldn't injure him. In addition  you can see from the diagram on the right  the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet. So this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down. The force of the water rushing down  in addition to that repulsion force  would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market. It's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system. When you get to the very bottom of the slide       the rider passes through an aluminum tube. And I'm going to kick it to Keith to explain why that's important from a technical standpoint. KS  So I'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal  it's not a magnetic material. But something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube. So we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you. Now  you see the magnet fell really slowly. Now  I'm not going to get into the physics of it  but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling  the greater the stopping force. ZK  Now  our next technology is actually a    foot pole  and I have it right here in my pocket. There're a few different versions of it. KS  Some of them automatically unroll like this one. They can be made to automatically roll up  or they can be made stable  like Zach's  to hold any position in between. ZK  As we were talking to the vendor    to try to learn about how you could apply these  or how they're being applied currently    he was telling us that  in the military they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests    very concealed    and then  when they're out on the field  erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base. In our brainstorms  we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal  so at the end of the game  you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag. KS  Now  the interesting thing about this is  you don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why a    foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting. So we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this. Man  I clean my ceiling fans with that and I get the spider webs off my house    I do it that way. Woman  I'd make my very own walking stick. Woman  I would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree. Woman  An olive server. Man  Some type of extension pole    like what the painters use. Woman  I would make a spear that  when you went deep sea diving  you could catch the fish really fast  and then roll it back up  and you could swim easier ... Yeah. ZK  Now  for our next technology we're going to do a little demonstration  and so we need a volunteer from the audience. You sir  come on up. Come on up. Tell everybody your name. Steve Jurvetson  Steve. ZK  It's Steve. All right Steve  now  follow me. We need you to stand right in front of the TED sign. Right there. That's great. And hold onto this. Good luck to you. KS  No  not yet. ZK  I'd just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by Target. KS  Little bit    that's perfect  just perfect. Now  Zach  we're going to demonstrate a water gun fight from the future. So here  come on up to the front. All right  so now if you'll see here    no  no  it's OK. So  describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt. Go ahead. SJ  It's cold. KS  Now the reason it's cold is that's it's not actually water loaded into these squirt guns    it's a dry liquid developed by  M. It's perfectly clear  it's odorless  it's colorless. It's so safe you could drink this stuff. And the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates    times faster than water. All right  well thanks for coming up. ZK  Wait  wait  Steven    before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends. SJ  Excellent  thank you. KS  Thanks for coming up. Let's give him a big round of applause. So what's the significance of this dry liquid  Early versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer. Now  the unexpected thing about this is that Zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we'd damage the electronics  that we'd get him wet  that we'd hurt the books or the computers. It works because it's non conductive. So you can see here  you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn't cause any damage. You can circulate it to draw the heat away. But today it's most widely used in office buildings    in the sprinkler system    as a fire suppression fluid. Again  it's perfectly safe for people. It puts out the fires  doesn't hurt anything. But our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game. So during halftime  it could rain down on the players  cool everyone down  and in a matter of minutes it would dry. Wouldn't hurt the court. ZK  Our next technology comes to us from a company in Japan called Sekisui Chemical. One of their R D engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer. While he was doing this  he noticed an unexpected thing. We have a video to show you. KS  So you see there  it didn't bounce back. Now  this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing. It's technically called   shape retaining property.  Now  think about your interactions with aluminum foil. Shape retaining is common in metal  you bend a piece of aluminum foil  and it holds its place. Contrast that with a plastic garbage can    and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back. ZK  For example  you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist  but doesn't use a buckle. Taking it a little further  if you wove those strips together    kind of like a little basket    you could make a shape retaining sheet  and then you could embed it in a cloth  so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table  so that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away. For our next technology  it's hard to observe the unexpected property by itself  because it's an ink. So  we've prepared a video to show it applied to paper. KS  As this paper is bending  the resistance of the ink changes. So with simple electronics  you can detect how much the page is being bent. Now  to think about the potential for this  think of all the places ink is supplied  on business cards  on the back of cereal boxes  board games. Any place you use ink  you could change the way you interact with it. ZK  So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book. This could totally change the way that you interface with paper. You see the dark line on the side and the top. As you turn the pages of the book  the book can actually detect what page you're on  based on the curvature of the pages. In addition  if you were to fold in one of the corners  then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes. KS  For our last technology  we worked again with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works. Old Milk Carton  Oh yeah  it smells good. Who are you  New Milk Carton  I'm New Milk. OMC  I used to smell like you. Narrator  Fresh Watch  from Inventables Dairy Farms. Packaging that changes color when your milk's gone off. Don't let milk spoil your morning. ZK  Now  this technology was developed by these two guys  Professor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow  of the University of Illinois. KS  Now the way it works  there's a matrix of color dyes. And these dyes change color in response to odors. So the smell of vanilla  that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow. This matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells. But like in the milk commercial  if you know what odor you want to detect  then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor. ZK  Right. It was that that started a conversation with Professor Suslick and myself  and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible  beyond just detecting spoiled food. It's really where the significance of it lies. His company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn  how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene  And he kind of comically explained that time after time  what the firemen would say is  they would rush to the scene of the crime  they would look around  if there were no dead policemen  it was OK to go. I mean  this is a true story. They're using policemen as canaries. But more seriously  they determined that you could develop a device that can smell better than the humans  and say if it's safe for the firemen. In addition  he's spun off a company from the University called ChemSensing  where they're working on medical equipment. So  a patient can come in and actually blow into their device. By detecting the odor of particular bacteria  or viruses  or even lung cancer  the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results. This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients. Currently  they're using a method of trial and error  but this could tell you precisely what disease you have. KS  So that was the six we had for you today  but I hope you're starting to see why we find these things so fascinating. Because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world. Prior to seeing this  we would have assumed  a    foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket  something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent  every one of these things    and we're constantly trying to find more. ZK  This is something that Keith and I really enjoy doing. I'm sure it's obvious to you now  but it was actually yesterday that I was reminded of why. I was having a conversation with Steve Jurvetson  over downstairs by the escalators  and he was telling me that when Chris sent out that little box  one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand    the sand that doesn't get wet. He said that he was playing with it with his son. And you know  his son was mesmerized  because he would dunk it in the water  he would take it out and it was bone dry. A few weeks later  he said that his son was playing with a lock of his mother's hair  and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair. And he took the thing and he looked up to Steve and he said   Look  hydrophobic string.  I mean  after hearing that story    that really summed it up for me. Thank you very much. KS  Thank you.,,200810,6.105098360655731
