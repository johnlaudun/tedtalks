Right when I was    was when I first got interested in solar energy. My family had moved from Fort Lee  New Jersey to California  and we moved from the snow to lots of heat  and gas lines. There was gas rationing in     . The energy crisis was in full bore. I started reading Popular Science magazine  and I got really excited about the potential of solar energy to try and solve that crisis. I had just taken trigonometry in high school  I learned about the parabola and how it could concentrate rays of light to a single focus. That got me very excited. And I really felt that there would be potential to build some kind of thing that could concentrate light. So  I started this company called Solar Devices. And this was a company where I built parabolas  I took metal shop  and I remember walking into metal shop building parabolas and Stirling engines. And I was building this Stirling engine over on the lathe  and all the biker guys    motorcycle guys    came over and said   You're building a bong  aren't you   And I said   No  it's a Stirling engine. It really is.  But they didn't believe me. I sold the plans for this engine and for this dish in the back of Popular Science magazine  for four dollars each. And I earned enough money to pay for my first year of Caltech. It was a really big excitement for me to get into Caltech. And my first year at Caltech  I continued the business. But then  in the second year of Caltech  they started grading. The whole first year was pass fail  but the second year was graded. I wasn't able to keep up with the business  and I ended up with a    year detour. My dream had been to convert solar energy at a very practical cost  but then I had this big detour. First  the coursework at Caltech. Then  when I graduated from Caltech  the IBM P.C. came out  and I got addicted to the IBM P.C. in     . And then in       Lotus       came out  and I was completely blown away by Lotus      . I began operating my business with        began writing add ins for        wrote a natural language interface to      . I started an educational software company after I joined Lotus  and then I started Idealab so I could have a roof under which I could build multiple companies in succession Then  much much later    in       very recently    the new California energy crisis    or what was purported to be a big energy crisis    was coming. And I was trying to figure if there was some way we could build something that would capitalize on that and try and get people back up energy  in case the crisis really came. And I started looking at how we could build battery back up systems that could give people five hours     hours  maybe even a full day  or three days' worth of back up power. I'm glad you heard earlier today  batteries are unbelievably energy    lack of density compared to fuel. So much more energy can be stored with fuel than with batteries. You'd have to fill your entire parking space of one garage space just to give yourself four hours of battery back up. And I concluded  after researching every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy    flywheels  different formulations of batteries    it just wasn't practical to store energy. So what about making energy  Maybe we could make energy. I tried to figure out    maybe solar's become attractive. It's been    years since I was doing this  let me go back and look at what's been happening with solar cells. And the price had gone down from    dollars a watt to about four or five dollars a watt  but it stabilized. And it really needed to get much lower than that to be cost effective. I studied all the new things that had happened in solar cells  and was trying to look for ways we could innovate and make solar cells more inexpensively. There are a lot of new things that are happening to do that  but fundamentally the process requires a tremendous amount of energy. Some people even say it takes more energy to make a solar cell than it will give out in its entire life. Hopefully  if we can reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells  that will become more practical. But right now  you pretty much have to take silicon  put it in an oven at      degrees Fahrenheit for    hours  to make the cells. A lot of people are working on things to try and reduce that  but I didn't have anything to contribute in that area. So I tried to figure out what other way could we try and make cost effective solar electricity. So I thought of an idea    what if we collect the sun with a large reflector    like I had been thinking about way back when  when I was in high school    but maybe with modern technology we could make a cheaper  large collector  concentrate it to a small converter  and then the conversion device wouldn't have to be as expensive  because it's much smaller  rather than solar cells  which have to be covering the entire surface area that you want to gather sun from. This seemed practical now  because a lot of new technologies had come in the    years since I had last looked at it. First of all  there was a lot of new manufacturing techniques  not to mention really cheap miniature motors    brushless motors  servo motors  stepper motors  that are used in printers and scanners and things like that. So  that's a breakthrough. Of course  inexpensive microprocessors and then a very important breakthrough    genetic algorithms. I'll be very short on genetic algorithms. It's a powerful way of solving intractable problems using natural selection. You take a problem that you can't solve with a pure mathematical answer  you build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at guessing  you add sex    where you take half of one solution and half of another and then make new mutations    and you use natural selection to kill off not as good solutions. Usually  with a genetic algorithm on a computer today  with a three gigahertz processor you can solve many  many formerly intractable problems in just a matter of minutes. We tried to come up with a way to use genetic algorithms to create a new type of concentrator. And I'll show you what we came up with. Traditionally  concentrators look like this. Those shapes are parabolas. They take all the parallel incoming rays and focus it to a single spot. They have to track the sun  because they have to be pointing directly at the sun. They usually have about a one degree acceptance angle  meaning once they're more than about a degree off  none of the sunlight rays will hit the focus. So we tried to come up with a way of making a non tracking collector  a collector that would gather much more than one degree of light  with no moving parts. So we created this genetic algorithm to try this out  we made a model in XL of a multi surface reflector  and an amazing thing evolved  literally evolved  from trying a billion cycles  a billion different attempts  with a fitness function that defined how can you collect the most light  from the most angles  over a day  from the sun. And this is the shape that evolved. It's this non tracking collector with these six tuba like horns  and each of them collect light in the following way    if the sunlight strikes right here  it might bounce right to the center  the hot spot  directly  but if the sun is off axis and comes from the side  it might hit two places and take two bounces. So for direct light  it takes only one bounce  for off axis light it might take two  and for extreme off axis  it might take three. Your efficiency goes down with more bounces  because you lose about    percent with each bounce  but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus    degree angle. So  about two and a half hours of the day we could collect with a stationary component. Solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though. On an average adjusted day  a solar cell    because the sun's moving across the sky  the solar cell is going down with a sine wave function of performance at the off axis angles. It collects about four and a half average hours of sunlight a day. So  even this  although it was great with no moving parts    we could achieve high temperatures    wasn't enough. We needed to beat solar cells. So we took a look at another idea. We looked at a way to break up a parabola into individual petals that would track. So what you see here is    separate petals  that each could be controlled with individual microprocessors that would only cost a dollar. You can buy a two megahertz microprocessor for a dollar now. And you can buy stepper motors that pretty much never wear out because they have no brushes  for a dollar. We can control all    of these petals for under    dollars and what this would allow us to do is not have to move the focus any more  but only move the petals. The whole system would have a much lower profile  but also we could gather sunlight for six and a half to seven hours a day. Now that we have concentrated sunlight  what are we going to put at the center to convert sunlight to electricity  So we tried to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to try and convert sunlight to electricity  or heat to electricity. And one of the great ones of all time  James Watt's steam engine of      was a major  major breakthrough. James Watt didn't actually invent the steam engine  he just refined it. But  his refinements were incredible. He added new linear motion guides to the pistons  he added a condenser to cool the steam outside the cylinder  he made the engine double acting so it had double the power. Those were major breakthroughs. I mean  all of the improvements he made    and it's justifiable that our measure of energy  the watt  today is named after him. So we looked at this engine  and this had some potential. Steam engines are dangerous  and they had tremendous impact on the world  as you know    industrial revolution and ships and locomotives. But they're usually good to be large  so they're not good for distributed power generation. But they're also very high pressure  so they're dangerous. Another type of engine is the hot air engine. And the hot air engine also was not invented by Robert Stirling  but Robert Stirling came along in      and radically improved it. This engine  because it was so interesting    it only worked on air  no steam    has led to hundreds of creative designs over the years that use the Stirling engine principle. But after the Stirling engine  Otto came along  and also  he didn't invent the internal combustion engine  he just refined it. He showed it in Paris in       and it was a major achievement because it brought the power density of the engine way up. You could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space  and that allowed the engine to be used for mobile applications. So  once you have mobility  now you're making a lot of engines because you've got lots of units  as opposed to steam ships or big factories where you're not making as many units  so this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production where all the other engines didn't benefit. So  because it went into mass production  costs were reduced      years of refinement  emissions were reduced  tremendous production value. There have been hundreds of millions of internal combustion engines built  compared to thousands of Stirling engines built. And not nearly as many small steam engines being built anymore  only large ones for big operations. So after looking at these three  and    others  we concluded that the Stirling engine would be the best one to use. I want to give you a brief explanation of how we looked at it and how it works. So we tried to look at the Stirling engine in a new way  because it was practical    weight no longer mattered for our application The internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around. But if you're trying to generate solar energy in a static place the weight doesn't matter so much. The other thing we discovered is that efficiency doesn't matter so much if your energy source is free. Normally  efficiency is crucial because the fuel cost of your engine over its life dwarfs the cost of the engine. But if your fuel source is free  then the only thing that matters is the up front capital cost of the engine. So you don't want to optimize for efficiency  you want to optimize for power per dollar. So using that new twist  with the new criteria  we thought we could re look at the Stirling engine  and also bring genetic algorithms in. Basically  Robert Stirling didn't have Gordon Moore before him to get us three gigahertz of processor power. So we took the same genetic algorithm that we used earlier to make that concentrator  which didn't work out for us  to optimize the Stirling engine  and make its design sizes and all of its dimensions the exact optimum to get the most power per dollar  irrespective of weight  irrespective of size  to get the most conversion of solar energy  because the sun is free. And that's the process we took    let me show you how the engine works. The simplest heat engine  or hot air engine  of all time would be this    take a box  a steel canister  with a piston. Put a flame under it  the piston moves up. Take it off the flame and pour water on it  or let it cool down  the piston moves down. That's a heat engine. That's basically the most fundamental heat engine you could possibly have. The problem is the efficiency is one hundredth of one percent  because you're heating all the metal of the chamber and then cooling all the metal of the chamber each time. And you're only getting power from the air that's heating at the same time  but you're wasting all the energy heating the metal and cooling the metal. So someone came up with a very clever idea  to    instead of heating the whole cylinder and cooling the whole cylinder  what about if you put a displacer inside    a little thing that shuttles the air back and forth. You move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you're only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end  down to the hot end and up to the cold end. So  now you're not alternately heating and cooling the metal  you're just alternately heating and cooling the air. That allows you to get the efficiency up from a hundredth of a percent to about two percent. And then Robert Stirling came along with this genius idea  which was  well I'm still not heating the metal now  with this kind of engine  but I'm still reheating all the air. I'm still heating the air every time and cooling the air every time. What about if I put a thermal sponge in the middle  in the passageway between where the air has to move between hot and cold  So he made fine wires  and cracked glass  and all different kinds of materials to be a heat sponge. So when the air pushes up to go from the hot end to the cold end  it puts some heat into the sponge. And then when the air comes back after it's been cooled it picks up that heat again. So you're reusing your energy five or six times  and that brings the efficiency up between    and    percent It's a little known  but brilliant  genius invention of Robert Stirling that takes the hot air engine from being somewhat impractical    like I found out when I made the real simple version in high school    to very potentially possible  once you get the efficiency up  if you can design this to be low enough cost. So we really set out on a path to try and make the lowest cost possible. We built a huge mathematical model of how a Stirling engine works. We applied the genetic algorithm. We got the results from that for the optimal engine. We built engines    so we built     different engines over the last two years. We measured each one  we readjusted the model to what we measured  and then we led that to the current prototype. It led to a very compact  inexpensive engine  and this is what the engine looks like. Let me show you what it looks like in real life. So this is the engine. It's just a small cylinder down here which holds the generator inside and all the linkage and it's the hot cap    the hot cylinder on the top    this part gets hot  this part is cool  and electricity comes out. The exact converse is also true. If you put electricity in  this will get hot and this will get cold  you get refrigeration. So it's a complete reversible cycle  a very efficient cycle  and quite a simple thing to make. So now you put the two things together. So you have the engine  now what if you combine the petals and the engine in the center  The petals track and the engine gets the concentrated sunlight  take that heat and turn it into electricity. This is what the first prototype of our system looked like together with the petals and the engine in the center. This is being run out in the sun  and now I want to show you what the actual thing looks like. Thank you. So this is a unit with the    petals These petals cost about a dollar each    they're lightweight  injection molded plastic  aluminized. The mechanism to control each petal is below there with a microprocessor on each one. There are thermocouples on the engine    little sensors that detect the heat when the sunlight strikes them. Each petal adjusts itself separately to keep the highest temperature on it. When the sun comes out in the morning  the petals will seek the sun  find it by searching for the highest temperature About a minute and a half or two minutes after the rays are striking the hot cap the engine will be warm enough to start and then the engine will generate electricity for about six and a half hours a day    six and a half to seven hours as the sun moves across the sky A critical part that we can take advantage of is that we have these inexpensive microprocessors and each one of these petals are autonomous  and each one of these petals figures out where the sun is with no user set up. So you don't have to tell what latitude  longitude you're at  you don't have to tell what your roof slope angle is  you don't have to tell what orientation. It doesn't really care. What it does is it searches to find the hottest spot  it searches again a half an hour later  it searches again a day later  it searches again a month later. It basically figures out where on Earth you are by watching the direction the sun moves  so you don't have to actually enter anything about that. The way the unit works is  when the sun comes out the engine will start and you get power out here. We have A.C. and D.C.  get    volts D.C.  so that could be used for certain applications. We have an inverter in there  so you get     volts A.C. and you also get hot water. The hot water's optional. You don't have to use the hot water  it will cool itself. But you can use it to optionally heat hot water and that brings the efficiency up even higher because some of the heat that you would normally be rejecting  you can now use as useful energy  whether it's for a pool or hot water. Let me show you a quick movie of what this looks like running. So this is the first test where we took it outside and each of the petals were individually seeking. And what they do is step  very coarsely at first  and then very finely afterward. Once they get a temperature reading on the thermocouple indicating they found the sun  then they slow down and do a fine search  then all the petals will move into position  and then the engine will start. So  we've been working on this for the last two years. We're very excited about the progress  we do have a very long way to go though still  and let me tell you a little bit more about that. This is how we envision it would be in a residential installation  you'd probably have more than one unit on your roof. It could be on your roof  or in your backyard  or somewhere else. You don't have to have enough units to power your entire house  you just save money with each incremental one you add. So you're still using the grid potentially  in this type of application  to be your back up supply    of course  you can't use these at night  and you can't use these on cloudy days. But by reducing your energy use  pretty much at the peak times    usually when you have you air conditioning on  or other times like that    this generates the peak power at the peak usage time  so it's very complementary in that sense. This is how we would envision a residential application. We also think there's very big potential for energy farms  especially in remote land where there happens to be a lot of sun. It's a really good combination of those two factors. It turns out there's a lot of powerful sun all around the world  obviously  but in special places where it happens to be relatively inexpensive to place these and also in many more places where there is high wind power. So an example of that is  here's the map of the United States. Pretty much everywhere that's not green or blue is a really ideal place  but even the green or blue areas are good  just not as good as the places that are red  orange and yellow. But the hot sport right around Las Vegas and Death Valley and that area is very  very good. And all this does is affect the payback period  it doesn't mean that you couldn't use solar energy  you could use solar energy anywhere on Earth. It just affects the payback period if you're comparing to grid supplied electricity. But if you don't have grid supplied electricity  then the whole question of payback is a different one entirely. It's just how many watts do you get per dollar  and how could you benefit from that using that power to change your life in some way. This is the map of the United States. This is the map of the whole Earth and again  you can see a huge swathe in the middle of pretty much where a large part of the population is  there's tremendous chances for solar energy. And of course  look at Africa. It's just unbelievable what the potential is to take advantage of solar energy there  and I'm really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that. So  in conclusion  I would say my journey has shown me that you can revisit old ideas in a new light  and sometimes ideas that have been discarded in the past can be practical now if you apply some new technology or new twists. We believe we're getting very close to something practical and affordable. Our short term goal for this is to be half the price of solar cells and our longer term goal is to be less than a five year payback. And at less than a five year payback  all of a sudden this becomes very economic So you don't have to just want to have a feel good attitude about energy to want to have one of these. It just makes economic sense. Right now  solar paybacks are between    and    years. If you get it down below five years then it becomes almost a no brainer because the interest to own it    someone else will finance it for you and you can just make money  basically from day one. So that's our real powerful goal that we're really shooting for in the company. Two other things that I learned that were very surprising to me    one was how casual we are about energy. I was walking from the elevator over here  and even just looking at the stage right now    so there's probably        watt lights right now. There's        watts of light pouring on the stage  one horsepower is     watts  at full power. So there's basically    horses running at full speed just to keep the stage lit. Not to mention the     horses that are probably running right now to keep the airconditioning going. And it's just amazing  walk in the elevator and there's lights on in the elevator. Of course  now I'm very sensitive at home when we leave the lights on by mistake. But  everywhere around us we have insatiable use for energy because it's so cheap. And it's cheap because we've been subsidized by energy that's been concentrated by the sun. Basically  oil is solar energy concentrate. It's been pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy to make it have all that energy contained in it. And we don't have a birthright to just use that up as fast as we are  I think. And it would be great if we could find a way to make our energy usage renewable  where as we're using the energy we're creating it at the same pace  and I really hope we can get there. Thank you very much  you've been a great audience. I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation  sharing some of the problems. And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that    being honest about what was going well  what wasn't  and making it kind of an annual thing. A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems  because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally. That is  the market does not drive the scientists  the communicators  the thinkers  the governments to do the right things. And only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to. So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand. But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist. Any tough problem  I think it can be solved. And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past. Over the past century  average lifespan has more than doubled. Another statistic  perhaps my favorite  is to look at childhood deaths. As recently as           million children were born  and    million of those died before the age of five. Five years ago      million children were born    so  more    and less than    million of them died before the age of five. So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate. It's a phenomenal thing. Each one of those lives matters a lot. And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs  vaccines that were used more widely. For example  measles was four million of the deaths back as recently as      and now is under        . So we really can make changes. The next breakthrough is to cut that    million in half again. And I think that's doable in well under    years. Why  Well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths  diarrhea  pneumonia and malaria. So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning  which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos  Well  what's the history of this disease  It's been a severe disease for thousands of years. In fact  if we look at the genetic code  it's the only disease we can see that people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths. Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the     s. So it was absolutely gigantic. And the disease was all over the world. A terrible disease. It was in the United States. It was in Europe. People didn't know what caused it until the early     s  when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos. So it was everywhere. And two tools helped bring the death rate down. One was killing the mosquitos with DDT. The other was treating the patients with quinine  or quinine derivatives. And so that's why the death rate did come down. Now  ironically  what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones  which is where the rich countries are. So we can see        it's everywhere.       it's still most places.       the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.       you've gotten most of the northern areas. And more recently you can see it's just around the equator. And so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries  it doesn't get much investment. For example  there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria. Now  baldness  it's a terrible thing. And rich men are afflicted. And so that's why that priority has been set. But  malaria    even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact. Over     million people at any one time are suffering from it. It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much. Now  malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos. I brought some here  just so you could experience this. We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit. There's no reason only poor people should have the experience. Those mosquitos are not infected. So we've come up with a few new things. We've got bed nets. And bed nets are a great tool. What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night  so the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them. And when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over    percent. And that's happened now in a number of countries. It's great to see. But we have to be careful because malaria    the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves. So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective. And so you end up with two choices. If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way  you do it vigorously  you can actually get a local eradication. And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking. Or  if you go in kind of half heartedly  for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden  but eventually those tools will become ineffective  and the death rate will soar back up again. And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention. Now we're on the upswing. Bed net funding is up. There's new drug discovery going on. Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months. And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective. So we're going to have these new tools. But that alone doesn't give us the road map. Because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things. It involves communicators to keep the funding high  to keep the visibility high  to tell the success stories. It involves social scientists  so we know how to get not just    percent of the people to use the bed nets  but    percent. We need mathematicians to come in and simulate this  to do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together. Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise. We need rich world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things. And so as these elements come together  I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria. Now let me turn to a second question  a fairly different question  but I'd say equally important. And this is  How do you make a teacher great  It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on  and we'd understand very well. And the answer is  really  that we don't. Let's start with why this is important. Well  all of us here  I'll bet  had some great teachers. We all had a wonderful education. That's part of the reason we're here today  part of the reason we're successful. I can say that  even though I'm a college drop out. I had great teachers. In fact  in the United States  the teaching system has worked fairly well. There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places. So the top    percent of students have gotten a good education. And those top    percent have been the best in the world  if you measure them against the other top    percent. And they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the U.S. at the forefront. Now  the strength for those top    percent is starting to fade on a relative basis  but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting. Not only has that been weak. it's getting weaker. And if you look at the economy  it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education. And we have to change this. We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity. We have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education  like science and mathematics. When I first learned the statistics  I was pretty stunned at how bad things are. Over    percent of kids never finish high school. And that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year. Because they weren't tracking where the kids were before that. But most of the dropouts had taken place before that. They had to raise the stated dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over    percent. For minority kids  it's over    percent. And even if you graduate from high school  if you're low income  you have less than a    percent chance of ever completing a college degree. If you're low income in the United States  you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four year degree. And that doesn't seem entirely fair. So  how do you make education better  Now  our foundation  for the last nine years  has invested in this. There's many people working on it. We've worked on small schools  we've funded scholarships  we've done things in libraries. A lot of these things had a good effect. But the more we looked at it  the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing. And we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers  between  say  the top quartile    the very best    and the bottom quartile. How much variation is there within a school or between schools  And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable. A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class    based on test scores    by over    percent in a single year. What does that mean  That means that if the entire U.S.  for two years  had top quartile teachers  the entire difference between us and Asia would go away. Within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away. So  it's simple. All you need are those top quartile teachers. And so you'd say   Wow  we should reward those people. We should retain those people. We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people.  But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today. What are the characteristics of this top quartile  What do they look like  You might think these must be very senior teachers. And the answer is no. Once somebody has taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter. The variation is very  very small. You might think these are people with master's degrees. They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education. This chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality. That bottom thing  which says there's no effect at all  is a master's degree. Now  the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded. One is seniority. Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension. The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree. But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher. Teach for America  slight effect. For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect. But  overwhelmingly  it's your past performance. There are some people who are very good at this. And we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it  to raise the average capability    or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system. You might say   Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave   The answer is  on average  the slightly better teachers leave the system. And it's a system with very high turnover. Now  there are a few places    very few    where great teachers are being made. A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP. KIPP means Knowledge Is Power. It's an unbelievable thing. They have    schools    mostly middle schools  some high schools    and what goes on is great teaching. They take the poorest kids  and over    percent of their high school graduates go to four year colleges. And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools. They're team teaching. They're constantly improving their teachers. They're taking data  the test scores  and saying to a teacher   Hey  you caused this amount of increase.  They're deeply engaged in making teaching better. When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms  at first it's very bizarre. I sat down and I thought   What is going on   The teacher was running around  and the energy level was high. I thought   I'm in the sports rally or something. What's going on   And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention  which kids were bored  and calling kids rapidly  putting things up on the board. It was a very dynamic environment  because particularly in those middle school years    fifth through eighth grade    keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention  nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there. Everybody needs to be involved. And so KIPP is doing it. How does that compare to a normal school  Well  in a normal school  teachers aren't told how good they are. The data isn't gathered. In the teacher's contract  it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom    sometimes to once per year. And they need advanced notice to do that. So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers  some of them just making crap and the management is told   Hey  you can only come down here once a year  but you need to let us know  because we might actually fool you  and try and do a good job in that one brief moment.  Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it. They don't have the test scores  and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data. For example  New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers. And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction. But I'm optimistic about this  I think there are some clear things we can do. First of all  there's a lot more testing going on  and that's given us the picture of where we are. And that allows us to understand who's doing it well  and call them out  and find out what those techniques are. Of course  digital video is cheap now. Putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all public schools. And so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say   OK  here's a little clip of something I thought I did well. Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly. Advise me    when this kid acted up  how should I have dealt with that   And they could all sit and work together on those problems. You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it  have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff. You can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course  learn from that. If you have a kid who's behind  you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept. And in fact  these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet  but you could make it so that DVDs were always available  and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers. And so by thinking of this as a personnel system  we can do it much better. Now there's a book actually  about KIPP    the place that this is going on    that Jay Matthews  a news reporter  wrote    called   Work Hard  Be Nice.  And I thought it was so fantastic. It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does. I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book. Now  we put a lot of money into education  and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have. In fact we have in the stimulus bill    it's interesting    the House version actually had money in it for these data systems  and it was taken out in the Senate because there are people who are threatened by these things. But I    I'm optimistic. I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is  and it really can make a difference for millions of lives  if we get it right. I only had time to frame those two problems. There's a lot more problems like that    AIDS  pneumonia    I can just see you're getting excited  just at the very name of these things. And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad. You know  the system doesn't naturally make it happen. Governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way. The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things. So it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things  get other people involved    and you're helping to come up with solutions. And with that  I think there's some great things that will come out of it. Thank you. I am a writer. Writing books is my profession but it's more than that  of course. It is also my great lifelong love and fascination. And I don't expect that that's ever going to change. But  that said  something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career  which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work. And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book  this memoir called  Eat  Pray  Love  which  decidedly unlike any of my previous books  went out in the world for some reason  and became this big  mega sensation  international bestseller thing. The result of which is that everywhere I go now  people treat me like I'm doomed. Seriously    doomed  doomed  Like  they come up to me now  all worried  and they say   Aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that  Aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all  ever again   So that's reassuring  you know. But it would be worse  except for that I happen to remember that over    years ago  when I was a teenager  when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writer  I was met with this same sort of fear based reaction. And people would say   Aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success  Aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you  Aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure   Like that  you know. The answer    the short answer to all those questions is   Yes.  Yes  I'm afraid of all those things. And I always have been. And I'm afraid of many  many more things besides that people can't even guess at  like seaweed and other things that are scary. But  when it comes to writing  the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately  and wondering about lately  is why  You know  is it rational  Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do. And what is it specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do  you know  Like my dad  for example  was a chemical engineer and I don't recall once in his    years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer  you know   That chemical engineering block  John  how's it going   It just didn't come up like that  you know  But to be fair  chemical engineers as a group haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressives. We writers  we kind of do have that reputation  and not just writers  but creative people across all genres  it seems  have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable. And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the   th century alone  of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands  you know  And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts  you know. Norman Mailer  just before he died  last interview  he said   Every one of my books has killed me a little more.  An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work. But we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this  because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry  in the end  will always ultimately lead to anguish. And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea  Are you comfortable with that  Because you look at it even from an inch away and  you know    I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption. I think it's odious. And I also think it's dangerous  and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century. I think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live. And I definitely know that  in my case    in my situation    it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption  particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career. Which is    you know  like check it out  I'm pretty young  I'm only about    years old. I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me. And it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book  right  I should just put it bluntly  because we're all sort of friends here now    it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me. So Jesus  what a thought  That's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning  and I don't want to go there. I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love. And so  the question becomes  how  And so  it seems to me  upon a lot of reflection  that the way that I have to work now  in order to continue writing  is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct  right  I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me  as I am writing  and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be  from now on. And  as I've been looking  over the last year  for models for how to do that  I've been sort of looking across time  and I've been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity. And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome. So stay with me  because it does circle around and back. But  ancient Greece and ancient Rome    people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then  OK  People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source  for distant and unknowable reasons. The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity  daemons.  Socrates  famously  believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar. The Romans had the same idea  but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius. Which is great  because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual. They believed that a genius was this  sort of magical divine entity  who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio  kind of like Dobby the house elf  and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work. So brilliant    there it is  right there  that distance that I'm talking about    that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work. And everyone knew that this is how it functioned  right  So the ancient artist was protected from certain things  like  for example  too much narcissism  right  If your work was brilliant  you couldn't take all the credit for it  everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you. If your work bombed  not entirely your fault  you know  Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame. And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time. And then the Renaissance came and everything changed  and we had this big idea  and the big idea was  let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries  and there's no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine. And it's the beginning of rational humanism  and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual. And for the first time in history  you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius  rather than having a genius. And I got to tell you  I think that was a huge error. You know  I think that allowing somebody  one mere person to believe that he or she is like  the vessel  you know  like the font and the essence and the source of all divine  creative  unknowable  eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile  human psyche. It's like asking somebody to swallow the sun. It just completely warps and distorts egos  and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance. And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last     years. And  if this is true  and I think it is true  the question becomes  what now  Can we do this differently  Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery. Maybe not. Maybe we can't just erase     years of rational humanistic thought in one    minute speech. And there's probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of  basically  fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff. I'm not  probably  going to bring you all along with me on this. But the question that I kind of want to pose is    you know  why not  Why not think about it this way  Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process. A process which  as anybody who has ever tried to make something    which is to say basically everyone here     knows does not always behave rationally. And  in fact  can sometimes feel downright paranormal. I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone  who's now in her   s  but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia  she would be out working in the fields  and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape. And she said it was like a thunderous train of air. And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape. And she felt it coming  because it would shake the earth under her feet. She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point  and that was to  in her words   run like hell.  And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem  and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her  she could collect it and grab it on the page. And other times she wouldn't be fast enough  so she'd be running and running  and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape  looking  as she put it  for another poet.  And then there were these times    this is the piece I never forgot    she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it  right  So  she's running to the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her  and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her  and then she said  it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it. She would catch the poem by its tail  and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page. And in these instances  the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards  from the last word to the first. So when I heard that I was like    that's uncanny  that's exactly what my creative process is like. That's not at all what my creative process is    I'm not the pipeline  I'm a mule  and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day  and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly. But even I  in my mulishness  even I have brushed up against that thing  at times. And I would imagine that a lot of you have too. You know  even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify. And what is that thing  And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds  but  in fact  might actually keep us sane  And for me  the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom Waits  who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment. And we were talking about this  and you know  Tom  for most of his life  he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist  trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized. But then he got older  he got calmer  and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles  and this is when it all changed for him. And he's speeding along  and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody  that comes into his head as inspiration often comes  elusive and tantalizing  and he wants it  it's gorgeous  and he longs for it  but he has no way to get it. He doesn't have a piece of paper  or a pencil  or a tape recorder. So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like   I'm going to lose this thing  and I'll be be haunted by this song forever. I'm not good enough  and I can't do it.  And instead of panicking  he just stopped. He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel. He just looked up at the sky  and he said   Excuse me  can you not see that I'm driving    Do I look like I can write down a song right now  If you really want to exist  come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you. Otherwise  go bother somebody else today. Go bother Leonard Cohen.  And his whole work process changed after that. Not the work  the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever. But the process  and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie  the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble  and released it back where it came from  and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized  tormented thing. It could be this peculiar  wondrous  bizarre collaboration  kind of conversation between Tom and the strange  external thing that was not quite Tom. When I heard that story  it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too  and this idea already saved me once. It saved me when I was in the middle of writing  Eat  Pray  Love   and I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster  the worst book ever written. Not just bad  but the worst book ever written. And I started to think I should just dump this project. But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it. So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room. And I said aloud   Listen you  thing  you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault  right  Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this  I don't have any more than this. If you want it to be better  you've got to show up and do your part of the deal. But if you don't do that  you know what  the hell with it. I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job. And I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job.  Because    Because in the end it's like this  OK    centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa  people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours  until dawn. They were always magnificent  because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific  right  But every once in a while  very rarely  something would happen  and one of these performers would actually become transcendent. And I know you know what I'm talking about  because I know you've all seen  at some point in your life  a performance like this. It was like time would stop  and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done        nights before  but everything would align. And all of a sudden  he would no longer appear to be merely human. He would be lit from within  and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity. And when this happened  back then  people knew it for what it was  you know  they called it by its name. They would put their hands together and they would start to chant   Allah  Allah  Allah  God  God  God.  That's God  you know. Curious historical footnote  when the Moors invaded southern Spain  they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from  Allah  Allah  Allah   to  Ol   ol   ol    which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances. In Spain  when a performer has done something impossible and magic   Allah  ol   ol   Allah  magnificent  bravo   incomprehensible  there it is    a glimpse of God. Which is great  because we need that. But  the tricky bit comes the next morning  for the dancer himself  when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday at    a.m.  and he's no longer a glimpse of God. He's just an aging mortal with really bad knees  and maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again. And maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins  and what is he then to do with the rest of his life  This is hard. This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life. But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe  in the first place  that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you. But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished  with somebody else. And  you know  if we think about it this way  it starts to change everything. This is how I've started to think  and this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months as I've been working on the book that will soon be published  as the dangerously  frighteningly over anticipated follow up to my freakish success. And what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that is don't be afraid. Don't be daunted. Just do your job. Continue to show up for your piece of it  whatever that might be. If your job is to dance  do your dance. If the divine  cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed  for just one moment through your efforts  then  Ol    And if not  do your dance anyhow. And  Ol    to you  nonetheless. I believe this and I feel that we must teach it.  Ol    to you  nonetheless  just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up. Thank you. Thank you. June Cohen  Ol   'Theme and variations' is one of those forms that require a certain kind of intellectual activity  because you are always comparing the variation with the theme that you hold in your mind. You might say that the theme is nature and everything that follows is a variation on the subject. I was asked  I guess about six years ago  to do a series of paintings that in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca. And it was very difficult for me to imagine how to paint pictures that were based on Piero until I realized that I could look at Piero as nature    that I would have the same attitude towards looking at Piero della Francesca as I would if I were looking out a window at a tree. And that was enormously liberating to me. Perhaps it's not a very insightful observation  but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations based on a work by Piero  in this case that remarkable painting that's in the Uffizi   The Duke of Montefeltro   who faces his consort  Battista. Once I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject  I did the following series of drawings. That's the real Piero della Francesca    one of the greatest portraits in human history. And these  I'll just show these without comment. It's just a series of variations on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro  who's a great  great figure in the Renaissance  and probably the basis for Machiavelli's  The Prince.  He apparently lost an eye in battle  which is why he is always shown in profile. And this is Battista. And then I decided I could move them around a little bit    so that for the first time in history  they're facing the same direction. Whoops  Passed each other. And then a visitor from another painting by Piero  this is from  The Resurrection of Christ     as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat. And now  four large panels  this is upper left  upper right  lower left  lower right. Incidentally  I've never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalism. Since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with there doesn't seem to be an argument there. On another subject    I was driving in the country one day with my wife  and I saw this sign  and I said   That is a fabulous piece of design.  And she said   What are you talking about   I said   Well  it's so persuasive  because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage  and since most people are so suspicious of garages  and know that they're going to be ripped off  they use the word 'reliable.' But everybody says they're reliable. But  reliable Dutchman      Fantastic   Because as soon as you hear the word Dutchman    which is an archaic word  nobody calls Dutch people  Dutchmen  anymore    but as soon as you hear Dutchman  you get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike  preventing the thing from falling and flooding Holland  and so on. And so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of  Dutchman.  Now  if you think I'm exaggerating at all in this  all you have to do is substitute something else  like  Indonesian.  Or even  French.  Now   Swiss  works  but you know it's going to cost a lot of money. I'm going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster. I do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts  where I teach  and the director of this school    a remarkable man named Silas Rhodes    often gives you a piece of text and he says   Do something with this.  And so he did. And this was the text     In words as fashion the same rule will hold  Alike fantastic if too new or old  Be not the first by whom the new are tried  Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.  I could make nothing of that. And I really struggled with this one. And the first thing I did  which was sort of in the absence of another idea  was say I'll sort of write it out and make some words big  and I'll have some kind of design on the back somehow  and I was hoping    as one often does    to stumble into something. So I took another crack at it    you've got to keep it moving    and I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and I pasted them down on an ugly board. I thought that something would come out of it  like  Words rule fantastic new old first last Pope  because it's by Alexander Pope  but I sort of made a mess out of it  and then I thought I'd repeat it in some way so it was legible. So  it was going nowhere. Sometimes  in the middle of a resistant problem  I write down things that I know about it. But you can see the beginning of an idea there  because you can see the word  new  emerging from the  old.  That's what happens. There's a relationship between the old and the new  the new emerges from the context of the old. And then I did some variations of it  but it still wasn't coalescing graphically at all. I had this other version which had something interesting about it in terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues. The W was clearly a W  the N was clearly an N  even though they were very fragmentary and there wasn't a lot of information in it. Then I got the words  new  and  old  and now I had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return. I was really desperate at this point. And so  I do something I'm truthfully ashamed of  which is that I took two drawings I had made for another purpose and I put them together. It says  dreams  at the top. And I was going to do a thing  I say   Well  change the copy. Let it say something about dreams  and come to SVA and you'll sort of fulfill your dreams.  But  to my credit  I was so embarrassed about doing that that I never submitted this sketch. And  finally  I arrived at the following solution. Now  it doesn't look terribly interesting  but it does have something that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters. For one thing  it transgresses the idea of what a poster's supposed to be  which is to be understood and seen immediately  and not explained. I remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts     If you have to explain it  it ain't working.  And one day I woke up and I said   Well  suppose that's not true   So here's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left. It says   Thoughts  This poem is impossible. Silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations. This one generates no imagery at all.  I am now exposing myself to my audience  right  Which is something you never want to do professionally.  Maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening. What's the heart of this poem  Don't be trendy if you want to be serious. Is doing the poster this way trendy in itself  I guess one could reduce the idea further by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old  like this.  And then I show you a little drawing    you see  you remember that old thing I discarded  Well  I found a way to use it. So  there's that little alternative over there  and I say   Not bad      criticizing myself     but more didactic than visual. Maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace  a kind of dance where each defines the other.  And then more self questioning     Am I being simple minded  Is this the kind of simple that looks obvious  or the kind that looks profound  There's a significant difference. This could be embarrassing. Actually  I realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition. Do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school   Well  I think there are two fresh things here    two fresh things. One is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience  and not to suggest that I am confident about what I'm doing. And as you know  you have to have a front. I mean    you've got to be confident  if you don't believe in your work  who else is going to believe in it  So that's one thing  to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics. That can be a big contribution. The other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one  you get the big one and if you don't like that  how about the little one  And that too is a relatively new idea. And here's just a series of experiments where I ask the question of    does a poster have to be square  Now  this is a little illusion. That poster is not folded. It's not folded  that's a photograph and it's cut on the diagonal. Same cheap trick in the upper left hand corner. And here  a very peculiar poster because  simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer  it won't sit still in the space. At times  it seems to be wider at the back than the front  and then it shifts. And if you sit here long enough  it'll float off the page into the audience. But  we don't have time. And then an experiment    a little bit about the nature of perspective  where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective  but the shape of the bottle    which is identical to the outside shape    is seen frontally. And another piece for the art directors' club is  Anna Rees  casting long shadows. This is another poster from the School of Visual Arts. There were    artists invited to participate in it  and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive and I didn't want to be embarrassed  so I worked very hard on this. The idea was    and it was a brilliant idea    was to have    posters distributed throughout the city's subway system so every time you got on the subway you'd be passing a different poster  all of which had a different idea of what art is. But I was absolutely stuck on the idea of  art is  and trying to determine what art was. But then I gave up and I said   Well  art is whatever.  And as soon as I said that  I discovered that the word  hat  was hidden in the word  whatever   and that led me to the inevitable conclusion. But then again  it's on my list of didactic posters. My intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster  in case you don't get it. Now this says   Note to the viewer  I thought I might use a visual cliche of our time    Magritte's everyman    to express the idea that art is mystery  continuity and history. I'm also convinced that  in an age of computer manipulation  surrealism has become banal  a shadow of its former self. The phrase 'Art is whatever' expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art making    a sort of 'it ain't what you do  it's the way that you do it' notion. The shadow of Magritte falls across the central part of the poster a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word 'hat ' hidden in the word 'whatever.' The four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined  as a thing itself  the worth of the thing  the shadow of the thing  and the shape of the thing. Whatever.  OK. And the one that I did not submit  which I still like  I wanted to use the same phrase. There were wonderful experiments by Bruno Munari on letterforms some years ago    sort of  see how far you could go and still be able to read them. And that idea stuck in my head. But then I took the pieces that I had taken off and put them at the bottom. And  of course those are the remains  and they're so labeled. But what really happens is that you read it as   Art is whatever remains.  Thank you. I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid  playing with blocks. As you figured out how to reach out and grasp  pick them up and move them around  you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships. Spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us. So  as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects    along with my adviser Pattie  and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi    I started to wonder    what if when we used a computer  instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop  what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically  arranging it the way we wanted  This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer  by building Siftables. In a nutshell  a Siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie. They're able to be moved around by hand  they can sense each other  they can sense their motion  and they have a screen and a wireless radio. Most importantly  they're physical  so like the blocks  you can move them just by reaching out and grasping. And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information. And as these tools become more physical  more aware of their motion  aware of each other  and aware of the nuance of how we move them  we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles. So  I'm going to start with some simple examples. This Siftable is configured to show video  and if I tilt it in one direction  it'll roll the video this way  if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards. And these interactive portraits are aware of each other. So if I put them next to each other  they get interested. If they get surrounded  they notice that too  they might get a little flustered. And they can also sense their motion and tilt. One of the interesting implications on interaction  we started to realize  was that we could use everyday gestures on data  like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid. So in this case  we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets and I can use them to pour color into that central one  where they get mixed. If we overshoot  we can pour a little bit back. There are also some neat possibilities for education  like language  math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly  and view the results immediately. So here I'm    This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program. Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash up between Scrabble and Boggle. Basically  in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable  and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary. Then  after about    seconds  it reshuffles  and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try. Thank you. So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab  and I managed to get them to try it out  and shoot a video. They really loved it. And  one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions. All you have to say is   Make words   and they know exactly what to do. So here's another few people trying it out. That's our youngest beta tester  down there on the right. Turns out  all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up. So to him  they were just blocks. Now  this is an interactive cartoon application. And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners. And this is Felix  actually. And he can bring new characters into the scene  just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them. Here  he's bringing the sun out. Video  The sun is rising. David Merrill  Now he's brought a tractor into the scene. Video  The orange tractor. Good job  Yeah  DM  So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact    Video  Woof  DM  inventing his own narrative. Video  Hello  DM  It's an open ended story  and he gets to decide how it unfolds. Video  Fly away  cat. DM  So  the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we've built recently  in which Siftables act as sounds like lead  bass and drums. Each of these has four different variations  you get to choose which one you want to use. And you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want. And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable. There are effects that you can control live  like reverb and filter. You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it. And then  overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence. So let's have a look. Video   Music  DM  We'll start by putting a lead into two sequence Siftables  arrange them into a series  extend it  add a little more lead. Now I put a bass line in. Video   Music  DM  Now I'll put some percussion in. Video   Music  DM  And now I'll attach the filter to the drums  so I can control the effect live. Video   Music  DM  I can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo one way or the other. Video   Music  DM  And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression. Video   Music  DM  I can rearrange the sequence while it plays. So I don't have to plan it out in advance  but I can improvise  making it longer or shorter as I go. And now  finally  I can fade the whole sequence out using the volume Siftable  tilted to the left. Thank you. So  as you can see  my passion is for making new human computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work. And today  I had time to show you one point in this new design space  and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory. So the thought I want to leave you with is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms. Thank you very much. I look forward to talking with all of you. In his inaugural address  Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis. But what did he appeal to  He did not  happily  follow in the footsteps of his predecessor  and tell us to just go shopping. Nor did he tell us   Trust us. Trust your country. Invest  invest  invest.  Instead  what he told us was to put aside childish things. And he appealed to virtue. Virtue is an old fashioned word. It seems a little out of place in a cutting edge environment like this one. And besides  some of you might be wondering  what the hell does it mean  Let me begin with an example. This is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen. And all of the items on it are unremarkable. They're the things you would expect  mop the floors  sweep them  empty the trash  restock the cabinets. It may be a little surprising how many things there are  but it's not surprising what they are. But the one thing I want you to notice about them is this  even though this is a very long list  there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings. Not one. The janitor's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital. And yet  when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like  they encountered Mike  who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because Mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise  trying to build up his strength  walking slowly up and down the hall. And Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor's admonition and didn't vacuum the visitor's lounge because there were some family members who were there all day  every day who  at this moment  happened to be taking a nap. And then there was Luke  who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice because the man's father  who had been keeping a vigil for six months  didn't see Luke do it the first time  and his father was angry. And behavior like this from janitors  from technicians  from nurses and  if we're lucky now and then  from doctors  doesn't just make people feel a little better  it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well. Now  not all janitors are like this  of course. But the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness  care and empathy are an essential part of the job. And yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings. These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people. And beyond this  they have the moral skill to figure out what  doing right  means.  Practical wisdom   Aristotle told us   is the combination of moral will and moral skill.  A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule  as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives. A wise person knows how to improvise  as Luke did when he re washed the floor. Real world problems are often ambiguous and ill defined and the context is always changing. A wise person is like a jazz musician    using the notes on the page  but dancing around them  inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand. A wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims. To serve other people  not to manipulate other people. And finally  perhaps most important  a wise person is made  not born. Wisdom depends on experience  and not just any experience. You need the time to get to know the people that you're serving. You need permission to be allowed to improvise  try new things  occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures. And you need to be mentored by wise teachers. When you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described how hard it is to learn to do their job  they tell you that it takes lots of experience. And they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans. It takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people. At TED  brilliance is rampant. It's scary. The good news is you don't need to be brilliant to be wise. The bad news is that without wisdom  brilliance isn't enough. It's as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else. Now  I hope that we all know this. There's a sense in which it's obvious  and yet  let me tell you a little story. It's a story about lemonade. A dad and his seven year old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark. His son asked him for some lemonade and Dad went to the concession stand to buy it. All they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade  which was five percent alcohol. Dad  being an academic  had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade contained alcohol. So he brought it back. And the kid was drinking it  and a security guard spotted it  and called the police  who called an ambulance that rushed to the ballpark  whisked the kid to the hospital. The emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood. And they were ready to let the kid go. But not so fast. The Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no. And the child was sent to a foster home for three days. At that point  can the child go home  Well  a judge said yes  but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel. After two weeks  I'm happy to report  the family was reunited. But the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing   We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure.  How do things like this happen  Scott Simon  who told this story on NPR  said   Rules and procedures may be dumb  but they spare you from thinking.  And  to be fair  rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lax and they let a child go back to an abusive household. Fair enough. When things go wrong  as of course they do  we reach for two tools to try to fix them. One tool we reach for is rules. Better ones  more of them. The second tool we reach for is incentives. Better ones  more of them. What else  after all  is there  We can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis. Regulate  regulate  regulate. Fix the incentives  fix the incentives  fix the incentives ... The truth is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job. How could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did  And would you pay them a bonus for being empathic  It's preposterous on its face. And what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules  rules and incentives may make things better in the short run  but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run. Moral skill is chipped away by an over reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisations. And moral will is undermined by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing. And without intending it  by appealing to rules and incentives  we are engaging in a war on wisdom. Let me just give you a few examples  first of rules and the war on moral skill. The lemonade story is one. Second  no doubt more familiar to you  is the nature of modern American education  scripted  lock step curricula. Here's an example from Chicago kindergarten. Reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with 'B.'  The Bath   Assemble students on a rug and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water. Say    items in this script to teach a    page picture book. All over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city  every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day. We know why these scripts are there. We don't trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own. Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster. And they prevent disaster. But what they assure in its place is mediocrity. Don't get me wrong. We need rules  Jazz musicians need some notes    most of them need some notes on the page. We need more rules for the bankers  God knows. But too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising. And as a result  they lose their gifts  or worse  they stop playing altogether. Now  how about incentives  They seem cleverer. If you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing  it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it. Right  Well  not always. Sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complimenting  and they make people less likely to do it. I'll just give you one example because time is racing. In Switzerland  back about    years ago  they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps. There was going to be a national referendum. Some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed. And they said   Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community   Astonishingly     percent of the citizens said yes. They knew it was dangerous. They thought it would reduce their property values. But it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens. The psychologists asked other people a slightly different question. They said   If we paid you six weeks' salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community   Two reasons. It's my responsibility and I'm getting paid. Instead of    percent saying yes     percent said yes. What happens is that the second this introduction of incentive gets us so that instead of asking   What is my responsibility   all we ask is   What serves my interests   When incentives don't work  when CEOs ignore the long term health of their companies in pursuit of short term gains that will lead to massive bonuses  the response is always the same. Get smarter incentives. The truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough. Any incentive system can be subverted by bad will. We need incentives. People have to make a living. But excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word. It causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality. Barack Obama said  before he was inaugurated   We must ask not just 'Is it profitable ' but 'Is it right '  And when professions are demoralized  everyone in them becomes dependent on    addicted to    incentives and they stop asking  Is it right   We see this in medicine. And we certainly see it in the world of business. It is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work. So what can we do  A few sources of hope  we ought to try to re moralize work. One way not to do it  teach more ethics courses. There is no better way to show people that you're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course. What to do instead  One  Celebrate moral exemplars. Acknowledge  when you go to law school  that a little voice is whispering in your ear about Atticus Finch. No    year old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions. People are inspired by moral heroes. But we learn that with sophistication comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes. Well  acknowledge them. Be proud that you have them. Celebrate them. And demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too. That's one thing we can do. I don't know how many of you remember this  another moral hero     years ago  Aaron Feuerstein  who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts    they made Polartec    The factory burned down.       employees. He kept every one of them on the payroll. Why  Because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go.  Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street  but I can tell you it's worth more. We're doing fine.  Just at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes. Two were particularly inspiring to me. One was Ray Anderson  who turned       turned  you know  a part of the evil empire into a zero footprint  or almost zero footprint business. Why  Because it was the right thing to do. And a bonus he's discovering is he's actually going to make even more money. His employees are inspired by the effort. Why  Because there happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do. Yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re foresting in Indonesia. In many ways this is the perfect example. Because it took the will to do the right thing. God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill. I'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know in order to plot this out. But most important to make it work    and he emphasized this    is that it took knowing the people in the communities. Unless the people you're working with are behind you  this will fail. And there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you  because different people in different communities organize their lives in different ways. So there's a lot here at TED  and at other places  to celebrate. And you don't have to be a mega hero. There are ordinary heroes. Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too. As practitioners each and every one of us should strive to be ordinary  if not extraordinary heroes. As heads of organizations  we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will. Even the wisest and most well meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work. If you run an organization  you should be sure that none of the jobs    none of the jobs    have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors. Because the truth is that any work that you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work. And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom. And  perhaps most important  as teachers  we should strive to be the ordinary heroes  the moral exemplars  to the people we mentor. And there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers. One is that we are always teaching. Someone is always watching. The camera is always on. Bill Gates talked about the importance of education and  in particular  the model that KIPP was providing   Knowledge is power.  And he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that KIPP is doing to take inner city kids and turn them in the direction of college. I want to focus on one particular thing KIPP is doing that Bill didn't mention. That is that they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character. They need to learn to respect themselves. They need to learn to respect their schoolmates. They need to learn to respect their teachers. And  most important  they need to learn to respect learning. That's the principle objective. If you do that  the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill. And the teachers  the way you teach these things to the kids is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day. Obama appealed to virtue. And I think he was right. And the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom  because it's what allows other virtues    honesty  kindness  courage and so on    to be displayed at the right time and in the right way. He also appealed to hope. Right again. I think there is reason for hope. I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous. In many ways  it's what TED is all about. Wanting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons. This kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention. Paying attention to what we do  to how we do it  and  perhaps most importantly  to the structure of the organizations within which we work  so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than having it suppressed. Thank you very much. Thank you. Chris Anderson  You have to go and stand out here a sec. Barry Schwartz  Thank you very much. There's a great big elephant in the room called the economy. So let's start talking about that. I wanted to give you a current picture of the economy. That's what I have behind myself. But of course what we have to remember is this. And what you have to think about is  when you're dancing in the flames  what's next  So what I'm going to try to do in the next    and a half minutes is I'm going to talk first about the flames    where we are in the economy    and then I'm going to take three trends that have taken place at TED over the last    years and that will take place in this conference and I will try and bring them together. And I will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like. Those three trends are the ability to engineer cells  the ability to engineer tissues  and robots. And somehow it will all make sense. But anyway  let's start with the economy. There's a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there. One is leverage. And the problem with leverage is it makes the U.S. financial system look like this. So  a normal commercial bank has nine to    times leverage. That means for every dollar you deposit  it loans out about nine or   . A normal investment bank is not a deposit bank  it's an investment bank  it has    to    times. It turns out that B of A in September had    times. And your friendly Citibank had    times. Oops. That means every bad loan goes bad    times over. And that  of course  is the reason why all of you are making such generous and wonderful donations to these nice folks. And as you think about that  you've got to wonder  so what do banks have in store for you now  It ain't pretty. The government  meanwhile  has been acting like Santa Claus. We all love Santa Claus  right  But the problem with Santa Clause is  if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing and promising folks  it turned out that in          percent was mandatory spending on what we call  entitlements.  And then by      it was    percent. And we weren't supposed to run into     percent until about     . Except we've been so busy giving away a trillion here  a trillion there  that we've brought that date of reckoning forward to about     . And we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids  but  guess what  We're going to start to pay them. And the problem with this stuff is  now that the bill's come due  it turns out Santa isn't quite as cute when it's summertime. Right  Here's some advice from one of the largest investors in the United States. This guy runs the China Investment Corporation. He is the main buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds. And he gave an interview in December. Here's his first bit of advice. And here's his second bit of advice. And  by the way  the Chinese Prime Minister reiterated this at Davos last Sunday. This stuff is getting serious enough that if we don't start paying attention to the deficit  we're going to end up losing the dollar. And then all bets are off. Let me show you what it looks like. I think I can safely say that I'm the only trillionaire in this room. This is an actual bill. And it's    triliion dollars. The only problem with this bill is it's not really worth very much. That was eight bucks last week  four bucks this week  a buck next week. And that's what happens to currencies when you don't stand behind them. So the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep  and sometimes this creature's called Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes ... whatever you want    you've just got to say no. And you've got to start banishing a word that's called  entitlement.  And the reason we have to do that in the short term is because we have just run out of cash. If you look at the federal budget  this is what it looks like. The orange slice is what's discretionary. Everything else is mandated. It makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to Alaska in the overall scheme of things. So what we have to start thinking about doing is capping our medical spending because that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget. We've got to start thinking about asking people to retire a little bit later. If you're    to    you retire on time. Your     k  just got nailed. If you're    to    we want you to work two years more. If you're under    we want you to work four more years. The reason why that's reasonable is  when your grandparents were given Social Security  they got it at    and were expected to check out at   . Sixty eight is young today. We've also got to cut the military about three percent a year. We've got to limit other mandatory spending. We've got to quit borrowing as much  because otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie. And we've got to end up with a smaller government. And if we don't start changing this trend line  we are going to lose the dollar and start to look like Iceland. I got what you're thinking. This is going to happen when hell freezes over. But let me remind you this December it did snow in Vegas. Here's what happens if you don't address this stuff. So  Japan had a fiscal real estate crisis back in the late '  s. And its     largest companies today are worth one quarter of what they were    years ago. We don't fix this now  how would you like to see a Dow       in       Because that's the consequence of not dealing with this stuff. And unless you want this person to not just become the CFO of Florida  but the United States  we'd better deal with this stuff. That's the short term. That's the flame part. That's the financial crisis. Now  right behind the financial crisis there's a second and bigger wave that we need to talk about. That wave is much larger  much more powerful  and that's of course the wave of technology. And what's really important in this stuff is  as we cut  we also have to grow. Among other things  because startup companies are .   percent of U.S. GDP investmentm and they're about   .  percent of output. It's groups like that in this room that generate the future of the U.S. economy. And that's what we've got to keep growing. We don't have to keep growing these bridges to nowhere. So let's bring a romance novelist into this conversation. And that's where these three trends come together. That's where the ability to engineer microbes  the ability to engineer tissues  and the ability to engineer robots begin to lead to a reboot. And let me recap some of the stuff you've seen. Craig Venter showed up last year and showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware where you can insert DNA and have it boot up as a different species. In parallel  the folks at MIT have been building a standard registry of biological parts. So think of it as a Radio Shack for biology. You can go out and get your proteins  your RNA  your DNA  whatever. And start building stuff. In      they brought together high school students and college students and started to build these little odd creatures. They just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards. Here was one of the first things they built. So  cells have this cycle. First they don't grow. Then they grow exponentially. Then they stop growing. Graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in. So they engineered these cells so that when they're growing in the exponential phase  they would smell like wintergreen. And when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas. And you could tell very easily when your experiment was working and wasn't  and where it was in the phase. This got a bit more complicated two years later. Twenty one countries came together. Dozens of teams. They started competing. The team from Rice University started to engineer the substance in red wine that makes red wine good for you into beer. So you take resveratrol and you put it into beer. Of course  one of the judges is wandering by  and he goes   Wow  Cancer fighting beer  There is a God.  The team from Taiwan was a little bit more ambitious. They tried to engineer bacterias in such a way that they would act as your kidneys. Four years ago  I showed you this picture. And people oohed and ahhed  because Cliff Tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken. And that was very cool stuff back then. But now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering  let me show you what's happened in that period of time. Two years ago  you saw this creature. An almost extinct animal from Xochimilco  Mexico called an axolotl that can re generate its limbs. You can freeze half its heart. It regrows. You can freeze half the brain. It regrows. It's almost like leaving Congress. But now  you don't have to have the animal itself to regenerate  because you can build cloned mice molars in Petri dishes. And  of course if you can build mice molars in Petri dishes  you can grow human molars in Petri dishes. This should not surprise you  right  I mean  you're born with no teeth. You give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy. You re grow a set of teeth. But then if you lose one of those second set of teeth  they don't regrow  unless  if you're a lawyer. But  of course  for most of us  we know how to grow teeth  and therefore we can take adult stem teeth  put them on a biodegradable mold  re grow a tooth  and simply implant it. And we can do it with other things. So  a Spanish woman who was dying of T.B. had a donor trachea  they took all the cells off the trachea  they spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage. She regrew her own trachea  and    hours later it was implanted. She's now running around with her kids. This is going on in Tony Atala's lab in Wake Forest where he is re growing ears for injured soldiers  and he's also re growing bladders. So there are now nine women walking around Boston with re grown bladders  which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags for the rest of your life. This is kind of getting boring  right  I mean  you understand where this story's going. But  I mean it gets more interesting. Last year  this group was able to take all the cells off a heart  leaving just the cartilage. Then  they sprayed stem cells onto that heart  from a mouse. Those stem cells self organized  and that heart started to beat. Life happens. This may be one of the ultimate papers. This was done in Japan and in the U.S.  published at the same time  and it rebooted skin cells into stem cells  last year. That meant that you can take the stuff right here  and turn it into almost anything in your body. And this is becoming common  it's moving very quickly  it's moving in a whole series of places. Third trend  robots. Those of us of a certain age grew up expecting that by now we would have Rosie the Robot from  The Jetsons  in our house. And all we've got is a Roomba. We also thought we'd have this robot to warn us of danger. Didn't happen. And these were robots engineered for a flat world  right  So  Rosie runs around on skates and the other one ran on flat threads. If you don't have a flat world  that's not good  which is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different. This is Boston Dynamics'  BigDog.  And this is about as close as you can get to a physical Turing test. O.K.  so let me remind you  a Turing test is where you've got a wall  you're talking to somebody on the other side of the wall  and when you don't know if that thing is human or animal    that's when computers have reached human intelligence. This is not an intelligence Turing rest  but this is as close as you can get to a physical Turing test. And this stuff is moving very quickly  and by the way  that thing can carry about     pounds of weight. These are not the only interesting robots. You've also got flies  the size of flies  that are being made by Robert Wood at Harvard. You've got Stickybots that are being made at Stanford. And as you bring these things together  as you bring cells  biological tissue engineering and mechanics together  you begin to get some really odd questions. In the last Olympics  this gentleman  who had several world records in the Special Olympics  tried to run in the normal Olympics. The only issue with Oscar Pistorius is he was born without bones in the lower part of his legs. He came within about a second of qualifying. He sued to be allowed to run  and he won the suit  but didn't qualify by time. Next Olympics  you can bet that Oscar  or one of Oscar's successors  is going to make the time. And two or three Olympics after that  they are going to be unbeatable. And as you bring these trends together  and as you think of what it means to take people who are profoundly deaf  who can now begin to hear    I mean  remember the evolution of hearing aids  right  I mean  your grandparents had these great big cones  and then your parents had these odd boxes that would squawk at odd times during dinner  and now we have these little buds that nobody sees. And now you have cochlear implants that go into people's heads and allow the deaf to begin to hear. Now  they can't hear as well as you and I can. But  in    or    machine generations they will  and these are machine generations  not human generations. And about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can  they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing  or how whales talk  or how dogs talk  and other types of tonal scales. They'll be able to focus their hearing  they'll be able to increase the sensitivity  decrease the sensitivity  do a series of things that we can't do. And the same thing is happening in eyes. This is a group in Germany that's beginning to engineer eyes so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark. Very primitive. And then they'll be able to see shape. And then they'll be able to see color  and then they'll be able to see in definition  and one day  they'll see as well as you and I can. And a couple of years after that  they'll be able to see in ultraviolet  they'll be able to see in infrared  they'll be able to focus their eyes  they'll be able to come into a microfocus. They'll do stuff you and I can't do. All of these things are coming together  and it's a particularly important thing to understand  as we worry about the flames of the present  to keep an eye on the future. And  of course  the future is looking back     years  because next week is the    th anniversary of Darwin's birth. And it's the    th anniversary of the publication of  The Origin of Species.  And Darwin  of course  argued that evolution is a natural state. It is a natural state in everything that is alive  including hominids. There have actually been    species of hominids that have been around  have evolved  have wandered in different places  have gone extinct. It is common for hominids to evolve. And that's the reason why  as you look at the hominid fossil record  erectus  and heidelbergensis  and floresiensis  and Neanderthals  and Homo sapiens  all overlap. The common state of affairs is to have overlapping versions of hominids  not one. And as you think of the implications of that  here's a brief history of the universe. The universe was created   .  billion years ago  and then you created all the stars  and all the planets  and all the galaxies  and all the Milky Ways. And then you created Earth about  .  billion years ago  and then you got life about four billion years ago  and then you got hominids about  .    billion years ago  and then you got our version of hominids about  .     billion years ago. Ta dah  Maybe the reason for thr creation of the universe  and all the galaxies  and all the planets  and all the energy  and all the dark energy  and all the rest of stuff is to create what's in this room. Maybe not. That would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint. So  if that's not the purpose of the universe  then what's next  I think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid. I think we're going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evolutis. And I think this isn't       years out. I think most of us are going to glance at it  and our grandchildren are going to begin to live it. And a Homo evolutis brings together these three trends into a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control over the evolution of his species  her species and other species. And that  of course  would be the ultimate reboot. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Let's now see the extraordinary speech that we captured a couple weeks ago. Jose Antonio Abreu  My dear friends  ladies and gentlemen  I am overjoyed today at being awarded the TED Prize on behalf of all the distinguished music teachers  artists and educators from Venezuela who have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for    years in founding  growing and developing in Venezuela the National System of Youth and Children's Orchestras and Choirs. Since I was a boy  in my early childhood  I always wanted to be a musician  and  thank God  I made it. From my teachers  my family and my community  I had all the necessary support to become a musician. All my life I've dreamed that all Venezuelan children have the same opportunity that I had. From that desire and from my heart stemmed the idea to make music a deep and global reality for my country. From the very first rehearsal  I saw the bright future ahead. Because the rehearsal meant a great challenge to me. I had received a donation of    music stands to be used by     boys in that rehearsal. When I arrived at the rehearsal  only    kids had shown up  and I said to myself   Do I close the program or multiply these kids   I decided to face the challenge  and on that same night  I promised those    children I'd turn our orchestra into one of the leading orchestras in the world. Two months ago  I remembered that promise I made  when a distinguished English critic published an article in the London Times  asking who could be the winner of the Orchestra World Cup. He mentioned four great world orchestras  and the fifth one was Venezuela's Youth Symphony Orchestra. Today we can say that art in Latin America is no longer a monopoly of elites and that it has become a social right  a right for all the people. Child  There is no difference here between classes  nor white or black  nor if you have money or not. Simply  if you are talented  if you have the vocation and the will to be here  you get in. You share with us and make music. JA  During the recent tour by the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela of U.S. and Europe  we saw how our music moved young audiences to the bottom of their souls  how children and adolescents rushed up to the stage to receive the jackets from our musicians  how the standing ovations  sometimes    minutes long  seemed to last forever  and how the public  after the concert was over  went out into the street to greet our young people in triumph. This meant not only an artistic triumph  but also a profound emotional sympathy between the public of the most advanced nations of the world and the musical youth of Latin America  as seen in Venezuela  giving these audiences a message of music  vitality  energy  enthusiasm and strength. In its essence  the orchestra and the choir are much more than artistic structures. They are examples and schools of social life  because to sing and to play together means to intimately coexist toward perfection and excellence  following a strict discipline of organization and coordination in order to seek the harmonic interdependence of voices and instruments. That's how they build a spirit of solidarity and fraternity among them  develop their self esteem and foster the ethical and aesthetical values related to the music in all its senses. This is why music is immensely important in the awakening of sensibility  in the forging of values and in the training of youngsters to teach other kids. Child  After all this time here  music is life. Nothing else. Music is life. JA  Each teenager and child in El Sistema has his own story  and they are all important and of great significance to me. Let me mention the case of Edicson Ruiz. He is a boy from a parish in Caracas who passionately attended to his double bass lessons at the San Agustin's Junior Orchestra. With his effort  and the support of his mother  his family and his community  he became a principal member in the double bass segment of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. We have another well known case    Gustavo Dudamel. He started as a boy member of the children's orchestra in his hometown  Barquisimeto. There  he grew as a violinist and as a conductor. He became the conductor of Venezuela's junior orchestras  and today conducts the world's greatest orchestras. He is the musical director of Los Angeles Philharmonic  and is still the overall leader of Venezuela's junior orchestras. He was the conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra  and he's an unbeatable example for young musicians in Latin America and the world. The structure of El Sistema is based on a new and flexible managing style adapted to the features of each community and region  and today attends to         children of the lower and middle class all over Venezuela. It's a program of social rescue and deep cultural transformation designed for the whole Venezuelan society with absolutely no distinctions whatsoever  but emphasizing the vulnerable and endangered social groups. The effect of El Sistema is felt in three fundamental circles  in the personal social circle  in the family circle and in the community. In the personal social circle  the children in the orchestras and choirs develop their intellectual and emotional side. The music becomes a source for developing the dimensions of the human being  thus elevating the spirit and leading man to a full development of his personality. So  the emotional and intellectual profits are huge    the acquisition of leadership  teaching and training principles  the sense of commitment  responsibility  generosity and dedication to others  and the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals. All this leads to the development of self esteem and confidence. Mother Teresa of Calcutta insisted on something that always impressed me  the most miserable and tragic thing about poverty is not the lack of bread or roof  but the feeling of being no one    the feeling of not being anyone  the lack of identification  the lack of public esteem. That's why the child's development in the orchestra and the choir provides him with a noble identity and makes him a role model for his family and community. It makes him a better student at school because it inspires in him a sense of responsibility  perseverance and punctuality that will greatly help him at school. Within the family  the parents' support is unconditional. The child becomes a role model for both his parents  and this is very important for a poor child. Once the child discovers he is important to his family  he begins to seek new ways of improving himself and hopes better for himself and his community. Also  he hopes for social and economic improvements for his own family. All this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic. The large majority of our children belong  as I already mentioned  to the most vulnerable strata of the Venezuelan population. That encourages them to embrace new dreams  new goals  and progress in the various opportunities that music has to offer. Finally  in the circle of the community  the orchestras prove to be the creative spaces of culture and sources of exchange and new meanings. The spontaneity music has excludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society. It's what makes a child play a violin at home  while his father works in his carpentry. It's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home  while her mother does the housework. The idea is that the families join with pride and joy in the activities of the orchestras and the choirs that their children belong to. The huge spiritual world that music produces in itself  which also lies within itself  ends up overcoming material poverty. From the minute a child's taught how to play an instrument  he's no longer poor. He becomes a child in progress heading for a professional level  who'll later become a full citizen. Needless to say that music is the number one prevention against prostitution  violence  bad habits  and everything degrading in the life of a child. A few years ago  historian Arnold Toynbee said that the world was suffering a huge spiritual crisis. Not an economic or social crisis  but a spiritual one. I believe that to confront such a crisis  only art and religion can give proper answers to humanity  to mankind's deepest aspirations  and to the historic demands of our times. Education    the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge    is the means to strive for a more perfect  more aware  more noble and more just society. With passion and enthusiasm we pay profound respects to TED for its outstanding humanism  the scope of its principles  for its open and generous promotion of young values. We hope that TED can contribute in a full and fundamental way to the building of this new era in the teaching of music  in which the social  communal  spiritual and vindicatory aims of the child and the adolescent become a beacon and a goal for a vast social mission. No longer putting society at the service of art  and much less at the services of monopolies of the elite  but instead art at the service of society  at the service of the weakest  at the service of the children  at the service of the sick  at the service of the vulnerable  and at the service of all those who cry for vindication through the spirit of their human condition and the raising up of their dignity. CA  We are going live now to Caracas. We are going live to Caracas to hear Maestro Abreu's TED Prize wish. JA  Here is my TED Prize wish  I wish that you'll help to create and document a special training program for    gifted young musicians  passionate about their art and social justice  and dedicated to bringing El Sistema to the United States and other countries. Thank you very much. Fifty years ago  when I began exploring the ocean  no one    not Jacques Perrin  not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson    imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it. It seemed  at that time  to be a sea of Eden  but now we know  and now we are facing paradise lost. I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us  and to consider why it matters that in    years  we've lost    actually  we've taken  we've eaten    more than    percent of the big fish in the sea  why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared  why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying  but it really should concern you. It does concern you  as well. I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls  tomorrow's child   asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time. Well  now is that time. I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and  in so doing  secure hope for humankind. Health to the ocean means health for us. And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. And I hope  Jill  that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet. Did I say that  I guess I did. For me  as a scientist  it all began in      when I first tried scuba. It's when I first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter. I actually love diving at night  you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime. Diving day and night was really easy for me in       when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time    at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon. In      I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim. It was six miles offshore and       feet down. It's one of my favorite bathing suits. Since then  I've used about    kinds of submarines and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea. I led a five year National Geographic expedition  the Sustainable Seas expeditions  using these little subs. They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it. And I'm living proof. Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air  food  water  temperature    all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea. I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system  and then he pointed to this and he said   Life support system.  We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it. The poet Auden said   Thousands have lived without love  none without water.  Ninety seven percent of Earth's water is ocean. No blue  no green. If you think the ocean isn't important  imagine Earth without it. Mars comes to mind. No ocean  no life support system. I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said   There it is  The World Bank   That's where all the assets are  And we've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them. Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment. With every drop of water you drink  every breath you take  you're connected to the sea. No matter where on Earth you live. Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea. Over time  most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there  mostly by microbes. The ocean drives climate and weather  stabilizes temperature  shapes Earth's chemistry. Water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain  sleet and snow  and provides home for about    percent of life in the world  maybe in the universe. No water  no life  no blue  no green. Yet we have this idea  we humans  that the Earth    all of it  the oceans  the skies    are so vast and so resilient it doesn't matter what we do to it. That may have been true        years ago  and maybe even       years ago but in the last      especially in the last     we've drawn down the assets  the air  the water  the wildlife that make our lives possible. New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature  the nature of what's happening  showing us our impact on the Earth. I mean  first you have to know that you've got a problem. And fortunately  in our time  we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history. And with knowing comes caring. And with caring  there's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us. But first we have to know. Three years ago  I met John Hanke  who's the head of Google Earth  and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously. But I asked him   When are you going to finish it  You did a great job with the land  the dirt. What about the water   Since then  I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers  with DOER Marine  with National Geographic  with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world  ones that we could enlist  to put the ocean in Google Earth. And as of just this week  last Monday  Google Earth is now whole. Consider this  Starting right here at the convention center  we can find the nearby aquarium  we can look at where we're sitting  and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium  the ocean  and California's four national marine sanctuaries  and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands  not just the little bit that pokes through the surface  but also what's below. To see    wait a minute  we can go kshhplash     right there  ha    under the ocean  see what the whales see. We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands. We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales. These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater. There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale. We can pick up and fly to the deepest place  seven miles down  the Mariana Trench  where only two people have ever been. Imagine that. It's only seven miles  but only two people have been there     years ago. One way trips are easy. We need new deep diving submarines. How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration  We need to see deep trenches  the undersea mountains  and understand life in the deep sea. We can now go to the Arctic. Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole. An ice free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century. That's bad news for the polar bears. That's bad news for us too. Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming  it's also changing ocean chemistry  making the sea more acidic. That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen producing plankton. Also it's bad news for us. We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea. Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets  gear that continues to kill. We're clogging the ocean  poisoning the planet's circulatory system  and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife  all carbon based units. Barbarically  we're killing sharks for shark fin soup  undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle  the nitrogen cycle  the oxygen cycle  the water cycle    our life support system. We're still killing bluefin tuna  truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead. All of these parts are part of our life support system. We kill using long lines  with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for    miles or more. Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers  taking everything in their path. Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers    in China  the North Sea  the Gulf of Mexico    shaking the foundation of our life support system  leaving plumes of death in their path. The next time you dine on sushi    or sashimi  or swordfish steak  or shrimp cocktail  whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean    think of the real cost. For every pound that goes to market  more than    pounds  even     pounds  may be thrown away as bycatch. This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea. This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from      to     . The highest concentrations are in red. In my lifetime  imagine     percent of the big fish have been killed. Most of the turtles  sharks  tunas and whales are way down in numbers. But  there is good news. Ten percent of the big fish still remain. There are still some blue whales. There are still some krill in Antarctica. There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay. Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape  a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet. There's still time  but not a lot  to turn things around. But business as usual means that in    years  there may be no coral reefs    and no commercial fishing  because the fish will simply be gone. Imagine the ocean without fish. Imagine what that means to our life support system. Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too  but the problems are more obvious  and some actions are being taken to protect trees  watersheds and wildlife. And in       with Yellowstone National Park  the United States began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea America ever had. About    percent of the land around the world is now protected  safeguarding biodiversity  providing a carbon sink  generating oxygen  protecting watersheds. And  in       this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea  National Marine Sanctuaries. That's another great idea. The good news is that there are now more than       places in the sea  around the world  that have some kind of protection. And you can find them on Google Earth. The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them. In the last three years  for example  the U.S. protected         square miles of ocean as national monuments. But it only increased from  .  of one percent to  .  of one percent of the ocean protected  globally. Protected areas do rebound  but it takes a long time to restore    year old rockfish or monkfish  sharks or sea bass  or     year old orange roughy. We don't consume     year old cows or chickens. Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream of an encyclopedia of life  or the census of marine life  will live not just as a list  a photograph  or a paragraph. With scientists around the world  I've been looking at the    percent of the ocean that is open to fishing    and mining  and drilling  and dumping  and whatever    to search out hope spots  and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future. Such as the Arctic    we have one chance  right now  to get it right. Or the Antarctic  where the continent is protected  but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill  whales and fish. Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows.    percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected  but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing. It's true too in Argentina on the Patagonian shelf  which is now in serious trouble. The high seas  where whales  tuna and dolphins travel    the largest  least protected  ecosystem on Earth  filled with luminous creatures  living in dark waters that average two miles deep. They flash  and sparkle  and glow with their own living light. There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child. The next    years may be the most important  and the next        years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life. To cope with climate change  we need new ways to generate power. We need new ways  better ways  to cope with poverty  wars and disease. We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place. But  nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean. Our fate and the ocean's are one. We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above. A global plan of action with a world conservation union  the IUCN  is underway to protect biodiversity  to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change  on the high seas and in coastal areas  wherever we can identify critical places. New technologies are needed to map  photograph and explore the    percent of the ocean that we have yet to see. The goal is to protect biodiversity  to provide stability and resilience. We need deep diving subs  new technologies to explore the ocean. We need  maybe  an expedition    a TED at sea    that could help figure out the next steps. And so  I suppose you want to know what my wish is. I wish you would use all means at your disposal    films  expeditions  the web  new submarines    and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas    hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean  the blue heart of the planet. How much  Some say    percent  some say    percent. You decide  how much of your heart do you want to protect  Whatever it is  a fraction of one percent is not enough. My wish is a big wish  but if we can make it happen  it can truly change the world  and help ensure the survival of what actually    as it turns out    is my favorite species  that would be us. For the children of today  for tomorrow's child  as never again  now is the time. Thank you. So  my question  are we alone  The story of humans is the story of ideas    scientific ideas that shine light into dark corners  ideas that we embrace rationally and irrationally  ideas for which we've lived and died and killed and been killed  ideas that have vanished in history  and ideas that have been set in dogma. It's a story of nations  of ideologies  of territories  and of conflicts among them. But  every moment of human history  from the Stone Age to the Information Age  from Sumer and Babylon to the iPod and celebrity gossip  they've all been carried out    every book that you've read  every poem  every laugh  every tear    they've all happened here. Here. Here. Here. Perspective is a very powerful thing. Perspectives can change. Perspectives can be altered. From my perspective  we live on a fragile island of life  in a universe of possibilities. For many millennia  humans have been on a journey to find answers  answers to questions about naturalism and transcendence  about who we are and why we are  and of course  who else might be out there. Is it really just us  Are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics  Well  if we are  it's an awful waste of space. But  what if we're not  What if  out there  others are asking and answering similar questions  What if they look up at the night sky  at the same stars  but from the opposite side  Would the discovery of an older cultural civilization out there inspire us to find ways to survive our increasingly uncertain technological adolescence  Might it be the discovery of a distant civilization and our common cosmic origins that finally drives home the message of the bond among all humans  Whether we're born in San Francisco  or Sudan  or close to the heart of the Milky Way galaxy  we are the products of a billion year lineage of wandering stardust. We  all of us  are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from. Fifty years ago  the journey to find answers took a different path and SETI  the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence  began. So  what exactly is SETI  Well  SETI uses the tools of astronomy to try and find evidence of someone else's technology out there. Our own technologies are visible over interstellar distances  and theirs might be as well. It might be that some massive network of communications  or some shield against asteroidal impact  or some huge astro engineering project that we can't even begin to conceive of  could generate signals at radio or optical frequencies that a determined program of searching might detect. For millennia  we've actually turned to the priests and the philosophers for guidance and instruction on this question of whether there's intelligent life out there. Now  we can use the tools of the   st century to try and observe what is  rather than ask what should be  believed. SETI doesn't presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence  it merely notes the possibility  if not the probability in this vast universe  which seems fairly uniform. The numbers suggest a universe of possibilities. Our sun is one of     billion stars in our galaxy  and we know that many other stars have planetary systems. We've discovered over     in the last    years  including the small planet  announced earlier this week  which has a radius just twice the size of the Earth. And  if even all of the planetary systems in our galaxy were devoid of life  there are still     billion other galaxies out there  altogether       stars. Now  I'm going to try a trick  and recreate an experiment from this morning. Remember  one billion  But  this time not one billion dollars  one billion stars. Alright  one billion stars. Now  up there     feet above the stage  that's    trillion. Well  what about        Where's the line that marks that  That line would have to be  .  million miles above this stage.    times farther away than the moon  or four percent of the distance to the sun. So  there are many possibilities. And much of this vast universe  much more may be habitable than we once thought  as we study extremophiles on Earth    organisms that can live in conditions totally inhospitable for us  in the hot  high pressure thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean  frozen in ice  in boiling battery acid  in the cooling waters of nuclear reactors. These extremophiles tell us that life may exist in many other environments. But those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe. Even our nearest star  the Sun    its emissions suffer the tyranny of light speed. It takes a full eight minutes for its radiation to reach us. And the nearest star is  .  light years away  which means its light takes  .  years to get here. And the edge of our galaxy is        light years away  and the nearest galaxy to us   .  million light years. That means any signal we detect would have started its journey a long time ago. And a signal would give us a glimpse of their past  not their present. Which is why Phil Morrison calls SETI   the archaeology of the future.  It tells us about their past  but detection of a signal tells us it's possible for us to have a long future. I think this is what David Deutsch meant in       when he ended his Oxford TEDTalk by saying he had two principles he'd like to share for living  and he would like to carve them on stone tablets. The first is that problems are inevitable. The second is that problems are soluble. So  ultimately what's going to determine the success or failure of SETI is the longevity of technologies  and the mean distance between technologies in the cosmos    distance over space and distance over time. If technologies don't last and persist  we will not succeed. And we're a very young technology in an old galaxy  and we don't yet know whether it's possible for technologies to persist. So  up until now I've been talking to you about really large numbers. Let me talk about a relatively small number. And that's the length of time that the Earth was lifeless. Zircons that are mined in the Jack Hills of western Australia  zircons taken from the Jack Hills of western Australia tell us that within a few hundred million years of the origin of the planet there was abundant water and perhaps even life. So  our planet has spent the vast majority of its  .   billion year history developing life  not anticipating its emergence. Life happened very quickly  and that bodes well for the potential of life elsewhere in the cosmos. And the other thing that one should take away from this chart is the very narrow range of time over which humans can claim to be the dominant intelligence on the planet. It's only the last few hundred thousand years modern humans have been pursuing technology and civilization. So  one needs a very deep appreciation of the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet as the first step in preparing to make contact with life elsewhere in the cosmos. We are not the pinnacle of evolution. We are not the determined product of billions of years of evolutionary plotting and planning. We are one outcome of a continuing adaptational process. We are residents of one small planet in a corner of the Milky Way galaxy. And Homo sapiens are one small leaf on a very extensive Tree of Life  which is densely populated by organisms that have been honed for survival over millions of years. We misuse language  and talk about the  ascent  of man. We understand the scientific basis for the interrelatedness of life but our ego hasn't caught up yet. So this  ascent  of man  pinnacle of evolution  has got to go. It's a sense of privilege that the natural universe doesn't share. Loren Eiseley has said   One does not meet oneself until one catches the reflection from an eye other than human.  One day that eye may be that of an intelligent alien  and the sooner we eschew our narrow view of evolution the sooner we can truly explore our ultimate origins and destinations. We are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution  and we are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story  and perhaps SETI will help as well. Occasionally  throughout history  this concept of this very large cosmic perspective comes to the surface  and as a result we see transformative and profound discoveries. So in       Nicholas Copernicus published  The Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres   and by taking the Earth out of the center  and putting the sun in the center of the solar system  he opened our eyes to a much larger universe  of which we are just a small part. And that Copernican revolution continues today to influence science and philosophy and technology and theology. So  in       Giuseppe Coccone and Philip Morrison published the first SETI article in a refereed journal  and brought SETI into the scientific mainstream. And in       Frank Drake conducted the first SETI observation looking at two stars  Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani  for about     hours. Now Drake did not discover extraterrestrial intelligence  but he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft  and that's that terrestrial technology can interfere with the search for extraterrestrial technology. We've been searching ever since  but it's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains. All of the concerted SETI efforts  over the last    some years  are equivalent to scooping a single glass of water from the oceans. And no one would decide that the ocean was without fish on the basis of one glass of water. The   st century now allows us to build bigger glasses    much bigger glasses. In Northern California  we're beginning to take observations with the first    telescopes of the Allen Telescope Array    and I've got to take a moment right now to publicly thank Paul Allen and Nathan Myhrvold and all the TeamSETI members in the TED community who have so generously supported this research. The ATA is the first telescope built from a large number of small dishes  and hooked together with computers. It's making silicon as important as aluminum  and we'll grow it in the future by adding more antennas to reach     for more sensitivity and leveraging Moore's law for more processing capability. Today  our signal detection algorithms can find very simple artifacts and noise. If you look very hard here you can see the signal from the Voyager   spacecraft  the most distant human object in the universe      times as far away from us as the sun is. And over those long distances  its signal is very faint when it reaches us. It may be hard for your eye to see it  but it's easily found with our efficient algorithms. But this is a simple signal  and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals. This is a very good year.      is the    th anniversary of Galileo's first use of the telescope  Darwin's    th birthday  the    th anniversary of the publication of  On the Origin of Species   the   th anniversary of SETI as a science  the   th anniversary of the incorporation of the SETI Institute as a non profit  and of course  the   th anniversary of TED. And next month  the Kepler Spacecraft will launch and will begin to tell us just how frequent Earth like planets are  the targets for SETI's searches. In       the U.N. has declared it to be the International Year of Astronomy  a global festival to help us residents of Earth rediscover our cosmic origins and our place in the universe. And in       change has come to Washington  with a promise to put science in its rightful position. So  what would change everything  Well  this is the question the Edge foundation asked this year  and four of the respondents said   SETI.  Why  Well  to quote   The discovery of intelligent life beyond Earth would eradicate the loneliness and solipsism that has plagued our species since its inception. And it wouldn't simply change everything  it would change everything all at once.  So  if that's right  why did we only capture four out of those     minds  I think it's a problem of completion and delivery  because the fine print said   What game changing ideas and scientific developments would you expect to live to see   So  we have a fulfillment problem. We need bigger glasses and more hands in the water  and then working together  maybe we can all live to see the detection of the first extraterrestrial signal. That brings me to my wish. I wish that you would empower Earthlings everywhere to become active participants in the ultimate search for cosmic company. The first step would be to tap into the global brain trust  to build an environment where raw data could be stored  and where it could be accessed and manipulated  where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient. And this is a technically creative challenge  and it would change the perspective of people who worked on it. And then  we'd like to augment the automated search with human insight. We'd like to use the pattern recognition capability of the human eye to find faint  complex signals that our current algorithms miss. And  of course  we'd like to inspire and engage the next generation. We'd like to take the materials that we have built for education  and get them out to students everywhere  students that can't come and visit us at the ATA. We'd like to tell our story better  and engage young people  and thereby change their perspective. I'm sorry Seth Godin  but over the millennia  we've seen where tribalism leads. We've seen what happens when we divide an already small planet into smaller islands. And  ultimately  we actually all belong to only one tribe  to Earthlings. And SETI is a mirror    a mirror that can show us ourselves from an extraordinary perspective  and can help to trivialize the differences among us. If SETI does nothing but change the perspective of humans on this planet  then it will be one of the most profound endeavors in history. So  in the opening days of       a visionary president stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and said   We cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass  that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve  that  as the world grows smaller  our common humanity shall reveal itself.  So  I look forward to working with the TED community to hear about your ideas about how to fulfill this wish  and in collaborating with you  hasten the day that that visionary statement can become a reality. Thank you. I'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years. And along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization. So I want to show you a clip of the film now. Hopefully it won't stutter. And if we did our jobs well  you won't know that we were even involved. Voice  Video   I don't know how it's possible ... but you seem to have more hair. Brad Pitt  What if I told you that I wasn't getting older ... but I was getting younger than everybody else  I was born with some form of disease. Voice  What kind of disease  BP  I was born old. Man  I'm sorry. BP  No need to be. There's nothing wrong with old age. Girl  Are you sick  BP  I heard momma and Tizzy whisper  and they said I was gonna die soon. But ... maybe not. Girl  You're different than anybody I've ever met. BB  There were many changes ... some you could see  some you couldn't. Hair started growing in all sorts of places  along with other things. I felt pretty good  considering. Ed Ulbrich  That was a clip from  The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.  Many of you  maybe you've seen it or you've heard of the story  but what you might not know is that for nearly the first hour of the film  the main character  Benjamin Button  who's played by Brad Pitt  is completely computer generated from the neck up. Now  there's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body. We've created a completely digital human head. So I'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project. This is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story. It's about a man who's born old and lives his life in reverse. Now  this movie has floated around Hollywood for well over half a century  and we first got involved with the project in the early '  s  with Ron Howard as the director. We took a lot of meetings and we seriously considered it. But at the time we had to throw in the towel. It was deemed impossible. It was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards. The human form  in particular the human head  has been considered the Holy Grail of our industry. The project came back to us about a decade later  and this time with a director named David Fincher. Now  Fincher is an interesting guy. David is fearless of technology  and he is absolutely tenacious. And David won't take  no.  And David believed  like we do in the visual effects industry  that anything is possible as long as you have enough time  resources and  of course  money. And so David had an interesting take on the film  and he threw a challenge at us. He wanted the main character of the film to be played from the cradle to the grave by one actor. It happened to be this guy. We went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery with David  and we ruled out  of course  swapping actors. That was one idea  that we would have different actors  and we would hand off from actor to actor. We even ruled out the idea of using makeup. We realized that prosthetic makeup just wouldn't hold up  particularly in close up. And makeup is an additive process. You have to build the face up. And David wanted to carve deeply into Brad's face to bring the aging to this character. He needed to be a very sympathetic character. So we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of Benjamin at the different increments of his life and that we would in fact create a computer generated version of Brad's head  aged to appear as Benjamin  and attach that to the body of the real actor. Sounded great. Of course  this was the Holy Grail of our industry  and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help either  because I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store  you know    we see his face constantly. So there really was no tolerable margin of error. There were two studios involved  Warner Brothers and Paramount. And they both believed this would make an amazing film  of course  but it was a very high risk proposition. There was lots of money and reputations at stake. But we believed that we had a very solid methodology that might work ... But despite our verbal assurances  they wanted some proof. And so  in       they commissioned us to do a screen test of Benjamin. And we did it in about five weeks. But we used lots of cheats and shortcuts. We basically put something together to get through the meeting. I'll roll that for you now. This was the first test for Benjamin Button. And in here  you can see  that's a computer generated head    pretty good    attached to the body of an actor. And it worked. And it gave the studio great relief. After many years of starts and stops on this project  and making that tough decision  they finally decided to greenlight the movie. And I can remember  actually  when I got the phone call to congratulate us  to say the movie was a go  I actually threw up. You know  this is some tough stuff. So we started to have early team meetings  and we got everybody together  and it was really more like therapy in the beginning  convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this. We had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character. And it's not a special effects film  it has to be a man. We really felt like we were in a    kind of a    step program. And of course  the first step is  admit you've got a problem.  Laughter  So we had a big problem  we didn't know how we were going to do this. But we did know one thing. Being from the visual effects industry  we  with David  believed that we now had enough time  enough resources  and  God  we hoped we had enough money. And we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence. So  when you're faced with something like that  of course you've got to break it down. You take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces and you start to attack that. So we had three main areas that we had to focus on. We needed to make Brad look a lot older    needed to age him    years or so. And we also needed to make sure that we could take Brad's idiosyncrasies  his little tics  the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that translate through our process so that it appears in Benjamin on the screen. And we also needed to create a character that could hold up under  really  all conditions. He needed to be able to walk in broad daylight  at nighttime  under candlelight  he had to hold an extreme close up  he had to deliver dialogue  he had to be able to run  he had to be able to sweat  he had to be able to take a bath  to cry  he even had to throw up. Not all at the same time    but he had to  you know  do all of those things. And the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie. We did about     shots. So we needed a system that would allow Benjamin to do everything a human being can do. And we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state of the art of technology in      and where we needed it to be. So we focused on motion capture. I'm sure many of you have seen motion capture. The state of the art at the time was something called marker based motion capture. I'll give you an example here. It's basically the idea of  you wear a leotard  and they put some reflective markers on your body  and instead of using cameras  there're infrared sensors around a volume  and those infrared sensors track the three dimensional position of those markers in real time. And then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers and apply them to a computer generated character. You can see the computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the dancers. But we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking  and that's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process. And as you can see  it gives you a pretty crappy performance. That's not terribly compelling. And what we realized was that what we needed was the information that was going on between the markers. We needed the subtleties of the skin. We needed to see skin moving over muscle moving over bone. We needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things. Our first revelation was to completely abort and walk away from the technology of the day  the status quo  the state of the art. So we aborted using motion capture. And we were now well out of our comfort zone  and in uncharted territory. So we were left with this idea that we ended up calling  technology stew.  We started to look out in other fields. The idea was that we were going to find nuggets or gems of technology that come from other industries like medical imaging  the video game space  and re appropriate them. And we had to create kind of a sauce. And the sauce was code in software that we'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technology to come together and work as one. Initially  we came across some remarkable research done by a gentleman named Dr. Paul Ekman in the early '  s. He believed that he could  in fact  catalog the human face. And he came up with this idea of Facial Action Coding System  or FACS. He believed that there were    basic poses or shapes of the human face  and that those basic poses or shapes of the face can be combined to create infinite possibilities of everything the human face is capable of doing. And of course  these transcend age  race  culture  gender. So this became the foundation of our research as we went forward. And then we came across some remarkable technology called Contour. And here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeup stippled on her face. And now what we're looking at is really creating a surface capture as opposed to a marker capture. The subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras  and those cameras can  frame by frame  reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment. So  effectively  you get  D data in real time of the subject. And if you look in a comparison  on the left  we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us. So  clearly  we were in a substantially better place for this. But these were the early days of this technology  and it wasn't really proven yet. We measure complexity and fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count. And so  on the left  we were seeing         polygons. We could go up into the millions of polygons. It seemed to be infinite. This was when we had our  Aha   This was the breakthrough. This is when we're like   OK  we're going to be OK  This is actually going to work.  And the  Aha   was  what if we could take Brad Pitt  and we could put Brad in this device  and use this Contour process  and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights  and we could  in fact  scan him in real time performing Ekman's FACS poses. Right  So  effectively  we ended up with a  D database of everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing. From there  we actually carved up those faces into smaller pieces and components of his face. So we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes  a complete database of all possibilities that his face is capable of doing. Now  that's great  except we had him at age   . We need to put another    years on him at this point. We brought in Rick Baker  and Rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry. And we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu Tsuji  and Kazu Tsuji is one of the great photorealist sculptors of our time. And we commissioned them to make a maquette  or a bust  of Benjamin. So  in the spirit of  The Great Unveiling     I had to do this    I had to unveil something. So this is Ben   . We created three of these  there's Ben     there's Ben     there's Ben   . And this really became the template for moving forward. Now  this was made from a life cast of Brad. So  in fact  anatomically  it is correct. The eyes  the jaw  the teeth  everything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has. We have these maquettes scanned into the computer at very high resolution    enormous polygonal count. And so now we had three age increments of Benjamin in the computer. But we needed to get a database of him doing more than that. We went through this process  then  called retargeting. This is Brad doing one of the Ekman FACS poses. And here's the resulting data that comes from that  the model that comes from that. Retargeting is the process of transposing that data onto another model. And because the life cast  or the bust    the maquette    of Benjamin was made from Brad  we could transpose the data of Brad at    onto Brad at   . So now  we had a  D database of everything Brad Pitt's face can do at age     in his   s and in his   s. Next we had to go into the shooting process. So while all that's going on  we're down in New Orleans and locations around the world. And we shot our body actors  and we shot them wearing blue hoods. So these are the gentleman who played Benjamin. And the blue hoods helped us with two things  one  we could easily erase their heads  and we also put tracking markers on their heads so we could recreate the camera motion and the lens optics from the set. But now we needed to get Brad's performance to drive our virtual Benjamin. And so we edited the footage that was shot on location with the rest of the cast and the body actors and about six months later we brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles and he watched on the screen. His job  then  was to become Benjamin. And so we looped the scenes. He watched again and again. We encouraged him to improvise. And he took Benjamin into interesting and unusual places that we didn't think he was going to go. We shot him with four HD cameras so we'd get multiple views of him and then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast. From there we went into a process called image analysis. And so here  you can see again  the chosen take. And you are seeing  now  that data being transposed on to Ben   . And so  what's interesting about this is we used something called image analysis  which is taking timings from different components of Benjamin's face. And so we could choose  say  his left eyebrow. And the software would tell us that  well  in frame    the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here  and it concludes moving in frame   . And so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from. And then  the sauce I talked about with our technology stew    that secret sauce was  effectively  software that allowed us to match the performance footage of Brad in live action with our database of aged Benjamin  the FACS shapes that we had. On a frame by frame basis  we could actually reconstruct a  D head that exactly matched the performance of Brad. So this was how the finished shot appeared in the film. And here you can see the body actor. And then this is what we called the  dead head   no reference to Jerry Garcia. And then here's the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance. And then  again  the final shot. It was a long process. The next section here  I'm going to just blast through this  because we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides. We had to create a lighting system. So really  a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment for every single location that Benjamin had to appear so that we could put Ben's head into any scene and it would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actors in the real world. We also had to create an eye system. We found the old adage  you know   The eyes are the window to the soul   absolutely true. So the key here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes. And if you could feel the warmth  and feel the humanity  and feel his intent coming through the eyes  then we would succeed. So we had one person focused on the eye system for almost two full years. We also had to create a mouth system. We worked from dental molds of Brad. We had to age the teeth over time. We also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words. There was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue. We had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months. He was very popular. Skin displacement  another big deal. The skin had to be absolutely accurate. He's also in an old age home  he's in a nursing home around other old people  so he had to look exactly the same as the others. So  lots of work on skin deformation  you can see in some of these cases it works  in some cases it looks bad. This is a very  very  very early test in our process. So  effectively we created a digital puppet that Brad Pitt could operate with his own face. There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior or enhance his performance. There was something that we encountered  though  that we ended up calling  the digital Botox effect.  So  as things went through this process  Fincher would always say   It sandblasts the edges off of the performance.  And thing our process and the technology couldn't do  is they couldn't understand intent  the intent of the actor. So it sees a smile as a smile. It doesn't recognize an ironic smile  or a happy smile  or a frustrated smile. So it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another. But we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology  emotion capture   as opposed to just motion capture. Take another look. Brad Pitt  Well  I heard momma and Tizzy whisper  and they said I was gonna die soon  but ... maybe not. EU  That's how to create a digital human in    minutes. A couple of quick factoids  it really took     people over two years  and we didn't even talk about    hairstyles and an all digital haircut. But  that is Benjamin. Thank you. Let's talk trash. You know  we had to be taught to renounce the powerful conservation ethic we developed during the Great Depression and World War II. After the war  we needed to direct our enormous production capacity toward creation of products for peacetime. Life Magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes. Mental note to the liberators  throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don't biodegrade. Only we humans make waste that nature can't digest. Plastics are also hard to recycle. A teacher told me how to express the under five percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream. It's diddly point squat. That's the percentage we recycle. Now  melting point has a lot to do with this. Plastic is not purified by the re melting process like glass and metal. It begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge. Half of each year's     billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets will be made into fast track trash. A large  unruly fraction of our trash will flow downriver to the sea. Here is the accumulation at Biona Creek next to the L.A. airport. And here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beach and the diesel plant we visited yesterday. In spite of deposit fees  much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles. We use two million of them in the United States every five minutes  here imaged by TED presenter Chris Jordan  who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail. Here is a remote island repository for bottles off the coast of Baja California. Isla San Roque is an uninhabited bird rookery off Baja's sparsely populated central coast. Notice that the bottles here have caps on them. Bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate  PET  will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization. Also  the caps are produced in separate factories from a different plastic  polypropylene. They will float in seawater  but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills. Let's trace the journey of the millions of caps that make it to sea solo. After a year the ones from Japan are heading straight across the Pacific  while ours get caught in the California current and first head down to the latitude of Cabo San Lucas. After ten years  a lot of the Japanese caps are in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch  while ours litter the Philippines. After    years  we see emerging the debris accumulation zone of the North Pacific Gyre. It so happens that millions of albatross nesting on Kure and Midway atolls in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands National Monument forage here and scavenge whatever they can find for regurgitation to their chicks. A four month old Laysan Albatross chick died with this in its stomach. Hundreds of thousands of the goose sized chicks are dying with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish  like cigarette lighters ... but  mostly bottle caps. Sadly  their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface. The retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals. This is Mae West  still alive at a zookeeper's home in New Orleans. I wanted to see what my home town of Long Beach was contributing to the problem  so on Coastal Clean Up Day in      I went to the Long Beach Peninsula  at the east end of our long beach. We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown. I offered five cents each for bottle caps. I got plenty of takers. Here are the       bottle caps they collected. I thought I would spend    bucks. That day I ended up spending nearly   . I separated them by color and put them on display the next Earth Day at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro. Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria stopped by to discuss the display. In spite of my  girly man  hat  crocheted from plastic shopping bags  they shook my hand.  Laughter  I showed him and Maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of Hawaii with more plastic than plankton. Here's what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like. Trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile produces samples like this. And this. Now  when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaii it looks like this. And this particular beach is Kailua Beach  the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington. Now  how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton  We sort the plastic fragments into different size classes  from five millimeters to one third of a millimeter. Small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater. We wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean  at the base of the food chain  was ingesting these poison pills. We did hundreds of necropsies  and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs. The record holder  only two and a half inches long  had    pieces in its tiny stomach. Now  you can buy certified organic produce. But no fishmonger on Earth can sell you a certified organic wild caught fish. This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations. The throwaway society cannot be contained    it has gone global. We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff. We have to throw it away. Now  the market can do a lot for us  but it can't fix the natural system in the ocean we've broken. All the king's horses and all the king's men ... will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again. Narrator  Video   The levels are increasing  the amount of packaging is increasing  the  throwaway  concept of living is proliferating  and it's showing up in the ocean. Anchor  He offers no hope of cleaning it up. Straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process. The solution  Moore says  is to stop the plastic at its source  stop it on land before it falls in the ocean. And in a plastic wrapped and packaged world  he doesn't hold out much hope for that  either. This is Brian Rooney for Nightline  in Long Beach  California. Charles Moore  Thank you. This is the first of two rather extraordinary photographs I'm going to show you today. It was taken    years ago. I was    years old at the time. I had just returned from one of the deepest dives I'd ever made at that time     a little over     feet    and  I had caught this little fish here. It turns out that that particular one was the first live one of that ever taken alive. I'm not just an ichthyologist  I'm a bona fide fish nerd. And to a fish nerd  this is some pretty exciting stuff. And more exciting was the fact that the person who took this photo was a guy named Jack Randall  the greatest living ichthyologist on Earth  the Grand Poobah of fish nerds  if you will. And so  it was really exciting to me to have this moment in time  it really set the course for the rest of my life. But really the most significant thing  the most profound thing about this picture is that it was taken two days before I was completely paralyzed from the neck down. I made a really stupid kind of mistake that most    year old males do when they think they're immortal  and I got a bad case of the bends  and was paralyzed  and had to be flown back for treatment. I learned two really important things that day. The first thing I learned    well  I'm mortal  that's a really big one. And the second thing I learned was that I knew  with profound certainty  that this is exactly what I was going to do for the rest of my life. I had to focus all my energies towards going to find new species of things down on deep coral reefs. Now  when you think of a coral reef  this is what most people think of  all these big  hard  elaborate corals and lots of bright  colorful fishes and things. But  this is really just the tip of the iceberg. If you look at this diagram of a coral reef  we know a lot about that part up near the top  and the reason we know so much about it is scuba divers can very easily go down there and access it. There is a problem with scuba though  in that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go  and it turns out that depth is about     feet. I'll get into why that is in just a minute. But  the point is that scuba divers generally stay less than     feet deep  and very rarely go much below this  at least  not with any kind of sanity. So  to go deeper  most biologists have turned to submersibles. Now  submersibles are great  wonderful things  but if you're going to spend        dollars a day to use one of these things  and it's capable of going       feet  you're sure not going to go farting around up here in a couple of hundred feet  you're going to go way  way  way  down deep. So  the bottom line is that almost all research using submersibles has taken place well below     feet. Now  it's pretty obvious at this point that there's this zone here in the middle and that's the zone that really centers around my own personal pursuit of happiness. I want to find out what's in this zone. We know almost nothing about it. Scuba divers can't get there  submarines go right on past it. It took me a year to learn how to walk again after I had my diving accident in Palau and during that year I spent a lot of time learning about the physics and physiology of diving and figuring out how to overcome these limitations. So  I'm just going to show you a basic idea. We're all breathing air right now. Air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen  about    percent oxygen. About    percent nitrogen is in our lungs. And there's a phenomenon called Henry's Law that says that gases will dissolve into a fluid in proportion to the partial pressures which you're exposing them to. So  basically the gas dissolves into our body. The oxygen is bound by metabolism  we use it for energy. The nitrogen just sort of floats around in our blood and tissues  and that's all fine  that's how we're designed. The problem happens when you start to go underwater. Now  the deeper you go underwater  the higher the pressure is. If you were to go down to a depth of about     feet  which is the recommended limit for most scuba divers  you get this pressure effect. And the effect of that pressure is that you have an increased density of gas molecules in every breath you take. Over time  those gas molecules dissolve into your blood and tissues and start to fill you up. Now  if you were to go down to  say      feet  you don't have five times as many gas molecules in your lungs    you've got    times as many gas molecules in your lungs. And  sure enough  they dissolve into your blood  and into your tissues as well. And of course  if you were to down to where there's    times as much    the deeper you go  the more exacerbating the problem becomes. And the problem  the limitation of diving with air is all those dots in your body    all the nitrogen and all the oxygen. There're three basic limitations of scuba diving. The first limitation is the oxygen    oxygen toxicity. Now  we all know the song   Love is like oxygen.  You get too much  you get too high.  Not enough  and you're going to die.  Well  in the context of diving  you get too much  you die also. You die also because oxygen toxicity can cause a seizure    makes you convulse underwater  not a good thing to happen underwater. It happens because there's too much concentration of oxygen in your body. The nitrogen has two problems. One of them is what Jacques Cousteau called  rapture of the deep.  It's nitrogen narcosis. It makes you loopy. The deeper you go  the loopier you get. You don't want to drive drunk  you don't want to dive drunk  so that's a real big problem. And of course  the third problem is the one I found out the hard way in Palau  which is the bends. Now the one thing that I forgot to mention  is that to obviate the problem of the nitrogen narcosis    all of those blue dots in our body    you remove the nitrogen and you replace it with helium. Now helium's a gas  there're a lot of reasons why helium's good  it's a tiny molecule  it's inert  it doesn't give you narcosis. So that's the basic concept that we use. But  the theory's relatively easy. The tricky part is the implementation. So  this is how I began  about    years ago. I'll admit  it wasn't exactly the smartest of starts  but  you know  you got to start somewhere. At the time  I wasn't the only one who didn't know what I was doing    almost nobody did. And this rig was actually used for a dive of     feet. Over time we got a little bit better at it  and we came up with this really sophisticated looking rig with four scuba tanks and five regulators and all the right gas mixtures and all that good stuff. And it was fine and dandy  and it allowed us to go down and find new species. This picture was taken     feet deep  catching new species of fish. But  the problem was that it didn't allow us much time. For all its bulk and size  it only gave us about    minutes at most down at those sorts of depths. We needed more time. There had to be a better way. And  indeed  there is a better way. In       I was fortunate enough to get access to these prototype closed circuit rebreathers. Alright  closed circuit rebreather    what is it about it that makes it different from scuba  and why is it better  Well  there are three main advantages to a rebreather. One  they're quiet  they don't make any noise. Two  they allow you to stay underwater longer. Three  they allow you to go deeper. How is it that they do that  Well  in order to really understand how they do that you have to take off the hood  and look underneath and see what's going on. There are three basic systems to a closed  circuit rebreather. The most fundamental of these is called the breathing loop. It's a breathing loop because you breathe off of it  and it's a closed loop  and you breathe the same gas around and around and around. So there's a mouthpiece that you put in your mouth  and there's also a counterlung  or in this case  two counterlungs. Now  the counterlungs aren't high tech  they're just simply flexible bags. They allow you to mechanically breathe  or mechanically ventilate. When you exhale your breath  it goes in the exhale counterlung  when you inhale a breath  it comes from the inhale counterlung. It's just pure mechanics  allowing you to cycle air through this breathing loop. And  the other component on a breathing loop is the carbon dioxide absorbent canister. Now  as we breathe  we produce carbon dioxide  and that carbon dioxide needs to be scrubbed out of the system. There's a chemical filter in there that pulls the carbon dioxide out of the breathing gas    so that  when it comes back to us to breathe again  it's safe to breathe again. So that's the breathing loop in a nutshell. The second main component of a closed circuit rebreather is the gas system. The primary purpose of the gas system is to provide oxygen  to replenish the oxygen that your body consumes. So the main tank  the main critical thing  is this oxygen gas supply cylinder we have here. But  if we only had an oxygen gas supply cylinder we wouldn't be able to go very deep  because we'd run into oxygen toxicity very  very quickly. So we need another gas  something to dilute the oxygen with. And that  fittingly enough  is called the diluent gas supply. In our applications  we generally put air inside this diluent gas supply  because it's a very cheap and easy source of nitrogen. So that's where we get our nitrogen from. But  if we want to go deeper  of course  we need another gas supply. We need helium  and the helium is what we really need to go deep. And usually we'll have a slightly larger cylinder mounted exterior on the rebreather  like this. And that's what we use to inject  as we start to do our deep dives. We also have a second oxygen cylinder  that's solely as a back up in case there's a problem with our first oxygen supply we can continue to breathe. And the way you manage all these different gases and all these different gas supplies is this really high tech  sophisticated gas block up on the front here  where it's easy to reach. It's got all the valves and knobs and things you need to do to inject the right gases at the right time. Now  normally you don't have to do that because all of it's done automatically for you with the electronics  the third system of a rebreather. The most critical part of a rebreather is the oxygen sensors. You need three of them  so that if one of them goes bad  you know which one it is. You need voting logic. You also have three microprocessors. Any one of those computers can run the entire system  so if you have to lose two of them  there's also back up power supplies. And of course there're multiple displays  to get the information to the diver. This is the high tech gadgetry that allows us to do what we do on these kinds of deep dives. And I can talk about it all day    just ask my wife    but I want to move on to something that's kind of much more interesting. I'm going to take you on a deep dive. I'm going to show you what it's like to do one of these dives that we do. We start up here on the boat  and for all this high tech  expensive equipment  this is still the best way to get in the water    just pfft     flop over the side of the boat. Now  as I showed you in the earlier diagram  these reefs that we dive on start out near the surface and they go almost vertically  completely straight down. So  we drop in the water  and we just sort of go over the edge of this cliff  and then we just start dropping  dropping  dropping. People have asked me   It must take a long time to get there   No  it only takes a couple of minutes to get all the way down to three or four hundred feet  which is where we're aiming for. It's kind of like skydiving in slow motion. It's really a very interesting    you ever see  The Abyss  where Ed Harris  you know  he's sinking down along the side of the wall  That's kind of what it feels like. It's pretty amazing. Also  when you get down there  you find that the water is very  very clear. It's extremely clear water  because there's hardly any plankton. But  when you turn on your light  you look around at the caves  and all of a sudden you're confronted with a tremendous amount of diversity  much more than anyone used to believe. Now not all of it is new species    like that fish you see with the white stripe  that's a known species. But  if you look carefully into the cracks and crevices  you'll see little things scurrying all over the place. There's a just unbelievable diversity. It's not just fish  either. These are crinoids  sponges  black corals. There're some more fishes. And those fishes that you see right now are new species. They're still new species because I had a video camera on this dive instead of my net  so they're still waiting down there for someone to go find them. But this is what it looks like  and this kind of habitat just goes on and on and on for miles. This is Papua  New Guinea. Now little fishes and invertebrates aren't the only things we see down there. We also see sharks  much more regularly than I would have expected to. And we're not quite sure why. But what I want you to do right now is imagine yourself     feet underwater  with all this high tech gear on your back  you're in a remote reef off Papua  New Guinea  thousands of miles from the nearest recompression chamber  and you're completely surrounded by sharks. Video  Look at those ... Uh oh ... uh oh  I think we have their attention.  Laughter  Richard Pyle  When you start talking like Donald Duck  there's no situation in the world that can seem tense. So  we're down there  and this is at     feet    that's looking straight up  by the way  so you can get a sense of how far away the surface is. And if you're a biologist and you know about sharks  and you want to assess  you know  how much jeopardy am I really in here  there's one question that sort of jumps to the forefront of your mind immediately which is    Diver    Video   What kind of sharks  Diver    Uh  silvertip sharks. Diver    Oh. RP  Silvertip sharks    they're actually three species of sharks here. The silvertips are the one with the white edges on the fin  and there're also gray reef sharks and some hammerheads off in the distance. And yes  it's a little nerve wracking. Diver    Video   Hoo  That little guy is frisky   Laughter  Now  you've seen video like this on TV a lot  and it's very intimidating  and I think it gives the wrong impression about sharks. Sharks are actually not very dangerous animals and that's why we weren't worried much  why we were joking around down there. More people are killed by pigs  more people are killed by lightning strikes  more people are killed at soccer games in England. There's a lot of other ways you can die. And I'm not making that stuff up. Coconuts  You can get killed by a coconut more likely than killed by a shark. So sharks aren't quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be. Now  I don't know if any of you get U.S. News and World Report    I got the recent issue. There's a cover story all about the great explorers of our time. The last article is an article entitled  No New Frontiers.  It questions whether or not there really are any new frontiers out there  whether there are any real  true  hardcore discoveries that can still be made. And this is my favorite line from the article. As a fish nerd  I have to laugh  because you know they don't call us fish nerds for nothing    we actually do get excited about finding a new dorsal spine in a guppy. But  it's much more than that. And  I want to show you a few of the guppies we've found over the years. This one's    you know  you can see how ugly it is. Even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing  just look at the monetary value of this thing. A couple of these ended up getting sold through the aquarium trade to Japan  where they sold for        dollars apiece. That's half a million dollars per pound. Here's another new angelfish we discovered. This one we actually first discovered back in the air days    the bad old air days  as we used to say    when we were doing these kind of dives with air. We were at     feet. And I remember coming up from one of these deep dives  and I had this fog  and the narcosis takes a little while to  you know  fade away. It's sort of like sobering up. And I had this vague recollection of seeing these yellow fish with a black spot  and I thought   Aw  damn. I should have caught one. I think that's a new species.  And then  eventually  I got around to looking in my bucket. Sure enough  I had caught one    I just completely forgot that I had caught one.  Laughter  And so this one we decided to give the name Centropyge narcosis to. So that's it's official scientific name  in reference to its deep dwelling habits. And this is another neat one. When we first found it  we weren't even sure what family this thing belonged to  so we just called it the Dr. Seuss fish  because it looked like something out of one of those books. Now  this one's pretty cool. If you go to Papua  New Guinea  and go down     feet  you're going to see these big mounds. And this may be kind of hard to see  but they're about    oh  a couple meters in diameter. If you look closely  you'll see there's a little white fish and gray fish that hangs out near them. Well  it turns out this little white fish builds these giant mounds  one pebble at a time. It's really extraordinary to find something like this. It's not just new species  it's new behavior  it's new ecology it's all kind of new things. So  what I'm going to show you right now  very quickly  is just a sampling of a few of the new species we've discovered. What's extraordinary about this is not just the sheer number of species we're finding    although as you can see that's pretty amazing  this is only half of what we've found    what's extraordinary is how quickly we find them. We're up to seven new species per hour of time we spend at that depth. Now  if you go to an Amazon jungle and fog a tree  you may get a lot of bugs  but for fishes  there's nowhere in the world you can get seven new species per hour of time. Now  we've done some back of the envelope calculations  and we're predicting that there are probably on the order of       to       new species in the Indo Pacific alone. There are only five to six thousand known species. So a very large percentage of what is out there isn't really known. We thought we had a handle on all the reef fish diversity    evidently not. And I'm going to just close on a very somber note. At the beginning I told you that I was going to show you two extraordinary photographs. This is the second extraordinary photograph I'm going to show you. This one was taken at the exact moment I was down there filming those sharks. This was taken exactly     feet above my head. And the reason this photograph is extraordinary is because it captures a moment in the very last minute of a person's life. Less than    seconds after this picture was taken  this guy was dead. When we recovered his body  we figured out what had gone wrong. He had made a very simple mistake. He turned the wrong valve when he filled his cylinder    he had    percent oxygen in his tank when he should have had   . He had an oxygen toxicity seizure and he drowned. The reason I show this    not to put a downer on everything    but I just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general  which is that we all have two goals. The first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet  which is to survive. I call it perpetuation  the survival of the species and survival of ourselves  because they're both about perpetuating the genome. And the second goal  for those of us who have mastered that first goal  is to    you know  you call it spiritual fulfillment  you can call it financial success  you can call it any number of different things. I call it seeking joy    this pursuit of happiness. So  I guess my theme on this is this guy lived his life to the fullest  he absolutely did. You have to balance those two goals. If you live your whole life in fear    I mean  life is a sexually transmitted disease with     percent mortality. So  you can't live your life in fear. I thought that was an old one. But  at the same time you don't want to get so focused on rule number two  or goal number two  that you neglect goal number one. Because once you're dead  you really can't enjoy anything after that. I wish you all the best of luck in maintaining that balance in your future endeavors. Thanks. I was raised in Seoul  Korea  and moved to New York City in      to attend college. I was pre med at the time  and I thought I would become a surgeon because I was interested in anatomy and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity. At the same time  I fell in love with New York City. I started to realize that I could look at the whole city as a living organism. I wanted to dissect it and look into its unseen layers. And the way to it  for me  was through artistic means. So  eventually I decided to pursue an MFA instead of an M.D. and in grad school I became interested in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city. In New York City  rats are part of commuters' daily lives. Most people ignore them or are frightened of them. But I took a liking to them because they dwell on the fringes of society. And even though they're used in labs to promote human lives  they're also considered pests. I also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them. One day  in the subway  I was snapping pictures of the tracks hoping to catch a rat or two  and a man came up to me and said   You can't take photographs here. The MTA will confiscate your camera.  I was quite shocked by that  and thought to myself   Well  OK then. I'll follow the rats.  Then I started going into the tunnels  which made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city that I never saw before and most people don't get to see. Around the same time  I met like minded individuals who call themselves urban explorers  adventurers  spelunkers  guerrilla historians  etc. I was welcomed into this loose  Internet based network of people who regularly explore urban ruins such as abandoned subway stations  tunnels  sewers  aqueducts  factories  hospitals  shipyards and so on. When I took photographs in these locations  I felt there was something missing in the pictures. Simply documenting these soon to be demolished structures wasn't enough for me. So I wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces  and the simplest way to do it  at the time  was to model myself. I decided against clothing because I wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications or time specific elements. I wanted a simple way to represent a living body inhabiting these decaying  derelict spaces. This was taken in the Riviera Sugar Factory in Red Hook  Brooklyn. It's now an empty  six acre lot waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new Ikea. I was very fond of this space because it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own that is abandoned. When I first went in  I was scared  because I heard dogs barking and I thought they were guard dogs. But they happened to be wild dogs living there  and it was right by the water  so there were swans and ducks swimming around and trees growing everywhere and bees nesting in the sugar barrels. The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex. And  in a way  I wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature. When I got comfortable in the space  it also felt like a big playground. I would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams as if I went back in time and became a child again. This was taken in the old Croton Aqueduct  which supplied fresh water to New York City for the first time. The construction began in     . It lasted about five years. It got abandoned when the new Croton Aqueducts opened in     . When you go into spaces like this  you're directly accessing the past  because they sit untouched for decades. I love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history. Instead of looking at reproductions of it at home  you're actually feeling the hand laid bricks and shimmying up and down narrow cracks and getting wet and muddy and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight. This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park. It was built in the     s by Robert Moses. The murals were done by a graffiti artist to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people that got relocated from the tunnel in      when the tunnel reopened for trains. Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful. There's nobody around you  and you hear the kids playing in the park above you  completely unaware of what's underneath. When I was going out a lot to these places  I was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolation because I was in a solitary phase in my life  and I decided to title my series  Naked City Spleen   which references Charles Baudelaire.  Naked City  is a nickname for New York  and  Spleen  embodies the melancholia and inertia that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment. This is the same tunnel. You see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts and the train approaching. This is a tunnel that's abandoned in Hell's Kitchen. I was there alone  setting up  and a homeless man approached. I was basically intruding in his living space. I was really frightened at first  but I calmly explained to him that I was working on an art project and he didn't seem to mind and so I went ahead and put my camera on self timer and ran back and forth. And when I was done  he actually offered me his shirt to wipe off my feet and kindly walked me out. It must have been a very unusual day for him. One thing that struck me  after this incident  was that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city. That homeless man  to me  really represented an element of the unconscious of the city. He told me that he was abused above ground and was once in Riker's Island  and at last he found peace and quiet in that space. The tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city  but is now a sanctuary for outcasts  who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller's everyday life. This is underneath my alma mater  Columbia University. The tunnels are famous for having been used during the development of the Manhattan Project. This particular tunnel is interesting because it shows the original foundations of Bloomingdale Insane Asylum  which was demolished in      when Columbia moved in. This is the New York City Farm Colony  which was a poorhouse in Staten Island from the     s to the     s. Most of my photos are set in places that have been abandoned for decades  but this is an exception. This children's hospital was closed in       it's located in Newark. When I was there three years ago  the windows were broken and the walls were peeling  but everything was left there as it was. You see the autopsy table  morgue trays  x ray machines and even used utensils  which you see on the autopsy table. After exploring recently abandoned buildings  I felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast  your home  your office  a shopping mall  a church    any man made structures around you. I was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is and how vulnerable people truly are. I love to travel  and Berlin has become one of my favorite cities. It's full of history  and also full of underground bunkers and ruins from the war. This was taken under a homeless asylum built in      to house       people. I saw the structure while I was on the train  and I got off at the next station and met people there that gave me access to their catacomb like basement  which was used for ammunition storage during the war and also  at some point  to hide groups of Jewish refugees. This is the actual catacombs in Paris. I explored there extensively in the off limits areas and fell in love right away. There are more than     miles of tunnels  and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum. The first tunnels date back to    B.C. They were consistently dug as limestone quarries and by the   th century  the caving in of some of these quarries posed safety threats  so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place. As you can see  the system is very complex and vast. It's very dangerous to get lost in there. And at the same time  there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries. So the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries  making them into the catacombs. The remains of over six million people are housed in there  some over       years old. This was taken under the Montparnasse Cemetery where most of the ossuaries are located. There are also phone cables that were used in the '  s and many bunkers from the World War II era. This is a German bunker. Nearby there's a French bunker  and the whole tunnel system is so complex that the two parties never met. The tunnels are famous for having been used by the Resistance  which Victor Hugo wrote about in  Les Miserables.  And I saw a lot of graffiti from the     s  like this one. After exploring the underground of Paris  I decided to climb up  and I climbed a Gothic monument that's right in the middle of Paris. This is the Tower of Saint Jacques. It was built in the early     s. I don't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of January  naked. It was not very comfortable.  Laughter  And all this time  I never saw a single rat in any of these places  until recently  when I was in the London sewers. This was probably the toughest place to explore. I had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes    I guess  except for in this picture. And when the tides of waste matter come in it sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you. This is a still from a film I worked on recently  called  Blind Door.  I've become more interested in capturing movement and texture. And the   mm black and white film gave a different feel to it. And this is the first theater project I worked on. I adapted and produced  A Dream Play  by August Strindberg. It was performed last September one time only in the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn  which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world  built in     . I've been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these  lately. But whenever I get a chance I still work on my series. The last place I visited was the Mayan ruins of Copan  Honduras. This was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple. I like doing more than just exploring these spaces. I feel an obligation to animate and humanize these spaces continually in order to preserve their memories in a creative way    before they're lost forever. Thank you. Four years ago  on the TED stage  I announced a company I was working with at the time called Odeo. And because of that announcement  we got a big article in The New York Times  which led to more press  which led to more attention  and me deciding to become CEO of that company    whereas I was just an adviser    and raising a round of venture capital and ramping up hiring. One of the guys I hired was an engineer named Jack Dorsey  and a year later  when we were trying to decide which way to go with Odeo  Jack presented an idea he'd been tinkering around with for a number of years that was based around sending simple status updates to friends. We were also playing with SMS at the time at Odeo  so we kind of put two and two together  and in early      we launched Twitter as a side project at Odeo. Now  it's hard to justify doing a side project at a startup  where focus is so critical  but I had actually launched Blogger as a side project to my previous company  thinking it was just a little thing we'd do on the side  and it ended up taking over not only the company  but my life for the next five or six years. So I learned to follow hunches even though you can't necessarily justify them or know where they're going to go. And that's kind of what's happened with Twitter  time after time. So  for those of you unfamiliar  Twitter is based around a very simple  seemingly trivial concept. You say what you're doing in     characters or less  and people who are interested in you get those updates. If they're really interested  they get the update as a text message on their cell phone. So  for instance  I may Twitter right now that I'm giving a talk at TED. And in my case  when I hit send  up to        people will receive that message in a matter of seconds. Now  the fundamental idea is that Twitter lets people share moments of their lives whenever they want  be they momentous occasions or mundane ones. It is by sharing these moments as they're happening that lets people feel more connected and in touch  despite distance  and in real time. This is the primary use we saw of Twitter from the beginning  and what got us excited. What we didn't anticipate was the many  many other uses that would evolve from this very simple system. One of the things we realized was how important Twitter could be during real time events. When the wildfires broke out in San Diego  in October of       people turned to Twitter to report what was happening and to find information from neighbors about what was happening around them. But it wasn't just individuals. The L.A. Times actually turned to Twitter to dispense information as well  and put a Twitter feed on the front page  and the L.A. Fire Department and Red Cross used it to dispense news and updates as well. At this event  dozens of people here are Twittering and thousands of people around the world are following along because they want to know what it feels like to be here and what's happening. Among the other interesting things that have cropped up are many things from businesses  from marketing and communications and predictable things  to an insanely popular Korean barbecue taco truck that drives around L.A. and Twitters where it stops  causing a line to form around the block. Politicians have recently begun Twittering. In fact  there are    members of Congress who currently have Twitter accounts. And they're tweeting  in some cases  from behind closed door sessions with the President. In this case  this guy's not liking what he's hearing. The President himself is our most popular Twitter user  although his tweets have dropped off as of late  while Senator McCain's have picked up. As have this guy's. Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium  you send one message and it goes out to everybody  and you receive the messages you're interested in. One of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitter was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person or a specific message. So  this syntax  the   username  that Shaquille O'Neal's using here to reply to one of his fans  was completely invented by users  and we didn't build it into the system until it already became popular and then we made it easier. This is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system. Another is via the API. We built an application programming interface  which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with Twitter. We currently know about over       pieces of software that can send Twitter updates    interfaces for Mac  Windows  your iPhone  your BlackBerry    as well as things like a device that lets an unborn baby Twitter when it kicks or a plant Twitter when it needs water. Probably the most important third party development came from a little company in Virginia called Summize. Summize built a Twitter search engine. And they tapped into the fact that  if you have millions of people around the world talking about what they're doing and what's around them  you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event while it's going on. This really changed how we perceived Twitter. For instance  here's what people are saying about TED. This is another way that our mind was shifted  and Twitter wasn't what we thought it was. We liked this so much we actually bought the company and are folding it into the main product. This not only lets you view Twitters in different ways  but it introduces new use cases as well. One of my favorites is what happened a few months ago when there was a gas shortage in Atlanta. Some users figured out that they would Twitter when they found gas    where it was  and how much it cost    and then appended the keyword   atlgas  which let other people search for that and find gas themselves. And this trend of people using this communication network to help each other out goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends. It's happened more and more lately  whether it's raising money for homeless people or to dig wells in Africa or for a family in crisis. People have raised tens of thousands of dollars over Twitter in a matter of days on several occasions. It seems like when you give people easier ways to share information  more good things happen. I have no idea what will happen next with Twitter. I've learned to follow the hunch  but never assume where it will go. Thanks. Chris Anderson  We're not quite done yet. So  look  if we could have this screen live. This is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do after they've been to an event. It's totally intimidating. So  this would be the Twitter search screen. So we're going to just type a couple of random words into Twitter. For example   Evan Williams.   Evan Williams  give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at TED.   Currently listening to Evan Williams.   Currently listening to Evan Williams.   Evan Williams     Oh.  Evan Williams is just dying on stage here at TED. Worst talk ever    Laughter  Evan Williams  Nice. Thanks. CA  Just kidding. But  literally in the eight minutes he was talking  there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk. So he'll see every aspect of the reaction  the fact that Barack Obama is the biggest Twitterer  the fact that it came out of TED. I don't think there's any other way of getting instant feedback that way. You have build something very fascinating  and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it. So  thank you very much  Evan. EW  Thank you. CA  That was very interesting.
