I want you to imagine what a breakthrough this was for women who were victims of violence in the     s. They would come into the emergency room with what the police would call  a lovers' quarrel   and I would see a woman who was beaten  I would see a broken nose and a fractured wrist and swollen eyes. And as activists  we would take our Polaroid camera  we would take her picture  we would wait    seconds  and we would give her the photograph. And she would then have the evidence she needed to go to court. We were making what was invisible visible. I've been doing this for    years. I've been part of a social movement that has been working on ending violence against women and children. And for all those years  I've had an absolutely passionate and sometimes not popular belief that this violence is not inevitable  that it is learned  and if it's learned  it can be un learned  and it can be prevented. Why do I believe this  Because it's true. It is absolutely true. Between      and       domestic violence among adult women in the United States has gone down by    percent  and that is great news. Sixty four percent. Now  how did we get there  Our eyes were wide open. Thirty years ago  women were beaten  they were stalked  they were raped  and no one talked about it. There was no justice. And as an activist  that was not good enough. And so step one on this journey is we organized  and we created this extraordinary underground network of amazing women who opened shelters  and if they didn't open a shelter  they opened their home so that women and children could be safe. And you know what else we did  We had bake sales  we had car washes  and we did everything we could do to fundraise  and then at one point we said  you know  it's time that we went to the federal government and asked them to pay for these extraordinary services that are saving people's lives. Right   Applause  And so  step number two  we knew we needed to change the laws. And so we went to Washington  and we lobbied for the first piece of legislation. And I remember walking through the halls of the U.S. Capitol  and I was in my   s  and my life had purpose  and I couldn't imagine that anybody would ever challenge this important piece of legislation. I was probably    and naive. But I heard about a congressman who had a very  very different point of view. Do you know what he called this important piece of legislation  He called it the Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act. The Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act. Ladies and gentlemen  that was in      in the United States  and I wish I had Twitter. Ten years later  after lots of hard work  we finally passed the Violence Against Women Act  which is a life changing act that has saved so many lives.  Applause  Thank you. I was proud to be part of that work  and it changed the laws and it put millions of dollars into local communities. And you know what else it did  It collected data. And I have to tell you  I'm passionate about data. In fact  I am a data nerd. I'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here. I am a data nerd  and the reason for that is I want to make sure that if we spend a dollar  that the program works  and if it doesn't work  we should change the plan. And I also want to say one other thing  We are not going to solve this problem by building more jails or by even building more shelters. It is about economic empowerment for women  it is about healing kids who are hurt  and it is about prevention with a capital P. And so  step number three on this journey  We know  if we're going to keep making this progress  we're going to have to turn up the volume  we're going to have to increase the visibility  and we're going to have to engage the public. And so knowing that  we went to the Advertising Council  and we asked them to help us build a public education campaign. And we looked around the world to Canada and Australia and Brazil and parts of Africa  and we took this knowledge and we built the first national public education campaign called There's No Excuse for Domestic Violence. Take a look at one of our spots. Woman  Well  I thought you'd be home a couple hours ago  and I put everything away  so  Man  What is this  Pizza. Woman  If you had just called me  I would have known  Man  Dinner  Dinner ready is a pizza  Woman  Honey  please don't be so loud. Please don't Let go of me  Man  Get in the kitchen  Woman  No  Help  Man  You want to see what hurts   Slaps woman  That's what hurts  That's what hurts   Breaking glass  Woman  Help me    Children have to sit by and watch. What's your excuse    Esta Soler  As we were in the process of releasing this campaign  O.J. Simpson was arrested for the murder of his wife and her friend. We learned that he had a long history of domestic violence. The media became fixated. The story of domestic violence went from the back page  but actually from the no page  to the front page. Our ads blanketed the airwaves  and women  for the first time  started to tell their stories. Movements are about moments  and we seized this moment. And let me just put this in context. Before       do you have any idea how many articles were in The New York Times on domestic violence  I'll tell you     . And in the     s  over      . We were obviously making a difference. But we were still missing a critical element. So  step four  We needed to engage men. We couldn't solve this problem with    percent of the population on the sidelines. And I already told you I'm a data nerd. National polling told us that men felt indicted and not invited into this conversation. So we wondered  how can we include men  How can we get men to talk about violence against women and girls  And a male friend of mine pulled me aside and he said   You want men to talk about violence against women and girls. Men don't talk.  I apologize to the men in the audience. I know you do. But he said   Do you know what they do do  They do talk to their kids. They talk to their kids as parents  as coaches.  And that's what we did. We met men where they were at and we built a program. And then we had this one event that stays in my heart forever where a basketball coach was talking to a room filled with male athletes and men from all walks of life. And he was talking about the importance of coaching boys into men and changing the culture of the locker room and giving men the tools to have healthy relationships. And all of a sudden  he looked at the back of the room  and he saw his daughter  and he called out his daughter's name  Michaela  and he said   Michaela  come up here.  And she's nine years old  and she was kind of shy  and she got up there  and he said   Sit down next to me.  She sat right down next to him. He gave her this big hug  and he said   People ask me why I do this work. I do this work because I'm her dad  and I don't want anyone ever to hurt her.  And as a parent  I get it. I get it  knowing that there are so many sexual assaults on college campuses that are so widespread and so under reported. We've done a lot for adult women. We've got to do a better job for our kids. We just do. We have to.  Applause  We've come a long way since the days of the Polaroid. Technology has been our friend. The mobile phone is a global game changer for the empowerment of women  and Facebook and Twitter and Google and YouTube and all the social media helps us organize and tell our story in a powerful way. And so those of you in this audience who have helped build those applications and those platforms  as an organizer  I say  thank you very much. Really. I clap for you. I'm the daughter of a man who joined one club in his life  the Optimist Club. You can't make that one up. And it is his spirit and his optimism that is in my DNA. I have been doing this work for over    years  and I am convinced  now more than ever  in the capacity of human beings to change. I believe we can bend the arc of human history toward compassion and equality  and I also fundamentally believe and passionately believe that this violence does not have to be part of the human condition. And I ask you  stand with us as we create futures without violence for women and girls and men and boys everywhere. Thank you very much. Five years ago  I was a Ph.D. student living two lives. In one  I used NASA supercomputers to design next generation spacecraft  and in the other I was a data scientist looking for potential smugglers of sensitive nuclear technologies. As a data scientist  I did a lot of analyses  mostly of facilities  industrial facilities around the world. And I was always looking for a better canvas to tie these all together. And one day  I was thinking about how all data has a location  and I realized that the answer had been staring me in the face. Although I was a satellite engineer  I hadn't thought about using satellite imagery in my work. Now  like most of us  I'd been online  I'd see my house  so I thought  I'll hop in there and I'll start looking up some of these facilities. And what I found really surprised me. The pictures that I was finding were years out of date  and because of that  it had relatively little relevance to the work that I was doing today. But I was intrigued. I mean  satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff. There are millions and millions of sensors surrounding us today  but there's still so much we don't know on a daily basis. How much oil is stored in all of China  How much corn is being produced  How many ships are in all of our world's ports  Now  in theory  all of these questions could be answered by imagery  but not if it's old. And if this data was so valuable  then how come I couldn't get my hands on more recent pictures  So the story begins over    years ago with the launch of the first generation of U.S. government photo reconnaissance satellites. And today  there's a handful of the great  great grandchildren of these early Cold War machines which are now operated by private companies and from which the vast majority of satellite imagery that you and I see on a daily basis comes. During this period  launching things into space  just the rocket to get the satellite up there  has cost hundreds of millions of dollars each  and that's created tremendous pressure to launch things infrequently and to make sure that when you do  you cram as much functionality in there as possible. All of this has only made satellites bigger and bigger and bigger and more expensive  now nearly a billion  with a b  dollars per copy. Because they are so expensive  there aren't very many of them. Because there aren't very many of them  the pictures that we see on a daily basis tend to be old. I think a lot of people actually understand this anecdotally  but in order to visualize just how sparsely our planet is collected  some friends and I put together a dataset of the    million pictures that have been gathered by these satellites between      and     . As you can see in blue  huge areas of our world are barely seen  less than once a year  and even the areas that are seen most frequently  those in red  are seen at best once a quarter. Now as aerospace engineering grad students  this chart cried out to us as a challenge. Why do these things have to be so expensive  Does a single satellite really have to cost the equivalent of three     jumbo jets  Wasn't there a way to build a smaller  simpler  new satellite design that could enable more timely imaging  I realize that it does sound a little bit crazy that we were going to go out and just begin designing satellites  but fortunately we had help. In the late     s  a couple of professors proposed a concept for radically reducing the price of putting things in space. This was hitchhiking small satellites alongside much larger satellites. This dropped the cost of putting objects up there by over a factor of      and suddenly we could afford to experiment  to take a little bit of risk  and to realize a lot of innovation. And a new generation of engineers and scientists  mostly out of universities  began launching these very small  breadbox sized satellites called CubeSats. And these were built with electronics obtained from RadioShack instead of Lockheed Martin. Now it was using the lessons learned from these early missions that my friends and I began a series of sketches of our own satellite design. And I can't remember a specific day where we made a conscious decision that we were actually going to go out and build these things  but once we got that idea in our minds of the world as a dataset  of being able to capture millions of data points on a daily basis describing the global economy  of being able to unearth billions of connections between them that had never before been found  it just seemed boring to go work on anything else. And so we moved into a cramped  windowless office in Palo Alto  and began working to take our design from the drawing board into the lab. The first major question we had to tackle was just how big to build this thing. In space  size drives cost  and we had worked with these very small  breadbox sized satellites in school  but as we began to better understand the laws of physics  we found that the quality of pictures those satellites could take was very limited  because the laws of physics dictate that the best picture you can take through a telescope is a function of the diameter of that telescope  and these satellites had a very small  very constrained volume. And we found that the best picture we would have been able to get looked something like this. Although this was the low cost option  quite frankly it was just too blurry to see the things that make satellite imagery valuable. So about three or four weeks later  we met a group of engineers randomly who had worked on the first private imaging satellite ever developed  and they told us that back in the     s  the U.S. government had found a powerful optimal tradeoff    that in taking pictures at right about one meter resolution  being able to see objects one meter in size  they had found that they could not just get very high quality images  but get a lot of them at an affordable price. From our own computer simulations  we quickly found that one meter really was the minimum viable product to be able to see the drivers of our global economy  for the first time  being able to count the ships and cars and shipping containers and trucks that move around our world on a daily basis  while conveniently still not being able to see individuals. We had found our compromise. We would have to build something larger than the original breadbox  now more like a mini fridge  but we still wouldn't have to build a pickup truck. So now we had our constraint. The laws of physics dictated the absolute minimum sized telescope that we could build. What came next was making the rest of the satellite as small and as simple as possible  basically a flying telescope with four walls and a set of electronics smaller than a phone book that used less power than a     watt lightbulb. The big challenge became actually taking the pictures through that telescope. Traditional imaging satellites use a line scanner  similar to a Xerox machine  and as they traverse the Earth  they take pictures  scanning row by row by row to build the complete image. Now people use these because they get a lot of light  which means less of the noise you see in a low cost cell phone image. The problem with them is they require very sophisticated pointing. You have to stay focused on a    centimeter target from over     miles away while moving at more than seven kilometers a second  which requires an awesome degree of complexity. So instead  we turned to a new generation of video sensors  originally created for use in night vision goggles. Instead of taking a single  high quality image  we could take a videostream of individually noisier frames  but then we could recombine all of those frames together into very high quality images using sophisticated pixel processing techniques here on the ground  at a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system. And we applied this technique to many of the other systems on the satellite as well  and day by day  our design evolved from CAD to prototypes to production units. A few short weeks ago  we packed up SkySat    put our signatures on it  and waved goodbye for the last time on Earth. Today  it's sitting in its final launch configuration ready to blast off in a few short weeks. And soon  we'll turn our attention to launching a constellation of    or more of these satellites and beginning to build the scalable analytics that will allow us to unearth the insights in the petabytes of data we will collect. So why do all of this  Why build these satellites  Well  it turns out imaging satellites have a unique ability to provide global transparency  and providing that transparency on a timely basis is simply an idea whose time has come. We see ourselves as pioneers of a new frontier  and beyond economic data  unlocking the human story  moment by moment. For a data scientist that just happened to go to space camp as a kid  it just doesn't get much better than that. Thank you. The urban explosion of the last years of economic boom also produced dramatic marginalization  resulting in the explosion of slums in many parts of the world. This polarization of enclaves of mega wealth surrounded by sectors of poverty and the socioeconomic inequalities they have engendered is really at the center of today's urban crisis. But I want to begin tonight by suggesting that this urban crisis is not only economic or environmental. It's particularly a cultural crisis  a crisis of the institutions unable to reimagine the stupid ways which we have been growing  unable to challenge the oil hungry  selfish urbanization that have perpetuated cities based on consumption  from southern California to New York to Dubai. So I just really want to share with you a reflection that the future of cities today depends less on buildings and  in fact  depends more on the fundamental reorganization of socioeconomic relations  that the best ideas in the shaping of the city in the future will not come from enclaves of economic power and abundance  but in fact from sectors of conflict and scarcity from which an urgent imagination can really inspire us to rethink urban growth today. And let me illustrate what I mean by understanding or engaging sites of conflict as harboring creativity  as I briefly introduce you to the Tijuana San Diego border region  which has been the laboratory to rethink my practice as an architect. This is the wall  the border wall  that separates San Diego and Tijuana  Latin America and the United States  a physical emblem of exclusionary planning policies that have perpetuated the division of communities  jurisdictions and resources across the world. In this border region  we find some of the wealthiest real estate  as I once found in the edges of San Diego  barely    minutes away from some of the poorest  settlements in Latin America. And while these two cities have the same population  San Diego has grown six times larger than Tijuana in the last decades  immediately thrusting us to confront the tensions and conflicts between sprawl and density  which are at the center of today's discussion about environmental sustainability. So I've been arguing in the last years that  in fact  the slums of Tijuana can teach a lot to the sprawls of San Diego when it comes to socioeconomic sustainability  that we should pay attention and learn from the many migrant communities on both sides of this border wall so that we can translate their informal processes of urbanization. What do I mean by the informal in this case  I'm really just talking about the compendium of social practices of adaptation that enable many of these migrant communities to transgress imposed political and economic recipes of urbanization. I'm talking simply about the creative intelligence of the bottom up  whether manifested in the slums of Tijuana that build themselves  in fact  with the waste of San Diego  or the many migrant neighborhoods in Southern California that have begun to be retrofitted with difference in the last decades. So I've been interested as an artist in the measuring  the observation  of many of the trans border informal flows across this border  in one direction  from south to north  the flow of immigrants into the United States  and from north to south the flow of waste from southern California into Tijuana. I'm referring to the recycling of these old post war bungalows that Mexican contractors bring to the border as American developers are disposing of them in the process of building a more inflated version of suburbia in the last decades. So these are houses waiting to cross the border. Not only people cross the border here  but entire chunks of one city move to the next  and when these houses are placed on top of these steel frames  they leave the first floor to become the second to be in filled with more house  with a small business. This layering of spaces and economies is very interesting to notice. But not only houses  also small debris from one city  from San Diego  to Tijuana. Probably a lot of you have seen the rubber tires that are used in the slums to build retaining walls. But look at what people have done here in conditions of socioeconomic emergency. They have figured out how to peel off the tire  how to thread it and interlock it to construct a more efficient retaining wall. Or the garage doors that are brought from San Diego in trucks to become the new skin of emergency housing in many of these slums surrounding the edges of Tijuana. So while  as an architect  this is a very compelling thing to witness  this creative intelligence  I also want to keep myself in check. I don't want to romanticize poverty. I just want to suggest that this informal urbanization is not just the image of precariousness  that informality here  the informal  is really a set of socioeconomic and political procedures that we could translate as artists  that this is about a bottom up urbanization that performs. See here  buildings are not important just for their looks  but  in fact  they are important for what they can do. They truly perform as they transform through time and as communities negotiate the spaces and boundaries and resources. So while waste flows southbound  people go north in search of dollars  and most of my research has had to do with the impact of immigration in the alteration of the homogeneity of many neighborhoods in the United States  particularly in San Diego. And I'm talking about how this begins to suggest that the future of Southern California depends on the retrofitting of the large urbanization    I mean  on steroids    with the small programs  social and economic. I'm referring to how immigrants  when they come to these neighborhoods  they begin to alter the one dimensionality of parcels and properties into more socially and economically complex systems  as they begin to plug an informal economy into a garage  or as they build an illegal granny flat to support an extended family. This socioeconomic entrepreneurship on the ground within these neighborhoods really begins to suggest ways of translating that into new  inclusive and more equitable land use policies. So many stories emerge from these dynamics of alteration of space  such as  quot the informal Buddha  quot  which tells the story of a small house that saved itself  it did not travel to Mexico  but it was retrofitted in the end into a Buddhist temple  and in so doing  this small house transforms or mutates from a singular dwelling into a small  or a micro  socioeconomic and cultural infrastructure inside a neighborhood. So these action neighborhoods  as I call them  really become the inspiration to imagine other interpretations of citizenship that have less to do  in fact  with belonging to the nation state  and more with upholding the notion of citizenship as a creative act that reorganizes institutional protocols in the spaces of the city. As an artist  I've been interested  in fact  in the visualization of citizenship  the gathering of many anecdotes  urban stories  in order to narrativize the relationship between social processes and spaces. This is a story of a group of teenagers that one night  a few months ago  decided to invade this space under the freeway to begin constructing their own skateboard park. With shovels in hand  they started to dig. Two weeks later  the police stopped them. They barricaded the place  and the teenagers were evicted  and the teenagers decided to fight back  not with bank cards or slogans but with constructing a critical process. The first thing they did was to recognize the specificity of political jurisdiction inscribed in that empty space. They found out that they had been lucky because they had not begun to dig under Caltrans territoy. Caltrans is a state agency that governs the freeway  so it would have been very difficult to negotiate with them. They were lucky  they said  because they began to dig under an arm of the freeway that belongs to the local municipality. They were also lucky  they said  because they began to dig in a sort of Bermuda Triangle of jurisdiction  between port authority  airport authority  two city districts  and a review board. All these red lines are the invisible political institutions that were inscribed in that leftover empty space. With this knowledge  these teenagers as skaters confronted the city. They came to the city attorney's office. The city attorney told them that in order to continue the negotiation they had to become an NGO  and of course they didn't know what an NGO was. They had to talk to their friends in Seattle who had gone through the same experience. And they began to realize the necessity to organize themselves even deeper and began to fundraise  to organize budgets  to really be aware of all the knowledge embedded in the urban code in San Diego so that they could begin to redefine the very meaning of public space in the city  expanding it to other categories. At the end  the teenagers won the case with that evidence  and they were able to construct their skateboard park under that freeway. Now for many of you  this story might seem trivial or naive. For me as an architect  it has become a fundamental narrative  because it begins to teach me that this micro community not only designed another category of public space but they also designed the socioeconomic protocols that were necessary to be inscribed in that space for its long term sustainability. They also taught me that similar to the migrant communities on both sides of the border  they engaged conflict itself as a creative tool  because they had to produce a process that enabled them to reorganize resources and the politics of the city. In that act  that informal  bottom up act of transgression  really began to trickle up to transform top down policy. Now this journey from the bottom up to the transformation of the top down is where I find hope today. And I'm thinking of how these modest alterations with space and with policy in many cities in the world  in primarily the urgency of a collective imagination as these communities reimagine their own forms of governance  social organization  and infrastructure  really is at the center of the new formation of democratic politics of the urban. It is  in fact  this that could become the framework for producing new social and economic justice in the city. I want to say this and emphasize it  because this is the only way I see that can enable us to move from urbanizations of consumption to neighborhoods of production today. Thank you. Intelligence    what is it  If we take a look back at the history of how intelligence has been viewed  one seminal example has been Edsger Dijkstra's famous quote that  the question of whether a machine can think is about as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim.  Now  Edsger Dijkstra  when he wrote this  intended it as a criticism of the early pioneers of computer science  like Alan Turing. However  if you take a look back and think about what have been the most empowering innovations that enabled us to build artificial machines that swim and artificial machines that  fly   you find that it was only through understanding the underlying physical mechanisms of swimming and flight that we were able to build these machines. And so  several years ago  I undertook a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence. Let's take a step back. Let's first begin with a thought experiment. Pretend that you're an alien race that doesn't know anything about Earth biology or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence  but you have amazing telescopes and you're able to watch the Earth  and you have amazingly long lives  so you're able to watch the Earth over millions  even billions of years. And you observe a really strange effect. You observe that  over the course of the millennia  Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids up until a point  and that at some point  corresponding roughly to our year       AD  asteroids that are on a collision course with the Earth that otherwise would have collided mysteriously get deflected or they detonate before they can hit the Earth. Now of course  as earthlings  we know the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves. We're trying to prevent an impact. But if you're an alien race who doesn't know any of this  doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence  you'd be forced to put together a physical theory that explains how  up until a certain point in time  asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet mysteriously stop doing that. And so I claim that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence. So in this program that I undertook several years ago  I looked at a variety of different threads across science  across a variety of disciplines  that were pointing  I think  towards a single  underlying mechanism for intelligence. In cosmology  for example  there have been a variety of different threads of evidence that our universe appears to be finely tuned for the development of intelligence  and  in particular  for the development of universal states that maximize the diversity of possible futures. In game play  for example  in Go    everyone remembers in      when IBM's Deep Blue beat  Garry Kasparov at chess    fewer people are aware that in the past    years or so  the game of Go  arguably a much more challenging game because it has a much higher branching factor  has also started to succumb to computer game players for the same reason  the best techniques right now for computers playing Go are techniques that try to maximize future options during game play. Finally  in robotic motion planning  there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to take advantage of abilities of robots to maximize future freedom of action in order to accomplish complex tasks. And so  taking all of these different threads and putting them together  I asked  starting several years ago  is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can factor out of all of these different threads  Is there a single equation for intelligence  And the answer  I believe  is yes.   F   T   S    What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to an E   mc  for intelligence that I've seen. So what you're seeing here is a statement of correspondence that intelligence is a force  F  that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action. It acts to maximize future freedom of action  or keep options open  with some strength T  with the diversity of possible accessible futures  S  up to some future time horizon  tau. In short  intelligence doesn't like to get trapped. Intelligence tries to maximize future freedom of action and keep options open. And so  given this one equation  it's natural to ask  so what can you do with this  How predictive is it  Does it predict human level intelligence  Does it predict artificial intelligence  So I'm going to show you now a video that will  I think  demonstrate some of the amazing applications of just this single equation. has suggested that universes that produce more disorder  or  entropy   over their lifetimes should tend to have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings such as ourselves. But what if that tentative cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence hints at a deeper relationship  What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate with the production of long term entropy  but actually emerges directly from it  To find out  we developed a software engine called Entropica  designed to maximize the production of long term entropy of any system that it finds itself in. Amazingly  Entropica was able to pass multiple animal intelligence tests  play human games  and even earn money trading stocks  all without being instructed to do so. Here are some examples of Entropica in action. Just like a human standing upright without falling over  here we see Entropica automatically balancing a pole using a cart. This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave Entropica a goal. It simply decided on its own to balance the pole. This balancing ability will have appliactions for humanoid robotics and human assistive technologies. Just as some animals can use objects in their environments as tools to reach into narrow spaces  here we see that Entropica  again on its own initiative  was able to move a large disk representing an animal around so as to cause a small disk  representing a tool  to reach into a confined space holding a third disk and release the third disk from its initially fixed position. This tool use ability will have applications for smart manufacturing and agriculture. In addition  just as some other animals are able to cooperate by pulling opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release food  here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish a model version of that task. This cooperative ability has interesting implications for economic planning and a variety of other fields. Entropica is broadly applicable to a variety of domains. For example  here we see it successfully playing a game of pong against itself  illustrating its potential for gaming. Here we see Entropica orchestrating new connections on a social network where friends are constantly falling out of touch and successfully keeping the network well connected. This same network orchestration ability also has applications in health care  energy  and intelligence. Here we see Entropica directing the paths of a fleet of ships  successfully discovering and utilizing the Panama Canal to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific. By the same token  Entropica is broadly applicable to problems in autonomous defense  logistics and transportation. Finally  here we see Entropica spontaneously discovering and executing a buy low  sell high strategy on a simulated range traded stock  successfully growing assets under management exponentially. This risk management ability will have broad applications in finance and insurance. Alex Wissner Gross  So what you've just seen is that a variety of signature human intelligent cognitive behaviors such as tool use and walking upright and social cooperation all follow from a single equation  which drives a system to maximize its future freedom of action. Now  there's a profound irony here. Going back to the beginning of the usage of the term robot  the play  RUR   there was always a concept that if we developed machine intelligence  there would be a cybernetic revolt. The machines would rise up against us. One major consequence of this work is that maybe all of these decades  we've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt in reverse. It's not that machines first become intelligent and then megalomaniacal and try to take over the world. It's quite the opposite  that the urge to take control of all possible futures is a more fundamental principle than that of intelligence  that general intelligence may in fact emerge directly from this sort of control grabbing  rather than vice versa. Another important consequence is goal seeking. I'm often asked  how does the ability to seek goals follow from this sort of framework  And the answer is  the ability to seek goals will follow directly from this in the following sense  just like you would travel through a tunnel  a bottleneck in your future path space  in order to achieve many other diverse objectives later on  or just like you would invest in a financial security  reducing your short term liquidity in order to increase your wealth over the long term  goal seeking emerges directly from a long term drive to increase future freedom of action. Finally  Richard Feynman  famous physicist  once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed and you could pass only a single concept on to our descendants to help them rebuild civilization  that concept should be that all matter around us is made out of tiny elements that attract each other when they're far apart but repel each other when they're close together. My equivalent of that statement to pass on to descendants to help them build artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence  is the following  Intelligence should be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in its own future. Thank you very much. Hi. So today  I'd like to share some works in progress. Since we are still realizing these works  we are largely working within the realm of intuition and mystery  still. So I'm going to try and describe some of the experiences that we're looking for through each of the works. So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes. A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room  and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall. Within seconds  as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer  they appear to panic and sort of get into a strict symmetry. So this is the sketch of the two states. One is total chaos. The other is absolute order. And we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state. This also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions. One is the altar tablets of the   th century  and the other is about     years ago  Malevich's abstract compositions. So I'm just going to take you to a video. To give you a sense of scale  the largest panel is about two meters high. That's about this much.  And the smallest one is an A . So a viewer enters the space  and they snap to attention. And after a while  if the viewer continues to remain in the space  the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again  until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement  when they will again snap to attention. So here it appears as if it's the viewer that's sort of instigating the sense of order among the panels  but it could also be the other way around  that the panels are so stuck within their preconditioned behaviors that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant. So this brings me to a quieter  small work called Handheld. The viewer sees a piece of paper that's mounted on the far end of the wall  but when you go closer  you see that it's a blank A   or a letter sized piece of paper  that's held on either side by two small hands that appear to be carved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood. The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture is sort of moving very slightly  as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long period of time  and somehow are not managing to. So this instability in the movement very closely resembles the unsteady nature of images seen through a handheld camera. So here I'm going to show you two tandem clips. One is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera. And you immediately see how the unsteady nature of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view. So we've just removed the camera and transferred that movement onto the panel. So here's a video. You have to imagine the other hand. It's not there yet. But to us  we're sort of trying to evoke a self effacing gesture  as if there's a little person with outstretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper. That sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them. The next work is Decoy. This is a cardboard model  so the object is about as tall as I am. It has a rounded body  two arms  and a very tall  head like antenna  and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself. So when a viewer passes by  it sort of tilts from side to side  and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer. So here is the first test scenario. You see the two movements integrated  and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation. But the idea is that once it's got the person's attention  it's no longer interested  and it looks for the next person whose attention to get. So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy. It appears to be mass manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines. Because we are always working from a very personal space  we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of depersonalizes the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance  at least. And so to us this is a kind of sinister being which is trying to distract you from the things that actually need your attention  but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help. The next work is an object  that's also a kind of sound instrument. In the shape of an amphitheater that's scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage. So from where I'm standing  each of you appears to be this big  and the audience sort of takes the entire field of my vision. Seated in this audience are     small figures. They're mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will. This means that each of them can decide if and when they want to clap  how hard  for how long  how they want to be influenced by those around them or influence others  and if they want to contribute to innovation. So when the viewer steps in front of the audience  there will be a response. It could be a few claps or a strong applause  and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage  and again the audience will respond. It could be anything from a few feeble claps from members in the audience  or it could be a very loud ovation. So to us  I think we're really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that's also got a sort of musical like quality to it  an instrument. So the viewer can play it by eliciting quite complex and varied  nuanced musical or sound patterns  but cannot really provoke the audience into any particular kind of response. So there's a sense of judgment and capriciousness and uneasiness involved. It also has an alluring and trap like quality to it. So here if you see we're quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands. So here's a small visual animation  as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing against each other to kind of make sense of the duality and the tension. And here is a prototype. So we can't wait to be engulfed by     of them. Okay  this is the last work. It's called the Framerunners. It comes out of the idea of a window. This is an actual window in our studio  and as you can see  it's made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections. So we used the same window vocabulary to construct our own frame or grid that's suspended in the room and that can be viewed from two sides. This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures. They're also made up of three different sizes  as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain. Each of these figures can also run backward and forward in the track and hide behind two adjacent tracks. So in contrast to this very tight grid  we wanted to give these figures a very comical and slapstick like quality  as if a puppeteer has taken them and physically animated them down the path. So we like the idea of these figures sort of skipping along like they're oblivious and carefree and happy go lucky and content  until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer and they will hide behind the fastest wall. So to us  this work also presents its own contradiction. These figures are sort of entrapped within this very strong grid  which is like a prison  but also a fortress  because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and carefree and quite oblivious of the external world. So all these real life qualities that I talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration  and we were very lucky to collaborate with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype. So you see they extracted the motion cogs from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the head bobbing movement and the back and forth movement. So it's really quite small. You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand. So imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio  and here it is. Thank you. I'd like to start  if I may  with the story of the Paisley snail. On the evening of the   th of August        May Donoghue took a train from Glasgow to the town of Paisley  seven miles east of the city  and there at the Wellmeadow Caf   she had a Scots ice cream float  a mix of ice cream and ginger beer bought for her by a friend. The ginger beer came in a brown  opaque bottle labeled  D. Stevenson  Glen Lane  Paisley.  She drank some of the ice cream float  but as the remaining ginger beer was poured into her tumbler  a decomposed snail floated to the surface of her glass. Three days later  she was admitted to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary and diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis and shock. The case of Donoghue vs. Stevenson that followed set a very important legal precedent  Stevenson  the manufacturer of the ginger beer  was held to have a clear duty of care towards May Donoghue  even though there was no contract between them  and  indeed  she hadn't even bought the drink. One of the judges  Lord Atkin  described it like this  You must take care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbor. Indeed  one wonders that without a duty of care  how many people would have had to suffer from gastroenteritis before Stevenson eventually went out of business. Now please hang on to that Paisley snail story  because it's an important principle. Last year  the Hansard Society  a nonpartisan charity which seeks to strengthen parliamentary democracy and encourage greater public involvement in politics published  alongside their annual audit of political engagement  an additional section devoted entirely to politics and the media. Here are a couple of rather depressing observations from that survey. Tabloid newspapers do not appear to advance the political citizenship of their readers  relative even to those who read no newspapers whatsoever. Tabloid only readers are twice as likely to agree with a negative view of politics than readers of no newspapers. They're not just less politically engaged. They are consuming media that reinforces their negative evaluation of politics  thereby contributing to a fatalistic and cynical attitude to democracy and their own role within it. Little wonder that the report concluded that in this respect  the press  particularly the tabloids  appear not to be living up to the importance of their role in our democracy. Now I doubt if anyone in this room would seriously challenge that view. But if Hansard are right  and they usually are  then we've got a very serious problem on our hands  and it's one that I'd like to spend the next    minutes focusing upon. Since the Paisley snail  and especially over the past decade or so  a great deal of thinking has been developed around the notion of a duty of care as it relates to a number of aspects of civil society. Generally a duty of care arises when one individual or a group of individuals undertakes an activity which has the potential to cause harm to another  either physically  mentally or economically. This is principally focused on obvious areas  such as our empathetic response to children and young people  to our service personnel  and to the elderly and infirm. It is seldom  if ever  extended to equally important arguments around the fragility of our present system of government  to the notion that honesty  accuracy and impartiality are fundamental to the process of building and embedding an informed  participatory democracy. And the more you think about it  the stranger that is. A couple of years ago  I had the pleasure of opening a brand new school in the northeast of England. It had been renamed by its pupils as Academy    . As I walked through their impressive  glass covered atrium  in front of me  emblazoned on the wall in letters of fire was Marcus Aurelius's famous injunction  If it's not true  don't say it  if it's not right  don't do it. The head teacher saw me staring at it  and he said   Oh  that's our school motto.  On the train back to London  I couldn't get it out of my mind. I kept thinking  can it really have taken us over       years to come to terms with that simple notion as being our minimum expectation of each other  Isn't it time that we develop this concept of a duty of care and extended it to include a care for our shared but increasingly endangered democratic values  After all  the absence of a duty of care within many professions can all too easily amount to accusations of negligence  and that being the case  can we be really comfortable with the thought that we're in effect being negligent in respect of the health of our own societies and the values that necessarily underpin them  Could anyone honestly suggest  on the evidence  that the same media which Hansard so roundly condemned have taken sufficient care to avoid behaving in ways which they could reasonably have foreseen would be likely to undermine or even damage our inherently fragile democratic settlement. Now there will be those who will argue that this could all too easily drift into a form of censorship  albeit self censorship  but I don't buy that argument. It has to be possible to balance freedom of expression with wider moral and social responsibilities. Let me explain why by taking the example from my own career as a filmmaker. Throughout that career  I never accepted that a filmmaker should set about putting their own work outside or above what he or she believed to be a decent set of values for their own life  their own family  and the future of the society in which we all live. I'd go further. A responsible filmmaker should never devalue their work to a point at which it becomes less than true to the world they themselves wish to inhabit. As I see it  filmmakers  journalists  even bloggers are all required to face up to the social expectations that come with combining the intrinsic power of their medium with their well honed professional skills. Obviously this is not a mandated duty  but for the gifted filmmaker and the responsible journalist or even blogger  it strikes me as being utterly inescapable. We should always remember that our notion of individual freedom and its partner  creative freedom  is comparatively new in the history of Western ideas  and for that reason  it's often undervalued and can be very quickly undermined. It's a prize easily lost  and once lost  once surrendered  it can prove very  very hard to reclaim. And its first line of defense has to be our own standards  not those enforced on us by a censor or legislation  our own standards and our own integrity. Our integrity as we deal with those with whom we work and our own standards as we operate within society. And these standards of ours need to be all of a piece with a sustainable social agenda. They're part of a collective responsibility  the responsibility of the artist or the journalist to deal with the world as it really is  and this  in turn  must go hand in hand with the responsibility of those governing society to also face up to that world  and not to be tempted to misappropriate the causes of its ills. Yet  as has become strikingly clear over the last couple of years  such responsibility has to a very great extent been abrogated by large sections of the media. And as a consequence  across the Western world  the over simplistic policies of the parties of protest and their appeal to a largely disillusioned  older demographic  along with the apathy and obsession with the trivial that typifies at least some of the young  taken together  these and other similarly contemporary aberrations are threatening to squeeze the life out of active  informed debate and engagement  and I stress active. The most ardent of libertarians might argue that Donoghue v. Stevenson should have been thrown out of court and that Stevenson would eventually have gone out of business if he'd continued to sell ginger beer with snails in it. But most of us  I think  accept some small role for the state to enforce a duty of care  and the key word here is reasonable. Judges must ask  did they take reasonable care and could they have reasonably foreseen the consequences of their actions  Far from signifying overbearing state power  it's that small common sense test of reasonableness that I'd like us to apply to those in the media who  after all  set the tone and the content for much of our democratic discourse. Democracy  in order to work  requires that reasonable men and women take the time to understand and debate difficult  sometimes complex issues  and they do so in an atmosphere which strives for the type of understanding that leads to  if not agreement  then at least a productive and workable compromise. Politics is about choices  and within those choices  politics is about priorities. It's about reconciling conflicting preferences wherever and whenever possibly based on fact. But if the facts themselves are distorted  the resolutions are likely only to create further conflict  with all the stresses and strains on society that inevitably follow. The media have to decide  Do they see their role as being to inflame or to inform  Because in the end  it comes down to a combination of trust and leadership. Fifty years ago this week  President John F. Kennedy made two epoch making speeches  the first on disarmament and the second on civil rights. The first led almost immediately to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty  and the second led to the      Civil Rights Act  both of which represented giant leaps forward. Democracy  well led and well informed  can achieve very great things  but there's a precondition. We have to trust that those making those decisions are acting in the best interest not of themselves but of the whole of the people. We need factually based options  clearly laid out  not those of a few powerful and potentially manipulative corporations pursuing their own frequently narrow agendas  but accurate  unprejudiced information with which to make our own judgments. If we want to provide decent  fulfilling lives for our children and our children's children  we need to exercise to the very greatest degree possible that duty of care for a vibrant  and hopefully a lasting  democracy. Thank you very much for listening to me. So imagine  you're in the supermarket  you're buying some groceries  and you get given the option for a plastic or a paper shopping bag. Which one do you choose if you want to do the right thing by the environment  Most people do pick the paper. Okay  let's think of why. It's brown to start with. Therefore  it must be good for the environment. It's biodegradable. It's reusable. In some cases  it's recyclable. So when people are looking at the plastic bag  it's likely they're thinking of something like this  which we all know is absolutely terrible  and we should be avoiding at all expenses these kinds of environmental damages. But people are often not thinking of something like this  which is the other end of the spectrum. When we produce materials  we need to extract them from the environment  and we need a whole bunch of environmental impacts. You see  what happens is  when we need to make complex choices  us humans like really simple solutions  and so we often ask for simple solutions. And I work in design. I advise designers and innovators around sustainability  and everyone always says to me   Oh Leyla  I just want the eco materials.  And I say   Well  that's very complex  and we'll have to spend four hours talking about what exactly an eco material means  because everything at some point comes from nature  and it's how you use the material that dictates the environmental impact. So what happens is  we have to rely on some sort of intuitive framework when we make decisions. So I like to call that intuitive framework our environmental folklore. It's either the little voice at the back of your head  or it's that gut feeling you get when you've done the right thing  so when you've picked the paper bag or when you've bought a fuel efficient car. And environmental folklore is a really important thing because we're trying to do the right thing. But how do we know if we're actually reducing the net environmental impacts that our actions as individuals and as professionals and as a society are actually having on the natural environment  So the thing about environmental folklore is it tends to be based on our experiences  the things we've heard from other people. It doesn't tend to be based on any scientific framework. And this is really hard  because we live in incredibly complex systems. We have the human systems of how we communicate and interrelate and have our whole constructed society  We have the industrial systems  which is essentially the entire economy  and then all of that has to operate within the biggest system  and  I would argue  the most important  the ecosystem. And you see  the choices that we make as an individual  but the choices that we make in every single job that we have  no matter how high or low you are in the pecking order  has an impact on all of these systems. And the thing is that we have to find ways if we're actually going to address sustainability of interlocking those complex systems and making better choices that result in net environmental gains. What we need to do is we need to learn to do more with less. We have an increasing population  and everybody likes their mobile phones  especially in this situation here. So we need to find innovative ways of solving some of these problems that we face. And that's where this process called life cycle thinking comes in. So essentially  everything that is created goes through a series of life cycle stages  and we use this scientific process called life cycle assessment  or in America  you guys say life cycle analysis  in order to have a clearer picture of how everything that we do in the technical part of those systems affects the natural environment. So we go all the way back to the extraction of raw materials  and then we look at manufacturing  we look at packaging and transportation  use  and end of life  and at every single one of these stages  the things that we do have an interaction with the natural environment  and we can monitor how that interaction is actually affecting the systems and services that make life on Earth possible. And through doing this  we've learned some absolutely fascinating things. And we've busted a bunch of myths. So to start with  there's a word that's used a lot. It's used a lot in marketing  and it's used a lot  I think  in our conversation when we're talking about sustainability  and that's the word biodegradability. Now biodegradability is a material property  it is not a definition of environmental benefits. Allow me to explain. When something natural  something that's made from a cellulose fiber like a piece of bread  even  or any food waste  or even a piece of paper  when something natural ends up in the natural environment  it degrades normally. Its little carbon molecules that it stored up as it was growing are naturally released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide  but this is a net situation. Most natural things don't actually end up in nature. Most of the things  the waste that  we produce  end up in landfill. Landfill is a different environment. In landfill  those same carbon molecules degrade in a different way  because a landfill is anaerobic. It's got no oxygen. It's tightly compacted and hot. Those same molecules  they become methane  and methane is a    times more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. So our old lettuces and products that we have thrown out that are made out of biodegradable materials  if they end up in landfill  contribute to climate change. You see  there are facilities now that can actually capture that methane and generate power  displacing the need for fossil fuel power  but we need to be smart about this. We need to identify how we can start to leverage these types of things that are already happening and start to design systems and services that alleviate these problems. Because right now  what people do is they turn around and they say   Let's ban plastic bags. We'll give people paper because that is better for the environment.  But if you're throwing it in the bin  and your local landfill facility is just a normal one  then we're having what's called a double negative. I'm a product designer by trade. I then did social science. And so I'm absolutely fascinated by consumer goods and how the consumer goods that we have kind of become immune to that fill our lives have an impact on the natural environment. And these guys are  like  serial offenders  and I'm pretty sure everyone in this room has a refrigerator. Now America has this amazing ability to keep growing refrigerators. In the last few years  they've grown one cubic foot on average  the standard size of a refrigerator. And the problem is  they're so big now  it's easier for us to buy more food that we can't eat or find. I mean  I have things at the back of my refrigerator that have been there for years  all right  And so what happens is  we waste more food. And as I was just explaining  food waste is a problem. In fact  here in the U.S.     percent of food purchased for the home is wasted. Half of the world's produced food is wasted. That's the latest U.N. stats. Up to half of the food. It's insane. It's  .  billion tons of food per annum. And I blame it on the refrigerator  well  especially in Western cultures  because it makes it easier. I mean  there's a lot of complex systems going on here. I don't want to make it so simplistic. But the refrigerator is a serious contributor to this  and one of the features of it is the crisper drawer. You all got crisper drawers  The drawer that you put your lettuces in  Lettuces have a habit of going soggy in the crisper drawers  don't they  Yeah  Soggy lettuces  In the U.K.  this is such a problem that there was a government report a few years ago that actually said the second biggest offender of wasted food in the U.K. is the soggy lettuce. It was called the Soggy Lettuce Report. Okay  So this is a problem  people. These poor little lettuces are getting thrown out left  right and center because the crisper drawers are not designed to actually keep things crisp. Okay. You need a tight environment. You need  like  an airless environment to prevent the degrading that would happen naturally. But the crisper drawers  they're just a drawer with a slightly better seal. Anyway  I'm clearly obsessed. Don't ever invite me over because I'll just start going through your refrigerator and looking at all sorts of things like that. But essentially  this is a big problem. Because when we lose something like the lettuce from the system  not only do we have that impact  I just explained at the end of life  but we actually have had to grow that lettuce. The life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical. We've had to clear land. We've had to plant seeds  phosphorus  fertilizers  nutrients  water  sunlight. All of the embodied impacts in that lettuce get lost from the system  which makes it a far bigger environmental impact than the loss of the energy from the fridge. So we need to design things like this far better if we're going to start addressing serious environmental problems. We could start with the crisper drawer and the size. For those of you in the room who do design fridges  that would be great. The problem is  imagine if we actually started to reconsider  how we designed things. So I look at the refrigerator as a sign of modernity  but we actually haven't really changed the design of them that much since the     s. A little bit  but essentially they're still big boxes  cold boxes that we store stuff in. So imagine if we actually really started to identify these problems and use that as the foundation for finding innovative and elegant design solutions that will solve those problems. This is design led system change  design dictating the way in which the system can be far more sustainable. Forty percent food waste is a major problem. Imagine if we designed fridges that halved that. Another item that I find fascinating is the electric tea kettle  which I found out that you don't do tea kettles in this country  really  do you  But that's really big in the U.K. Ninety seven percent of households in the United Kingdom own an electric tea kettle. So they're very popular. And  I mean  if I were to work with a design firm or a designer  and they were designing one of these  and they wanted to do it eco  they'd usually ask me two things. They'd say   Leyla  how do I make it technically efficient   Because obviously energy's a problem with this product. Or   How do I make it green materials  How do I make the materials green in the manufacturing   Would you ask me those questions  They seem logical  right  Yeah. Well I'd say   You're looking at the wrong problems.  Because the problem is with use. It's with how people use the product. Sixty five percent of Brits admit to over filling their kettle when they only need one cup of tea. All of this extra water that's being boiled requires energy  and it's been calculated that in one day of extra energy use from boiling kettles is enough to light all of the streetlights in England for a night. But this is the thing. This is what I call a product person failure. But we've got a product system failure going on with these little guys  and they're so ubiquitous  you  don't even notice they're there. And this guy over here  though  he does. He's named Simon. Simon works for the national electricity company in the U.K. He has a very important job of monitoring all of the electricity coming into the system to make sure there is enough so it powers everybody's homes. He's also watching television. The reason is because there's a unique phenomenon that happens in the U.K. the moment that very popular TV shows end. The minute the ad break comes on  this man has to rush to buy nuclear power from France  because everybody turns their kettles on at the same time.  .  million kettles  seriously problematic. So imagine if you designed kettles  you actually found a way to solve these system failures  because this is a huge amount of pressure on the system  just because the product hasn't thought about the problem that it's going to have when it exists in the world. Now  I looked at a number of kettles available on the market  and found the minimum fill lines  so the little piece of information that tells you how much you need to put in there  was between two and a five and a half cups of water just to make one cup of tea. So this kettle here is an example of one where it actually has two reservoirs. One's a boiling chamber  and one's the water holder. The user actually has to push that button to get their hot water boiled  which means  because we're all lazy  you only fill exactly what you need. And this is what I call behavior changing products  products  systems or services that intervene and solve these problems up front. Now  this is a technology arena  so obviously these things are quite popular  but I think if we're going to keep designing  buying and using and throwing out these kinds of products at the rate we currently do  which is astronomically high  there are seven billion people who live in the world right now. There are six billion mobile phone subscriptions as of last year. Every single year   .  billion mobile phones roll off production lines  and some companies report their production rate as being greater than the human birth rate. One hundred fifty two million phones  were thrown out in the U.S. last year  only    percent were recycled. I'm from Australia. We have a population of    million    don't laugh    and it's been reported that    million phones are in people's drawers. We need to find ways of solving the problems around this  because these things are so complicated. They have so much locked up inside them. Gold  Did you know that it's actually cheaper now to get gold out of a ton of old mobile phones than it is out of a ton of gold ore  There's a number of highly complex and valuable materials embodied inside these things  so we need to find ways of encouraging disassembly  because this is otherwise what happens. This is a community in Ghana  and e waste is reported  or electronic waste is reported by the U.N. as being up to    million tons trafficked. This is how they get the gold and the other valuable materials out. They burn the electronic waste in open spaces. These are communities  and this is happening all over the world. And because we don't see the ramifications of the choices that we make as designers  as businesspeople  as consumers  then these kinds of externalities happen  and these are people's lives. So we need to find smarter  more systems based  innovative solutions to these problems  if we're going to start to live sustainably within this world. So imagine if  when you bought your mobile phone  your new one because you replaced your old one    after    to    months is the average time that people replace their phones  by the way   so if we're going to keep this kind of expedient mobile phone replacing  then we should be looking at closing the loop on these systems. The people who produce these phones  and some of which I'm sure are in the room right now  could potentially look at doing what we call closed loop systems  or product system services  so identifying that there is a market demand and that market demand's not going to go anywhere  so you design the product to solve the problem. Design for disassembly  design for light weighting. We heard some of those kinds of strategies being used in the Tesla Motors car today. These kinds of approaches are not hard  but understanding the system and then looking for viable  market driven consumer demand alternatives is how we can start radically altering the sustainability agenda  because I hate to break it to you all  Consumption is the biggest problem. But design is one of the best solutions. These kinds of products are everywhere. By identifying alternative ways of doing things  we can actually start to innovate  and I say actually start to innovate. I'm sure everyone in this room is very innovative. But in the regards to using sustainability as a parameter  as a criteria for fueling systems based solutions  because as I've just demonstrated with these simple products  they're participating in these major problems. So we need to look across the entire life of the things that we do. If you just had paper or plastic    obviously reusable is far more beneficial    then the paper is worse  and the paper is worse because it weighs four to    times more than the plastic  and when we actually compare  from a life cycle perspective  a kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper  the paper is far better  but the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag to carry your groceries home is not  done with a kilo of each material. It's done with a very small amount of plastic and quite a lot more paper. Because functionality defines environmental impact  and I said earlier that the designers always ask me for the eco materials. I say  there's only a few materials that you should completely avoid. The rest of them  it's all about application  and at the end of the day  everything we design and produce in the economy or buy as consumers is done so for function. We want something  therefore we buy it. So breaking things back down and delivering smartly  elegantly  sophisticated solutions that take into consideration the entire system and the entire life of the thing  everything  all the way back to the extraction through to the end of life  we can start to actually find really innovative solutions. And I'll just leave you with one very quick thing that a designer said to me recently  who I work with  a senior designer. I said   How come you're not doing  sustainability  I know you know this.  And he said   Well  recently I pitched a sustainability project to a client  and turned and he said to me  'I know it's going to cost less  I know it's going to sell more  but we're not pioneers  because pioneers have arrows in their backs.'  I think we've got a roomful of pioneers  and I hope there are far more pioneers out there  because we need to solve these problems. Thank you. The world is changing in some really profound ways  and I worry that investors aren't paying enough attention to some of the biggest drivers of change  especially when it comes to sustainability. And by sustainability  I mean the really juicy things  like environmental and social issues and corporate governance. I think it's reckless to ignore these things  because doing so can jeopardize future long term returns. And here's something that may surprise you  the balance of power to really influence sustainability rests with institutional investors  the large investors like pension funds  foundations and endowments. I believe that sustainable investing is less complicated than you think  better performing than you believe  and more important than we can imagine. Let me remind you what we already know. We have a population that's both growing and aging  we have seven billion souls today heading to    billion at the end of the century  we consume natural resources faster than they can be replenished  and the emissions that are mainly responsible for climate change just keep increasing. Now clearly  these are environmental and social issues  but that's not all. They're economic issues  and that makes them relevant to risk and return. And they are really complex and they can seem really far off  that the temptation may be to do this  bury our heads in the sand and not think about it. Resist this  if you can. Don't do this at home. But it makes me wonder if the investment rules of today are fit for purpose tomorrow. We know that investors  when they look at a company and decide whether to invest  they look at financial data  metrics like sales growth  cash flow  market share  valuation    you know  the really sexy stuff. And these things are fundamental  of course  but they're not enough. Investors should also look at performance metrics in what we call ESG  environment  social and governance. Environment includes energy consumption  water availability  waste and pollution  just making efficient uses of resources. Social includes human capital  things like employee engagement and innovation capacity  as well as supply chain management and labor rights and human rights. And governance relates to the oversight of companies by their boards and investors. See  I told you this is the really juicy stuff. But ESG is the measure of sustainability  and sustainable investing incorporates ESG factors with financial factors into the investment process. It means limiting future risk by minimizing harm to people and planet  and it means providing capital to users who deploy it towards productive and sustainable outcomes. So if sustainability matters financially today  and all signs indicate more tomorrow  is the private sector paying attention  Well  the really cool thing is that most CEOs are. They started to see sustainability not just as important but crucial to business success. About    percent of global CEOs see sustainability as the root to growth in innovation and leading to competitive advantage in their industries. But    percent see ESG as the future  or as important to the future of their business. So the views of CEOs are clear. There's tremendous opportunity in sustainability. So how are companies actually leveraging ESG to drive hard business results  One example is near and dear to our hearts. In       State Street migrated    applications to the cloud environment  and we retired another   . We virtualized our operating system environments  and we completed numerous automation projects. Now these initiatives create a more mobile workplace  and they reduce our real estate footprint  and they yield savings of    million dollars in operating costs annually  and avoid the emissions of a         metric tons of carbon. That's the equivalent of taking        cars off the road. So awesome  right  Another example is Pentair. Pentair is a U.S. industrial conglomerate  and about a decade ago  they sold their core power tools business and reinvested those proceeds in a water business. That's a really big bet. Why did they do that  Well  with apologies to the Home Improvement fans  there's more growth in water than in power tools  and this company has their sights set on what they call  the new New World.  That's four billion middle class people demanding food  energy and water. Now  you may be asking yourself  are these just isolated cases  I mean  come on  really  Do companies that take sustainability into account really do well financially  The answer that may surprise you is yes. The data shows that stocks with better ESG performance perform just as well as others. In blue  we see the MSCI World. It's an index of large companies from developed markets across the world. And in gold  we see a subset of companies rated as having the best ESG performance. Over three plus years  no performance tradeoff. So that's okay  right  We want more. I want more. In some cases  there may be outperformance from ESG. In blue  we see the performance of the     largest global companies  and in gold  we see a subset of companies with best practice in climate change strategy and risk management. Now over almost eight years  they've outperformed by about two thirds. So yes  this is correlation. It's not causation. But it does illustrate that environmental leadership is compatible with good returns. So if the returns are the same or better and the planet benefits  wouldn't this be the norm  Are investors  particularly institutional investors  engaged  Well  some are  and a few are really at the vanguard. Hesta. Hesta is a retirement fund for health and community services employees in Australia  with assets of    billion  dollars . They believe that ESG has the potential to impact risks and returns  so incorporating it into the investment process is core to their duty to act in the best interest of fund members  core to their duty. You gotta love the Aussies  right  CalPERS is another example. CalPERS is the pension fund for public employees in California  and with assets of     billion  dollars   they are the second largest in the U.S. and the sixth largest in the world. Now  they're moving toward     percent sustainable investment by systematically integrated ESG across the entire fund. Why  They believe it's critical to superior long term returns  full stop. In their own words   long term value creation requires the effective management of three forms of capital  financial  human  and physical. This is why we are concerned with ESG.  Now  I do speak to a lot of investors as part of my job  and not all of them see it this way. Often I hear   We are required to maximize returns  so we don't do that here   or   We don't want to use the portfolio to make policy statements.  The one that just really gets under my skin is   If you want to do something about that  just make money  give the profits to charities.  It's eyes rolling  eyes rolling. I mean  let me clarify something right here. Companies and investors are not singularly responsible for the fate of the planet. They don't have indefinite social obligations  and prudent investing and finance theory aren't subordinate to sustainability. They're compatible. So I'm not talking about tradeoffs here. But institutional investors are the x factor in sustainability. Why do they hold the key  The answer  quite simply  is  they have the money. A lot of it. I mean  a really lot of it. The global stock market is worth    trillion dollars. The global bond market     trillion. That's     trillion combined. That's eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S. That's the world's largest economy. That's some serious freaking firepower. So we can reconsider some of these pressing challenges  like fresh water  clean air  feeding    billion mouths  if institutional investors integrated ESG into investment. What if they used that firepower to allocate more of their capital to companies working the hardest at solving these challenges or at least not exacerbating them  What if we work and save and invest  only to find that the world we retire into is more stressed and less secure than it is now  What if there isn't enough clean air and fresh water  Now a fair question might be  what if all this sustainability risk stuff is exaggerated  overstated  it's not urgent  something for virtuous consumers or lifestyle choice  Well  President John F. Kennedy said something about this that is just spot on   There are risks and costs to a program of action  but they are far less than the long range risks and costs of comfortable inaction.  I can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this  but since this is based on widespread scientific consensus  the odds that it's not completely wrong are better than the odds that our house will burn down or we'll get in a car accident. Well  maybe not if you live in Boston.  Laughter  But my point is that we buy insurance to protect ourselves financially in case those things happen  right  So by investing sustainably we're doing two things. We're creating insurance  reducing the risk to our planet and to our economy  and at the same time  in the short term  we're not sacrificing performance.  Man in comic   What if it's a big hoax  and we create a better world for nothing    Good  you like it. I like it too. I like it because it pokes fun at both sides of the climate change issue. I bet you can't guess which side I'm on. But what I really like about it is that it reminds me of something Mark Twain said  which is   Plan for the future  because that's where you're going to spend the rest of your life.  Thank you. I'd like to talk today about a powerful and fundamental aspect of who we are  our voice. Each one of us has a unique voiceprint that reflects our age  our size  even our lifestyle and personality. In the words of the poet Longfellow   the human voice is the organ of the soul.  As a speech scientist  I'm fascinated by how the voice is produced  and I have an idea for how it can be engineered. That's what I'd like to share with you. I'm going to start by playing you a sample of a voice that you may recognize. it was fairly obvious what I meant.  Rupal Patel  That was the voice of Professor Stephen Hawking. What you may not know is that same voice may also be used by this little girl who is unable to speak because of a neurological condition. In fact  all of these individuals may be using the same voice  and that's because there's only a few options available. In the U.S. alone  there are  .  million Americans who are unable to speak  and many of whom use computerized devices to communicate. Now that's millions of people worldwide who are using generic voices  including Professor Hawking  who uses an American accented voice. This lack of individuation of the synthetic voice really hit home when I was at an assistive technology conference a few years ago  and I recall walking into an exhibit hall and seeing a little girl and a grown man having a conversation using their devices  different devices  but the same voice. And I looked around and I saw this happening all around me  literally hundreds of individuals using a handful of voices  voices that didn't fit their bodies or their personalities. We wouldn't dream of fitting a little girl with the prosthetic limb of a grown man. So why then the same prosthetic voice  It really struck me  and I wanted to do something about this. I'm going to play you now a sample of someone who has  two people actually  who have severe speech disorders. I want you to take a listen to how they sound. They're saying the same utterance. You probably didn't understand what they said  but I hope that you heard their unique vocal identities. So what I wanted to do next is  I wanted to find out how we could harness these residual vocal abilities and build a technology that could be customized for them  voices that could be customized for them. So I reached out to my collaborator  Tim Bunnell. Dr. Bunnell is an expert in speech synthesis  and what he'd been doing is building personalized voices for people by putting together pre recorded samples of their voice and reconstructing a voice for them. These are people who had lost their voice later in life. We didn't have the luxury of pre recorded samples of speech for those born with speech disorder. But I thought  there had to be a way to reverse engineer a voice from whatever little is left over. So we decided to do exactly that. We set out with a little bit of funding from the National Science Foundation  to create custom crafted voices that captured their unique vocal identities. We call this project VocaliD  or vocal I.D.  for vocal identity. Now before I get into the details of how the voice is made and let you listen to it  I need to give you a real quick speech science lesson. Okay  So first  we know that the voice is changing dramatically over the course of development. Children sound different from teens who sound different from adults. We've all experienced this. Fact number two is that speech is a combination of the source  which is the vibrations generated by your voice box  which are then pushed through the rest of the vocal tract. These are the chambers of your head and neck that vibrate  and they actually filter that source sound to produce consonants and vowels. So the combination of source and filter is how we produce speech. And that happens in one individual. Now I told you earlier that I'd spent a good part of my career understanding and studying the source characteristics of people with severe speech disorder  and what I've found is that even though their filters were impaired  they were able to modulate their source  the pitch  the loudness  the tempo of their voice. These are called prosody  and I've been documenting for years that the prosodic abilities of these individuals are preserved. So when I realized that those same cues are also important for speaker identity  I had this idea. Why don't we take the source from the person we want the voice to sound like  because it's preserved  and borrow the filter from someone about the same age and size  because they can articulate speech  and then mix them  Because when we mix them  we can get a voice that's as clear as our surrogate talker    that's the person we borrowed the filter from  and is similar in identity to our target talker. It's that simple. That's the science behind what we're doing. So once you have that in mind  how do you go about building this voice  Well  you have to find someone who is willing to be a surrogate. It's not such an ominous thing. Being a surrogate donor only requires you to say a few hundred to a few thousand utterances. The process goes something like this. I love to sleep. The sky is blue without clouds. RP  Now she's going to go on like this for about three to four hours  and the idea is not for her to say everything that the target is going to want to say  but the idea is to cover all the different combinations of the sounds that occur in the language. The more speech you have  the better sounding voice you're going to have. Once you have those recordings  what we need to do is we have to parse these recordings into little snippets of speech  one  or two sound combinations  sometimes even whole words that start populating a dataset or a database. We're going to call this database a voice bank. Now the power of the voice bank is that from this voice bank  we can now say any new utterance  like   I love chocolate     everyone needs to be able to say that  fish through that database and find all the segments necessary to say that utterance. RP  So that's speech synthesis. It's called concatenative synthesis  and that's what we're using. That's not the novel part. What's novel is how we make it sound like this young woman. This is Samantha. I met her when she was nine  and since then  my team and I have been trying to build her a personalized voice. We first had to find a surrogate donor  and then we had to have Samantha produce some utterances. What she can produce are mostly vowel like sounds  but that's enough for us to extract her source characteristics. What happens next is best described by my daughter's analogy. She's six. She calls it mixing colors to paint voices. It's beautiful. It's exactly that. Samantha's voice is like a concentrated sample of red food dye which we can infuse into the recordings of her surrogate to get a pink voice just like this. RP  So now  Samantha can say this. I can't wait to use my new voice with my friends. RP  Thank you.  Applause  I'll never forget the gentle smile that spread across her face when she heard that voice for the first time. Now there's millions of people around the world like Samantha  millions  and we've only begun to scratch the surface. What we've done so far is we have a few surrogate talkers from around the U.S. who have donated their voices  and we have been using those to build our first few personalized voices. But there's so much more work to be done. For Samantha  her surrogate came from somewhere in the Midwest  a stranger who gave her the gift of voice. And as a scientist  I'm so excited to take this work out of the laboratory and finally into the real world so it can have real world impact. What I want to share with you next is how I envision taking this work to that next level. I imagine a whole world of surrogate donors from all walks of life  different sizes  different ages  coming together in this voice drive to give people voices that are as colorful as their personalities. To do that as a first step  we've put together this website  VocaliD.org  as a way to bring together those who want to join us as voice donors  as expertise donors  in whatever way to make this vision a reality. They say that giving blood can save lives. Well  giving your voice can change lives. All we need is a few hours of speech from our surrogate talker  and as little as a vowel from our target talker  to create a unique vocal identity. So that's the science behind what we're doing. I want to end by circling back to the human side that is really the inspiration for this work. About five years ago  we built our very first voice for a little boy named William. When his mom first heard this voice  she said   This is what William would have sounded like had he been able to speak.  And then I saw William typing a message on his device. I wondered  what was he thinking  Imagine carrying around someone else's voice for nine years and finally finding your own voice. Imagine that. This is what William said   Never heard me before.  Thank you. What is love  It's a hard term to define in so far as it has a very wide application. I can love jogging. I can love a book  a movie. I can love escalopes. I can love my wife. But there's a great difference between an escalope and my wife  for instance. That is  if I value the escalope  the escalope  on the other hand   it doesn't value me back. Whereas my wife  she calls me the star of her life. Therefore  only another desiring conscience can conceive me as a desirable being. I know this  that's why love can be defined in a more accurate way as the desire of being desired. Hence the eternal problem of love  how to become and remain desirable  The individual used to find an answer to this problem by submitting his life to community rules. You had a specific part to play according to your sex  your age  your social status  and you only had to play your part to be valued and loved by the whole community. Think about the young woman who must remain chaste before marriage. Think about the youngest son  who must obey the eldest son  who in turn must obey the patriarch. But a phenomenon started in the   th century  mainly in the Renaissance  in the West  that caused the biggest identity crisis in the history of humankind. This phenomenon is modernity. We can basically summarize it through a triple process. First  a process of rationalization of scientific research  which has accelerated technical progress. Next  a process of political democratization  which has fostered individual rights. And finally  a process of rationalization  of economic production and of trade liberalization. These three intertwined processes have completely annihilated all the traditional bearings of Western societies  with radical consequences for the individual. Now individuals are free to value or disvalue any attitude  any choice  any object. But as a result  they are themselves confronted with this same freedom that others have to value or disvalue them. In other words  my value was once ensured by submitting myself  to the traditional authorities. Now it is quoted in the stock exchange. On the free market of individual desires  I negotiate my value every day. Hence the anxiety of contemporary man. He is obsessed   Am I desirable  How desirable  How many people are going to love me   And how does he respond to this anxiety  Well  by hysterically collecting symbols of desirability. I call this act of collecting  along with others  seduction capital. Indeed  our consumer society is largely based on seduction capital. It is said about this consumption that our age is materialistic. But it's not true  We only accumulate objects in order to communicate with other minds. We do it to make them love us  to seduce them. Nothing could be less materialistic   or more sentimental  than a teenager buying brand new jeans and tearing them at the knees  because he wants to please Jennifer. Consumerism is not materialism. It is rather what is swallowed up and sacrificed in the name of the god of love  or rather in the name of seduction capital. In light of this observation on contemporary love  how can we think of love in the years to come  We can envision two hypotheses  The first one consists of betting that this process of narcissistic  capitalization will intensify. It is hard to say what shape  this intensification will take  because it largely depends on social and technical innovations  which are by definition difficult to predict. But we can  for instance  imagine a dating website which  a bit like those loyalty points programs  uses seduction capital points that vary according to my age   my height weight ratio  my degree  my salary  or the number of clicks on my profile. We can also imagine a chemical treatment for breakups that weakens the feelings of attachment. By the way  there's a program on MTV already in which seduction teachers treat heartache as a disease. These teachers call themselves  pick up artists.   Artist  in French is easy  it means  artiste.   Pick up  is to pick someone up  but not just any picking up    it's picking up chicks. So they are artists of picking up chicks. And they call heartache  one itis.  In English   itis  is a suffix that signifies infection. One itis can be translated as  an infection from one.  It's a bit disgusting. Indeed  for the pick up artists  falling in love with someone is a waste of time  it's squandering your seduction capital  so it must be eliminated like a disease  like an infection. We can also envision a romantic use of the genome. Everyone would carry it around and present it like a business card to verify if seduction can progress to reproduction. Of course  this race for seduction  like every fierce competition  will create huge disparities  in narcissistic satisfaction  and therefore a lot of loneliness and frustration too. So we can expect that modernity itself  which is the origin of seduction capital  would be called into question. I'm thinking particularly of the reaction of neo fascist or religious communes. But such a future doesn't have to be. Another path to thinking about love may be possible. But how  How to renounce the hysterical need to be valued  Well  by becoming aware of my uselessness. Yes  I'm useless. But rest assured  so are you. We are all useless. This uselessness is easily demonstrated  because in order to be valued I need another to desire me  which shows that I do not have any value of my own. I don't have any inherent value. We all pretend to have an idol  we all pretend to be an idol for someone else  but actually we are all impostors  a bit like a man on the street who appears totally cool and indifferent  while he has actually anticipated and calculated so that all eyes are on him. I think that becoming aware of this general imposture that concerns all of us would ease our love relationships. It is because I want to be loved from head to toe  justified in my every choice  that the seduction hysteria exists. And therefore I want to seem perfect so that another can love me. I want them to be perfect so that I can be reassured of my value. It leads to couples obsessed with performance who will break up  just like that  at the slightest underachievement. In contrast to this attitude  I call upon tenderness    love as tenderness. What is tenderness  To be tender is to accept  the loved one's weaknesses. It's not about becoming a sad couple of orderlies. That's pretty bad. On the contrary  there's plenty of charm and happiness in tenderness. I refer specifically to a kind of humor that is unfortunately underused. It is a sort of poetry of deliberate awkwardness. I refer to self mockery. For a couple who is no longer sustained  supported by the constraints of tradition  I believe that self mockery is one of the best means for  the relationship to endure. As humans  it's in our nature to want to improve our health  and minimize our suffering. Whatever life throws at us  whether it's cancer  diabetes  heart disease  or even broken bones  we want to try and get better. Now I'm head of a biomaterials lab  and I'm really fascinated by the way that humans have used materials in really creative ways in the body over time. Take  for example  this beautiful blue nacre shell. This was actually used by the Mayans as an artificial tooth replacement. We're not quite sure why they did it. It's hard. It's durable. But it also had other very nice properties. In fact  when they put it into the jawbone  it could integrate into the jaw  and we know now with very sophisticated imaging technologies that part of that integration comes from the fact that this material is designed in a very specific way  has a beautiful chemistry  has a beautiful architecture. And I think in many ways we can sort of think of the use of the blue nacre shell and the Mayans as the first real application of the bluetooth technology. But if we move on and think throughout history how people have used different  materials in the body  very often it's been physicians that have been quite creative. They've taken things off the shelf. One of my favorite examples is that of Sir Harold Ridley  who was a famous ophthalmologist  or at least became a famous ophthalmologist. And during World War II  what he would see would be pilots coming back from their missions  and he noticed that within their eyes they had shards of small bits of material lodged within the eye  but the very interesting thing about it was that material  actually  wasn't causing any inflammatory response. So he looked into this  and he figured out that actually that material was little shards of plastic that were coming from the canopy of the Spitfires. And this led him to propose that material as a new material for intraocular lenses. It's called PMMA  and it's now used in millions of people every year and helps in preventing cataracts. And that example  I think  is a really nice one  because it helps remind us that in the early days  people often chose materials because they were bioinert. Their very purpose was to  perform a mechanical function. You'd put them in the body and you wouldn't get an adverse response. And what I want to show you is that in regenerative medicine  we've really shifted away from that idea of taking a bioinert material. We're actually actively looking for materials that will be bioactive  that will interact with the body  and that furthermore we can put in the body  they'll have their function  and then they'll dissolve away over time. If we look at this schematic  this is showing you what we think of as the typical tissue engineering approach. We have cells there  typically from the patient. We can put those onto a material  and we can make that material  very complex if we want to  and we can then grow that up in the lab or we can put it straight back into the patient. And this is an approach that's  used all over the world  including in our lab. But one of the things that's really important when we're thinking about stem cells is that obviously stem cells  can be many different things  and they want to be many different things  and so we want to make sure that the environment we put them into has enough information so that they can become the right sort of specialist tissue. And if we think about the different types of tissues that people are looking at regenerating all over the world  in all the  different labs in the world  there's pretty much every tissue you can think of. And actually  the structure of those tissues is quite different  and it's going to really depend on whether your patient has any underlying disease  other conditions  in terms of how you're going to regenerate your tissue  and you're going to need to think about the materials you're going to use really carefully  their biochemistry  their mechanics  and many other properties as well. Our tissues all have very  different abilities to regenerate  and here we see poor Prometheus  who made a rather tricky career choice and was punished by the Greek gods. He was tied to a rock  and an eagle would come every day to eat his liver. But of course his liver would regenerate every day  and so day after day he was punished for eternity by the gods. And liver will regenerate in this very nice way  but actually if we think of other tissues  like cartilage  for example  even the simplest nick and you're going to find it really difficult to regenerate your cartilage. So it's going to be very different from tissue to tissue. Now  bone is somewhere in between  and this is one of the tissues  that we work on a lot in our lab. And bone is actually quite good at repairing. It has to be. We've probably all had fractures at some point or other. And one of the ways that you can think about repairing your fracture is this procedure here  called  an iliac crest harvest. And what the surgeon might do is take some bone from your iliac crest  which is just here  and then transplant that  somewhere else in the body. And it actually works really well  because it's your own bone  and it's well vascularized  which means it's got a really good blood supply. But the problem is  there's only so much you can take  and also when you do that operation  your patients might actually have significant pain in that defect site even two  years after the operation. So what we were thinking is  there's a tremendous need  for bone repair  of course  but this iliac crest type approach really has a lot of limitations to it  and could we perhaps recreate the generation of bone within the body on demand and then be able to transplant it without these very  very painful aftereffects that you would have with the iliac crest harvest  And so this is what we did  and the way we did it was by coming back to this typical tissue engineering approach but actually thinking about it rather differently. And we simplified it a lot  so we got rid of a lot of these steps. We got rid of the need to  harvest cells from the patient  we got rid of the need to put  in really fancy chemistries  and we got rid of the need to culture these scaffolds in the lab. And what we really focused on was our material system and making it quite simple  but because we used it in a really clever way  we were able to generate enormous amounts of bone using this approach. So we were using the body as really the catalyst to help us to make lots of new bone. And it's an approach that we call the in vivo bioreactor  and we were able to make enormous amounts of bone using this approach. And I'll talk you through this. So what we do is  in humans  we all have a layer of stem cells on the outside of our long bones. That layer is called the periosteum. And that layer is actually normally very  very tightly bound to the underlying bone  and it's got stem cells in it. Those stem cells are really important in the embryo when it develops  and they also sort of wake up if you have a fracture to help you with repairing the bone. So we take that periosteum layer and we developed a way to inject underneath it a liquid that then  within    seconds  would turn into quite a rigid gel and can actually lift the periosteum away from the bone. So it creates  in essence  an artificial cavity that is right next to both the bone but also this really rich layer of stem cells. And we go in through a pinhole incision so that no other cells from the body can get in  and what happens is that that artificial in vivo bioreactor cavity can then lead to the proliferation of these stem cells  and they can form lots of new tissue  and then over time  you can harvest that tissue and use it elsewhere in the body. This is a histology slide of what we see when we do that  and essentially what we see is very large amounts of bone. So in this picture  you can see the middle of the leg  so the bone marrow  then you can see the original bone  and you can see where that original bone finishes  and just to the left of that is the new bone that's grown within that bioreactor cavity  and you can actually make it even larger. And that demarcation that you can see between the original bone and the new bone acts as a very slight point of weakness  so actually now the surgeon can come along  can harvest away that new bone  and the periosteum can grow back  so you're left with the leg in the same sort of state as if you hadn't operated on it in the first place. So it's very  very low in terms of after pain compared to an iliac crest harvest. And you can grow different amounts of bone depending on how much gel you put in there  so it really is an on demand sort of procedure. Now  at the time that we did this  this received a lot of attention in the press  because it was a really nice way of generating new bone  and we got many  many contacts from different people that  were interested in using this. And I'm just going to tell you  sometimes those contacts are very strange  slightly unexpected  and the very most interesting  let me put it that way  contact that I had  was actually from a team of American footballers that all wanted to have double thickness skulls made on their head. And so you do get these kinds of contacts  and of course  being British and also growing up in France  I tend to be very blunt  and so I had to explain to them very nicely that in their particular case  there probably wasn't that much in there to protect in the first place. So this was our approach  and it was simple materials  but we thought about it carefully. And actually we know that those cells in the body  in the embryo  as they develop can form a different kind of tissue  cartilage  and so we developed a gel that was slightly different in nature and slightly different chemistry  put it in there  and we were able to get     percent cartilage instead. And this approach works really well  I think  for pre planned procedures  but it's something you do have to pre plan. So for other kinds of operations  there's definitely a need for other scaffold based approaches. And when you think about designing those other scaffolds  actually  you need a really multi disciplinary team. And so our team has chemists  it has cell biologists  surgeons  physicists even  and those people all come together and we think really hard about  designing the materials. But we want to make them have enough information that we can get the cells to do what we want  but not be so complex as to make it difficult to get to clinic. And so one of the things we think about a lot is really trying to understand the structure of the tissues in the body. And so if we think of bone  obviously my own favorite tissue  we zoom in  we can see  even if you don't know anything  about bone structure  it's beautifully organized   really beautifully organized. We've lots of blood vessels in there. And if we zoom in again  we see that the cells are actually surrounded by a  D matrix of nano scale fibers  and they give a lot of information to the cells. And if we zoom in again  actually in the case of bone  the matrix around the cells is beautifully organized at the nano scale  and it's a hybrid material that's part organic  part inorganic. And that's led to a whole field  really  that has looked at developing materials that have this hybrid kind of structure. And so I'm showing here just two examples where we've made some materials that have that sort of structure  and you can really tailor it. You can see here a very squishy one and now a material that's also  this hybrid sort of material but actually has remarkable toughness  and it's no longer brittle. And an inorganic material  would normally be really brittle  and you wouldn't be able to have that sort of strength and toughness in it. One other thing I want to quickly mention is that many of the scaffolds we make  are porous  and they have to be  because you want blood vessels to grow in there. But the pores are actually oftentimes much bigger than the cells  and so even though it's  D  the cell might see it more  as a slightly curved surface  and that's a little bit unnatural. And so one of the things you can think about doing is actually making scaffolds  with slightly different dimensions that might be able to surround your cells in  D and give them a little bit more information. And there's a lot of work going  on in both of these areas. Now finally  I just want to talk a little bit about applying this sort of thing to cardiovascular disease  because this is a really big clinical problem. And one of the things that we know is that  unfortunately  if you have a heart attack  then that tissue can start to die  and your outcome may not be very good over time. And it would be really great  actually  if we could stop that dead tissue either from dying or help it to regenerate. And there's lots and lots of stem  cell trials going on worldwide  and they use many different types of cells  but one common theme that seems to be coming out is that actually  very often  those cells will die once you've implanted them. And you can either put them into the heart or into the blood system  but either way  we don't seem to be able to get quite the right number of cells getting to the location we want them to and being able to deliver the sort of beautiful cell regeneration that we would like to have to get good clinical outcomes. And so some of the things that we're thinking of  and many other people in the field are thinking of  are actually developing materials for that. But there's a difference here. We still need chemistry  we still need mechanics  we still need really interesting topography  and we still need really interesting  ways to surround the cells. But now  the cells also would probably quite like a material that's going to be able to be conductive  because the cells themselves will respond very well and will actually conduct signals  between themselves. You can see them now beating synchronously on these materials  and that's a very  very exciting development that's going on. So just to wrap up  I'd like to actually say that being able to work in this sort of field  all of us that work in this field that's not only super exciting science  but also has the potential to impact on patients  however big or small they are  is really a great privilege. And so for that  I'd like to thank all of you as well. Thank you. What makes a great leader today  Many of us carry this image of this all knowing superhero who stands and commands and protects his followers. But that's kind of an image from another time  and what's also outdated are the leadership development programs that are based on success models for a world that was  not a world that is or that is coming. We conducted a study of       companies  and we asked them  let's see the effectiveness of your leadership development programs. Fifty eight percent of the companies cited significant talent gaps for critical leadership roles. That means that despite corporate training programs  off sites  assessments  coaching  all of these things  more than half the companies had failed to grow enough great leaders. You may be asking yourself  is my company helping me to prepare to be a great   st century leader  The odds are  probably not. Now  I've spent    years of my professional life observing what makes great leaders. I've worked inside Fortune     companies  I've advised over     CEOs  and I've cultivated more leadership pipelines than you can imagine. But a few years ago  I noticed a disturbing trend in leadership preparation. I noticed that  despite all the efforts  there were familiar stories that kept resurfacing about individuals. One story was about Chris  a high potential  superstar leader who moves to a new unit and fails  destroying unrecoverable value. And then there were stories like Sidney  the CEO  who was so frustrated because her company is cited as a best company for leaders  but only one of the top    leaders is equipped to lead their crucial initiatives. And then there were stories like the senior leadership team of a once thriving business that's surprised by a market shift  finds itself having to force the company to reduce its size in half or go out of business. Now  these recurring stories cause me to ask two questions. Why are the leadership gaps widening when there's so much more investment in leadership development  And what are the great leaders doing distinctly different to thrive and grow  One of the things that I did  I was so consumed by these questions and also frustrated by those stories  that I left my job so that I could study this full time  and I took a year to travel to different parts of the world to learn about effective and ineffective leadership practices in companies  countries and nonprofit organizations. And so I did things like travel to South Africa  where I had an opportunity to understand how Nelson Mandela was ahead of his time in anticipating and navigating his political  social and economic context. I also met a number of nonprofit leaders who  despite very limited financial resources  were making a huge impact in the world  often bringing together seeming adversaries. And I spent countless hours in presidential libraries trying to understand how the environment had shaped the leaders  the moves that they made  and then the impact of those moves beyond their tenure. And then  when I returned to work full time  in this role  I joined with wonderful colleagues who were also interested in these questions. Now  from all this  I distilled the characteristics of leaders who are thriving and what they do differently  and then I also distilled the preparation practices that enable people to grow to their potential. I want to share some of those with you now. In a   st century world  which is more global  digitally enabled and transparent  with faster speeds of information  flow and innovation  and where nothing big gets done without some kind of a complex matrix  relying on traditional development practices will stunt your growth as a leader. In fact  traditional assessments like narrow     surveys or outdated performance criteria will give you false positives  lulling you into thinking that you are more prepared than you really are. Leadership in the   st century is defined and evidenced by three questions. Where are you looking to anticipate the next change to your business model or your life  The answer to this question is on your calendar. Who are you spending time with  On what topics  Where are you traveling  What are you reading  And then how are you distilling this into understanding potential discontinuities  and then making a decision to do something right now so that you're prepared and ready  There's a leadership team that does a practice where they bring together each member collecting  here are trends that impact me  here are trends that impact another team member  and they share these  and then make decisions  to course correct a strategy or to anticipate a new move. Great leaders are not head down. They see around corners  shaping their future  not just reacting to it. The second question is  what is the diversity measure of your personal and professional stakeholder network  You know  we hear often about  good ol' boy networks and they're certainly alive and  well in many institutions. But to some extent  we all have a network of people that we're comfortable with. So this question is about your capacity to develop relationships with people that are very different than you. And those differences can be biological  physical  functional  political   cultural  socioeconomic. And yet  despite all these differences  they connect with you and they trust you enough to cooperate with you in achieving a shared goal. Great leaders understand that having a more diverse network is a source of pattern identification at greater levels and also of solutions  because you have people that are thinking differently than you are. Third question  are you courageous enough to abandon a practice that has  made you successful in the past  There's an expression  Go along to get along. But if you follow this advice  chances are as a leader  you're going to keep doing what's familiar and comfortable. Great leaders dare to be different. They don't just talk about risk taking  they actually do it. And one of the leaders shared with me the fact that the most impactful development comes when you are able to build the emotional stamina to withstand people telling you that your new idea is na ve or reckless or just plain stupid. Now interestingly  the people who will join you are not your usual suspects in your network. They're often people that think differently and therefore are willing to join you in taking a courageous leap. And it's a leap  not a step. More than traditional leadership programs  answering these three questions will determine your effectiveness as a   st century leader. So what makes a great leader in the   st century  I've met many  and they stand out. They are women and men who are preparing themselves not for the comfortable predictability of yesterday but also for the realities of today and all of those unknown possibilities of tomorrow. Thank you. I'm going to go off script and make Chris quite nervous here by making this audience participation. All right. Are you with me  Yeah. Yeah. All right. So what I'd like to do is have you raise your hand if you've ever heard a heterosexual couple having sex. Could be the neighbors  hotel room  your parents. Sorry. Okay. Pretty much everybody. Now raise your hand if the man was making more noise than the woman. I see one guy there. It doesn't count if it was you  sir. So his hand's down. And one woman. Okay. Sitting next to a loud guy. Now what does this tell us  It tells us that human beings make noise when they have sex  and it's generally the woman who makes more noise. This is known as female copulatory vocalization to the clipboard crowd. I wasn't even going to mention this  but somebody told me that Meg Ryan might be here  and she is the world's most famous female copulatory vocalizer. So I thought  got to talk about that. We'll get back to that a little bit later. Let me start by saying human beings are not descended from apes  despite what you may have heard. We are apes. We are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo than the African elephant is to the Indian elephant  as Jared Diamond pointed out in one of his early books. We're more closely related to chimps and bonobos than chimps and bonobos are related to any other primate    gorillas  orangutans  what have you. So we're extremely closely related to them  and as you'll see in terms of our behavior  we've got some relationship as well. So what I'm asking today  the question I want to explore with you today is  what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality  Now  since Darwin's day there's been what Cacilda and I have called the standard narrative of human sexual evolution  and you're all familiar with it  even if you haven't read this stuff. The idea is that  as part of human nature  from the beginning of our species' time  men have sort of leased women's reproductive potential by providing them with certain goods and services. Generally we're talking about meat  shelter  status  protection  things like that. And in exchange  women have offered fidelity  or at least a promise of fidelity. Now this sets men and women up in an oppositional relationship. The war between the sexes is built right into our DNA  according to this vision. Right  What Cacilda and I have argued is that no  this economic relationship  this oppositional relationship  is actually an artifact of agriculture  which only arose about        years ago at the earliest. Anatomically modern human beings have been around for about         years  so we're talking about five percent  at most  of our time as a modern  distinct species. So before agriculture  before the agricultural revolution  it's important to understand that human beings lived in hunter gatherer groups that are characterized wherever they're found in the world by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism. They not only share things  they demand that things be shared  meat  shelter  protection  all these things that were supposedly being traded to women for their sexual fidelity  it turns out  are shared widely among these societies. Now I'm not saying that our ancestors were noble savages  and I'm not saying modern day hunter gatherers are noble savages either. What I'm saying is that this is simply the best way to mitigate risk in a foraging context. And there's really no argument about this among anthropologists. All Cacilda and I have done is extend this sharing behavior to sexuality. So we've argued that human sexuality has essentially evolved  until agriculture  as a way of establishing and maintaining the complex  flexible social systems  networks  that our ancestors were very good at  and that's why our species has survived so well. Now  this makes some people uncomfortable  and so I always need to take  a moment in these talks to say  listen  I'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous  but I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers. There were no strangers. Right  In a hunter gatherer band  there are no strangers. You've known these people your entire life. So I'm saying  yes  there were overlapping sexual relationships  that our ancestors probably had several different sexual relationships going on at any given moment in their adult lives. But I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers. I'm not saying that they didn't love the people they were having sex with. And I'm not saying there was no pair bonding going on. I'm just saying it wasn't sexually exclusive. And those of us who have chosen to be monogamous    my parents  for example  have been married for    years monogamously  and if it wasn't monogamously  Mom and Dad  I don't want to hear about it  I'm not criticizing this and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this. What I'm saying is that to argue that our ancestors were sexual omnivores is no more a criticism of monogamy than to argue that our ancestors were dietary omnivores is a criticism of vegetarianism. You can choose to be a vegetarian  but don't think that just because you've made that decision  bacon suddenly stops smelling good. Okay  So this is my point. That one took a minute to sink in  huh  Now  in addition to being a great genius  a wonderful man  a wonderful husband  a wonderful father  Charles Darwin was also a world class Victorian prude. All right  He was perplexed by the sexual swellings of certain primates  including chimps and bonobos  because these sexual swellings tend to provoke many males to mate with the females. So he couldn't understand why on Earth would the female have developed this thing if all they were supposed to be doing is forming their pair bond  right  Chimps and bonobos  Darwin didn't really know this  but chimps and bonobos mate one to four times per hour with up to a dozen males per day when they have their sexual swellings. Interestingly  chimps have sexual swellings through    percent  roughly  of their menstrual cycle  bonobos    percent  and humans are among the only species on the planet where the female is available for sex throughout the menstrual cycle  whether she's menstruating  whether she's post menopausal  whether she's already pregnant. This is vanishingly rare among mammals. So it's a very interesting aspect of human sexuality. Now  Darwin ignored the reflections of the sexual swelling in his own day  as scientists tend to do sometimes. So what we're talking about is sperm competition. Now the average human ejaculate has about     million sperm cells  so it's already a competitive environment. The question is whether these sperm are  competing against other men's sperm or just their own. There's a lot to talk about in this chart. The one thing I'll call your attention to right away is the little musical note above the female chimp and bonobo and human. That indicates female copulatory vocalization. Just look at the numbers. The average human has sex about       times per birth. If that number seems high for some of you  I assure you it seems low for others in the room. We share that ratio with chimps and bonobos. We don't share it with the other three apes  the gorilla  the orangutan and the gibbon  who are more typical of mammals  having sex only about a dozen times per birth. Humans and bonobos are the only  animals that have sex face to face when both of them are alive. And you'll see that the human  chimp and bonobo all have external testicles  which in our book we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage just for beer. If you're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge in the garage  you expect a party to happen at any moment  and you need to be ready. That's what the external testicles are. They keep the sperm cells cool so you can have frequent ejaculations. I'm sorry. It's true. The human  some of you will be happy to hear  has the largest  thickest penis of any primate. Now  this evidence goes way beyond anatomy. It goes into anthropology as well. Historical records are full of accounts of people around the world who have sexual practices that should be impossible given what we have assumed about human sexual evolution. These women are the Mosuo from southwestern China. In their society  everyone  men and women  are completely sexually autonomous. There's no shame associated with sexual behavior. Women have hundreds of partners. It doesn't matter. Nobody cares. Nobody gossips. It's not an issue. When the woman becomes pregnant  the child is cared for by her   her sisters  and her brothers. The biological father is a nonissue. On the other side of the planet  in the Amazon  we've got many tribes which practice what anthropologists call partible paternity. These people actually believe    and they have no contact among them  no common language or anything  so it's not an idea that spread  it's an idea that's arisen around the world    they believe that a fetus is literally made of accumulated semen. So a woman who wants to have a child who's smart and funny and strong makes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy  the funny guy and the strong guy  to get the essence of each of these men into the baby  and then when the child is born  these different men will come forward and acknowledge their paternity of the child. So paternity is actually sort of a team endeavor in this society. So there are all sorts of examples like this that we go through in the book. Now  why does this matter  Edward Wilson says we need to understand that human sexuality is first a bonding device and only secondarily procreation. I think that's true. This matters because our evolved sexuality is in direct conflict with many aspects of the modern world. The contradictions between what we're told we should feel and what we actually do feel generates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering. My hope is that a more accurate  updated understanding of human sexuality will lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves  for each other  greater respect for unconventional relationship configurations like same sex marriage or polyamorous unions  and that we'll finally put to rest the idea that men have some innate  instinctive right to monitor and control women's sexual behavior. Thank you. And we'll see that it's not only gay people that have to come out of the closet. We all have closets we have to come out of. Right  And when we do come out of those closets  we'll recognize that our fight is not with each other  our fight is with an outdated   Victorian sense of human sexuality that conflates desire with property rights  generates shame and confusion in place of understanding and empathy. It's time we moved beyond Mars and Venus  because the truth is that men are from Africa and women are from Africa. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Christopher Ryan  Thank you. CA  So a question. It's so perplexing  trying to use arguments about evolutionary history to turn that into what we ought to do today. Someone could give a talk and say  look at us  we've got these really sharp teeth and muscles and a brain that's really good at throwing weapons  and if you look at lots of societies around the world  you'll see very high rates of violence. Nonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism  but it's not who you are. How is that different from the talk you gave  CR  Well first of all  the evidence for high levels of violence in prehistory is very debatable. But that's just an example. Certainly  you know  lots of people say to me  just because we lived a certain way in the past doesn't mean we should live that  way now  and I agree with that. Everyone has to respond to the modern world. But the body does have its inherent evolved trajectories. And so you could live on McDonald's and milkshakes  but your body will rebel against  that. We have appetites. I think it was Schopenhauer who said  a person can do what they want but not want what they want. And so what I'm arguing against is the shame that's associated with desires. It's the idea that if you love your husband or wife but you still are attracted to other people  there's something wrong with you  there's something wrong with your marriage  something wrong with your partner. I think a lot of families are fractured by unrealistic expectations that are based upon this false vision of human sexuality. That's what I'm trying to get at. CA  Thank you. Communicated powerfully. Thanks a lot. CR  Thank you  Chris.  Applause  I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet  and not in the traditional sense  not just the gay closet. I think we all have closets. Your closet may be telling someone you love her for the first time  or telling someone that you're pregnant  or telling someone you have cancer  or any of the other hard conversations we have throughout our lives. All a closet is is a hard conversation  and although our topics may vary tremendously  the experience of being in and coming out of the closet is universal. It is scary  and we hate it  and it needs to be done. Several years ago  I was working at the South Side Walnut Cafe  a local diner in town  and during my time there I would go through phases of militant lesbian intensity  not shaving my armpits  quoting Ani DiFranco lyrics as gospel. And depending on the bagginess of my cargo shorts and how recently I had shaved my head  the question would often be sprung on me  usually by a little kid   Um  are you a boy or are you a girl   And there would be an awkward silence at the table. I'd clench my jaw a little tighter  hold my coffee pot with a little more vengeance. The dad would awkwardly shuffle his newspaper and the mom would shoot a chilling stare at her kid. But I would say nothing  and I would seethe inside. And it got to the point where every time I walked up to a table that had a kid anywhere between three and    years old  I was ready to fight. And that is a terrible feeling. So I promised myself  the next time  I would say something. I would have that hard conversation. So within a matter of weeks  it happens again.  Are you a boy or are you a girl   Familiar silence  but this time I'm ready  and I am about to go all Women's Studies     on this table.  Laughter  I've got my Betty Friedan quotes. I've got my Gloria Steinem quotes. I've even got this little bit from  Vagina Monologues  I'm going to do. So I take a deep breath and I look down and staring back at me is a four year old girl in a pink dress  not a challenge to a feminist duel  just a kid with a question   Are you a boy or are you a girl   So I take another deep breath  squat down to next to her  and say   Hey  I know it's kind of confusing. My hair is short like a boy's  and I wear boy's clothes  but I'm a girl  and you know how sometimes you like to wear a pink dress  and sometimes you like to wear your comfy jammies  Well  I'm more of a comfy jammies kind of girl.  And this kid looks me dead in the eye  without missing a beat  and says   My favorite pajamas are purple with fish. Can I get a pancake  please   And that was it. Just   Oh  okay. You're a girl. How about that pancake   It was the easiest hard conversation I have ever had. And why  Because Pancake Girl and I  we were both real with each other. So like many of us  I've lived in a few closets in my life  and yeah  most often  my walls happened to be rainbow. But inside  in the dark  you can't tell what color the walls are. You just know what it feels like to live in a closet. So really  my closet is no different than yours or yours or yours. Sure  I'll give you     reasons why coming out of my closet was harder than coming out of yours  but here's the thing  Hard is not relative. Hard is hard. Who can tell me that explaining to someone you've just declared bankruptcy is harder than telling someone you just cheated on them  Who can tell me that his coming out story is harder than telling your five year old  you're getting a divorce  There is no harder  there is just hard. We need to stop ranking our hard against everyone else's hard to make us feel better or worse about our closets and just commiserate on the  fact that we all have hard. At some point in our lives  we all live in closets  and they may feel safe  or at least safer than what lies on the other side of that door. But I am here to tell you  no matter what your walls are made of  a closet is no place for a person to live. Thanks.  Applause  So imagine yourself    years ago. Me  I had a ponytail  a strapless dress  and high heeled shoes. I was not the militant lesbian ready to fight any four year old that walked into the cafe. I was frozen by fear  curled up in the corner of my pitch black closet clutching my gay grenade  and moving one muscle is the scariest thing I have ever done. My family  my friends  complete strangers    I had spent my entire life trying to not disappoint these people  and now I was turning the world upside down on purpose. I was burning the pages of the script we had all followed for so long  but if you do not throw that grenade  it will kill you. One of my most memorable grenade tosses was at my sister's wedding. It was the first time that many in attendance knew I was gay  so in doing  my maid of honor duties  in my black dress and heels  I walked around to tables and finally landed on a table of my parents' friends  folks that had known me for years. And after a little small talk  one of the women shouted out   I love Nathan Lane   And the battle of gay relatability had begun.  Ash  have you ever been to the Castro    Well  yeah  actually  we have friends in San Francisco.   Well  we've never been there but we've heard it's fabulous.   Ash  do you know my hairdresser Antonio  He's really good and he has never talked about a girlfriend.   Ash  what's your favorite TV show  Our favorite TV show  Favorite  Will   Grace. And you know who we love  Jack. Jack is our favorite.  And then one woman  stumped but wanting so desperately to show her support  to let me know she was on my side  she finally blurted out   Well  sometimes my husband wears pink shirts.  And I had a choice in that moment  as all grenade throwers do. I could go back to my girlfriend and my gay loving table and mock their responses  chastise their unworldliness and their inability to jump through the politically correct  gay hoops I had brought with me  or I could empathize with them and realize that that was maybe one of the hardest things they had ever done  that starting and having that conversation was them coming out of their closets. Sure  it would have been easy to point out where they felt short. It's a lot harder to meet them where they are and acknowledge the fact that they were trying. And what else can you ask someone to do but try  If you're going to be real with someone  you gotta be ready for real in return. So hard conversations are still not my strong suit. Ask anybody I have ever dated. But I'm getting better  and I follow what I like to call the three Pancake Girl principles. Now  please view this through gay colored lenses  but know what it takes to come out of any closet is essentially the same. Number one  Be authentic. Take the armor off. Be yourself. That kid in the cafe had no armor  but I was ready for battle. If you want someone to be real with you  they need to know that you bleed too. Number two  Be direct. Just say it. Rip the Band Aid off. If you know you are gay  just say it. If you tell your parents you might be gay  they will hold out hope that this will change. Do not give them that sense of false hope. And number three  and most important    Be unapologetic. You are speaking your truth. Never apologize for that. And some folks may have gotten hurt along the way  so sure  apologize for what you've done  but never apologize for who you are. And yeah  some folks may be disappointed  but that is on them  not on you. Those are their expectations of who you are  not yours. That is their story  not yours. The only story that matters is the one that you want to write. So the next time you find yourself in a pitch black closet clutching your grenade  know we have all been there before. And you may feel so very alone  but you are not. And we know it's hard but we need you out here  no matter what your walls are made of  because I guarantee you there are others peering through the keyholes of their closets looking for the next brave soul to bust a door open  so be that person and show the world that we are bigger than our closets and that a closet is no place for a person to truly live. Thank you  Boulder. Enjoy your night.  Applause  I'm very pleased to be here today to talk to you all about how we might repair the damaged brain  and I'm particularly excited by this field  because as a neurologist myself  I believe that this offers one of the great ways that we might be able to offer hope for patients who today live with devastating and yet untreatable diseases of the brain. So here's the problem. You can see here the picture of somebody's brain with Alzheimer's disease next to a healthy brain  and what's obvious is  in the Alzheimer's brain  ringed red  there's obvious damage    atrophy  scarring. And I could show you equivalent pictures from other disease  multiple sclerosis  motor neuron disease  Parkinson's disease  even Huntington's disease  and they would all tell a similar story. And collectively these brain disorders represent one of the major public health threats of our time. And the numbers here are really rather staggering. At any one time  there are    million people today living with one of these brain diseases  and the annual cost globally is     billion dollars. I mean  just think about that. That's greater than one percent of the global GDP. And it gets worse  because all these numbers are rising because these are by and large age related diseases  and we're living longer. So the question we really need to ask ourselves is  why  given the devastating impact of these diseases to the individual  never mind the scale of the societal problem  why are there no effective treatments  Now in order to consider this  I first need to give you a crash course in how the brain works. So in other words  I need to tell you everything I learned at medical school. But believe me  this isn't going to take very long. Okay   Laughter  So the brain is terribly simple  it's made up of four cells  and two of them are shown here. There's the nerve cell  and then there's the myelinating cell  or the insulating cell. It's called oligodendrocyte. And when these four cells work together in health and harmony  they create an extraordinary symphony of electrical activity  and it is this electrical activity that underpins our ability to think  to emote  to remember  to learn  move  feel and so on. But equally  each of these individual four cells alone or together  can go rogue or die  and when that happens  you get damage. You get damaged wiring. You get disrupted connections. And that's evident here with the slower conduction. But ultimately  this damage will manifest as disease  clearly. And if the starting dying nerve cell is a motor nerve  for example  you'll get motor neuron disease. So I'd like to give you a real life illustration of what happens with motor neuron disease. So this is a patient of mine called John. John I saw just last week in the clinic. And I've asked John to tell us something  about what were his problems that led to the initial diagnosis of motor neuron disease. John  I was diagnosed in October in       and the main problem was a breathing problem  difficulty breathing. Siddharthan Chandran  I don't know if you caught all of that  but what John was telling us was that difficulty with breathing led eventually to the diagnosis of motor neuron disease. So John's now    months further down in that journey  and I've now asked him to tell us something about his current predicament. John  What I've got now is  the breathing's gotten worse. I've got weakness in my hands   my arms and my legs. So basically I'm in a wheelchair most of the time. SC  John's just told us he's in a wheelchair most of the time. So what these two clips show is not just the devastating consequence of the disease  but they also tell us something about the shocking pace of the disease  because in just    months  a fit adult man has been rendered wheelchair  and respirator dependent. And let's face it  John could be anybody's father  brother or friend. So that's what happens when the motor nerve dies. But what happens when that myelin cell dies  You get multiple sclerosis. So the scan on your left is an illustration of the brain  and it's a map of the connections of the brain  and superimposed upon which are areas of damage. We call them lesions of demyelination. But they're damage  and they're white. So I know what you're thinking here. You're thinking   My God  this bloke came up and said he's going to talk about hope  and all he's done is give a really rather bleak and depressing tale.  I've told you these diseases are terrible. They're devastating  numbers are rising  the costs are ridiculous  and worst of all  we have no treatment. Where's the hope  Well  you know what  I think there is hope. And there's hope in this next section  of this brain section of somebody else with M.S.  because what it illustrates is  amazingly  the brain can repair itself. It just doesn't do it well enough. And so again  there are two things I want to show you. First of all is the damage of this patient with M.S. And again  it's another one of these white masses. But crucially  the area that's ringed red highlights an area that is pale blue. But that area that is pale blue was once white. So it was damaged. It's now repaired. Just to be clear  It's not because of doctors. It's in spite of doctors  not because of doctors. This is spontaneous repair. It's amazing and it's occurred because there are stem cells in the brain  even  which can enable new myelin  new insulation  to be laid down over the damaged nerves. And this observation is important for two reasons. The first is it challenges one of the orthodoxies that we learnt at medical school  or at least I did  admittedly last century  which is that the brain doesn't repair itself  unlike  say  the bone or the liver. But actually it does  but it just doesn't do it well enough. And the second thing it does  and it gives us a very clear direction  of travel for new therapies    I mean  you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know what to do here. You simply need to find ways of promoting the endogenous  spontaneous repair that occurs anyway. So the question is  why  if we've known that for some time  as we have  why do we not have those treatments  And that in part reflects the complexity of drug development. Now  drug development you might think of as a rather expensive but risky bet  and the odds of this bet are roughly this  they're        to one against  because you need to screen about        compounds to find that one potential winner. And then you need to spend    years and spend over a billion dollars  and even then  you may not have a winner. So the question for us is  can you change the rules of the game and can you shorten the odds  And in order to do that  you have to think  where is the bottleneck in this drug discovery  And one of the bottlenecks is  early in drug discovery. All that screening occurs in animal models. But we know that the proper  study of mankind is man  to borrow from Alexander Pope. So the question is  can we study these diseases using human material  And of course  absolutely we can. We can use stem cells  and specifically we can use human stem cells. And human stem cells are these extraordinary but simple cells that can do two things  they can self renew or make more of themselves  but they can also become specialized to make bone  liver or  crucially  nerve cells  maybe even the motor nerve cell or the myelin cell. And the challenge has long been  can we harness the power  the undoubted power of these stem cells in order to realize their promise for regenerative neurology  And I think we can now  and the reason we can is because there have been several major discoveries in the last        years. One of them was here in Edinburgh  and it must be the only celebrity sheep  Dolly. So Dolly was made in Edinburgh  and Dolly was an example of the first cloning of a mammal from an adult cell. But I think the even more significant breakthrough for the purposes of our discussion today was made in      by a Japanese scientist called Yamanaka. And what Yamaka did  in a fantastic form of scientific cookery  was he showed that four ingredients  just four ingredients  could effectively convert any cell  adult cell  into a master stem cell. And the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate  because what it means that from anybody in this room  but particularly patients  you could now generate a bespoke  personalized tissue repair kit. Take a skin cell  make it a master pluripotent cell  so you could then make those cells that are relevant to their disease  both to study but potentially to treat. Now  the idea of that at medical school    this is a recurring theme  isn't  it  me and medical school    would have been ridiculous  but it's an absolute reality today. And I see this as the cornerstone of regeneration  repair and hope. And whilst we're on the theme of hope  for those of you who might have failed at school  there's hope for you as well  because this is the school report of John Gerdon.   I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist  on his present showing this is quite ridiculous.   So they didn't think much of him then. But what you may not know is that he  got the Nobel Prize for medicine just three months ago. So to return to the original problem  what is the opportunity of these stem cells  or this disruptive technology  for repairing the damaged brain  which we call regenerative neurology  I think there are two ways you can think about this  as a fantastic   st century drug discovery tool  and or as a form of therapy. So I want to tell you a little bit about both of those in the next few moments. Drug discovery in a dish is how people often talk about this. It's very simple  You take a patient with a disease  let's say motor neuron disease  you take a skin sample  you do the pluripotent reprogramming  as I've already told you  and you generate live motor nerve cells. That's straightforward  because that's what pluripotent cells can do. But crucially  you can then compare their behavior to their equivalent but healthy counterparts  ideally from an unaffected relative. That way  you're matching for genetic variation. And that's exactly what we did here. This was a collaboration with colleagues  in London  Chris Shaw  in the U.S.   Steve Finkbeiner and Tom Maniatis. And what you're looking at  and this is amazing  these are living  growing  motor nerve cells from a patient with motor neuron disease. It happens to be an inherited form. I mean  just imagine that. This would have been unimaginable    years ago. So apart from seeing them grow and put out processes  we can also engineer them so that they fluoresce  but crucially  we can then track their individual health and compare the diseased motor nerve cells to the healthy ones. And when you do all that and put it together  you realize that the diseased ones  which is represented in the red line  are two and a half times more likely to die than the healthy counterpart. And the crucial point about this is that you then have a fantastic assay to discover drugs  because what would you ask of the drugs  and you could do this through a high throughput automated screening system  you'd ask the drugs  give me one thing  find me a drug that will bring the red line closer to the blue line  because that drug will be a high value candidate that you could probably take direct to human trial and almost bypass that bottleneck that I've told you about in drug discovery with the animal models  if that makes sense. It's fantastic. But I want to come back to how you might use stem cells directly to repair damage. And again there are two ways to think about this  and they're not mutually exclusive. The first  and I think in the long run the one that will give us the biggest dividend  but it's not thought of that way just yet  is to think about those stem cells that are already in your brain  and I've told you that. All of us have stem cells in the brain  even the diseased brain  and surely the smart way forward is to find ways that you can promote and activate those stem cells in your brain already to react and respond appropriately to damage to repair it. That will be the future. There will be drugs that will do that. But the other way is to effectively parachute in cells  transplant them in  to replace dying or lost cells  even in the brain. And I want to tell you now an experiment  it's a clinical trial that we did  which recently completed  which is with colleagues in UCL  David Miller in particular. So this study was very simple. We took patients with multiple sclerosis and asked a simple question  Would stem cells from the bone marrow be protective of their nerves  So what we did was we took this bone marrow  grew up the stem cells in the lab  and then injected them back into the vein. I'm making this sound really simple. It took five years off a lot of people  okay  And it put gray hair on me and caused all kinds of issues. But conceptually  it's essentially simple. So we've given them into the vein  right  So in order to measure whether this was successful or not  we measured the optic nerve as our outcome measure. And that's a good thing to measure in M.S.  because patients with M.S. sadly suffer with problems with vision    loss of vision  unclear vision. And so we measured the size of the optic nerve using the scans with David Miller three times       months  six months  and before the infusion    and you can see the gently declining red line. And that's telling you that the optic nerve is shrinking  which makes sense  because their nerves are dying. We then gave the stem cell infusion and repeated the measurement twice    three months and six months    and to our surprise  almost  the line's gone up. That suggests that the intervention has been protective. I don't think myself that what's happened is that those stem cells have made new myelin or new nerves. What I think they've done is they've promoted the endogenous stem cells  or precursor cells  to do their job  wake up  lay down new myelin. So this is a proof of concept. I'm very excited about that. So I just want to end with the theme I began on  which was regeneration and hope. So here I've asked John what his hopes are for the future. John  I would hope that sometime in the future through the research that you people are doing  we can come up with a cure so that people like me can lead a normal life. SC  I mean  that speaks volumes. But I'd like to close by first of all thanking John    thanking John for allowing me to share his insights and these clips with you all. But I'd also like to add to John and to others that my own view is  I'm hopeful for the future. I do believe that the disruptive technologies like stem cells that I've tried to explain to you do offer very real hope. And I do think that the day that we might be able to repair the damaged brain is sooner than we think. Thank you. I'm going to talk about hackers. And the image that comes to your mind when I say that word is probably not of Benjamin Franklin  but I'm going to explain to you why it should be. The image that comes to your mind is probably more likely of a pasty kid sitting in a basement doing something mischievous  or of a shady criminal who is trying to steal your identity  or of an international rogue with a political agenda. And mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea that hackers are people that we should be afraid of. But like most things in technology and the technology world  hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil. For every hacker that's trying to steal your identity there's one that's building a tool that will help you find your loved ones after a disaster or to monitor environmental quality after an oil spill. Hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system  and it is a deeply democratic activity. It's about critical thinking. It's about questioning existing ways of doing things. It's the idea that if you see a  problem  you work to fix it  and not just complain about it. And in many ways  hacking is what built America. Betsy Ross was a hacker. The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack. And from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs  hacking has always been at the foundation of American democracy. So if there's one thing I want to leave you here with today  it's that the next time you think about who a hacker is  you think not of this guy but of this guy  Benjamin Franklin  who was one of the greatest hackers of all time. He was one of America's most prolific inventors  though he famously never filed a patent  because he thought that all human knowledge should be freely available. He brought us bifocals and the lightning rod  and of course there was his collaboration on the invention of American democracy. And in Code For America  we really try to embody the spirit of Ben Franklin. He was a tinkerer and a statesman whose conception of citizenship was always predicated on action. He believed that government could be built by the people  and we call those people civic hackers. So it's no wonder that the values that underly a healthy democracy  like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise  are the same values that underly the Internet. And so it's no surprise that many hackers are turning their attention to the problem of government. But before I give you a few examples of what civic hacking looks like  I want to make clear that you don't have to be a programmer to be a civic hacker. You just have to believe that you can bring a   st century tool set to bear on the problems that government faces. And we hear all the time from our community of civic hackers at Code for America that they didn't understand how much nontechnical work actually went into civic hacking projects. So keep that in mind. All of you are potential civic hackers. So what does civic hacking look like  Our team last year in Honolulu  which in this case was three full time fellows who were doing a year of public service  were asked by the city to rebuild the website. And it's a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages which just wasn't going to be possible in the few months that they had. So instead  they decided to build a parallel site that better conformed to how citizens actually want to interact with information on a city website. They're looking for answers to questions  and they want to take action when they're done  which is really hard to do from a site that looks like this. So our team built Honolulu Answers  which is a super simple search interface where you enter a search term or a question and get back plain language answers that drive a user towards action. Now the site itself was easy enough to build  but the team was faced with the challenge of how they populate all of the content. It would have taken the three of them a very long time  especially given that none of  them are actually from Honolulu. And so they did something that's really radical  when you think about how government is used to working. They asked citizens to write the content. So you've heard of a hack a thon. They held a write a thon  where on one Saturday afternoon    Wild pigs are a huge problem  in Honolulu  apparently. In one Saturday afternoon  they were able to populate most of the content for most of the frequently asked questions  but more importantly than that  they created a new way for citizens  to participate in their government. Now  I think this is a really cool story in and of itself  but it gets more awesome. On the National Day of Civic Hacking this past June in Oakland  where I live  the Code For America team in Oakland took the open source code base of Honolulu Answers and turned it into Oakland Answers  and again we held a write a thon where we took the most frequently asked questions and had citizens write the answers to them  and I got into the act. I authored this answer  and a few others. And I'm trying to this day to articulate the sense of empowerment and responsibility that I feel for the place that I live based simply on this small act of participation. And by stitching together my small act with the thousands of other small acts of participation that we're enabling through civic hacking  we think we can reenergize citizenship and restore trust in government. At this point  you may be wondering what city officials think of all this. They actually love it. As most of you guys know  cities are being asked every day to do more with less  and they're always looking for innovative solutions to entrenched problems. So when you give citizens a way to participate beyond attending a town hall meeting  cities can actually capture the capacity in their communities to do the business of government. Now I don't want to leave the impression that civic hacking is just an American phenomenon. It's happening across the globe  and one of my favorite examples is from Mexico City  where earlier this year  the Mexico House of Representatives entered into a contract with a software development firm to build an app that legislators would use to track bills. So this was just for the handful of legislators in the House. And the contract was a two year contract for  .  million dollars. Now a lot of people were really angry about this  especially geeks who knew that  .  million dollars was an absolutely outrageous amount of money for what was a very simple app. But instead of taking to the streets  they issued a challenge. They asked programmers in Mexico to build something better and cheaper  and they offered a prize of       dollars           times cheaper than the government contract  and they gave the entrants    days. And in those    days  they submitted     apps  five of which were presented to Congress and are still in the app store today. And because of this action  that contract was vacated  and now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City which is home to one of our partners  Code for Mexico City. And so what you see in all three of these places  in Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City  are the elements that are at the core of civic hacking. It's citizens who saw things that could be working better and they decided to fix them  and through that work  they're creating a   st century ecosystem of participation. They're creating a whole new set of ways for citizens to be involved  besides voting or signing a petition or protesting. They can actually build government. So back to our friend Ben Franklin  who  one of his lesser known accomplishments was that in      he founded the first volunteer firefighting company in Philadelphia  called a brigade. And it's because he and his friends noticed that the city was having trouble keeping up with all the fires that were happening in the city  so in true civic hacker fashion  they built a solution. And we have our own brigades at Code for America working on the projects that I've just described  and we want to ask you to follow in Ben Franklin's footsteps and come join us. We have    brigades in the U.S. We are pleased to announce today that we're opening up the  brigade to international cities for the first time  starting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland. You can find out if there's a brigade where you live at brigade.codeforamerica.org  and if there's not a brigade where you live  we will help you. We've created a tool kit which also lives at brigade.codeforamerica.org  and we will support you along the way. Our goal is to create a global network of civic hackers who are innovating on the existing system in order to build tools that will solve entrenched problems  that will support local government  and that will empower citizens. So please come hack with us. Thank you. Thirteen years ago  we set ourselves a goal to end poverty. After some success  we've hit a big hurdle. The aftermath of the financial crisis has begun to hit aid payments  which have fallen for two consecutive years. My question is whether the lessons learned from saving the financial system can be used to help us overcome that hurdle and help millions. Can we simply print money for aid   Surely not.  It's a common reaction. It's a quick talk. Others channel John McEnroe.  You cannot be serious   Now  I can't do the accent  but I am serious  thanks to these two children  who  as you'll learn  are very much at the heart of my talk. On the left  we have Pia. She lives in England. She has two loving parents  one of whom is standing right here. Dorothy  on the right  lives in rural Kenya. She's one of        orphans and vulnerable children who are assisted by a charity that I support. I do that because I believe that Dorothy  like Pia  deserves the best life chances that we can afford to give her. You'll all agree with me  I'm sure. The U.N. agrees too. Their overriding aim for international aid is to strive for a life of dignity for all. But    and here's that hurdle    can we afford our aid aspirations  History suggests not. In       governments set themselves a target to increase overseas aid payments to  .  percent of their national income. As you can see  a big gap opens up between actual aid and that target. But then come the Millennium Development Goals  eight ambitious targets to be met by     . If I tell you that just one of those targets is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty  you get a sense of the ambition. There's also been some success. The number of people living on less than   .   a day has halved. But a lot remains to be done in two years. One in eight remain hungry. In the context of this auditorium  the front two rows aren't going to get any food. We can't settle for that  which is why the concern about the eighth goal  which relates to funding  which I said at the beginning is falling  is so troubling. So what can be done  Well  I work in financial markets  not development. I study the behavior of investors  how they react to policy and the economy. It gives me a different angle on the aid issue. But it took an innocent question from my then four year old daughter to make me appreciate that. Pia and I were on the way to a local cafe and we passed a man collecting for charity. I didn't have any change to give him  and she was disappointed. Once in the cafe  Pia takes out her coloring book and starts scribbling. After a little while  I ask her what she's doing  and she shows me a drawing of a    note to give to the man outside. It's so sweet  and more generous than Dad would have been. But of course I explained to her   You can't do that  it's not allowed.  To which I get the classic four year old response   Why not   Now I'm excited  because I actually think I can answer this time. So I launch into an explanation of how an unlimited supply of money chasing a limited number of goods sends prices to the moon. Something about that exchange stuck with me  not because of the look of relief on Pia's face when I finally finished  but because it related to the sanctity of the money supply  a sanctity that had been challenged and questioned by the reaction of central banks to the financial crisis. To reassure investors  central banks began buying assets to try and encourage investors to do the same. They funded these purchases with money they created themselves. The money wasn't actually physically printed. It's still sort of locked away in the banking system today. But the amount created was unprecedented. Together  the central banks of the U.S.  U.K and Japan increased the stock of money in their economies by  .  trillion dollars. That's three times  in fact that's more than three times  the total physical stock of dollar notes in circulation. Three times  Before the crisis  this would have been utterly unthinkable  yet it was accepted remarkably quickly. The price of gold  an asset thought to protect against inflation  did jump  but investors bought other assets that offered little protection from inflation. They bought fixed income securities  bonds. They bought equities too. For all the scare stories  the actual actions of investors spoke of rapid acceptance and confidence. That confidence was based on two pillars. The first was that  after years of keeping inflation under control  central banks were trusted to take the money printing away if inflation became a threat. Secondly  inflation simply never became a threat. As you can see  in the United States  inflation for most of this period remained below average. It was the same elsewhere. So how does all this relate to aid  Well  this is where Dorothy and the Mango Tree charity that supports her comes in. I was at one of their fundraising events earlier this year  and I was inspired to give a one off donation when I remembered that my firm offers to match the charitable contributions its employees make. So think of this  Instead of just being able to help Dorothy and four of her classmates to go through secondary school for a few years  I was able to double my contribution. Brilliant. So following that conversation with my daughter  and seeing the absence of inflation in the face of money printing  and knowing that international aid payments were falling at just the wrong time  this made me wonder  Could we match but just on a much grander scale  Let's call this scheme  Print Aid.  And here's how it might work. Provided it saw little inflation risk from doing so  the central bank would be mandated to match the government's overseas aid payments up to a certain limit. Governments have been aiming to get aid to  .  percent for years  so let's set the limit at half of that   .   percent of their income. So it would work like this  If in a given year the government gave  .  percent of its income to overseas aid  the central bank would simply top it up with a further  .  percent. So far so good. How risky is this  Well  this involves the creation of money to buy goods  not assets. It sounds more inflationary already  doesn't it. But there are two important mitigating factors here. The first is that by definition  this money printed would be spent overseas. So it's not obvious how it leads to inflation in the country doing the actual printing unless it leads to a currency depreciation of that country. That is unlikely for the second reason  the scale of the money that would be printed under this scheme. So let's think of an example where Print Aid was in place in the U.S.  U.K. and Japan. To match the aid payments made by those governments over the last four years  Print Aid would have generated     billion dollars' worth of extra aid. What would that look like in the context of the increase in the money stock that had already happened in those countries to save the financial system  Are you read for this  You might struggle to see that at the back  because the gap is quite small. So what we're saying here is that we took a   .  trillion gamble to save our financial systems  and you know what  it paid off. There was no inflation. Are we really saying that it's not worth the risk to print an extra     billion for aid  Would the risks really be that different  To me  it's not that clear. What is clear is the impact on aid. Even though this is the printing of just three central banks  the global aid that's given over this period is up by almost    percent. Aid as a proportion of national income all of a sudden is at a    year high. Now  we don't get to  .  percent. Governments are still incentivized to give. But you know what  that's the  point of a matching scheme. So I think what we've learned is that the risks from this money creation scheme are quite modest  but the benefits are potentially huge. Imagine what we could do with    percent more funding. We might be able to feed the front row. The thing that I fear  the only thing that I fear  apart from the fact that I've run out of time  is that the window of opportunity for this idea is a short one. Today  money creation by central banks is an accepted policy tool. That may not always be the case. Today there are universally agreed aims for international aid. That may not always be the case. Today might be the only time that these two things coincide  such that we can afford the aid that we've always aspired to give. So  can we print money for international aid  I seriously believe the question should be  why not  Thank you very much. Here are some images of clusters of galaxies. They're exactly what they sound like. They are these huge collections of galaxies  bound together by their mutual gravity. So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars  but collections of stars  or galaxies. Now  by showing you some of these images  I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects  but more than that  I think galaxy clusters are mysterious  they are surprising  and they're useful. Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories. And as laboratories  to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them. And I think there are four major types  and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big. So  how big  Well  here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent  it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster. And  in fact  if you look very carefully you'll be able to see rings around this cluster. Now  to give you a number  this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns. It's just mind boggling how  massive these systems can get. But more than their mass  they have this additional feature. They are essentially isolated systems  so if we like  we can think of them as a scaled down version of the entire universe. And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales  such as  how does gravity work  might be answered by studying these systems. So that was very big. The second things is very hot. Okay  if I take an image of a galaxy cluster  and I subtract away all of the starlight  what I'm left with is this big  blue blob. This is in false color. It's actually X ray light that we're seeing. And the question is  if it's not galaxies  what is emitting this light  The answer is hot gas  million degree gas    in fact  it's plasma. And the reason why it's so hot goes back to the previous slide. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds  and great speeds means great temperatures. So this is the main idea  but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us  still puzzle us  and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot. Third thing  probing the very small. Now  to explain this  I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something  very  very mysterious  which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that  doesn't like to interact very much  except through gravity  and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist  you want to know what happens  when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception. Well  how do we do this  To answer that question  I'm going to have to ask another one  which is  what happens when galaxy clusters collide  Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe  scaled down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter  and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas  and  of course  you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge  huge scale. And this is very important  because what it means is that very  very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab  might be compounded and compounded into something that we could  possibly observe in nature. So  it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter  the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small  is precisely because they are so very big. Fourth thing  the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay  if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air  I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever increasing rate. Similarly  cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding. They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name  and they call it dark energy. And  again  we want to learn more about it. So  one particular question that we have is  how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales  Depending on how strong it is  maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well  the problem with the large scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well  I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic  the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly  I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. So  as I come to a close  you might feel slightly cheated. I mean  I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful  and I've given some reasons  but what is their use really  Well  to answer this  I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say   If I had asked people what they wanted  they would have said faster horses.  Today  we as a society are faced with many  many difficult problems. And the solutions to these  problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity. So  yes  we need to focus  yes  we need to concentrate  but we also need to remember that innovation  ingenuity  inspiration    these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us. Thanks. I'm very pleased to be here today to talk to you all about how we might repair the damaged brain  and I'm particularly excited by this field  because as a neurologist myself  I believe that this offers one of the great ways that we might be able to offer hope for patients who today live with devastating and yet untreatable diseases of the brain. So here's the problem. You can see here the picture of somebody's brain with Alzheimer's disease next to a healthy brain  and what's obvious is  in the Alzheimer's brain  ringed red  there's obvious damage    atrophy  scarring. And I could show you equivalent pictures from other disease  multiple sclerosis  motor neuron disease  Parkinson's disease  even Huntington's disease  and they would all tell a similar story. And collectively these brain disorders represent one of the major public health threats of our time. And the numbers here are really rather staggering. At any one time  there are    million people today living with one of these brain diseases  and the annual cost globally is     billion dollars. I mean  just think about that. That's greater than one percent of the global GDP. And it gets worse  because all these numbers are rising because these are by and large age related diseases  and we're living longer. So the question we really need to ask ourselves is  why  given the devastating impact of these diseases to the individual  never mind the scale of the societal problem  why are there no effective treatments  Now in order to consider this  I first need to give you a crash course in how the brain works. So in other words  I need to tell you everything I learned at medical school. But believe me  this isn't going to take very long. Okay   Laughter  So the brain is terribly simple  it's made up of four cells  and two of them are shown here. There's the nerve cell  and then there's the myelinating cell  or the insulating cell. It's called oligodendrocyte. And when these four cells work together in health and harmony  they create an extraordinary symphony of electrical activity  and it is this electrical activity that underpins our ability to think  to emote  to remember  to learn  move  feel and so on. But equally  each of these individual four cells alone or together  can go rogue or die  and when that happens  you get damage. You get damaged wiring. You get disrupted connections. And that's evident here with the slower conduction. But ultimately  this damage will manifest as disease  clearly. And if the starting dying nerve cell is a motor nerve  for example  you'll get motor neuron disease. So I'd like to give you a real life illustration of what happens with motor neuron disease. So this is a patient of mine called John. John I saw just last week in the clinic. And I've asked John to tell us something  about what were his problems that led to the initial diagnosis of motor neuron disease. John  I was diagnosed in October in       and the main problem was a breathing problem  difficulty breathing. Siddharthan Chandran  I don't know if you caught all of that  but what John was telling us was that difficulty with breathing led eventually to the diagnosis of motor neuron disease. So John's now    months further down in that journey  and I've now asked him to tell us something about his current predicament. John  What I've got now is  the breathing's gotten worse. I've got weakness in my hands   my arms and my legs. So basically I'm in a wheelchair most of the time. SC  John's just told us he's in a wheelchair most of the time. So what these two clips show is not just the devastating consequence of the disease  but they also tell us something about the shocking pace of the disease  because in just    months  a fit adult man has been rendered wheelchair  and respirator dependent. And let's face it  John could be anybody's father  brother or friend. So that's what happens when the motor nerve dies. But what happens when that myelin cell dies  You get multiple sclerosis. So the scan on your left is an illustration of the brain  and it's a map of the connections of the brain  and superimposed upon which are areas of damage. We call them lesions of demyelination. But they're damage  and they're white. So I know what you're thinking here. You're thinking   My God  this bloke came up and said he's going to talk about hope  and all he's done is give a really rather bleak and depressing tale.  I've told you these diseases are terrible. They're devastating  numbers are rising  the costs are ridiculous  and worst of all  we have no treatment. Where's the hope  Well  you know what  I think there is hope. And there's hope in this next section  of this brain section of somebody else with M.S.  because what it illustrates is  amazingly  the brain can repair itself. It just doesn't do it well enough. And so again  there are two things I want to show you. First of all is the damage of this patient with M.S. And again  it's another one of these white masses. But crucially  the area that's ringed red highlights an area that is pale blue. But that area that is pale blue was once white. So it was damaged. It's now repaired. Just to be clear  It's not because of doctors. It's in spite of doctors  not because of doctors. This is spontaneous repair. It's amazing and it's occurred because there are stem cells in the brain  even  which can enable new myelin  new insulation  to be laid down over the damaged nerves. And this observation is important for two reasons. The first is it challenges one of the orthodoxies that we learnt at medical school  or at least I did  admittedly last century  which is that the brain doesn't repair itself  unlike  say  the bone or the liver. But actually it does  but it just doesn't do it well enough. And the second thing it does  and it gives us a very clear direction  of travel for new therapies    I mean  you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know what to do here. You simply need to find ways of promoting the endogenous  spontaneous repair that occurs anyway. So the question is  why  if we've known that for some time  as we have  why do we not have those treatments  And that in part reflects the complexity of drug development. Now  drug development you might think of as a rather expensive but risky bet  and the odds of this bet are roughly this  they're        to one against  because you need to screen about        compounds to find that one potential winner. And then you need to spend    years and spend over a billion dollars  and even then  you may not have a winner. So the question for us is  can you change the rules of the game and can you shorten the odds  And in order to do that  you have to think  where is the bottleneck in this drug discovery  And one of the bottlenecks is  early in drug discovery. All that screening occurs in animal models. But we know that the proper  study of mankind is man  to borrow from Alexander Pope. So the question is  can we study these diseases using human material  And of course  absolutely we can. We can use stem cells  and specifically we can use human stem cells. And human stem cells are these extraordinary but simple cells that can do two things  they can self renew or make more of themselves  but they can also become specialized to make bone  liver or  crucially  nerve cells  maybe even the motor nerve cell or the myelin cell. And the challenge has long been  can we harness the power  the undoubted power of these stem cells in order to realize their promise for regenerative neurology  And I think we can now  and the reason we can is because there have been several major discoveries in the last        years. One of them was here in Edinburgh  and it must be the only celebrity sheep  Dolly. So Dolly was made in Edinburgh  and Dolly was an example of the first cloning of a mammal from an adult cell. But I think the even more significant breakthrough for the purposes of our discussion today was made in      by a Japanese scientist called Yamanaka. And what Yamaka did  in a fantastic form of scientific cookery  was he showed that four ingredients  just four ingredients  could effectively convert any cell  adult cell  into a master stem cell. And the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate  because what it means that from anybody in this room  but particularly patients  you could now generate a bespoke  personalized tissue repair kit. Take a skin cell  make it a master pluripotent cell  so you could then make those cells that are relevant to their disease  both to study but potentially to treat. Now  the idea of that at medical school    this is a recurring theme  isn't  it  me and medical school    would have been ridiculous  but it's an absolute reality today. And I see this as the cornerstone of regeneration  repair and hope. And whilst we're on the theme of hope  for those of you who might have failed at school  there's hope for you as well  because this is the school report of John Gerdon.   I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist  on his present showing this is quite ridiculous.   So they didn't think much of him then. But what you may not know is that he  got the Nobel Prize for medicine just three months ago. So to return to the original problem  what is the opportunity of these stem cells  or this disruptive technology  for repairing the damaged brain  which we call regenerative neurology  I think there are two ways you can think about this  as a fantastic   st century drug discovery tool  and or as a form of therapy. So I want to tell you a little bit about both of those in the next few moments. Drug discovery in a dish is how people often talk about this. It's very simple  You take a patient with a disease  let's say motor neuron disease  you take a skin sample  you do the pluripotent reprogramming  as I've already told you  and you generate live motor nerve cells. That's straightforward  because that's what pluripotent cells can do. But crucially  you can then compare their behavior to their equivalent but healthy counterparts  ideally from an unaffected relative. That way  you're matching for genetic variation. And that's exactly what we did here. This was a collaboration with colleagues  in London  Chris Shaw  in the U.S.   Steve Finkbeiner and Tom Maniatis. And what you're looking at  and this is amazing  these are living  growing  motor nerve cells from a patient with motor neuron disease. It happens to be an inherited form. I mean  just imagine that. This would have been unimaginable    years ago. So apart from seeing them grow and put out processes  we can also engineer them so that they fluoresce  but crucially  we can then track their individual health and compare the diseased motor nerve cells to the healthy ones. And when you do all that and put it together  you realize that the diseased ones  which is represented in the red line  are two and a half times more likely to die than the healthy counterpart. And the crucial point about this is that you then have a fantastic assay to discover drugs  because what would you ask of the drugs  and you could do this through a high throughput automated screening system  you'd ask the drugs  give me one thing  find me a drug that will bring the red line closer to the blue line  because that drug will be a high value candidate that you could probably take direct to human trial and almost bypass that bottleneck that I've told you about in drug discovery with the animal models  if that makes sense. It's fantastic. But I want to come back to how you might use stem cells directly to repair damage. And again there are two ways to think about this  and they're not mutually exclusive. The first  and I think in the long run the one that will give us the biggest dividend  but it's not thought of that way just yet  is to think about those stem cells that are already in your brain  and I've told you that. All of us have stem cells in the brain  even the diseased brain  and surely the smart way forward is to find ways that you can promote and activate those stem cells in your brain already to react and respond appropriately to damage to repair it. That will be the future. There will be drugs that will do that. But the other way is to effectively parachute in cells  transplant them in  to replace dying or lost cells  even in the brain. And I want to tell you now an experiment  it's a clinical trial that we did  which recently completed  which is with colleagues in UCL  David Miller in particular. So this study was very simple. We took patients with multiple sclerosis and asked a simple question  Would stem cells from the bone marrow be protective of their nerves  So what we did was we took this bone marrow  grew up the stem cells in the lab  and then injected them back into the vein. I'm making this sound really simple. It took five years off a lot of people  okay  And it put gray hair on me and caused all kinds of issues. But conceptually  it's essentially simple. So we've given them into the vein  right  So in order to measure whether this was successful or not  we measured the optic nerve as our outcome measure. And that's a good thing to measure in M.S.  because patients with M.S. sadly suffer with problems with vision    loss of vision  unclear vision. And so we measured the size of the optic nerve using the scans with David Miller three times       months  six months  and before the infusion    and you can see the gently declining red line. And that's telling you that the optic nerve is shrinking  which makes sense  because their nerves are dying. We then gave the stem cell infusion and repeated the measurement twice    three months and six months    and to our surprise  almost  the line's gone up. That suggests that the intervention has been protective. I don't think myself that what's happened is that those stem cells have made new myelin or new nerves. What I think they've done is they've promoted the endogenous stem cells  or precursor cells  to do their job  wake up  lay down new myelin. So this is a proof of concept. I'm very excited about that. So I just want to end with the theme I began on  which was regeneration and hope. So here I've asked John what his hopes are for the future. John  I would hope that sometime in the future through the research that you people are doing  we can come up with a cure so that people like me can lead a normal life. SC  I mean  that speaks volumes. But I'd like to close by first of all thanking John    thanking John for allowing me to share his insights and these clips with you all. But I'd also like to add to John and to others that my own view is  I'm hopeful for the future. I do believe that the disruptive technologies like stem cells that I've tried to explain to you do offer very real hope. And I do think that the day that we might be able to repair the damaged brain is sooner than we think. Thank you. I'm going to talk about hackers. And the image that comes to your mind when I say that word is probably not of Benjamin Franklin  but I'm going to explain to you why it should be. The image that comes to your mind is probably more likely of a pasty kid sitting in a basement doing something mischievous  or of a shady criminal who is trying to steal your identity  or of an international rogue with a political agenda. And mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea that hackers are people that we should be afraid of. But like most things in technology and the technology world  hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil. For every hacker that's trying to steal your identity there's one that's building a tool that will help you find your loved ones after a disaster or to monitor environmental quality after an oil spill. Hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system  and it is a deeply democratic activity. It's about critical thinking. It's about questioning existing ways of doing things. It's the idea that if you see a  problem  you work to fix it  and not just complain about it. And in many ways  hacking is what built America. Betsy Ross was a hacker. The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack. And from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs  hacking has always been at the foundation of American democracy. So if there's one thing I want to leave you here with today  it's that the next time you think about who a hacker is  you think not of this guy but of this guy  Benjamin Franklin  who was one of the greatest hackers of all time. He was one of America's most prolific inventors  though he famously never filed a patent  because he thought that all human knowledge should be freely available. He brought us bifocals and the lightning rod  and of course there was his collaboration on the invention of American democracy. And in Code For America  we really try to embody the spirit of Ben Franklin. He was a tinkerer and a statesman whose conception of citizenship was always predicated on action. He believed that government could be built by the people  and we call those people civic hackers. So it's no wonder that the values that underly a healthy democracy  like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise  are the same values that underly the Internet. And so it's no surprise that many hackers are turning their attention to the problem of government. But before I give you a few examples of what civic hacking looks like  I want to make clear that you don't have to be a programmer to be a civic hacker. You just have to believe that you can bring a   st century tool set to bear on the problems that government faces. And we hear all the time from our community of civic hackers at Code for America that they didn't understand how much nontechnical work actually went into civic hacking projects. So keep that in mind. All of you are potential civic hackers. So what does civic hacking look like  Our team last year in Honolulu  which in this case was three full time fellows who were doing a year of public service  were asked by the city to rebuild the website. And it's a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages which just wasn't going to be possible in the few months that they had. So instead  they decided to build a parallel site that better conformed to how citizens actually want to interact with information on a city website. They're looking for answers to questions  and they want to take action when they're done  which is really hard to do from a site that looks like this. So our team built Honolulu Answers  which is a super simple search interface where you enter a search term or a question and get back plain language answers that drive a user towards action. Now the site itself was easy enough to build  but the team was faced with the challenge of how they populate all of the content. It would have taken the three of them a very long time  especially given that none of  them are actually from Honolulu. And so they did something that's really radical  when you think about how government is used to working. They asked citizens to write the content. So you've heard of a hack a thon. They held a write a thon  where on one Saturday afternoon    Wild pigs are a huge problem  in Honolulu  apparently. In one Saturday afternoon  they were able to populate most of the content for most of the frequently asked questions  but more importantly than that  they created a new way for citizens  to participate in their government. Now  I think this is a really cool story in and of itself  but it gets more awesome. On the National Day of Civic Hacking this past June in Oakland  where I live  the Code For America team in Oakland took the open source code base of Honolulu Answers and turned it into Oakland Answers  and again we held a write a thon where we took the most frequently asked questions and had citizens write the answers to them  and I got into the act. I authored this answer  and a few others. And I'm trying to this day to articulate the sense of empowerment and responsibility that I feel for the place that I live based simply on this small act of participation. And by stitching together my small act with the thousands of other small acts of participation that we're enabling through civic hacking  we think we can reenergize citizenship and restore trust in government. At this point  you may be wondering what city officials think of all this. They actually love it. As most of you guys know  cities are being asked every day to do more with less  and they're always looking for innovative solutions to entrenched problems. So when you give citizens a way to participate beyond attending a town hall meeting  cities can actually capture the capacity in their communities to do the business of government. Now I don't want to leave the impression that civic hacking is just an American phenomenon. It's happening across the globe  and one of my favorite examples is from Mexico City  where earlier this year  the Mexico House of Representatives entered into a contract with a software development firm to build an app that legislators would use to track bills. So this was just for the handful of legislators in the House. And the contract was a two year contract for  .  million dollars. Now a lot of people were really angry about this  especially geeks who knew that  .  million dollars was an absolutely outrageous amount of money for what was a very simple app. But instead of taking to the streets  they issued a challenge. They asked programmers in Mexico to build something better and cheaper  and they offered a prize of       dollars           times cheaper than the government contract  and they gave the entrants    days. And in those    days  they submitted     apps  five of which were presented to Congress and are still in the app store today. And because of this action  that contract was vacated  and now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City which is home to one of our partners  Code for Mexico City. And so what you see in all three of these places  in Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City  are the elements that are at the core of civic hacking. It's citizens who saw things that could be working better and they decided to fix them  and through that work  they're creating a   st century ecosystem of participation. They're creating a whole new set of ways for citizens to be involved  besides voting or signing a petition or protesting. They can actually build government. So back to our friend Ben Franklin  who  one of his lesser known accomplishments was that in      he founded the first volunteer firefighting company in Philadelphia  called a brigade. And it's because he and his friends noticed that the city was having trouble keeping up with all the fires that were happening in the city  so in true civic hacker fashion  they built a solution. And we have our own brigades at Code for America working on the projects that I've just described  and we want to ask you to follow in Ben Franklin's footsteps and come join us. We have    brigades in the U.S. We are pleased to announce today that we're opening up the  brigade to international cities for the first time  starting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland. You can find out if there's a brigade where you live at brigade.codeforamerica.org  and if there's not a brigade where you live  we will help you. We've created a tool kit which also lives at brigade.codeforamerica.org  and we will support you along the way. Our goal is to create a global network of civic hackers who are innovating on the existing system in order to build tools that will solve entrenched problems  that will support local government  and that will empower citizens. So please come hack with us. Thank you. Here are some images of clusters of galaxies. They're exactly what they sound like. They are these huge collections of galaxies  bound together by their mutual gravity. So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars  but collections of stars  or galaxies. Now  by showing you some of these images  I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects  but more than that  I think galaxy clusters are mysterious  they are surprising  and they're useful. Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories. And as laboratories  to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them. And I think there are four major types  and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big. So  how big  Well  here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent  it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster. And  in fact  if you look very carefully you'll be able to see rings around this cluster. Now  to give you a number  this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns. It's just mind boggling how  massive these systems can get. But more than their mass  they have this additional feature. They are essentially isolated systems  so if we like  we can think of them as a scaled down version of the entire universe. And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales  such as  how does gravity work  might be answered by studying these systems. So that was very big. The second things is very hot. Okay  if I take an image of a galaxy cluster  and I subtract away all of the starlight  what I'm left with is this big  blue blob. This is in false color. It's actually X ray light that we're seeing. And the question is  if it's not galaxies  what is emitting this light  The answer is hot gas  million degree gas    in fact  it's plasma. And the reason why it's so hot goes back to the previous slide. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds  and great speeds means great temperatures. So this is the main idea  but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us  still puzzle us  and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot. Third thing  probing the very small. Now  to explain this  I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something  very  very mysterious  which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that  doesn't like to interact very much  except through gravity  and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist  you want to know what happens  when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception. Well  how do we do this  To answer that question  I'm going to have to ask another one  which is  what happens when galaxy clusters collide  Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe  scaled down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter  and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas  and  of course  you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge  huge scale. And this is very important  because what it means is that very  very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab  might be compounded and compounded into something that we could  possibly observe in nature. So  it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter  the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small  is precisely because they are so very big. Fourth thing  the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay  if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air  I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever increasing rate. Similarly  cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding. They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name  and they call it dark energy. And  again  we want to learn more about it. So  one particular question that we have is  how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales  Depending on how strong it is  maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well  the problem with the large scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well  I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic  the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly  I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. So  as I come to a close  you might feel slightly cheated. I mean  I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful  and I've given some reasons  but what is their use really  Well  to answer this  I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say   If I had asked people what they wanted  they would have said faster horses.  Today  we as a society are faced with many  many difficult problems. And the solutions to these  problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity. So  yes  we need to focus  yes  we need to concentrate  but we also need to remember that innovation  ingenuity  inspiration    these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us. Thanks. Almost two years ago  I was driving in my car in Germany  and I turned on the radio. Europe at the time was in the middle of the Euro crisis  and all the headlines were about European countries getting downgraded by rating agencies in the United States. I listened and thought to myself   What are these rating agencies  and why is everybody so upset about their work   Well  if you were sitting next to me in the car that day and would have told me that I would devote the next years to trying to reform them  obviously I would have called you crazy. But guess what's really crazy  the way these rating agencies are run. And I would like to explain to you not only why it's time to change this  but also how we can do it. So let me tell you a little bit about what rating agencies really do. As you would read a car magazine before purchasing a new car or taking a look at a product review before deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get  investors are reading ratings before they decide in which kind of product they are investing their money. A rating can range from a so called AAA  which means it's a top performing product  and it can go down to the level of the so called BBB   which means it's a fairly risky investment. Rating agencies are rating companies. They are rating banks. They are rating even financial products like the infamous mortgage backed securities. But they can also rate countries  and these ratings are called sovereign ratings  and I would like to focus in particular on these sovereign ratings. And I can tell  as you're listening to me right now  you're thinking  so why should I really care about this  right  Be honest. Well  ratings affect you. They affect all of us. If a rating agency rates a country  it basically assesses and evaluates a country's debt and the ability and willingness of a country to repay its debt. So if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency  the country has to pay more in order to borrow money on the international markets. So it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer  because you and your fellow countrymen have to pony up more in order to borrow. But what if a country can't afford to pay more because it's maybe too expensive  Well  then the country has less available for other services  like roads  schools  healthcare. And this is the reason why you should care  because sovereign ratings affect everyone. And that is the reason why I believe they should be defined as public goods. They should be transparent  accessible  and available to everyone at no cost. But here's the situation  the rating agency market is dominated by three players and three players only    Standard   Poor's  Moody's  and Fitch    and we know whenever there is a market concentration  there is really no competition. There is no incentive to improve the quality of your product. And let's face it  the credit rating  agencies have contributed  putting the global economy on the brink  and yet they have to change the way they operate. The second point  would you really buy a car just based on the advice of the dealer  Obviously not  right  That would be irresponsible. But that's actually what's going on in the rating agency sector every single day. The customers of these rating agencies  like countries or companies  they are paying for their own ratings  and obviously this is creating a conflict of interest. The third point is  the rating agencies are not really telling us how they are coming up with their ratings  but in this day and age  you can't even sell a candy bar without listing everything that's inside. But for ratings  a crucial element of our economy  we really do not know what all the different ingredients are. We are allowing the rating agencies to be intransparent about their work  and we need to change this. I think there is no doubt that the sector needs a complete overhaul  not just a trimming at the margins. I think it's time for a bold move. I think it's time to upgrade the system. And this is why we at the Bertelsmann Foundation have invested a lot of time and effort thinking about an alternative for the sector. And we have developed the first model for a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk  and we call it by its acronym  INCRA. INCRA would make a difference to the current system by adding another nonprofit player to the mix. It would be based on a nonprofit model that would be based on a sustainable endowment. The endowment would create income that would allow us to run the operation  to run the rating agency  and it would also allow us to make our ratings publicly available. But this is not enough to make a difference  right  INCRA would also be based on a very  very clear governance structure that would avoid any conflict of interest  and it would include many stakeholders from society. INCRA would not only be a European or an American rating agency  it would be a truly international one  in which  in particular  the emerging economies would have an equal interest   voice and representation. The second big difference that INCRA would make is that would it base its sovereign risk assessment on a broader set of indicators. Think about it that way. If we conduct a sovereign rating  we basically take a look at the economic soil of a country  its macroeconomic fundamentals. But we also have to ask the question  who is cultivating the economic soil of a country  right  Well  a country has many gardeners  and one of them is the government  so we have to ask the question  how is a country governed  How is it managed  And this is the reason why we have developed what we call forward looking indicators. These are indicators that give you a much better read about the socioeconomic development of a country. I hope you would agree it's important for you to know if your government is willing to invest  in renewable energy and education. It's important for you to know if the government of your country is able to manage a crisis  if the government is finally able to implement the reforms that it's promised. For example  if INCRA would rate South Africa right now  of course we would take a very  very close look at the youth unemployment of the country  the highest in the world. If over    percent of a country's population under the age of    is unemployed  of course this has a huge impact on the economy today and even more so in the future. Well  our friends at Moody's  Standard   Poor's  and Fitch will tell us we would take this into account as well. But guess what  We do not know exactly how they will take this into account. And this leads me to the third big difference that INCRA would make. INCRA would not only release its ratings but it would also release its indicators and methodology. So in contrast to the current system  INCRA would be fully transparent. So in a nutshell  INCRA would offer an alternative to the current system of the big three rating agencies by adding a new  nonprofit player to the mix that would increase the competition  it would increase the transparency of the sector  and it would also increase the quality. I can tell that sovereign ratings may still look to you like this very small piece of this very complex global financial world  but I tell you it's a very important one  and a very important one to fix  because sovereign ratings affect all of us  and they should be addressed and should be defined as public goods. And this is why we are testing our model right now  and why we are trying to find out if it can bring together a group of able and willing actors to bring INCRA to life. I truly believe building up INCRA is in everyone's interest  and that we have the unique opportunity right now to turn INCRA into a cornerstone of a new  more inclusive financial system. Because for way too long  we have left the big financial players on their own. It's time to give them some company. Thank you.
