Good morning. Let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all  Leonardo da Vinci. We're all familiar with his fantastic work    his drawings  his paintings  his inventions  his writings. But we do not know his face. Thousands of books have been written about him  but there's controversy  and it remains  about his looks. Even this well known portrait is not accepted by many art historians. So  what do you think  Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it  Let's find out. Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him. He drew people  anatomy  plants  animals  landscapes  buildings  water  everything. But no faces  I find that hard to believe. His contemporaries made faces  like the ones you see here    en face or three quarters. So  surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo must have made self portraits from time to time. So let's try to find them. I think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self portraits  we would find his face looking at us. So I looked at all of his drawings  more than      and looked for male portraits. There are about      you see them here. Which ones of these could be self portraits  Well  for that they have to be done as we just saw  en face or three quarters. So we can eliminate all the profiles. It also has to be sufficiently detailed. So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized. And we know from his contemporaries that Leonardo was a very handsome  even beautiful man. So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures. And look what happens    only three candidates remain that fit the bill. And here they are. Yes  indeed  the old man is there  as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus. And lastly  the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted   The Musician.  Before we go into these faces  I should explain why I have some right to talk about them. I've made more than       portraits myself for newspapers  over the course of           years  sorry     years only. But there are        and very few artists have drawn so many faces. So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces. OK  now let's look at these three portraits. And hold onto your seats  because if we zoom in on those faces  remark how they have the same broad forehead  the horizontal eyebrows  the long nose  the curved lips and the small  well developed chin. I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw that. There is no reason why these portraits should look alike. All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self portrait  and look  they are very similar. Now  are they made in the right order  The young man should be made first. And as you see here from the years that they were created  it is indeed the case. They are made in the right order. What was the age of Leonardo at the time  Does that fit  Yes  it does. He was        and    when these were made. So we have three pictures  potentially of the same person of the same age as Leonardo at the time. But how do we know it's him  and not someone else  Well  we need a reference. And here's the only picture of Leonardo that's widely accepted. It's a statue made by Verrocchio  of David  for which Leonardo posed as a boy of   . And if we now compare the face of the statue  with the face of the musician  you see the very same features again. The statue is the reference  and it connects the identity of Leonardo to those three faces. Ladies and gentlemen  this story has not yet been published. It's only proper that you here at TED hear and see it first. The icon of icons finally has a face. Here he is  Leonardo da Vinci. Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union  a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside. With it  they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space. The rocket was huge. And packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside. On October          they launched their rocket. One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time   We are about to create a new planet that we will call Sputnik. In the olden days  explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe. Now we have the good fortune to open up space. And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy.  You're watching snippets from  Sputnik   my fifth documentary feature  which is just about completed. It tells the story of Sputnik  and the story of what happened to America as a result. For days after the launch  Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity. A man made moon visible by ordinary citizens  it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space. But just three days later  on a day they called Red Monday  the media and the politicians told us  and we believed  that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology  and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs  using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile. All hell broke loose. Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America    historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or     . It provoked the missile gap. It exploded an arms race. It began the space race. Within a year  Congress funded huge weapons increases  and we went from       nuclear weapons to       . And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases. For example  some here will remember this day  June       the National Civil Defense Drill  where tens of millions of people in    cities went underground. Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in    Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen  and that at least    percent of our population was going to be killed. But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well. For example  some in this room went to school on scholarship because of Sputnik. Support for engineering  math and science    education in general    boomed. And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik led directly to ARPA  and the Internet  and  of course  NASA. My feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media. But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation  into something that was overall very good for America.  Sputnik  will soon be released. In closing  I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors  longtime TEDster  Jay Walker. And I'd like to thank you all. Thank you  Chris. There is nothing bigger or older than the universe. The questions I would like to talk about are  one  where did we come from  How did the universe come into being  Are we alone in the universe  Is there alien life out there  What is the future of the human race  Up until the     s  everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time. Then it was discovered that the universe was expanding. Distant galaxies were moving away from us. This meant they must have been closer together in the past. If we extrapolate back  we find we must have all been on top of each other about    billion years ago. This was the Big Bang  the beginning of the universe. But was there anything before the Big Bang  If not  what created the universe  Why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did  We used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts. First  there were the laws like Maxwell's equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe  given its state over all of space at one time. And second  there was no question of the initial state of the universe. We have made good progress on the first part  and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions. But until recently  we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe. However  this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct. Under extreme conditions  general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space. This removes the distinction between time and space  and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state. The universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing. Moreover  we can calculate a probability that the universe was created in different states. These predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the WMAP satellite of the cosmic microwave background  which is an imprint of the very early universe. We think we have solved the mystery of creation. Maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence. I now turn to the second big question  are we alone  or is there other life in the universe  We believe that life arose spontaneously on the Earth  so it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets  of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy. But we don't know how life first appeared. We have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing. The first is that we have fossils of algae from  .  billion years ago. The Earth was formed  .  billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years. So life appeared on Earth within half a billion years of it being possible  which is short compared to the    billion year lifetime of a planet of Earth type. This suggests that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high. If it was very low  one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available. On the other hand  we don't seem to have been visited by aliens. I am discounting the reports of UFOs. Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos  If there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring  it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far. Furthermore  despite an extensive search by the SETI project  we haven't heard any alien television quiz shows. This probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years. Issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet. This brings me to the last of the big questions  the future of the human race. If we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy  we should make sure we survive and continue. But we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history. Our population and our use of the finite resources of planet Earth are growing exponentially  along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill. But our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were of survival advantage in the past. It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years  let alone the next thousand or million. Our only chance of long term survival is not to remain inward looking on planet Earth  but to spread out into space. The answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years. But if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years  our future is in space. That is why I am in favor of manned    or should I say   personned    space flight. All of my life I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions. I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap. Indeed  it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge. The ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe  and we are making good progress. Thank you for listening. Chris Anderson  Professor  if you had to guess either way  do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are alone in the Milky Way  as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher  This answer took seven minutes  and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for TED. Stephen Hawking  I think it quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years  otherwise we would have heard radio waves. The alternative is that civilizations don't last very long  but destroy themselves. CA  Professor Hawking  thank you for that answer. We will take it as a salutary warning  I think  for the rest of our conference this week. Professor  we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today. Thank you very much indeed. I have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about       times. I'm giving a short slide show this morning that I'm giving for the very first time  so    well it's    I don't want or need to raise the bar  I'm actually trying to lower the bar. Because I've cobbled this together to try to meet the challenge of this session. And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong's fantastic presentation that religion really properly understood is not about belief  but about behavior. Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism. How dare we be optimistic  Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief  an intellectual posture. As Mahatma Gandhi famously said   You must become the change you wish to see in the world.  And the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created by the belief alone  except to the extent that the belief brings about new behavior. But the word  behavior  is also  I think  sometimes misunderstood in this context. I'm a big advocate of changing the lightbulbs and buying hybrids  and Tipper and I put    solar panels on our house  and dug the geothermal wells  and did all of that other stuff. But  as important as it is to change the lightbulbs  it is more important to change the laws. And when we change our behavior in our daily lives  we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part. In order to be optimistic about this  we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy. In order to solve the climate crisis  we have to solve the democracy crisis. And we have one. I have been trying to tell this story for a long time. I was reminded of that recently  by a woman who walked past the table I was sitting at  just staring at me as she walked past. She was in her   s  looked like she had a kind face. I thought nothing of it until I saw from the corner of my eye she was walking from the opposite direction  also just staring at me. And so I said   How do you do   And she said   You know  if you dyed your hair black  you would look just like Al Gore.   Laughter  Many years ago  when I was a young congressman  I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control    the nuclear arms race. And the military historians taught me  during that quest  that military conflicts are typically put into three categories  local battles  regional or theater wars  and the rare but all important global  world war    strategic conflicts. And each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources  a different approach  a different organizational model. Environmental challenges fall into the same three categories  and most of what we think about are local environmental problems  air pollution  water pollution  hazardous waste dumps. But there are also regional environmental problems  like acid rain from the Midwest to the Northeast  and from Western Europe to the Arctic  and from the Midwest out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico. And there are lots of those. But the climate crisis is the rare but all important global  or strategic  conflict. Everything is affected. And we have to organize our response appropriately. We need a worldwide  global mobilization for renewable energy  conservation  efficiency and a global transition to a low carbon economy. We have work to do. And we can mobilize resources and political will. But the political will has to be mobilized  in order to mobilize the resources. Let me show you these slides here. I thought I would start with the logo. What's missing here  of course  is the North Polar ice cap. Greenland remains. Twenty eight years ago  this is what the polar ice cap    the North Polar ice cap    looked like at the end of the summer  at the fall equinox. This last fall  I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder  Colorado  and talked to the researchers here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory. This is what's happened in the last    years. To put it in perspective       was the previous record. Here's what happened last fall that has really unnerved the researchers. The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically    doesn't look quite the same size    but it is exactly the same size as the United States  minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona. The amount that disappeared in      was equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi. The extra amount that disappeared last fall was equivalent to this much. It comes back in the winter  but not as permanent ice  as thin ice    vulnerable. The amount remaining could be completely gone in summer in as little as five years. That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland. Already  around the Arctic Circle    this is a famous village in Alaska. This is a town in Newfoundland. Antarctica. Latest studies from NASA. The amount of a moderate to severe snow melting of an area equivalent to the size of California.  They were the best of times  they were the worst of times   the most famous opening sentence in English literature. I want to share briefly a tale of two planets. Earth and Venus are exactly the same size. Earth's diameter is about     kilometers larger  but essentially the same size. They have exactly the same amount of carbon. But the difference is  on Earth  most of the carbon has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere  deposited in the ground as coal  oil  natural gas  etc. On Venus  most of it is in the atmosphere. The difference is that our temperature is    degrees on average. On Venus  it's    . This is relevant to our current strategy of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible  and putting it into the atmosphere. It's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun. It's three times hotter than Mercury  which is right next to the Sun. Now  briefly  here's an image you've seen  as one of the only old images  but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI  Climate. The global scientific community says  man made global warming pollution  put into the atmosphere  thickening this  is trapping more of the outgoing infrared. You all know that. At the last IPCC summary  the scientists wanted to say   How certain are you   They wanted to answer that     percent.  The Chinese objected  and so the compromise was  more than    percent.  Now  the skeptics say   Oh  wait a minute  this could be variations in this energy coming in from the sun.  If that were true  the stratosphere would be heated as well as the lower atmosphere  if it's more coming in. If it's more being trapped on the way out  then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here. Here is the lower atmosphere. Here's the stratosphere  cooler. CSI  Climate. Now  here's the good news. Sixty eight percent of Americans now believe that human activity is responsible for global warming. Sixty nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up in a significant way. There has been progress  but here is the key  when given a list of challenges to confront  global warming is still listed at near the bottom. What is missing is a sense of urgency. If you agree with the factual analysis  but you don't feel the sense of urgency  where does that leave you  Well  the Alliance for Climate Protection  which I head in conjunction with Current TV    who did this pro bono    did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this. This is the winner. NBC    I'll show all of the networks here    the top journalists for NBC asked     questions in      of the presidential candidates  two of them were about the climate crisis. ABC      questions  two about the climate crisis. Fox  two. CNN  two. CBS  zero. From laughs to tears    this is one of the older tobacco commercials. So here's what we're doing. This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries. And us. But it's not just the developed nations. The developing countries are now following us and accelerating their pace. And actually  their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent to where we were in     . And they're catching up very dramatically. The total concentrations  by       they will be essentially where we were in     . If the wealthy countries were completely missing from the picture  we would still have this crisis. But we have given to the developing countries the technologies and the ways of thinking that are creating the crisis. This is in Bolivia    over thirty years. This is peak fishing in a few seconds. The '  s. '  s. '  s. '  s. We have to stop this. And the good news is that we can. We have the technologies. We have to have a unified view of how to go about this  the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions  all has a single  very simple solution. People say   What's the solution   Here it is. Put a price on carbon. We need a CO  tax  revenue neutral  to replace taxation on employment  which was invented by Bismarck    and some things have changed since the   th century. In the poor world  we have to integrate the responses to poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis. Plans to fight poverty in Uganda are mooted  if we do not solve the climate crisis. But responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries. This is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in Europe. This was from Nature magazine. These are concentrating solar  renewable energy plants  linked in a so called  supergrid  to supply all of the electrical power to Europe  largely from developing countries    high voltage DC currents. This is not pie in the sky  this can be done. We need to do it for our own economy. The latest figures show that the old model is not working. There are a lot of great investments that you can make. If you are investing in tar sands or shale oil  then you have a portfolio that is crammed with sub prime carbon assets. And it is based on an old model. Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapse. Developing tar sands and coal shale is the equivalent. Here are just a few of the investments that I personally think make sense. I have a stake in these  so I'll have a disclaimer there. But geothermal  concentrating solar  advanced photovoltaics  efficiency and conservation. You've seen this slide before  but there's a change. The only two countries that didn't ratify    and now there's only one. Australia had an election. And there was a campaign in Australia that involved television and Internet and radio commercials to lift the sense of urgency for the people there. And we trained     people to give the slide show in every town and village and city in Australia. Lot of other things contributed to it  but the new Prime Minister announced that his very first priority would be to change Australia's position on Kyoto  and he has. Now  they came to an awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have had. This is Lake Lanier. My friend Heidi Cullen said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names  we'd call the one in the southeast now Katrina  and we would say it's headed toward Atlanta. We can't wait for the kind of drought Australia had to change our political culture. Here's more good news. The cities supporting Kyoto in the U.S. are up to        and I thought I saw one go by there  just to localize this    which is good news. Now  to close  we heard a couple of days ago about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace that it becomes banal or routine. What we need is another hero generation. Those of us who are alive in the United States of America today especially  but also the rest of the world  have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice    just as Jill  Bolte  Taylor was figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through. We now have a culture of distraction. But we have a planetary emergency. And we have to find a way to create  in the generation of those alive today  a sense of generational mission. I wish I could find the words to convey this. This was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet. Another that ended slavery. And that gave women the right to vote. We can do this. Don't tell me that we don't have the capacity to do it. If we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq War  we could be well on the way to solving this challenge. We have the capacity to do it. One final point  I'm optimistic  because I believe we have the capacity  at moments of great challenge  to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us. Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis by saying   Oh  this is so terrible. What a burden we have.  I would like to ask you to reframe that. How many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts  A challenge that can pull from us more than we knew we could do  I think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude that we are the generation about which  a thousand years from now  philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate by saying  they were the ones that found it within themselves to solve this crisis and lay the basis for a bright and optimistic human future. Let's do that. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  For so many people at TED  there is deep pain that basically a design issue on a voting form    one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come true. That hurts. Al Gore  You have no idea.  Laughter  CA  When you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now    I mean  there's    are you excited by their plans on global warming  AG  The answer to the question is hard for me because  on the one hand  I think that we should feel really great about the fact that the Republican nominee    certain nominee    John McCain  and both of the finalists for the Democratic nomination    all three have a very different and forward leaning position on the climate crisis. All three have offered leadership  and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration. And I think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals. But the campaign dialogue that    as illustrated by the questions    that was put together by the League of Conservation Voters  by the way  the analysis of all the questions    and  by the way  the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label   Clean Coal.  Has anybody noticed that  Every single debate has been sponsored by  Clean Coal.   Now  even lower emissions   The richness and fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold initiative that is really needed. So they're saying the right things and they may    whichever of them is elected    may do the right thing  but let me tell you  when I came back from Kyoto in       with a feeling of great happiness that we'd gotten that breakthrough there  and then confronted the United States Senate  only one out of     senators was willing to vote to confirm  to ratify that treaty. Whatever the candidates say has to be laid alongside what the people say. This challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization. CO  is the exhaling breath of our civilization  literally. And now we mechanized that process. Changing that pattern requires a scope  a scale  a speed of change that is beyond what we have done in the past. So that's why I began by saying  be optimistic in what you do  but be an active citizen. Demand    change the light bulbs  but change the laws. Change the global treaties. We have to speak up. We have to solve this democracy    this    We have sclerosis in our democracy. And we have to change that. Use the Internet. Go on the Internet. Connect with people. Become very active as citizens. Have a moratorium    we shouldn't have any new coal fired generating plants that aren't able to capture and store CO   which means we have to quickly build these renewable sources. Now  nobody is talking on that scale. But I do believe that between now and November  it is possible. This Alliance for Climate Protection is going to launch a nationwide campaign    grassroots mobilization  television ads  Internet ads  radio  newspaper    with partnerships with everybody from the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen. We need help. We need help. CA  In terms of your own personal role going forward  Al  is there something more than that you would like to be doing  AG  I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer to that question. What can I do  Buckminster Fuller once wrote   If the future of all human civilization depended on me  what would I do  How would I be   It does depend on all of us  but again  not just with the light bulbs. We  most of us here  are Americans. We have a democracy. We can change things  but we have to actively change. What's needed really is a higher level of consciousness. And that's hard to    that's hard to create    but it is coming. There's an old African proverb that some of you know that says   If you want to go quickly  go alone  if you want to go far  go together.  We have to go far  quickly. So we have to have a change in consciousness. A change in commitment. A new sense of urgency. A new appreciation for the privilege that we have of undertaking this challenge. CA  Al Gore  thank you so much for coming to TED. AG  Thank you. Thank you very much. So  as researchers  something that we often do is use immense resources to achieve certain capabilities  or achieve certain goals. And this is essential to the progress of science  or exploration of what is possible. But it creates this unfortunate situation where a tiny  tiny fraction of the world can actually participate in this exploration or can benefit from that technology. Something that motivates me  and gets me really excited about my research  is when I see simple opportunities to drastically change that distribution and make the technology accessible to a much wider percentage of the population. I'm going to show you two videos that have gotten a lot of attention that I think embody this philosophy. And they actually use the Nintendo Wii Remote. For those of you who aren't familiar with this device  it's a     video game controller. And it's mostly advertised for its motion sensing capabilities  so you can swing a tennis racket  or hit a baseball bat. But what actually interests me a lot more is the fact that in the tip of each controller is a relatively high performing infrared camera. And I'm going to show you two demos of why this is useful. So here  I have my computer set up with the projector  and I have a Wii Remote sitting on top of it. And  for example  if you're in a school that doesn't have a lot money  probably a lot of schools  or if you're in an office environment  and you want an interactive whiteboard  normally these cost about two to three thousand dollars. So I'm going to show you how to create one with a Wii Remote. Now  this requires another piece of hardware  which is this infrared pen. You can probably make this yourself for about five dollars with a quick trip to the Radio Shack. It's got a battery  a button and an infrared LED    you guys can't see it    but it turns on whenever I push the button. Now  what this means is that if I run this piece of software  the camera sees the infrared dot  and I can register the location of the camera pixels to the projector pixels. And now this is like an interactive whiteboard surface. So for about     of hardware  you can have your own whiteboard. This is Adobe Photoshop. Thank you. The software for this I've actually put on my website and have let people download it for free. In the three months this project has been public  it's been downloaded over half a million times. So teachers and students all around the world are already using this. Although it does do it for    dollars  there are some limitations of this approach. You get about    percent of the way there  for one percent of the cost. Another nice thing is that a camera can see multiple dots  so this is actually a multi touch  interactive whiteboard system as well. For the second demo  I have this Wii Remote that's actually next to the TV. So it's pointing away from the display  rather than pointing at the display. And why this is interesting is that if you put on  say  a pair of safety glasses  that have two infrared dots in them  they are going to give the computer an approximation of your head location. And why this is interesting is I have this sort of application running on the computer monitor  which has a  D room  with some targets floating in it. And you can see that it looks like a  D room. kind of like a video game  it sort of looks  D  but for the most part  the image looks pretty flat  and bound to the surface of the screen. But if we turn on head tracking    the computer can change the image that's on the screen and make it respond to the head movements. So let's switch back to that. So this has actually been a little bit startling to the game development community. Because this is about    dollars of additional hardware if you already have a Nintendo Wii. So I'm looking forward to seeing some games  and actually Louis Castle  that's him down there  last week announced that Electronic Arts  one of the largest game publishers  is releasing a game in May that has a little Easter egg feature for supporting this type of head tracking. And that's from less than five months from a prototype in my lab to a major commercial product. Thank you. But actually  to me  what's almost more interesting than either of these two projects is how people actually found out about them. YouTube has really changed the way  or changed the speed  in which a single individual can actually spread an idea around the world. I'm doing some research in my lab with a video camera  and within the first week  a million people had seen this work  and literally within days  engineers  teachers and students from around the world were already posting their own YouTube videos of them using my system or derivatives of this work. So I hope to see more of that in the future  and hope online video distribution to be embraced by the research community. So thank you very much. The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal. It means a lot to us. But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it  but you make it yourself. So  that's my first idea. And we all know about the Mozart effect    the idea that's been around for the last five to    years    that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby  in utero   that it'll raise our IQ points            percent. Great idea  but it doesn't work at all. So  you can't just listen to music  you have to make it somehow. And I'd add to that  that it's not just making it  but everybody  each of us  everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way  and that's one of the main parts of my work. So  with the MIT Media Lab  for quite a while now  we've been engaged in a field called active music. What are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience  not just listening  but making music  And we started by making instruments for some of the world's greatest performers    we call these hyperinstruments    for Yo Yo Ma  Peter Gabriel  Prince  orchestras  rock bands. Instruments where they're all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument  so the instrument knows how it's being played. And just by changing the interpretation and the feeling  I can turn my cello into a voice  or into a whole orchestra  or into something that nobody has ever heard before. When we started making these  I started thinking  why can't we make wonderful instruments like that for everybody  people who aren't fantastic Yo Yo Mas or Princes  So  we've made a whole series of instruments. One of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera. It's a whole orchestra of about     instruments  all designed for anybody to play using natural skill. So  you can play a video game  drive through a piece of music  use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound  touch a special surface to make melodies  use your voice to make a whole aura. And when we make the Brain Opera  we invite the public to come in  to try these instruments and then collaborate with us to help make each performance of the Brain Opera. We toured that for a long time. It is now permanently in Vienna  where we built a museum around it. And that led to something which you probably do know. Guitar Hero came out of our lab  and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface  people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music  and playing it over and over and over again. So  the model works  but it's only the tip of the iceberg  because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want to make music in something like Guitar Hero. And music is very fun  but it's also transformative. It's very  very important. Music can change your life  more than almost anything. It can change the way you communicate with others  it can change your body  it can change your mind. So  we're trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero. We are very involved in education. We have a long term project called Toy Symphony  where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive  but for little kids  so the kids will fall in love with making music  want to spend their time doing it  and then will demand to know how it works  how to make more  how to create. So  we make squeezy instruments  like these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers  Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms    they gather your rhythm  and like hot potato  you send your rhythm to your friends  who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing    and a software package called Hyperscore  which lets anybody use lines and color to make quite sophisticated music. Extremely easy to use  but once you use it  you can go quite deep    music in any style. And then  by pressing a button  it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces. We've had good enough  really  very powerful effects with kids around the world  and now people of all ages  using Hyperscore. So  we've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activities in a much broader context  for all kinds of people who don't usually have the opportunity to make music. So  one of the growing fields that we're working on at the Media Lab right now is music  mind and health. A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called  Musicophilia . It's on sale in the bookstore. It's a great book. If you haven't seen it  it's worth reading. He's a pianist himself  and he details his whole career of looking at and observing incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples' lives in unusual situations. So we know  for instance  that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to. Maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones  you can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror  or can't tell anyone in their family  but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing. And with that you can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities. Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes  movement to people with Parkinson's disease. It's very powerful for depression  schizophrenia  many  many things. So  we're working on understanding those underlying principles and then building activities which will let music really improve people's health. And we do this in many ways. We work with many different hospitals. One of them is right near Boston  called Tewksbury Hospital. It's a long term state hospital  where several years ago we started working with Hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities. This has become a central part of the treatment at Tewksbury hospital  so everybody there clamors to work on musical activities. It's the activity that seems to accelerate people's treatment the most and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community. I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on. Video  They're manipulating each other's rhythms. It's a real experience  not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms  but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group. To get their hands on music  to shape it themselves  change it  to experiment with it  to make their own music. So Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly. Everybody can experience music in a profound way  we just have to make different tools. The third idea I want to share with you is that music  paradoxically  I think even more than words  is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are. I love giving talks  although strangely I feel more nervous giving talks than playing music. If I were here playing cello  or playing on a synth  or sharing my music with you  I'd be able to show things about myself that I can't tell you in words  more personal things  perhaps deeper things. I think that's true for many of us  and I want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have  from ourselves to the outside world. The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now  called Death and the Powers. And it's a big opera  one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now. And it's about a man  rich  successful  powerful  who wants to live forever. So  he figures out a way to download himself into his environment  actually into a series of books. So this guy wants to live forever  he downloads himself into his environment. The main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera and the entire stage becomes the main character. It becomes his legacy. And the opera is about what we can share  what we can pass on to others  to the people we love  and what we can't. Every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument  like this chandelier. It takes up the whole stage. It looks like a chandelier  but it's actually a robotic music instrument. So  as you can see in this prototype  gigantic piano strings  each string is controlled with a little robotic element    either little bows that stroke the strings  propellers that tickle the strings  acoustic signals that vibrate the strings. We also have an army of robots on stage. These robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character  Simon Powers  and his family. There are a whole series of them  kind of like a Greek chorus. They observe the action. We've designed these square robots that we're testing right now at MIT called OperaBots. These OperaBots follow my music. They follow the characters. They're smart enough  we hope  not to bump into each other. They go off on their own. And then they can also  when you snap  line up exactly the way you'd like to. Even though they're cubes  they actually have a lot of personality. The largest set piece in the opera is called The System. It's a series of books. Every single book is robotic  so they all move  they all make sound  and when you put them all together  they turn into these walls  which have the gesture and the personality of Simon Powers. So he's disappeared  but the whole physical environment becomes this person. This is how he's chosen to represent himself. The books also have high packed LEDs on the spines. So it's all display. And here's the great baritone James Maddalena as he enters The System. This is a sneak preview. This premieres in Monaco    it's in September     . If by any chance you can't make it  another idea with this project    here's this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form  through music and through the environment. But we're also making this available both online and in public spaces  as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love. So instead of being grand opera  this opera will turn into what we're thinking of as personal opera. And  if you're going to make a personal opera  what about a personal instrument  Everything I've shown you so far    whether it's a hyper cello for Yo Yo Ma or squeezy toy for a child    the instruments stayed the same and are valuable for a certain class of person  a virtuoso  a child. But what if I could make an instrument that could be adapted to the way I personally behave  to the way my hands work  to what I do very skillfully  perhaps  to what I don't do so skillfully  I think that this is the future of interface  it's the future of music  the future of instruments. And I'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage  so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like. So  can you give a hand to Adam Boulanger  Ph.D. student from the MIT Media Lab  and Dan Ellsey. Dan  thanks to TED and to Bombardier Flexjet  Dan is here with us today all the way from Tewksbury. He's a resident at Tewksbury Hospital. This is by far the farthest he's strayed from Tewksbury Hospital  I can tell you that  because he's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music. So  first of all  Dan  do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are  Dan Ellsey  Hello. My name is Dan Ellsey. I am    years old and I have cerebral palsy. I have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software. Tod Machover  And we're really excited to have you here  really Dan.  Applause  So we met Dan about three years ago  three and a half years ago  when we started working at Tewksbury. Everybody we met there was fantastic  did fantastic music. Dan had never made music before  and it turned out he was really fantastic at it. He's a born composer. He's very shy  too. So  turned out he's a fantastic composer  and over the last few years has been a constant collaborator of ours. He has made many  many pieces. He makes his own CDs. Actually  he is quite well known in the Boston area    mentors people at the hospital and children  locally  in how to make their own music. And I'll let Adam tell you. So  Adam is a Ph.D. student at MIT  an expert in music technology and medicine. And Adam and Dan have become close collaborators. What Adam's been working on for this last period is not only how to have Dan be able easily to make his own pieces  but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument. So  you want to say a little bit about how you guys work  Adam Boulanger  Yes. So  Tod and I entered into a discussion following the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressive person  and he's an intelligent and creative person. And it's in his face  it's in his breathing  it's in his eyes. How come he can't perform one of his pieces of music  That's our responsibility  and it doesn't make sense. So we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance  with precision  with control  and despite his physical disability  to be able to do that  to be able to perform his piece of music. So  the process and the technology    basically  first we needed an engineering solution. So  you know  we have a FireWire camera  it looked at an infrared pointer. We went with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan was already used to with his speaking controller. And this was actually the least interesting part of the work  you know  the design process. We needed an input  we needed continuous tracking  in the software  we look at the types of shapes he's making. But  then was the really interesting aspect of the work  following the engineering part  where  basically  we're coding over Dan's shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out  you know  how does Dan move  What's useful to him as an expressive motion  You know  what's his metaphor for performance  What types of things does he find important to control and convey in a piece of music  So all the parameter fitting  and really the technology was stretched at that point to fit just Dan. And  you know  I think this is a perspective shift. It's not that our technologies    they provide access  they allow us to create pieces of creative work. But what about expression  What about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work  You know  do our technologies allow us to express  Do they provide structure for us to do that  And  you know  that's a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere. So  you know  with Dan  we needed a new design process  a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform. And so that's what we'll do today. TM  So let's do it. So Dan do you want to tell everyone about what you're going to play now  DE  This is  My Eagle Song.  TM  So Dan is going to play a piece of his  called  My Eagle Song . In fact  this is the score for Dan's piece  completely composed by Dan in Hyperscore. So he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into Hyperscore. He's incredibly fast at it  too  faster than I am  in fact. TM  He's really modest  too. So he can go in Hyperscore. You start out by making melodies and rhythms. He can place those exactly where he wants. Each one gets a color. He goes back into the composition window  draws the lines  places everything the way he wants to. Looking at the Hyperscore  you can see it also  you can see where the sections are  something might continue for a while  change  get really crazy and then end up with a big bang at the end. So that's the way he made his piece  and as Adam says  we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece. It's going to be looked at by this camera  analyze his movements  it's going to let Dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to. And you're also going to notice a visual on the screen. We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring. But instead of making it very literal  showing you exactly the camera tracing  we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement  and shows the way it's being analyzed. I think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from what Dan's doing  but I think it will also show you  if you look at that movement  that when Dan makes music  his motions are very purposeful  very precise  very disciplined and they're also very beautiful. So  in hearing this piece  as I mentioned before  the most important thing is the music's great  and it'll show you who Dan is. So  are we ready Adam  AB  Yeah. TM  OK  now Dan will play his piece  My Eagle Song  for you. TM  Bravo. One of the problems of writing  and working  and looking at the Internet is that it's very hard to separate fashion from deep change. And so  to start helping that  I want to take us back to     . In       James Gordon Bennett founded the first mass circulation newspaper in New York City. And it cost about     dollars to start it  which was about the equivalent of        dollars of today. By    years later  by       doing the same thing    starting what was experienced as a mass  circulation daily paper    would come to cost two and a half million dollars.         two and a half million     years. That's the critical change that is being inverted by the Net. And that's what I want to talk about today  and how that relates to the emergence of social production. Starting with newspapers  what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement for making information  knowledge and culture  which led to a stark bifurcation between producers    who had to be able to raise financial capital  just like any other industrial organization    and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could produce. Now  the term  information society    information economy   for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after the industrial revolution. But in fact  for purposes of understanding what's happening today  that's wrong. Because for     years  we've had an information economy. It's just been industrial  which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money to pay those two and a half million dollars  and later  more for the telegraph  and the radio transmitter  and the television  and eventually the mainframe. And that meant they were market based  or they were government owned  depending on what kind of system they were in. And this characterized and anchored the way information and knowledge were produced for the next     years. Now  let me tell you a different story. Around June       the world of supercomputers had a bombshell. The Japanese had  for the first time  created the fastest supercomputer    the NEC Earth Simulator    taking the primary from the U.S.  and about two years later    this  by the way  is measuring the trillion floating point operations per second that the computer's capable of running    sigh of relief  IBM  Blue Gene  has just edged ahead of the NEC Earth Simulator. All of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period  there's another supercomputer running in the world    SETI home. Four and a half million users around the world  contributing their leftover computer cycles  whenever their computer isn't working  by running a screen saver  and together sharing their resources to create a massive supercomputer that NASA harnesses to analyze the data coming from radio telescopes. What this picture suggests to us is that we've got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized. Not that it's become less capital intensive    that there's less money that's required    but that the ownership of this capital  the way the capitalization happens  is radically distributed. Each of us  in these advanced economies  has one of these  or something rather like it    a computer. They're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network. And computation  storage and communications capacity are in the hands of practically every connected person    and these are the basic physical capital means necessary for producing information  knowledge and culture  in the hands of something like     million to a billion people around the planet. What this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution  the most important means  the most important components of the core economic activities    remember  we are in an information economy    of the most advanced economies  and there more than anywhere else  are in the hands of the population at large. This is completely different than what we've seen since the industrial revolution. So we've got communications and computation capacity in the hands of the entire population  and we've got human creativity  human wisdom  human experience    the other major experience  the other major input    which unlike simple labor    stand here turning this lever all day long    is not something that's the same or fungible among people. Any one of you who has taken someone else's job  or tried to give yours to someone else  no matter how detailed the manual  you cannot transmit what you know  what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances. In that we're unique  and each of us holds this critical input into production as we hold this machine. What's the effect of this  So  the story that most people know is the story of free or open source software. This is market share of Apache Web server    one of the critical applications in Web based communications. In       two groups of people said   Wow  this is really important  the Web  We need a much better Web server   One was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided  you know  we really need this  we should write one  and what are we going to do with what    well  we're gonna share it  And other people will be able to develop it. The other was Microsoft. Now  if I told you that    years later  the motley crew of people  who didn't control anything that they produced  acquired    percent of the market and was the red line  it would be amazing  Right  Think of it in minivans. A group of automobile engineers on their weekends are competing with Toyota. Right  But  in fact  of course  the story is it's the    percent  including the major e commerce site       percent of a critical application on which Web based communications and applications work is produced in this form  in direct competition with Microsoft. Not in a side issue    in a central strategic decision to try to capture a component of the Net. Software has done this in a way that's been very visible  because it's measurable. But the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the Web. So  NASA  at some point  did an experiment where they took images of Mars that they were mapping  and they said  instead of having three or four fully trained Ph.D.s doing this all the time  let's break it up into small components  put it up on the Web  and see if people  using a very simple interface  will actually spend five minutes here     minutes there  clicking. After six months         people used this to generate mapping at a faster rate than the images were coming in  which was  quote   practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully trained Ph.D.   once you showed it to a number of people and computed the average. Now  if you have a little girl  and she goes and writes to    well  not so little  medium little    tries to do research on Barbie. And she'll come to Encarta  one of the main online encyclopedias. This is what you'll find out about Barbie. This is it  there's nothing more to the definition  including   manufacturers     plural     now more commonly produce ethnically diverse dolls  like this black Barbie.  Which is vastly better than what you'll find in the encyclopedia.com  which is Barbie  Klaus.  Laughter  On the other hand  if they go to Wikipedia  they'll find a genuine article    and I won't talk a lot about Wikipedia  because Jimmy Wales is here    but roughly equivalent to what you would find in the Britannica  differently written  including the controversies over body image and commercialization  the claims about the way in which she's a good role model  etc. Another portion is not only how content is produced  but how relevance is produced. The claim to fame of Yahoo  was  we hire people to look    originally  not anymore    we hire people to look at websites and tell you    if they're in the index  they're good. This  on the other hand  is what        passionate volunteers produce in the Open Directory Project  each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about  to say  this is good. So  this is the Open Directory Project  with        volunteers  each one spending a little bit of time  as opposed to a few hundred fully paid employees. No one owns it  no one owns the output  it's free for anyone to use and it's the output of people acting out of social and psychological motivations to do something interesting. This is not only outside of businesses. When you think of what is the critical innovation of Google  the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing    the decision about what's relevant    to the community of the Web as a whole  doing whatever they want to do  so  page rank. The critical innovation here is instead of our engineers  or our people saying which is the most relevant  we're going to go out and count what you  people out there on the Web  for whatever reason    vanity  pleasure    produced links  and tied to each other. We're going to count those  and count them up. And again  here  you see Barbie.com  but also  very quickly  Adiosbarbie.com  the body image for every size. A contested cultural object  which you won't find anywhere soon on Overture  which is the classic market based mechanism  whoever pays the most is highest on the list. So  all of that is in the creation of content  of relevance  basic human expression. But remember  the computers were also physical. Just physical materials    our PCs    we share them together. We also see this in wireless. It used to be wireless was one person owned the license  they transmitted in an area  and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property. What we're seeing now is that computers and radios are becoming so sophisticated that we're developing algorithms to let people own machines  like Wi Fi devices  and overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this to build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle  When I'm listening  when I'm not using  I can help you transfer your messages  and when you're not using  you'll help me transfer yours. And this is not an idealized version. These are working models that at least in some places in the United States are being implemented  at least for public security. If in      I told you  let's build a data storage and retrieval system. It's got to store terabytes. It's got to be available    hours a day  seven days a week. It's got to be available from anywhere in the world. It has to support over     million users at any given moment. It's got to be robust to attack  including closing the main index  injecting malicious files  armed seizure of some major nodes. You'd say that would take years. It would take millions. But of course  what I'm describing is P P file sharing. Right  We always think of it as stealing music  but fundamentally  it's a distributed data storage and retrieval system  where people  for very obvious reasons  are willing to share their bandwidth and their storage to create something. So  essentially what we're seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactional framework. It used to be that there were two primary dimensions along which you could divide things. They could be market based  or non market based  they could be decentralized  or centralized. The price system was a market based and decentralized system. If things worked better because you actually had somebody organizing them  you had firms  if you wanted to be in the market    or you had governments or sometimes larger non profits in the non market. It was too expensive to have decentralized social production  to have decentralized action in society. That was not about society itself. That was  in fact  economic. But what we're seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange. Not that it's the first time that we do nice things to each other  or for each other  as social beings. We do it all the time. It's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact. What characterizes them is decentralized authority. You don't have to ask permission  as you do in a property based system. May I do this  It's open for anyone to create and innovate and share  if they want to  by themselves or with others  because property is one mechanism of coordination. But it's not the only one. Instead  what we see are social frameworks for all of the critical things that we use property and contract in the market  information flows to decide what are interesting problems  who's available and good for something  motivation structures    remember  money isn't always the best motivator. If you leave a     check after dinner with friends  you don't increase the probability of being invited back. And if dinner isn't entirely obvious  think of sex.  Laughter  It also requires certain new organizational approaches. And in particular  what we've seen is task organization. You have to hire people who know what they're doing. You have to hire them to spend a lot of time. Now  take the same problem  chunk it into little modules  and motivations become trivial. Five minutes  instead of watching TV  Five minutes I'll spend just because it's interesting. Just because it's fun. Just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning  or  in places that are more involved  like Wikipedia  gives me a certain set of social relations. So  a new social phenomenon is emerging. It's creating  and it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition. Peer to peer networks assaulting the recording industry  free and open source software taking market share from Microsoft  Skype potentially threatening traditional telecoms  Wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias. But it's also a new source of opportunities for businesses. As you see a new set of social relations and behaviors emerging  you have new opportunities. Some of them are toolmakers. Instead of building well behaved appliances    things that you know what they'll do in advance    you begin to build more open tools. There's a new set of values  a new set of things people value. You build platforms for self expression and collaboration. Like Wikipedia  like the Open Directory Project  you're beginning to build platforms  and you see that as a model. And you see surfers  people who see this happening  and in some sense build it into a supply chain  which is a very curious one. Right  You have a belief  stuff will flow out of connected human beings. That'll give me something I can use  and I'm going to contract with someone. I will deliver something based on what happens. It's very scary    that's what Google does  essentially. That's what IBM does in software services  and they've done reasonably well. So  social production is a real fact  not a fad. It is the critical long term shift caused by the Internet. Social relations and exchange become significantly more important than they ever were as an economic phenomenon. In some contexts  it's even more efficient because of the quality of the information  the ability to find the best person  the lower transaction costs. It's sustainable and growing fast. But    and this is the dark lining    it is threatened by    in the same way that it threatens    the incumbent industrial systems. So next time you open the paper  and you see an intellectual property decision  a telecoms decision  it's not about something small and technical. It is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other  and the way information  knowledge and culture will be produced. Because it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be for the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes  or for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model  and change the way we begin to see the world and report what it is that we see. Thank you. It is interesting that in the United States  the most significant health care budget goes to cardiovascular disease care  whether it's private or public. There's no comparison at all. In Africa    where it is a major killer    it is totally ignored. And that situation cannot be right. We must do something about it. A health status of a nation parallels development of that nation.    million people die every year from heart disease.    million heart attacks and strokes occur. Most of this is in developing countries  and the majority is in Africa.    percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease is in developing countries    not in the West    and yet    percent of the resources are in the West. Who is at risk  People like you. It's not just the Africans that should be concerned about that. All friends of Africa  that will have reason to be in Africa at some point in time  should be very concerned about this deplorable situation. Has anyone here wondered what will happen if you go back to your room at night  and you start getting chest pains  shortness of breath  sweating  You're having a heart attack. What are you going to do  Will you fly back to the U.S.  Germany  Europe  No  you will die.    percent will die within    hours  if not treated. This is what's going on. In a look at the map of the U.S.    the graph here     million people here     million here. By the time you get to     it's almost no one left in Nigeria    life expectancy is   . It's not because some people don't survive childhood illnesses    they do    but they do not survive after the time that they reach about    years old and    years old. And those are the times they're most productive. Those are the times that they should be contributing to Africa's development. But they're not there. The best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents. If you cannot secure the parents  you cannot guarantee the security of the African child. What are the risk factors  It's very well known. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on those. These are just for information  hypertension  diabetes  obesity  lack of exercise. The usual suspects. Right here in Tanzania     percent of individuals have hypertension.    percent are getting treated. Only less than one percent are adequately treated. If we can treat hypertension alone in Africa  we'll save         lives a year. That's quite significant  Easy to treat. Look at the situation in Mauritius. In eight short years    we're here talking about HIV  malaria  which is all good. We cannot make the mistakes we've made with malaria and HIV. In eight short years  non communicable diseases will become the leading causes of death in Africa. That is something to keep in mind. We can't deal with it with situations like this. This is a typical African hospital. We can't depend on the elites    they go to USA  Germany  U.K. for treatment. Unbelievable. You can't depend on foreign aid alone. Here is the situation  countries are turning inwards. Post        the  United States has had a lot of trouble to deal with  their own internal issues. So  they spend their money trying to fix those problems. You can't rightly    it's not their responsibility  it is my responsibility. I have to take care of my own problems. If they help  that's good  But that is not my expectation. These worsening indices of health care or health studies in Africa demand a new look. We cannot keep on doing things the way we've always done them. If they have not worked  we have to look for alternative solutions. I'm here to talk to you about solutions. This has been    what has been a difficult sign to some of us. Several years ago  we started thinking about it. Everyone knows the problem. No one knows what the solutions are. We decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is. Everyone is ready to throw in money  in terms of free money aid to developing countries. Talk about sustainable investment  no one is interested. You can't raise money. I have done businesses in healthcare in the United States    I live in Nashville  Tennessee  health care capital of America.  It's  very easy to raise money for health care ventures. But start telling them  you know  we're going to try to do it in Nigeria    everyone runs away. That is totally wrong. Those of you in the audience here  if you want to help Africa  invest money in sustainable development. Let me lead you through a day in the life of the Heart Institute  so you get a glimpse of what we do  and I'll talk a little bit more about it. What we have done is to show that high quality health care  comparable to the best anywhere in the world  can be done in a developing country environment. We have    positions right now    all of them trained  board certified in the USA  Canada or Britain. We have every modality that can be done in Vanderbilt  Cleveland Clinic    everywhere in the U.S.    and we do it for about    percent of the cost that you will need to do those things in the United States. Additionally  we have a policy that no one is ever turned away because of ability to pay. We take care of everyone. Whether you have one dollar  two dollars    it doesn't matter. And I will tell you how we're able to do it. We make sure that we select our equipment properly. We go for modular units. Units that have multi modality functions have modular components. Easy to repair  and because of that  we do not take things that are not durable and cannot last. We emphasize training  and we make sure that this process is regenerative. Very soon we will all be dead and gone  but the problems will stay  unless we have people taking over from where we stopped. We made sure that we produced some things ourselves. We do not buy unit doses of radiopharmaceuticals. We get the generators from the companies. We manufacture them in house  ourselves. That keeps the costs down. So  for a radiopharmaceutical in the U.S.    that you'll get a unit dose for     dollars    when we're finished manufacturing it in house  we come at a price of about two dollars. We recognize that the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor countries is through education and technology. All these problems we're talking about    if we bring development  they will all disappear. Technology is a great equalizer. How do we make it work  It's been proved  self care is cost effective. It extends opportunity to the rural centers  and we can use expertise in a very smart way. This is the way our centers are set up. We currently have three locations in the Caribbean  and we're planning a fourth one. And we have now decided to go into Africa. We will be doing the West African Heart Institute in Port Harcourt  Nigeria. That project will be starting within the next few months. We hope to open in        . And we will do other centers. This model can be adapted to every disease process. All the units  all the centers  are linked through a switched hub to a central server  and all the images are populated to review stations. And we designed this telemedicine solution. It's proprietary to us  and we are happy to share what we have learned with anyone who is interested in doing it. You can still be profitable. We make sure that the telemedicine platform gives access to expert medical specialists anywhere in the world  just by a click of the button. I'll lead you through  to see how this happens. This is at the Heart Institute. The doctors from anywhere can log in. I can call you in Switzerland and say   Listen  go into our system. Look at Mrs. Jones. Look at the study  tell me what you think.  They'll give me that information  and we'll make the care of the patient better. The patient doesn't have to travel. He doesn't have to experience the anxiety of not knowing because of limited expertise. We also use  an  electronic medical record system. I'm happy to say that the things we have implemented       percent of U.S. practices do not have them  and yet the technology is there. But you know  they have that luxury. Because if you can't get it in Nashville  you can travel to Birmingham  two hours away  and you'll get it. If you can't get it in Cleveland  you can go to Cincinnati. We don't have that luxury  so we have to make it happen. When we do it  we will put the cost of care down. And we'll extend it to the rural centers and make it affordable. And everyone will get the care they deserve. It cannot just be technology  we recognize that. Prevention must be part of the solution    we emphasize that. But  you know  you have to tell people what can be done. It's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive  and they go home and can't do it. They need to be alive  they need to feed. We recommend exercise as the most effective  simple  easy thing to do. We have had walks every year    every March  April. We form people into groups and make them go into challenges. Which group loses the most weight  we give them prizes. Which groups record more walking distance by pedometer  we give them prizes. We do this constantly. We encourage them to bring children. That way we start exposing the children from very early on  on what these issues are. Because once they learn it  they will stay with it. In doing this we have created at least     skilled jobs in Jamaica alone  and these are physicians with expertise and special training. We have taken care of over       indigent patients that could have died  including four free pacemakers in patients with complete heart block. For those that understand cardiology  complete heart block means certain death. If you don't get this pacemaker  you will be dead. So we are pleased with that. Indirectly  we have saved the government of Jamaica five million dollars from people that would have gone to Miami or Atlanta for care. And we've hopefully saved a lot of lives. By the end of this year  we would have contributed over one million dollars in indigent care. In the first four months  it's been         dollars  averaging        dollars a month. The government will not do that  because they have competing needs. They need to put resources elsewhere. But we can still do it. People say   How can you do that   This is how we can do that. At least       rich Jamaicans that were heading to Miami for treatment have self confessed that they did not go to Miami because of the Heart Institute of the Caribbean. And  if they went to Miami  they will spend significantly more    eight to    times more. And they feel happy spending it at home  getting the same quality of care. And for that money    for every one patient that has the money to pay  it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people that do not have the resources to pay. For this to work  this progress must be sustainable. So  we emphasize training. Training is critical. We have gone further  we have formed a relationship with the University of Technology  Jamaica  where I now have an appointment. And we are starting a biomedical engineering program  so that we will train people locally  who can repair that equipment. That way we're not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues. We're also starting ancillary health care technology training programs    training people in echocardiography  cardiac ultrasound  those kinds of things. Now  with that kind of training  it gives people motivation. Because now they will get a bachelors degree in medical imaging and all that kind of stuff. In the process  I want you to just hear from the trainees themselves what it has meant for them. I'm a senior resident in anesthesia in intensive care at the University Hospital of the West Indies. I came to the Heart Institute in       as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program. I spent three months at the Heart Institute. There's been no doubt around my colleagues about the utility of the training I received here  and I think there's been an increased interest now in    particularly in echocardiography and its use in our setting. Sharon Lazarus  I am an echocardiographer at the Heart Institute of the Caribbean  since the past two years. I received training at this institution. I think this aspect of training in cardiology that the Heart Institute of the Caribbean has introduced in Jamaica is very important in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases. Ernest Madu  The lesson in this is that it can be done  and it can be sustained  and you can make it possible for everyone. Who are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care  When have you been appointed to play God  It is not my decision. My job is to make sure that every person  no matter what fate has assigned to you  will have the opportunity to get the best quality health care in life. Next stop is West African Heart Institute  that we are going to be doing in Port Harcourt  Nigeria  as I said before. We will do other centers across West Africa. We will extend the same system into other areas  like dialysis treatment. And anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation  we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we've done it  and how you can do it. If we do this  we can change the face of health care in Africa. Africa has been good to us  it is time for us to give back to Africa. I am going. Those who want to come  I welcome you to come along with me. Thank you. The Value of Nothing  Out of Nothing Comes Something. That was an essay I wrote when I was    years old and I got a B .  Laughter  What I'm going to talk about  nothing out of something  and how we create. And I'm gonna try and do that within the    minute time span that we were told to stay within  and to follow the TED commandments  that is  actually  something that creates a near death experience  but near death is good for creativity. So  I also want to explain  because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me if I said anything that was a lie  or not true to universal creativity. And I've done it this way for half the audience  who is scientific. When I say we  I don't mean you  necessarily  I mean me  and my right brain  my left brain and the one that's in between that is the censor and tells me what I'm saying is wrong. And I'm going do that also by looking at what I think is part of my creative process  which includes a number of things that happened  actually    the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which I'm creating something new. And that includes nature  and nurture  and what I refer to as nightmares. Now in the nature area  we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something  perhaps in our brains  some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse like effect. And some people would say that we're born with it in some other means. And others  like my mother  would say that I get my material from past lives. Some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk    van Gogh syndrome    that you have a little bit of  you know  psychosis  or depression. I do have to say  somebody    I read recently that van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic  that he might have had temporal lobe seizures  and that might have caused his spurt of creativity  and I don't    I suppose it does something in some part of your brain. And I will mention that I actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago  but it was during the time I was writing my last book  and some people say that book is quite different. I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis  you know  who am I  why am I this particular person  why am I not black like everybody else  And sometimes you're equipped with skills  but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity. I used to draw. I thought I would be an artist. And I had a miniature poodle. And it wasn't bad  but it wasn't really creative. Because all I could really do was represent in a very one on one way. And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book. And then  I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be  and you know  you look at those scores  and it wasn't bad  but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words. Also  one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma. And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had  and that is that  you know  I had expectations placed on me. That figure right there  by the way  figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old  and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age. I have some ones that were long lasting  from the age of five to     this was supposed to be my side occupation  and it led to a sense of failure. But actually  there was something quite real in my life that happened when I was about   . And it was discovered that my brother  in       and then my father  six months later  had brain tumors. And my mother believed that something had gone wrong  and she was gonna find out what it was  and she was gonna fix it. My father was a Baptist minister  and he believed in miracles  and that God's will would take care of that. But  of course  they ended up dying  six months apart. And after that  my mother believed that it was fate  or curses    she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened. Everything except randomness. She did not believe in randomness. There was a reason for everything. And one of the reasons  she thought  was that her mother  who had died when she was very young  was angry at her. And so  I had this notion of death all around me  because my mother also believed that I would be next  and she would be next. And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon  you begin to think very much about everything. You become very creative  in a survival sense. And this  then  led to my big questions. And they're the same ones that I have today. And they are  why do things happen  and how do things happen  And the one my mother asked  how do I make things happen  It's a wonderful way to look at these questions  when you write a story. Because  after all  in that framework  between page one and      you have to answer this question of why things happen  how things happen  in what order they happen. What are the influences  How do I  as the narrator  as the writer  also influence that  And it's also one that  I think  many of our scientists have been asking. It's a kind of cosmology  and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe  as the creator of that universe. And you see  there's a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen  trying to figure it out    years and years  oftentimes. So  when I look at creativity  I also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress  my looking at associations in practically anything in life. And I got a lot of them during what's been going on throughout this conference  almost everything that's been going on. And so I'm going to use  as the metaphor  this association  quantum mechanics  which I really don't understand  but I'm still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor. So  in quantum mechanics  of course  you have dark energy and dark matter. And it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen. There's a lot of unknown  and you often don't know what it is except by its absence. But when you make those associations  you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story  and what you're finding is what matters. The meaning. And that's what I look for in my work  a personal meaning. There is also the uncertainty principle  which is part of quantum mechanics  as I understand it.  Laughter  And this happens constantly in the writing. And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect  in which you're looking for something  and you know  things are happening simultaneously  and you're looking at it in a different way  and you're trying to really look for the about ness  or what is this story about. And if you try too hard  then you will only write the about. You won't discover anything. And what you were supposed to find  what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way  is no longer there. Now  I don't want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe  like many of our scientists have. And so  I am going to just throw in string theory here  and just say that creative people are multidimensional  and there are    levels  I think  of anxiety. There is also a big question of ambiguity. And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant. And you don't know what is operating  but something is operating there. And ambiguity  to me  is very uncomfortable in my life  and I have it. Moral ambiguity. It is constantly there. And  just as an example  this is one that recently came to me. It was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq. And she said   Save a man from drowning  you are responsible to him for life.  A very famous Chinese saying  she said. And that means because we went into Iraq  we should stay there until things were solved. You know  maybe even     years. So  there was another one that I came across  and it's  saving fish from drowning.  And it's what Buddhist fishermen say  because they're not supposed to kill anything. And they also have to make a living  and people need to be fed. So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning  and unfortunately  in the process the fish die. Now  what's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors    actually  one of them is my mother's interpretation  and it is a famous Chinese saying  because she said it to me   save a man from drowning  you are responsible to him for life.  And it was a warning    don't get involved in other people's business  or you're going to get stuck. OK. I think if somebody really was drowning  she'd save them. But  both of these sayings    saving a fish from drowning  or saving a man from drowning    to me they had to do with intentions. And all of us in life  when we see a situation  we have a response. And then we have intentions. There's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do  and then we do something. And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been. Maybe things go wrong. And so  after that  what are our responsibilities  What are we supposed to do  Do we stay in for life  or do we do something else and justify and say  well  my intentions were good  and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it  That is the ambiguity in my life that really disturbed me  and led me to write a book called  Saving Fish From Drowning.  I saw examples of that. Once I identified this question  it was all over the place. I got these hints everywhere. And then  in a way  I knew that they had always been there. And then writing  that's what happens. I get these hints  these clues  and I realize that they've been obvious  and yet they have not been. And what I need  in effect  is a focus. And when I have the question  it is a focus. And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question  and what happens is those particular things become relevant. And it seems like it's happening all the time. You think there's a sort of coincidence going on  a serendipity  in which you're getting all this help from the universe. And it may also be explained that now you have a focus. And you are noticing it more often. But you apply this. You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions. Your brother  who's fallen in trouble  do you take care of him  Why or why not  It may be something that is perhaps more serious    as I said  human rights in Burma. I was thinking that I shouldn't go because somebody said  if I did  it would show that I approved of the military regime there. And then  after a while  I had to ask myself   Why do we take on knowledge  why do we take on assumptions that other people have given us   And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up  and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father  who was a Baptist minister. So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions  and still didn't know that if I went there  what the result of that would be  if I wrote a book    and I just would have to face that later  when the time came. We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of. We come to this point and say  what do I as an individual do  Not all of us can go to Africa  or work at hospitals  so what do we do  if we have this moral response  this feeling  Also  I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at  and we talked about today  is genocide. This leads to this question. When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable  and I consider what my intentions should be  I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child    and why am I here  and what is the meaning of my life  and what is my place in the universe  It seems so obvious  and yet it is not. We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense  and yet it is also absolutely necessary. In writing a story  it is the place where I begin. Sometimes I get help from the universe  it seems. My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book  because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know. Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally  from an overdose of opium  while having too much of a good time  I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself  and that actually was the way it happened. And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother. There are also things  quite uncanny  which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book. In this case  I was writing a story that included some kind of detail  period of history  a certain location. And I needed to find something historically that would match that. And I took down this book  and I    first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting  and the time period  and the kind of character I needed    was the Taiping rebellion  happening in the area near Guilin  outside of that  and a character who thought he was the son of God. You wonder  are these things random chance  Well  what is random  What is chance  What is luck  What are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain  And that goes into the story  too. These are the things I constantly think about from day to day. Especially when good things happen  and  in particular  when bad things happen. But I do think there's a kind of serendipity  and I do want to know what those elements are  so I can thank them  and also try to find them in my life. Because  again  I think that when I am aware of them  more of them happen. Another chance encounter is when I went to a place    I just was with some friends  and we drove randomly to a different place  and we ended up in this non tourist location  a beautiful village  pristine. And we walked three valleys beyond  and the third valley  there was something quite mysterious and ominous  a discomfort I felt. And then I knew that had to be  the  setting of my book. And in writing one of the scenes  it happened in that third valley. For some reason I wrote about cairns    stacks of rocks    that a man was building. And I didn't know exactly why I had it  but it was so vivid. I got stuck  and a friend  when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs  that I said  sure. And about    minutes later  walking along the beach  I came across this. And it was a man  a Chinese man  and he was stacking these things  not with glue  not with anything. And I asked him   How is it possible to do this   And he said   Well  I guess with everything in life  there's a place of balance.  And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point. I had so many examples    I have so many instances like this  when I'm writing a story  and I cannot explain it. Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things  Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain  like the cosmological constant  A big thing that I also think about is accidents. And as I said  my mother did not believe in randomness. What is the nature of accidents  And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are  outside of a court of law  I was able to see that in a firsthand way  when I went to beautiful Dong village  in Guizhou  the poorest province of China. And I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to come back. And I had a chance to do that  when National Geographic asked me if I wanted to write anything about China. And I said yes  about this village of singing people  singing minority. And they agreed  and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went  there was a terrible accident. A man  an old man  fell asleep  and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm.    homes were destroyed  and    were damaged. Responsibility was assigned to the family. The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away  in a cowshed. And  of course  as Westerners  we say   Well  it was an accident. That's not fair. It's the son  not the father.  When I go on a story  I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs. It takes a while  but I have to let go of them and just go there  and be there. And so I was there on three occasions  different seasons. And I began to sense something different about the history  and what had happened before  and the nature of life in a very poor village  and what you find as your joys  and your rituals  your traditions  your links with other families. And I saw how this had a kind of justice  in its responsibility. I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using  a ceremony they hadn't used in about    years. And it was to send some men    a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses. Now you  as Westerners  and I  as Westerners  would say well  that's superstition. But after being there for a while  and seeing the amazing things that happened  you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world  determining how things happen. So I remained with them  and the more I wrote that story  the more I got into those beliefs  and I think that's important for me    to take on the beliefs  because that is where the story is real  and that is where I'm gonna find the answers to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life. Years go by  of course  and the writing  it doesn't happen instantly  as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED. The book comes and it goes. When it arrives  it is no longer my book. It is in the hands of readers  and they interpret it differently. But I go back to this question of  how do I create something out of nothing  And how do I create my own life  And I think it is by questioning  and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths. I believe in specifics  the specifics of story  and the past  the specifics of that past  and what is happening in the story at that point. I also believe that in thinking about things    my thinking about luck  and fate  and coincidences and accidents  God's will  and the synchrony of mysterious forces    I will come to some notion of what that is  how we create. I have to think of my role. Where I am in the universe  and did somebody intend for me to be that way  or is it just something I came up with  And I also can find that by imagining fully  and becoming what is imagined    and yet is in that real world  the fictional world. And that is how I find particles of truth  not the absolute truth  or the whole truth. And they have to be in all possibilities  including those I never considered before. So  there are never complete answers. Or rather  if there is an answer  it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything  and that is good  because then I will discover something new. And if there is a partial answer  a more complete answer from me  it is to simply imagine. And to imagine is to put myself in that story  until there was only    there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating. And that's how I've discovered that if I feel what is in the story    in one story    then I come the closest  I think  to knowing what compassion is  to feeling that compassion. Because for everything  in that question of how things happen  it has to do with the feeling. I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that. We've come to the end of the talk  and I will reveal what is in the bag  and it is the muse  and it is the things that transform in our lives  that are wonderful and stay with us. There she is. Thank you very much  In the year       a virtually unknown German mathematician  named Theodor Kaluza suggested a very bold and  in some ways  a very bizarre idea. He proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aware of. That is in addition to left  right  back  forth and up  down  Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don't yet see. Now  when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea  sometimes that's all it is    bold and bizarre  but it has nothing to do with the world around us. This particular idea  however    although we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong  and at the end I'll discuss experiments which  in the next few years  may tell us whether it's right or wrong    this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting edge research. So  I'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions. So where do we go  To begin we need a little bit of back story. Go to     . This is a year when Einstein is basking in the glow of having discovered the special theory of relativity and decides to take on a new project  to try to understand fully the grand  pervasive force of gravity. And in that moment  there are many people around who thought that that project had already been resolved. Newton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late     s that works well  describes the motion of planets  the motion of the moon and so forth  the motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees  hitting people on the head. All of that could be described using Newton's work. But Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story  because even Newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity  he'd been unable to figure out how it really works. How is it that the Sun     million miles away   that  somehow it affects the motion of the Earth  How does the Sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence  And that is a task to which Einstein set himself    to figure out how gravity works. And let me show you what it is that he found. So Einstein found that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself. The idea goes like this  imagine space is a substrate of all there is. Einstein said space is nice and flat  if there's no matter present. But if there is matter in the environment  such as the Sun  it causes the fabric of space to warp  to curve. And that communicates the force of gravity. Even the Earth warps space around it. Now look at the Moon. The Moon is kept in orbit  according to these ideas  because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment that the Sun and the Moon and the Earth can all create by virtue of their presence. We go to a full frame view of this. The Earth itself is kept in orbit because it rolls along a valley in the environment that's curved because of the Sun's presence. That is this new idea about how gravity actually works. Now  this idea was tested in      through astronomical observations. It really works. It describes the data. And this gained Einstein prominence around the world. And that is what got Kaluza thinking. He  like Einstein  was in search of what we call a unified theory. That's one theory that might be able to describe all of nature's forces from one set of ideas  one set of principles  one master equation  if you will. So Kaluza said to himself  Einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of warps and curves in space    in fact  space and time  to be more precise. Maybe I can play the same game with the other known force  which was  at that time  known as the electromagnetic force    we know of others today  but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about. You know  the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attraction and so forth. So Kaluza says  maybe I can play the same game and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves. That raised a question  warps and curves in what  Einstein had already used up space and time  warps and curves  to describe gravity. There didn't seem to be anything else to warp or curve. So Kaluza said  well  maybe there are more dimensions of space. He said  if I want to describe one more force  maybe I need one more dimension. So he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space  not three  and imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves in that fourth dimension. Now here's the thing  when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves in a universe with four space dimensions  not three  he found the old equations that Einstein had already derived in three dimensions    those were for gravity    but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension. And when he looked at that equation  it was none other than the equation that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force. Amazing    it just popped out. He was so excited by this realization that he ran around his house screaming   Victory      that he had found the unified theory. Now clearly  Kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously. He  in fact    there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim  he read a book  a treatise on swimming       then dove into the ocean. This is a man who would risk his life on theory. Now  but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded  two questions immediately arise from his observation. Number one  if there are more dimensions in space  where are they  We don't seem to see them. And number two  does this theory really work in detail  when you try to apply it to the world around us  Now  the first question was answered in      by a fellow named Oskar Klein. He suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties    there might be big  easy to see dimensions  but there might also be tiny  curled up dimensions  curled up so small  even though they're all around us  that we don't see them. Let me show you that one visually. So  imagine you're looking at something like a cable supporting a traffic light. It's in Manhattan. You're in Central Park    it's kind of irrelevant    but the cable looks one dimensional from a distant viewpoint  but you and I all know that it does have some thickness. It's very hard to see it  though  from far away. But if we zoom in and take the perspective of  say  a little ant walking around    little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions    the long dimension  but also this clockwise  counter clockwise direction. And I hope you appreciate this. It took so long to get these ants to do this. But this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts  big and small. And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can easily see  but there might be additional dimensions curled up  sort of like the circular part of that cable  so small that they have so far remained invisible. Let me show you what that would look like. So  if we take a look  say  at space itself    I can only show  of course  two dimensions on a screen. Some of you guys will fix that one day  but anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension  goes smaller  smaller  smaller  and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself  this is the idea  you could have additional curled up dimensions    here is a little shape of a circle    so small that we don't see them. But if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around  you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about    that's like the grid part    but you could also access the tiny curled up dimension that's so small that we can't see it with the naked eye or even with any of our most refined equipment. But deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself  the idea is there could be more dimensions  as we see there. Now that's an explanation about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see. But what about the second question that I asked  does the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world  Well  it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time  and  in detail  it didn't work. In detail  for instance  they couldn't get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory. So many people worked on it  but by the '  s  certainly by the '  s  this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away. Until something wonderful happened in our age. In our era  a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself  many others around the world  it's called superstring theory  as you were indicating. And the wonderful thing is that superstring theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions  but when we study superstring theory  we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling  new form. So  let me just tell you how that goes. Superstring theory    what is it  Well  it's a theory that tries to answer the question  what are the basic  fundamental  indivisible  uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us  The idea is like this. So  imagine we look at a familiar object  just a candle in a holder  and imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of. So we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents. So deep inside    we all know  you go sufficiently far down  you have atoms. We also all know that atoms are not the end of the story. They have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus with neutrons and protons. Even the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks. That is where conventional ideas stop. Here is the new idea of string theory. Deep inside any of these particles  there is something else. This something else is this dancing filament of energy. It looks like a vibrating string    that's where the idea  string theory comes from. And just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello can vibrate in different patterns  these can also vibrate in different patterns. They don't produce different musical notes. Rather  they produce the different particles making up the world around us. So if these ideas are correct  this is what the ultra microscopic landscape of the universe looks like. It's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy  vibrating in different frequencies. The different frequencies produce the different particles. The different particles are responsible for all the richness in the world around us. And there you see unification  because matter particles  electrons and quarks  radiation particles  photons  gravitons  are all built up from one entity. So matter and the forces of nature all are put together under the rubric of vibrating strings. And that's what we mean by a unified theory. Now here is the catch. When you study the mathematics of string theory  you find that it doesn't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space. It doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space  nor five  nor six. Finally  you can study the equations  and show that it works only in a universe that has    dimensions of space and one dimension of time. It leads us right back to this idea of Kaluza and Klein    that our world  when appropriately described  has more dimensions than the ones that we see. Now you might think about that and say  well  OK  you know  if you have extra dimensions  and they're really tightly curled up  yeah  perhaps we won't see them  if they're small enough. But if there's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there  and you make them small enough  and we won't see them either. That is true. One of the other predictions of string theory    no  that's not one of the other predictions of string theory. But it raises the question  are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions  or do they tell us something about the world  In the remaining time  I'd like to tell you two features of them. First is  many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics  theoretical science. And that question is this  when we look around the world  as scientists have done for the last hundred years  there appear to be about    numbers that really describe our universe. These are numbers like the mass of the particles  like electrons and quarks  the strength of gravity  the strength of the electromagnetic force    a list of about    numbers that have been measured with incredible precision  but nobody has an explanation for why the numbers have the particular values that they do. Now  does string theory offer an answer  Not yet. But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions. And the wonderful thing is  if those numbers had any other values than the known ones  the universe  as we know it  wouldn't exist. This is a deep question. Why are those numbers so finely tuned to allow stars to shine and planets to form  when we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers    if I had    dials up here and I let you come up and fiddle with those numbers  almost any fiddling makes the universe disappear. So can we explain those    numbers  And string theory suggests that those    numbers have to do with the extra dimensions. Let me show you how. So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory  it's not one extra dimension  as in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein. This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions. They have a very rich  intertwined geometry. This is an example of something known as a Calabi Yau shape    name isn't all that important. But  as you can see  the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape  interesting structure. And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like  then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales. When you swing your hand  you'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again  but they're so small that we wouldn't know it. So what is the physical implication  though  relevant to those    numbers  Consider this. If you look at the instrument  a French horn  notice that the vibrations of the airstreams are affected by the shape of the instrument. Now in string theory  all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate. So just as those airstreams are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument  strings themselves will be affected by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving. So let me bring some strings into the story. And if you watch these little fellows vibrating around    they'll be there in a second    right there  notice that they way they vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions. So  if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like    we don't yet  but if we did    we should be able to calculate the allowed notes  the allowed vibrational patterns. And if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns  we should be able to calculate those    numbers. And if the answer that we get from our calculations agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined through detailed and precise experimentation  this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is. Now  the second issue that I want to finish up with is  how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly  Is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained features of the world  or can we actually test for these extra dimensions  And we think    and this is  I think  very exciting    that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the existence of these extra dimensions. Here's how it goes. In CERN  Geneva  Switzerland  a machine is being built called the Large Hadron Collider. It's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel  opposite directions  near the speed of light. Every so often those particles will be aimed at each other  so there's a head on collision. The hope is that if the collision has enough energy  it may eject some of the debris from the collision from our dimensions  forcing it to enter into the other dimensions. How would we know it  Well  we'll measure the amount of energy after the collision  compare it to the amount of energy before  and if there's less energy after the collision than before  this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away. And if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate  this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there. Let me show you that idea visually. So  imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton    that's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out  if the extra dimensions are real. But here's how the experiment will go. You take these particles. You slam them together. You slam them together  and if we are right  some of the energy of that collision will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions. So this is the kind of experiment that we'll be looking at in the next five  seven to    years or so. And if this experiment bears fruit  if we see that kind of particle ejected by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions than when we began  this will show that the extra dimensions are real. And to me this is a really remarkable story  and a remarkable opportunity. Going back to Newton with absolute space    didn't provide anything but an arena  a stage in which the events of the universe take place. Einstein comes along and says  well  space and time can warp and curve    that's what gravity is. And now string theory comes along and says  yes  gravity  quantum mechanics  electromagnetism  all together in one package  but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see. And this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime. Amazing possibility. Thank you very much. This is the Large Hadron Collider. It's    kilometers in circumference. It's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted. Over        physicists and engineers from    countries around the world have come together over several decades to build this machine. What we do is we accelerate protons    so  hydrogen nuclei    around   .       percent the speed of light. Right  At that speed  they go around that    kilometers        times a second. And we collide them with another beam of protons going in the opposite direction. We collide them inside giant detectors. They're essentially digital cameras. And this is the one that I work on  ATLAS. You get some sense of the size    you can just see these EU standard size people underneath. You get some sense of the size     meters wide     meters in diameter        tons. And we re create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began up to     million times a second inside that detector    immense numbers. And if you see those metal bits there    those are huge magnets that bend electrically charged particles  so it can measure how fast they're traveling. This is a picture about a year ago. Those magnets are in there. And  again  a EU standard size  real person  so you get some sense of the scale. And it's in there that those mini Big Bangs will be created  sometime in the summer this year. And actually  this morning  I got an email saying that we've just finished  today  building the last piece of ATLAS. So as of today  it's finished. I'd like to say that I planned that for TED  but I didn't. So it's been completed as of today. Yeah  it's a wonderful achievement. So  you might be asking   Why  Why create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began   Well  particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious. And the aim of particle physics is to understand what everything's made of  and how everything sticks together. And by everything I mean  of course  me and you  the Earth  the Sun  the     billion suns in our galaxy and the     billion galaxies in the observable universe. Absolutely everything. Now you might say   Well  OK  but why not just look at it  You know  If you want to know what I'm made of  let's look at me.  Well  we found that as you look back in time  the universe gets hotter and hotter  denser and denser  and simpler and simpler. Now  there's no real reason I'm aware of for that  but that seems to be the case. So  way back in the early times of the universe  we believe it was very simple and understandable. All this complexity  all the way to these wonderful things    human brains    are a property of an old and cold and complicated universe. Back at the start  in the first billionth of a second  we believe  or we've observed  it was very simple. It's almost like ... imagine a snowflake in your hand  and you look at it  and it's an incredibly complicated  beautiful object. But as you heat it up  it'll melt into a pool of water  and you would be able to see that  actually  it was just made of H    water. So it's in that same sense that we look back in time to understand what the universe is made of. And  as of today  it's made of these things. Just    particles of matter  stuck together by four forces of nature. The quarks  these pink things  are the things that make up protons and neutrons that make up the atomic nuclei in your body. The electron    the thing that goes around the atomic nucleus    held around in orbit  by the way  by the electromagnetic force that's carried by this thing  the photon. The quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons. And these guys  here  they're the weak nuclear force  probably the least familiar. But  without it  the sun wouldn't shine. And when the sun shines  you get copious quantities of these things  called neutrinos  pouring out. Actually  if you just look at your thumbnail    about a square centimeter    there are something like    billion neutrinos per second from the sun  passing through every square centimeter of your body. But you don't feel them  because the weak force is correctly named    very short range and very weak  so they just fly through you. And these particles have been discovered over the last century  pretty much. The first one  the electron  was discovered in       and the last one  this thing called the tau neutrino  in the year     . Actually just    I was going to say  just up the road in Chicago. I know it's a big country  America  isn't it  Just up the road. Relative to the universe  it's just up the road. So  this thing was discovered in the year       so it's a relatively recent picture. One of the wonderful things  actually  I find  is that we've discovered any of them  when you realize how tiny they are. You know  they're a step in size from the entire observable universe. So      billion galaxies    .  billion light years away    a step in size from that to Monterey  actually  is about the same as from Monterey to these things. Absolutely  exquisitely minute  and yet we've discovered pretty much the full set. So  one of my most illustrious forebears at Manchester University  Ernest Rutherford  discoverer of the atomic nucleus  once said   All science is either physics or stamp collecting.  Now  I don't think he meant to insult the rest of science  although he was from New Zealand  so it's possible. But what he meant was that what we've done  really  is stamp collect there. OK  we've discovered the particles  but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern    you know  why it's built the way it is    really you've done stamp collecting. You haven't done science. Fortunately  we have probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century that underpins that pattern. It's the Newton's laws  if you want  of particle physics. It's called the standard model    beautifully simple mathematical equation. You could stick it on the front of a T shirt  which is always the sign of elegance. This is it. I've been a little disingenuous  because I've expanded it out in all its gory detail. This equation  though  allows you to calculate everything    other than gravity    that happens in the universe. So  you want to know why the sky is blue  why atomic nuclei stick together    in principle  you've got a big enough computer    why DNA is the shape it is. In principle  you should be able to calculate it from that equation. But there's a problem. Can anyone see what it is  A bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me. I'll make it easier  actually  by blowing one of the lines up. Basically  each of these terms refers to some of the particles. So those Ws there refer to the Ws  and how they stick together. These carriers of the weak force  the Zs  the same. But there's an extra symbol in this equation  H. Right  H. H stands for Higgs particle. Higgs particles have not been discovered. But they're necessary  they're necessary to make that mathematics work. So all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn't be possible without an extra bit. So it's a prediction  a prediction of a new particle. What does it do  Well  we had a long time to come up with good analogies. And back in the     s  when we wanted the money for the LHC from the U.K. government  Margaret Thatcher  at the time  said   If you guys can explain  in language a politician can understand  what the hell it is that you're doing  you can have the money. I want to know what this Higgs particle does.  And we came up with this analogy  and it seemed to work. Well  what the Higgs does is  it gives mass to the fundamental particles. And the picture is that the whole universe    and that doesn't mean just space  it means me as well  and inside you    the whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field. Higgs particles  if you will. The analogy is that these people in a room are the Higgs particles. Now when a particle moves through the universe  it can interact with these Higgs particles. But imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room. Then everyone ignores them. They can just pass through the room very quickly  essentially at the speed of light. They're massless. And imagine someone incredibly important and popular and intelligent walks into the room. They're surrounded by people  and their passage through the room is impeded. It's almost like they get heavy. They get massive. And that's exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works. The picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body and in the universe that we see around us are heavy  in a sense  and massive  because they're surrounded by Higgs particles. They're interacting with the Higgs field. If that picture's true  then we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC. If it's not true    because it's quite a convoluted mechanism  although it's the simplest we've been able to think of    then whatever does the job of the Higgs particles we know have to turn up at the LHC. So  that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine. I'm glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher. Actually  I thought about making it more culturally relevant  but    anyway. So that's one thing. That's essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find. There are many other things. You've heard many of the big problems in particle physics. One of them you heard about  dark matter  dark energy. There's another issue  which is that the forces in nature    it's quite beautiful  actually    seem  as you go back in time  they seem to change in strength. Well  they do change in strength. So  the electromagnetic force  the force that holds us together  gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures. The strong force  the strong nuclear force  which sticks nuclei together  gets weaker. And what you see is the standard model    you can calculate how these change    is the forces  the three forces  other than gravity  almost seem to come together at one point. It's almost as if there was one beautiful kind of super force  back at the beginning of time. But they just miss. Now there's a theory called super symmetry  which doubles the number of particles in the standard model  which  at first sight  doesn't sound like a simplification. But actually  with this theory  we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together  back at the Big Bang    absolutely beautiful prophecy. The model wasn't built to do that  but it seems to do it. Also  those super symmetric particles are very strong candidates for the dark matter. So a very compelling theory that's really mainstream physics. And if I was to put money on it  I would put money on    in a very unscientific way    that that these things would also crop up at the LHC. Many other things that the LHC could discover. But in the last few minutes  I just want to give you a different perspective of what I think    what particle physics really means to me    particle physics and cosmology. And that's that I think it's given us a wonderful narrative    almost a creation story  if you'd like    about the universe  from modern science over the last few decades. And I'd say that it deserves  in the spirit of Wade Davis' talk  to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north. This is a creation story  I think  equally as wonderful. The story goes like this  we know that the universe began   .  billion years ago  in an immensely hot  dense state  much smaller than a single atom. It began to expand about a million  billion  billion  billion billionth of a second    I think I got that right    after the Big Bang. Gravity separated away from the other forces. The universe then underwent an exponential expansion called inflation. In about the first billionth of a second or so  the Higgs field kicked in  and the quarks and the gluons and the electrons that make us up got mass. The universe continued to expand and cool. After about a few minutes  there was hydrogen and helium in the universe. That's all. The universe was about    percent hydrogen     percent helium. It still is today. It continued to expand about     million years. Then light began to travel through the universe. It was big enough to be transparent to light  and that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background that George Smoot described as looking at the face of God. After about     million years  the first stars formed  and that hydrogen  that helium  then began to cook into the heavier elements. So the elements of life    carbon  and oxygen and iron  all the elements that we need to make us up    were cooked in those first generations of stars  which then ran out of fuel  exploded  threw those elements back into the universe. They then re collapsed into another generation of stars and planets. And on some of those planets  the oxygen  which had been created in that first generation of stars  could fuse with hydrogen to form water  liquid water on the surface. On at least one  and maybe only one of those planets  primitive life evolved  which evolved over millions of years into things that walked upright and left footprints about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania  and eventually left a footprint on another world. And built this civilization  this wonderful picture  that turned the darkness into light  and you can see the civilization from space. As one of my great heroes  Carl Sagan  said  these are the things    and actually  not only these  but I was looking around    these are the things  like Saturn V rockets  and Sputnik  and DNA  and literature and science    these are the things that hydrogen atoms do when given   .  billion years. Absolutely remarkable. And  the laws of physics. Right  So  the right laws of physics    they're beautifully balanced. If the weak force had been a little bit different  then carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable inside the hearts of stars  and there would be none of that in the universe. And I think that's a wonderful and significant story.    years ago  I couldn't have told that story  because we didn't know it. It makes me really feel that that civilization    which  as I say  if you believe the scientific creation story  has emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics  and a few hydrogen atoms    then I think  to me anyway  it makes me feel incredibly valuable. So that's the LHC. The LHC is certainly  when it turns on in summer  going to write the next chapter of that book. And I'm certainly looking forward with immense excitement to it being turned on.

I am wearing the Al Gore in ear monitors he wore on the Larry King show and I'm hearing that transmission and not mine. But I guess that's in keeping  so now we'll just move to the PowerPoint presentation  ladies and gentlemen. This is a brand new song. In the spirit of TED  we're bringing you something that has not been released. John  do you want to introduce the song  This is a song about a creature called a hummingbird moth which imitates another creature which imitates yet another creature. It's completely fucked up and can only be explained in song.   Everyone is crying at the dread hypnotic flying     of the bee of the bird of the moth.     You can't walk  you can't ramble     'cause you're gonna have to scramble     from the bee of the bird of the moth.     Catbird is a cat     but he's got bugness in his veins.     Manhouse lives within himself     with thoughtful human brains.     Neither one is equal      to the challenge of the freak we'll call     the bee of the bird of the moth.     Now the moth     defeats the mouse and man.     It's messing with the plan.     It can't be believed     'cause it's just a hummingbird moth     who's acting like the bird     that thinks it's a bee.     Got a brand new shipment     of electrical equipment     it's addressed to the bottom of the sea.     Send a tangerine colored     nuclear submarine     with a sticker that says STP.     Windshield wiper washer fluid     spraying in the air ...     headlights under head lice     under hats lie everywhere.     Subatomic waves     to the underwater caves     of the bee of the bird of the moth.     Now the moth defeats the mouse and man.     It's messing with the plan.     It can't be believed     'cause it's just a hummingbird moth     who's acting like a bird     that thinks it's a bee.     Is it us or is this messed up      Everyone's deforming     in the presence of the swarming     of the bee of the bird of the moth.     Protozoa  snakes and horses     have enlisted in the forces     of the bee of bird of the moth.     Catbug is a cat     but he's got bugness in his veins.     Manhouse lives within himself     with thoughtful human brains.     Neither one is equal     to the challenge of the freak we'll call     the bee of the bird of the moth.   Thanks a lot. Thank you very much. So we are past our      th show. Probably somewhere around      . It's hard to know. We've only done two shows in      so far  but our first show was actually the coldest performance we've ever had. It was    degrees in St. Louis about a month ago and I'm happy to report that this performance you are seeing today is the earliest we have ever performed. So thank you. We are cultural test pilots  ladies and gentlemen. How early can a rock performance begin  Not all the facts are in about performing at  .   in the morning. I can tell you the    degree thing was fantastic. All right. So we don't know that much about the history of violinists but we do know that when we entered the state of New Jersey there is an uptick in violence. This song is called  Asbury Park.  It's based on a real life experience.   I     I got     I got kicked     I got kicked in the head     backstage at the Stone.     Stone Pone.     Stone Pony.     I got kicked in the head     backstage at the Stone Pony     where I swore to the guy     that the guy who took his beer wasn't me.     Me got     Me got kicked     Me got kicked in the head     backstage at the Stone.     Stone Pone.     Stone Pony.     Me got kicked in the head     backstage at the Stone Pony     where I swore to the guy     that the guy who took his beer     was a guy dressed like me.     Not me      Not me      Not me    Thank you. Marty Beller on the drums over there. We want to get in as many songs as possible during our brief time here so this is the one to play.

What's that blue thing doing here      Something grabbed ahold of my hand     I didn't know what had my hand     but that's when all my troubles began.     I don't understand you     I don't understand you     I cannot understand you     I cannot understand you     I don't understand the things you say     I can't understand a single word     I don't understand you     I don't understand you     I just don't understand you     I don't understand you     I do not understand you     Don't understand you     Don't understand you     I turn around     See the sound     Turn around and see the thing     that made the sound.     Mysterious whisper     Mysterious whisper     Mysterious whisper     Mysterious whisper     The day that love came to play.

Eleanor  I'm sorry  do you have a laminated badge  No  I don't have a badge. Well  I think we're going to stop that part of the show. Here's a song we like to think of as the future anthem of TED. It's actually a children's song but like so many projects for children it's really just a Trojan horse for adult work. This song is called  The Alphabet ...
