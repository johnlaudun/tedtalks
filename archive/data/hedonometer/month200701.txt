Let me show you some images of what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow. So  that's Kibera  the largest squatter community in Nairobi. This is the squatter community in Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Bombay  India  what's called Mumbai these days. This is Hosinia  the largest and most urbanized favela in Rio de Janeiro. And this is Sultanbelyi  which is one of the largest squatter communities in Istanbul. They are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow  the new urban world. Now  why do I say that  To tell you about that I have to talk about this fellow here  his name is Julius. And I met Julius the last week that I was living in Kibera. So  I had been there almost three months  and I was touring around the city going to different squatter areas and Julius was tagging along  and he was bug eyed and at certain points we were walking around  he grabbed my hand for support  which is something most Kenyans would never consider doing. They're very polite and they don't get so forward so quickly. And I found out later that it was Julius' first day in Nairobi  and he's one of many. So  close to         people a day migrate from the rural to the urban areas. That's  and I'm going to be fair to the statisticians who talked this morning  not almost  .  million people a week  but almost  .  million people a week but I'm a journalist  and we exaggerate  so almost  .  million people a week  close to    million people a year. And if you do the math  that's     people every minute. So  that'll be    in the    minutes that I'm given to talk here  between two and three thousand people will have journeyed to the cities. And here are the statistics. Today    a billion squatters  one in six people on the planet.         two billion squatters  one in four people on the planet. And the estimate is that in       there'll be three billion squatters  better than one in three people on earth. So  these are the cities of the future  and we have to engage them. And I was thinking this morning of the good life  and before I show you the rest of my presentation  I'm going to violate TED rules here  and I'm going to read you something from my book as quickly as I can. Because I think it says something about reversing our perception of what we think the good life is. So     The hut was made of corrugated metal  set on a concrete pad. It was a    by    cell. Armstrong O'Brian  Jr. shared it with three other men. Armstrong and his friends had no water    they bought it from a nearby tap owner    no toilet    the families in this compound shared a single pit latrine    and no sewers or sanitation. They did have electricity  but it was illegal service tapped from someone else's wires  and could only power one feeble bulb. This was Southland  a small shanty community on the western side of Nairobi  Kenya. But it could've been anywhere in the city  because more than half the city of Nairobi lives like this.  .  million people stuffed into mud or metal huts with no services  no toilets  no rights.  Armstrong explained the brutal reality of their situation  they paid       shillings in rent  about    bucks a month  a relatively high price for a Kenyan shantytown  and they could not afford to be late with the money. 'In case you owe one month  the landlord will come with his henchmen and bundle you out. He will confiscate your things ' Armstrong said. 'Not one month  one day ' his roommate Hilary Kibagendi Onsomu  who was cooking ugali  the spongy white cornmeal concoction that is the staple food in the country  cut into the conversation. They called their landlord a Wabenzi  meaning that he is a person who has enough money to drive a Mercedes Benz. Hilary served the ugali with a fry of meat and tomatoes  the sun slammed down on the thin steel roof  and we perspired as we ate.  After we finished  Armstrong straightened his tie  put on a wool sports jacket  and we headed out into the glare. Outside a mound of garbage formed the border between Southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of Langata. It was perhaps eight feet tall     feet long  and    feet wide. And it was set in a wider watery ooze. As we passed  two boys were climbing the mount Kenya of trash. They couldn't have been more than five or six years old. They were barefoot  and with each step their toes sank into the muck sending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile. I thought they might be playing King of the Hill  but I was wrong. Once atop the pile  one of the boys lowered his shorts  squatted  and defecated. The flies buzzed hungrily around his legs. When    families        people or so    share a single latrine  a boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing. But it stood in jarring contrast to something Armstrong had said as we were eating    that he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood.  For Armstrong  Southland wasn't constrained by its material conditions. Instead  the human spirit radiated out from the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer something no legal neighborhood could  freedom. 'This place is very addictive ' he had said. 'It's a simple life  but nobody is restricting you. Nobody is controlling what you do. Once you have stayed here  you cannot go back.' He meant back beyond that mountain of trash  back in the legal city  of legal buildings  with legal leases and legal rights. 'Once you have stayed here ' he said  'you can stay for the rest of your life.'  So  he has hope  and this is where these communities start. This is perhaps the most primitive shanty that you can find in Kibera  little more than a stick and mud hut next to a garbage heap. This is getting ready for the monsoon in Bombay  India. This is home improvement  putting plastic tarps on your roof. This is in Rio de Janeiro  and it's getting a bit better  right  We're seeing scavenged terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs  and plaster over the brick  some color  and this is Sulay Montakaya's house in Sultanbelyi  and it's getting even better. He's got a fence  he scavenged a door  he's got new tile on the roof. And then you get Rocinha and you can see that it's getting even better. The buildings here are multi story. They develop    you can see on the far right one where it seems to just stack on top of each other  room  after room  after room. And what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories  and they sell their loggia or roof rights  and someone else builds on top of their building  and then that person sells the roof rights  and someone else builds on top of their building. All of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick. And then you get Sultanbelyi  in Turkey  where it's even built to a higher level of design. The crud in the front is mattress stuffing  and you see that all over Turkey. People dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs. But the green building  on behind  you can see that the top floor is not occupied  so people are building with the possibility of expansion. And it's built to a pretty high standard of design. And then you finally get squatter homes like this  which is built on the suburban model. Hey  that's a single family home in the squatter community. That's also in Istanbul  Turkey. They're quite vital places  these communities. This is the main drag of Rocinha  the Estrada da Gavea  and there's a bus route that runs through it  lots of people out on the street. These communities in these cities are actually more vital than the illegal communities. They have more things going on in them. This is a typical pathway in Rocinha called a  beco     these are how you get around the community. It's on very steep ground. They're built on the hills  inland from the beaches in Rio  and you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions. So  that's just a rock in the hillside. And these becos are normally very crowded  and people hump furniture up them  or refrigerators up them  all sorts of things. Beer is all carried in on your shoulders. Beer is a very important thing in Brazil. This is commerce in Kenya  right along the train tracks  so close to the train tracks that the merchants sometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way. This is a marketplace  also in Kenya  Toi Market  lots of dealers  in almost everything you want to buy. Those green things in the foreground are mangoes. This is a shopping street in Kibera  and you can see that there's a soda dealer  a health clinic  two beauty salons  a bar  two grocery stores  and a church  and more. It's a typical downtown street  it just happens to be self built. This here  on the right hand side  is what's called a    if you look at the fine print under the awning    it's a hotel. And what hotel means  in Kenya and India  is an eating place. So  that's a restaurant. People steal electrical power    this is Rio. People tap in and they have thieves who are called  grillos  or  crickets   and they steal the electrical power and wire the neighborhood. People burn trash to get rid of the garbage  and they dig their own sewer channels. Talk about more plastic bags than plankton. And sometimes they have natural trash disposal. And when they have more money they cement their streets  and they put in sewers and good water pipes  and stuff like that. This is water going to Rio. People run their water pipes all over the place  and that little hut right there has a pump in it  and that's what people do  they steal electricity  they install a pump and they tap into the water main  and pump water up to their houses. So  the question is how do you go from the mud hut village  to the more developed city  to the even highly developed Sultanbelyi  I say there are two things. One is people need a guarantee they won't be evicted. That does not necessarily mean property rights  and I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question  because property rights create a lot of complications. They're most often sold to people  and people then wind up in debt and have to pay back the debt  and sometimes have to sell their property in order to pay back the debt. There's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights sometimes don't work in these cases  but they do need security of tenure. And they need access to politics  and that can mean two things. That can mean community organizing from below  but it can also mean possibilities from above. And I say that because the system in Turkey is notable. Turkey has two great laws that protect squatters. One is that    it's called  gecekondu  in Turkish  which means  built overnight   and if you build your house overnight in Turkey  you can't be evicted without due process of law  if they don't catch you during the night. And the second aspect is that once you have       people in the community  you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal sub municipality. And when you're a legal sub municipality  you suddenly have politics. You're allowed to have an elected government  collect taxes  provide municipal services  and that's exactly what they do. So  these are the civic leaders of the future. The woman in the center is Geeta Jiwa. She lives in one of those tents on the highway median in Mumbai. That's Sureka Gundi  she also lives with her family on the tent along the same highway median. They're very outspoken. They're very active. They can be community leaders. This woman is Nine  which means  grandma  in Turkish. And there were three old ladies who lived in    that's her self built house behind her    and they've lived there for    or    years  and they are the backbone of the community there. This is Richard Muthama Peter  and he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera. He makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood  and the people in the neighborhood  and is a great resource in the community. And finally my choice to run for mayor of Rio is Cezinio  the fruit merchant with his two kids here  and a more honest and giving and caring man I don't know. The future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work with those people. So  I think the message I take  from what I read from the book  from what Armstrong said  and from all these people  is that these are neighborhoods. The issue is not urban poverty. The issue is not the larger  over arching thing. The issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods    this is a legitimate form of urban development    and that cities have to engage these residents  because they are building the cities of the future. Thank you very much. What I'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world. I'm not going to talk about  The Skeptical Environmentalist     probably that's also a good choice. But I am going talk about  what are the big problems in the world  And I must say  before I go on  I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that. So get out your pen and paper. Bottom line is  there is a lot of problems out there in the world. I'm just going to list some of them. There are     million people starving. There's a billion people without clean drinking water. Two billion people without sanitation. There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS. The lists go on and on. There's two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change    so on. There are many  many problems out there. In an ideal world  we would solve them all  but we don't. We don't actually solve all problems. And if we do not  the question I think we need to ask ourselves    and that's why it's on the economy session    is to say  if we don't do all things  we really have to start asking ourselves  which ones should we solve first  And that's the question I'd like to ask you. If we had say     billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world  where should we spend it  We identified    of the biggest challenges in the world  and I will just briefly read them  climate change  communicable diseases  conflicts  education  financial instability  governance and corruption  malnutrition and hunger  population migration  sanitation and water  and subsidies and trade barriers. We believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world. The obvious question would be to ask  what do you think are the biggest things  Where should we start on solving these problems  But that's a wrong problem to ask. That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January. But of course  there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems. Because we can't solve problems. Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die. But we don't have a technology to solve that  right  So the point is not to prioritize problems  but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems. And that would be    of course that gets a little more complicated. To climate change that would be like Kyoto. To communicable diseases  it might be health clinics or mosquito nets. To conflicts  it would be U.N.'s peacekeeping forces  and so on. The point that I would like to ask you to try to do  is just in    seconds    and I know this is in a sense an impossible task    write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities. And also    and that's  of course  where economics gets evil    to put down what are the things we should not do  first. What should be at the bottom of the list  Please  just take    seconds  perhaps talk to your neighbor  and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world's biggest issues. The amazing part of this process    and of course  I mean  I would love to    I only have    minutes  I've already given you quite a substantial amount of my time  right  I'd love to go into  and get you to think about this process  and that's actually what we did. And I also strongly encourage you  and I'm sure we'll also have these discussions afterwards  to think about  how do we actually prioritize  Of course  you have to ask yourself  why on Earth was such a list never done before  And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable. Nobody wants to do this. Of course  every organization would love to be on the top of such a list. But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list. And since there are many more not number one spots on the list than there is number ones  it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list. We've had the U.N. for almost    years  yet we've never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world  and said  which of them should we do first  So it doesn't mean that we are not prioritizing    any decision is a prioritization  so of course we are still prioritizing  if only implicitly    and that's unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization  and went in and talked about it. So what I'm proposing is really to say that we have  for a very long time  had a situation when we've had a menu of choices. There are many  many things we can do out there  but we've not had the prices  nor the sizes. We have not had an idea. Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card  but you have no idea what the price is. You know  you have a pizza  you've no idea what the price is. It could be at one dollar  it could be       dollars. It could be a family size pizza  it could be a very individual size pizza  right  We'd like to know these things. And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do    to try to put prices on these issues. And so basically  this has been the Copenhagen Consensus' process. We got    of the world's best economists  three in each area. So we have three of world's top economists write about climate change. What can we do  What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that  Likewise in communicable diseases. Three of the world's top experts saying  what can we do  What would be the price  What should we do about it  and what will be the outcome  And so on. Then we had some of the world's top economists  eight of the world's top economists  including three Nobel Laureates  meet in Copenhagen in May     . We called them the  dream team.  The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them the Real Madrid of economics. That works very well in Europe  but it doesn't really work over here. And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list. And then you ask  why economists  And of course  I'm very happy you asked that question     Laughter     because that's a very good question. The point is  of course  if you want to know about malaria  you ask a malaria expert. If you want to know about climate  you ask a climatologist. But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first  you can't ask either of them  because that's not what they do. That is what economists do. They prioritize. They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying  which one should we do first  and which one should we do afterwards  So this is the list  and this is the one I'd like to share with you. Of course  you can also see it on the website  and we'll also talk about it more  I'm sure  as the day goes on. They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects    basically  projects where if you invest a dollar  you get less than a dollar back. Then there's fair projects  good projects and very good projects. And of course  it's the very good projects we should start doing. I'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects. These were the bad projects. As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change. This offends a lot of people  and that's probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn't come back  either. And I'd like to talk about that  because that's really curious. Why is it it came up  And I'll actually also try to get back to this because it's probably one of the things that we'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down. The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto    or doing something more than Kyoto    is a bad deal is simply because it's very inefficient. It's not saying that global warming is not happening. It's not saying that it's not a big problem. But it's saying that what we can do about it is very little  at a very high cost. What they basically show us  the average of all macroeconomic models  is that Kyoto  if everyone agreed  would cost about     billion dollars a year. That's a substantial amount of money. That's two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year. Yet it would do very little good. All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in     . So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in      can wait until     . Which is a little good  but not very much good. So the idea here really is to say  well  we've spent a lot of money doing a little good. And just to give you a sense of reference  the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount  for about    billion dollars a year  we could solve all major basic problems in the world. We could give clean drinking water  sanitation  basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet. So we have to ask ourselves  do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good  Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good  And that is really why it becomes a bad project. It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world  we wouldn't want to do it. But it's to say  when we don't  it's just simply not our first priority. The fair projects    notice I'm not going to comment on all these    but communicable diseases  scale of basic health services    just made it  simply because  yes  scale of basic health services is a great thing. It would do a lot of good  but it's also very  very costly. Again  what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation. If you look at the good projects  a lot of sanitation and water projects came in. Again  sanitation and water is incredibly important  but it also costs a lot of infrastructure. So I'd like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world. The fourth best problem is malaria    dealing with malaria. The incidence of malaria is about a couple of  million  people get infected every year. It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations. If we invested about    billion dollars over the next four years  we could bring that incidence down to half. We could avoid about         people dying  but perhaps more importantly  we could avoid about a  million  people getting infected every year. We would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with    of course  in the long run  also to deal with global warming. This third best one was free trade. Basically  the model showed that if we could get free trade  and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe  we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about       billion dollars a year  half of which would accrue to the Third World. Again  the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty  very radically fast  in about two to five years. That would be the third best thing we could do. The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition. Not just malnutrition in general  but there's a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition  namely  the lack of micronutrients. Basically  about half of the world's population is lacking in iron  zinc  iodine and vitamin A. If we invest about    billion dollars  we could make a severe inroad into that problem. That would be the second best investment that we could do. And the very best project would be to focus on HIV AIDS. Basically  if we invest    billion dollars over the next eight years  we could avoid    new million cases of HIV AIDS. Again  what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV AIDS. One is treatment  the other one is prevention. And again  in an ideal world  we would do both. But in a world where we don't do either  or don't do it very well  we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first. And treatment is much  much more expensive than prevention. So basically  what this focuses on is saying  we can do a lot more by investing in prevention. Basically for the amount of money that we spend  we can do X amount of good in treatment  and    times as much good in prevention. So again  what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment  at first rate. What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities. I'd like to have you look at your priority list and say  did you get it right  Or did you get close to what we came up with here  Well  of course  one of the things is climate change again. I find a lot of people find it very  very unlikely that we should do that. We should also do climate change  if for no other reason  simply because it's such a big problem. But of course  we don't do all problems. There are many problems out there in the world. And what I want to make sure of is  if we actually focus on problems  that we focus on the right ones. The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good. And I think  actually    Thomas Schelling  one of the participants in the dream team  he put it very  very well. One of things that people forget  is that in     years  when we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be  people will be much  much richer. Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N. estimate that the average person in the developing world in      will be about as rich as we are today. Much more likely  they will be two to four times richer than we are. And of course  we'll be even richer than that. But the point is to say  when we talk about saving people  or helping people in Bangladesh in       we're not talking about a poor Bangladeshi. We're actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy. And so the real point  of course  is to say  do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little      years from now  a fairly rich Dutch guy  Or do we want to help real poor people  right now  in Bangladesh  who really need the help  and whom we can help very  very cheaply  Or as Schelling put it  imagine if you were a rich    as you will be    a rich Chinese  a rich Bolivian  a rich Congolese  in       thinking back on       and saying   How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change  and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather  whom they could have helped so much more  and who needed the help so much more   So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight. Even if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem. Of course  that's mainly because climate change has good pictures. We have  you know   The Day After Tomorrow     it looks great  right  It's a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it  right  but don't expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something.  Laughter  It just doesn't make for as much of a movie. So in many ways  I think of the Copenhagen Consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems. To make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good. It's not about making things that have the most media attention  but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good. The other objections  I think  that are important to say  is that I'm somehow    or we are somehow    positing a false choice. Of course  we should do all things  in an ideal world    I would certainly agree. I think we should do all things  but we don't. In       the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did  right now  than in       on the developing world. Since then our aid has halved. So it doesn't look like we're actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems. Likewise  people are also saying  but what about the Iraq war  You know  we spend     billion dollars    why don't we spend that on doing good in the world  I'm all for that. If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that  that's fine. But the point  of course  is still to say  if you get another     billion dollars  we still want to spend that in the best possible way  don't we  So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities. I should just mention briefly  is this really the right list that we got out  You know  when you ask the world's best economists  you inevitably end up asking old  white American men. And they're not necessarily  you know  great ways of looking at the entire world. So we actually invited    young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem. The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university  and they spoke English. The majority of them were  first  from developing countries. They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion  and they certainly did  to come up with their own lists. And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar    with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom. We've done this many other times. There's been many other seminars and university students  and different things. They all come out with very much the same list. And that gives me great hope  really  in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities  and saying  what is the important thing in the world  Of course  in an ideal world  again we'd love to do everything. But if we don't do it  then we can start thinking about where should we start  I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process. We did it in       and we hope to assemble many more people  getting much better information for           . Map out the right path for the world    but also to start thinking about political triage. To start thinking about saying   Let's do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost  not the things that we don't know how to do  but let's do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good  at very low cost  right now.  At the end of the day  you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these  but we have to be honest and frank about saying  if there's some things we do  there are other things we don't do. If we worry too much about some things  we end by not worrying about other things. So I hope this will help us make better priorities  and think about how we better work for the world. Thank you. A fact came out of MIT  couple of years ago. Ken Hale  who's a linguist  said that of the       languages spoken on Earth right now        aren't spoken by the children. So that in one generation  we're going to halve our cultural diversity. He went on to say that every two weeks  an elder goes to the grave carrying the last spoken word of that culture. So an entire philosophy  a body of knowledge about the natural world that had been empirically gleaned over centuries  goes away. And this happens every two weeks. So for the last    years  since my dental experience  I have been traveling the world and coming back with stories about some of these people. What I'd like to do right now is share some of those stories with you. This is Tamdin. She is a    year old nun. She was thrown in prison in Tibet for two years for putting up a little tiny placard protesting the occupation of her country. And when I met her  she had just taken a walk over the Himalayas from Lhasa  the capital of Tibet  into Nepal  across to India       days    to meet her leader  the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala  India. So I took this picture three days after she arrived  and she had this beat up pair of tennis shoes on  with her toes sticking out. And she crossed in March  and there's a lot of snow at        feet in March. This is Paldin. Paldin is a    year old monk. And he spent    years in prison. His whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising  when the Dalai Lama had to leave Tibet. And he was beaten  starved  tortured    lost all his teeth while in prison. And when I met him  he was a kind gentle old man. And it really impressed me    I met him two weeks after he got out of prison    that he went through that experience  and ended up with the demeanor that he had. So I was in Dharamsala meeting these people  and I'd spent about five weeks there  and I was hearing these similar stories of these refugees that had poured out of Tibet into Dharamsala. And it just so happened  on the fifth week  there was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama. And I was watching this crowd of monks and nuns  many of which I had just interviewed  and heard their stories  and I watched their faces  and they gave us a little FM radio  and we could listen to the translation of his teachings. And what he said was  treat your enemies as if they were precious jewels  because it's your enemies that build your tolerance and patience on the road to your enlightenment. That hit me so hard  telling these people that had been through this experience. So  two months later  I went into Tibet  and I started interviewing the people there  taking my photographs. That's what I do. I interview and do portraits. And this is a little girl. I took her portrait up on top of the Jokhang Temple. And I'd snuck in    because it's totally illegal to have a picture of the Dalai Lama in Tibet    it's the quickest way you can get arrested. So I snuck in a bunch of little wallet sized pictures of the Dalai Lama  and I would hand them out. And when I gave them to the people  they'd either hold them to their heart  or they'd hold them up to their head and just stay there. And this is    well  at the time    I did this    years ago    that was    years after the Dalai Lama had left. So I was going in  interviewing these people and doing their portraits. This is Jigme and her sister  Sonam. And they live up on the Chang Tang  the Tibetan Plateau  way in the western part of the country. This is at        feet. And they had just come down from the high pastures  at        feet. Same thing  gave her a picture  she held it up to her forehead. And I usually hand out Polaroids when I do these  because I'm setting up lights  and checking my lights  and when I showed her her Polaroid  she screamed and ran into her tent. This is Tenzin Gyatso  he was found to be the Buddha of Compassion at the age of two  out in a peasant's house  way out in the middle of nowhere. At the age of four  he was installed as the   th Dalai Lama. As a teenager  he faced the invasion of his country  and had to deal with it    he was the leader of the country. Eight years later  when they discovered there was a plot to kill him  they dressed him up like a beggar and snuck him out of the country on horseback  and took the same trip that Tamdin did. And he's never been back to his country since. And if you think about this man     years later  still sticking to this non violent response to a severe political and human rights issue. And the young people  young Tibetans  are starting to say  listen  this doesn't work. You know  violence as a political tool is all the rage right now. And he still is holding this line. So this is our icon to non violence in our world    one of our living icons. This is another leader of his people. This is Moi. This is in the Ecuadorian Amazon. And Moi is    years old. And this area of the Ecuadorian Amazon    oil was discovered in     . And in this period of time    since that time    as much oil  or twice as much oil as was spilled in the Exxon Valdez accident  was spilled in this little area of the Amazon  and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move. And Moi belongs to the Huaorani tribe  and they're known as very fierce  they're known as  auca.  And they've managed to keep out the seismologists and the oil workers with spears and blowguns. And we spent    I was with a team    two weeks with these guys out in the jungle watching them hunt. This was on a monkey hunt  hunting with curare tipped darts. And the knowledge that these people have about the natural environment is incredible. They could hear things  smell things  see things I couldn't see. And I couldn't even see the monkeys that they were getting with these darts. This is Yadira  and Yadira is five years old. She's in a tribe that's neighboring the Huaorani. And her tribe has had to move three times in the last    years because of the oil spills. And we never hear about that. And the latest infraction against these people is  as part of Plan Colombia  we're spraying Paraquat or Round Up  whatever it is    we're defoliating thousands of acres of the Ecuadorian Amazon in our war on drugs. And these people are the people who take the brunt of it. This is Mengatoue. He's the shaman of the Huaorani  and he said to us  you know  I'm an older man now  I'm getting tired  you know  I'm tired of spearing these oil workers. I wish they would just go away. And I was    I usually travel alone when I do my work  but I did this    I hosted a program for Discovery  and when I went down with the team  I was quite concerned about going in with a whole bunch of people  especially into the Huaorani  deep into the Huaorani tribe. And as it turned out  these guys really taught me a thing or two about blending in with the locals. One of the things I did just before         August of         I took my son  Dax  who was    at the time  and I took him to Pakistan. Because at first I wanted    you know  I've taken him on a couple of trips  but I wanted him to see people that live on a dollar a day or less. I wanted him to get an experience in the Islamic world and I also wanted him to    I was going there to work with a group  do a story on a group called the Kalash  that are a group of animists        animists  that live    very small area    surrounded by Islam    there's       of these Kalash left  they're incredible people. So it was a great experience for him. He stayed up all night with them  drumming and dancing. And he brought a soccer ball  and we had soccer every night in this little village. And then we went up and met their shaman. By the way  Mengatoue was the shaman of his tribe as well. And this is John Doolikahn  who's the shaman of the Kalash. And he's up in the mountains  right on the border with Afghanistan. In fact  on that other side is the area  Tora Bora  the area where Osama bin Laden's supposed to be. This is the tribal area. And we watched and stayed with John Doolikahn. And the shaman    I did a whole series on shamanism  which is an interesting phenomenon. But around the world  they go into trance in different ways  and in Pakistan  the way they do it is they burn juniper leaves and they sacrifice an animal  pour the blood of the animal on the leaves and then inhale the smoke. And they're all praying to the mountain gods as they go into trance. You know  getting kids used to different realities  I think  is so important. What Dan Dennett said the other day    having a curriculum where they study different religions  just to make a mental flexibility  give them a mental flexibility in different belief systems    I think this is so necessary in our world today as you see these clash of beliefs taking place. And all the security issues they cause us. So  one thing we did five years ago  we started a program that links kids in indigenous communities with kids in the United States. So we first hooked up a spot in the Navajo Nation with a classroom in Seattle. We now have    sites. We have one in Kathmandu  Nepal  Dharamsala  India  Takaungu  Kenya    Takaungu is one third Christian  one third Muslim and one third animist  the community is    Ollantaytambo  Peru  and Arctic Village  Alaska. This is Daniel  he's one of our students in Arctic Village  Alaska. He lives in this log cabin    no running water  no heat other than    no windows and high speed Internet connection. And this is    I see this rolling out all over    this is our site in Ollantaytambo  Peru  four years ago  where they first saw their first computers  now they have computers in their classrooms. And the way we've done this    we teach digital storytelling to these kids. And we have them tell stories about issues in their community in their community that they care about. And this is in Peru  where the kids told the story about a river that they cleaned up. And the way we do it is  we do it in workshops  and we bring people who want to learn digital workflow and storytelling  and have them work with the kids. And just this last year we've taken a group of teenagers in  and this has worked the best. So our dream is to bring teenagers together  so they'll have a community service experience as well as a cross cultural experience  as they teach kids in these areas and help them build their communication infrastructure. This is teaching Photoshop in the Tibetan children's village in Dharamsala. We have the website  where the kids all get their homepage. This is all their movies. We've got about    movies that these kids have made  and they're quite incredible. The one I want to show you    after we get them to make the movies  we have a night where we show the movies to the community. And this is in Takaungu    we've got a generator and a digital projector  and we're projecting it up against a barn  and showing one of the movies that they made. And if you get a chance  you can go to our website  and you'll see the incredible work these kids do. The other thing  I wanted to give indigenous people a voice. That was one of the big motivating factors. But the other motivating factor is the insular nature of our country. National Geographic just did a Roper Study of    to    year olds in our country and in nine other industrialized countries. It was a two million dollar study. United States came in second to last in geographic knowledge.    percent of the kids couldn't find Afghanistan or Iraq on a map     percent couldn't find India     percent couldn't find the Pacific Ocean. And this is a study that was just done a couple of years ago. So what I'd like to show you now  in the couple of minutes I have left  is a film that a student made in Guatemala. We just had a workshop in Guatemala. A week before we got to the workshop  a massive landslide  caused by Hurricane Stan  last October  came in and buried     people alive in their village. And this kid lived in the village    he wasn't there at the time    and this is the little movie he put together about that. And he hadn't seen a computer before we did this movie. We taught him Photoshop and    yeah  we can play it. This is an old Mayan funeral chant that he got from his grandfather. Thank you very much. You know  one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways  who still feel their past in the wind  touch it in stones polished by rain  taste it in the bitter leaves of plants. Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way  or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning  or that in the Himalaya  the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma  is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology  and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense  but is just one model of reality  the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made  albeit successfully  many generations ago. And of course  we all share the same adaptive imperatives. We're all born. We all bring our children into the world. We go through initiation rites. We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death  so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing  we all dance  we all have art. But what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song  the rhythm of the dance in every culture. And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo  or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti  or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya  the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes  or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara    this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago    or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma  Everest  the goddess mother of the world. All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being  other ways of thinking  other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth. And this is an idea  if you think about it  can only fill you with hope. Now  together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet  and is as important to the well being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere. And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere  and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams  myths  ideas  inspirations  intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness. The ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy. It's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species. And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded  so too is the ethnosphere    and  if anything  at a far greater rate. No biologists  for example  would dare suggest that    percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true  and yet that    the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity    scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity. And the great indicator of that  of course  is language loss. When each of you in this room were born  there were       languages spoken on the planet. Now  a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules. A language is a flash of the human spirit. It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world. Every language is an old growth forest of the mind  a watershed  a thought  an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities. And of those       languages  as we sit here today in Monterey  fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children. They're no longer being taught to babies  which means  effectively  unless something changes  they're already dead. What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence  to be the last of your people to speak your language  to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children  And yet  that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks  because every two weeks  some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue. And I know there's some of you who say   Well  wouldn't it be better  wouldn't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language   And I say   Great  let's make that language Yoruba. Let's make it Cantonese. Let's make it Kogi.  And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language. And so  what I'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere  a brief journey through the ethnosphere  to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost. Now  there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say  different ways of being   I really do mean different ways of being. Take  for example  this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon  the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes. Now  this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend. They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called  linguistic exogamy   you must marry someone who speaks a different language. And this is all rooted in the mythological past  yet the curious thing is in these long houses  where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage  you never hear anyone practicing a language. They simply listen and then begin to speak. Or  one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with  the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador  an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in     . In       five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake. They dropped from the air   x    glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures  forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two dimensional in their lives. They picked up these photographs from the forest floor  tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure  found nothing  and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil  so they speared the five missionaries to death. But the Waorani didn't just spear outsiders. They speared each other.    percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other. We traced genealogies back eight generations  and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it  they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old  so we speared him anyway.  Laughter  But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing. Their hunters could smell animal urine at    paces and tell you what species left it behind. In the early '  s  I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti  infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier's strength and Tonton Macoutes  and securing the poison used to make zombies. In order to make sense out of sensation  of course  I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun. And Voodoo is not a black magic cult. On the contrary  it's a complex metaphysical worldview. It's interesting. If I asked you to name the great religions of the world  what would you say  Christianity  Islam  Buddhism  Judaism  whatever. There's always one continent left out  the assumption being that sub Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs. Well  of course  they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era. But  what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it's this living relationship between the living and the dead. So  the living give birth to the spirits. The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water  responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living  so that for that brief shining moment  the acolyte becomes the god. That's why the Voodooists like to say that  You white people go to church and speak about God. We dance in the temple and become God.  And because you are possessed  you are taken by the spirit    how can you be harmed  So you see these astonishing demonstrations  Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity  a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation. Now  of all the peoples that I've ever been with  the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia. Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia  in the wake of the conquest  these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain. In a bloodstained continent  these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish. To this day  they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary. The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four  sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for    years  two nine year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother's womb  now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother. And for this entire time  they are inculturated into the values of their society  values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic    or we might say the ecological    balance. And at the end of this amazing initiation  one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives  at the age of     they see a sunrise. And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape  suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory. And the priest steps back and says   You see  It's really as I've told you. It is that beautiful. It is yours to protect.  They call themselves the  elder brothers  and they say we  who are the younger brothers  are the ones responsible for destroying the world. Now  this level of intuition becomes very important. Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape  we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the  noble savage   which is an idea racist in its simplicity  or alternatively  we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are. Well  indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia. There's not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet  but they have  nevertheless  through time and ritual  forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self consciously close to it  but on a far subtler intuition  the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness. Now  what does that mean  It means that a young kid from the Andes who's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined. Whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant. What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world. I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut. That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world  spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation. Now  if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities  you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant here. It's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April. This is ayahuasca  which many of you have heard about  the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman's repertoire. What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation  but the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources  on the one hand  this woody liana which has in it a series of beta carbolines  harmine  harmaline  mildly hallucinogenic    to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness    but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis. This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines  very close to brain serotonin  dimethyltryptamine    methoxydimethyltryptamine. If you've ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses  that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine. To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity.  Laughter  It doesn't create the distortion of reality  it creates the dissolution of reality. In fact  I used to argue with my professor  Richard Evan Shultes    who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the     s    I used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination.  Laughter  But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they're denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase. They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO. Now  the fascinating things are that the beta carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine. So you ask yourself a question. How  in a flora of        species of vascular plants  do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way  created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts  Well  we use that great euphemism   trial and error   which is exposed to be meaningless. But you ask the Indians  and they say   The plants talk to us.  Well  what does that mean  This tribe  the Cofan  has    varieties of ayahuasca  all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest  all of which are referable to our eye as one species. And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say   I thought you knew something about plants. I mean  don't you know anything   And I said   No.  Well  it turns out you take each of the    varieties in the night of a full moon  and it sings to you in a different key. Now  that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard  but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens.  Laughter  Now    the problem    the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world  meaning our world  moves on. Well  the truth is the   th century      years from now  is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations  but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet. Now  the problem isn't change. All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life. And the problem is not technology itself. The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy. It's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere. It is power  the crude face of domination. Wherever you look around the world  you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away  these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to  whether it's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan    a nomadic people from Southeast Asia  from Sarawak    a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago  and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers  where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away to the South China Sea  where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest    or  in the case of the Yanomami  it's the disease entities that have come in  in the wake of the discovery of gold. Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet  where I'm doing a lot of research recently  you'll see it's a crude face of political domination. You know  genocide  the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned  but ethnocide  the destruction of people's way of life  is not only not condemned  it's universally  in many quarters  celebrated as part of a development strategy. And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level. I once travelled       miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague  and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about        sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes   .  million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution. This young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama. That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion. His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal. His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy. He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn't bear to be without him. The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp. One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao  and for that transgression  she was given seven years of hard labor. The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear  but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold. And in the end  then  it really comes down to a choice  do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity  Margaret Mead  the great anthropologist  said  before she died  that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought  but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities. And it's humbling to remember that our species has  perhaps  been around for           years. The Neolithic Revolution    which gave us agriculture  at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed  the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood  we created hierarchy specialization surplus    is only        years ago. The modern industrial world as we know it is barely     years old. Now  that shallow history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia. When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human  they respond with        different voices. And it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are  a fully conscious species  fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish. And there are great moments of optimism. This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people  and this man  Olayuk  told me a marvelous story of his grandfather. The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people  and during the     s  to establish our sovereignty  we forced them into settlements. This old man's grandfather refused to go. The family  fearful for his life  took away all of his weapons  all of his tools. Now  you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold  they took advantage of it. The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide. So  this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing. He simply slipped outside  pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand. And as the feces began to freeze  he shaped it into the form of a blade. He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid  he butchered a dog with it. He skinned the dog and improvised a harness  took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled  harnessed up an adjacent dog  and disappeared over the ice floes  shit knife in belt. Talk about getting by with nothing.  Laughter  And this  in many ways    is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world. The Canadian government in April of      gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together. It's our new homeland. It's called Nunavut. It's an independent territory. They control all mineral resources. An amazing example of how a nation state can seek restitution with its people. And finally  in the end  I think it's pretty obvious at least to all of all us who've traveled in these remote reaches of the planet  to realize that they're not remote at all. They're homelands of somebody. They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time. And for all of us  the dreams of these children  like the dreams of our own children  become part of the naked geography of hope. So  what we're trying to do at the National Geographic  finally  is  we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything. We think that polemics    we think that polemics are not persuasive  but we think that storytelling can change the world  and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world. We get    million hits on our website every month.     nations carry our television channel. Our magazines are read by millions. And what we're doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen  and hopefully  therefore  embrace gradually  one by one  the central revelation of anthropology  that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way  that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural  pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well being. Thank you very much. If you take        people at random        have something in common  their interests in business lie on or near the Earth's surface. The odd one out is an astronomer  and I am one of that strange breed. My talk will be in two parts. I'll talk first as an astronomer  and then as a worried member of the human race. But let's start off by remembering that Darwin showed how we're the outcome of four billion years of evolution. And what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology is to go back before Darwin's simple beginning  to set our Earth in a cosmic context. And let me just run through a few slides. This was the impact that happened last week on a comet. If they'd sent a nuke  it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last Monday. So that's another project for NASA. That's Mars from the European Mars Express  and at New Year. This artist's impression turned into reality when a parachute landed on Titan  Saturn's giant moon. It landed on the surface. This is pictures taken on the way down. That looks like a coastline. It is indeed  but the ocean is liquid methane    the temperature minus     degrees centigrade. If we go beyond our solar system  we've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light. Each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it. And we can see places where stars are forming  like the Eagle Nebula. We see stars dying. In six billion years  the sun will look like that. And some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion  leaving remnants like that. On a still bigger scale  we see entire galaxies of stars. We see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled. And to the cosmologist  these galaxies are just the atoms  as it were  of the large scale universe. This picture shows a patch of sky so small that it would take about     patches like it to cover the full moon in the sky. Through a small telescope  this would look quite blank  but you see here hundreds of little  faint smudges. Each is a galaxy  fully like ours or Andromeda  which looks so small and faint because its light has taken    billion light years to get to us. The stars in those galaxies probably don't have planets around them. There's scant chance of life there    that's because there's been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron  the building blocks of planets and of life. We believe that all of this emerged from a Big Bang    a hot  dense state. So how did that amorphous Big Bang turn into our complex cosmos  I'm going to show you a movie simulation    powers of    faster than real time  which shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out. But you see  as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom  you will see structures evolve as gravity feeds on small  dense irregularities  and structures develop. And we'll end up after    billion years with something looking rather like our own universe. And we compare simulated universes like that    I'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk    with what we actually see in the sky. Well  we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the Big Bang  but we still don't know what banged and why it banged. That's a challenge for   st century science. If my research group had a logo  it would be this picture here  an ouroboros  where you see the micro world on the left    the world of the quantum    and on the right the large scale universe of planets  stars and galaxies. We know our universes are united though    links between left and right. The everyday world is determined by atoms  how they stick together to make molecules. Stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together. And  as we've learned in the last few years  galaxies are held together by the gravitational pull of so called dark matter  particles in huge swarms  far smaller even than atomic nuclei. But we'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top. The micro world of the quantum is understood. On the right hand side  gravity holds sway. Einstein explained that. But the unfinished business for   st century science is to link together cosmos and micro world with a unified theory    symbolized  as it were  gastronomically at the top of that picture.  Laughter  And until we have that synthesis  we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an atom  quantum effects could shake everything. And so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small  which we don't yet have. One idea  incidentally    and I had this hazard sign to say I'm going to speculate from now on    is that our Big Bang was not the only one. One idea is that our three dimensional universe may be embedded in a high dimensional space  just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper. You can imagine ants on one of them thinking it's a two dimensional universe  not being aware of another population of ants on the other. So there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours  but we're not aware of it because that millimeter is measured in some fourth spatial dimension  and we're imprisoned in our three. And so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality than what we've normally called our universe    the aftermath of our Big Bang. And here's another picture. Bottom right depicts our universe  which on the horizon is not beyond that  but even that is just one bubble  as it were  in some vaster reality. Many people suspect that just as we've gone from believing in one solar system to zillions of solar systems  one galaxy to many galaxies  we have to go to many Big Bangs from one Big Bang  perhaps these many Big Bangs displaying an immense variety of properties. Well  let's go back to this picture. There's one challenge symbolized at the top  but there's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom. You want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small  but we want to understand the very complex. And the most complex things are ourselves  midway between atoms and stars. We depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of. We depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure. We clearly have to be large  compared to atoms  to have layer upon layer of complex structure. We clearly have to be small  compared to stars and planets    otherwise we'd be crushed by gravity. And in fact  we are midway. It would take as many human bodies to make up the sun as there are atoms in each of us. The geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is    kilograms  within a factor of two of the mass of each person here. Well  most of you anyway. The science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all  greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right. And it's this science  which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world  but also transforming our world faster than ever. And more than that  it's engendering new kinds of change. And I now move on to the second part of my talk  and the book  Our Final Century  was mentioned. If I was not a self effacing Brit  I would mention the book myself  and I would add that it's available in paperback. And in America it was called  Our Final Hour  because Americans like instant gratification. But my theme is that in this century  not only has science changed the world faster than ever  but in new and different ways. Targeted drugs  genetic modification  artificial intelligence  perhaps even implants into our brains  may change human beings themselves. And human beings  their physique and character  has not changed for thousands of years. It may change this century. It's new in our history. And the human impact on the global environment    greenhouse warming  mass extinctions and so forth    is unprecedented  too. And so  this makes this coming century a challenge. Bio  and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign in that they offer marvelous prospects  while  nonetheless  reducing pressure on energy and resources. But they will have a dark side. In our interconnected world  novel technology could empower just one fanatic  or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses  to trigger some kind on disaster. Indeed  catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure    error rather than terror. And even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable when the downside could be of global consequence. In fact  some years ago  Bill Joy wrote an article expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over  etc. I don't go along with all that  but it's interesting that he had a simple solution. It was what he called  fine grained relinquishment.  He wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science and keep the good bits. Now  that's absurdly naive for two reasons. First  any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones. And also  when a scientist makes a discovery  he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be. And so what this means is that we have to accept the risks if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science. We have to accept that there will be hazards. And I think we have to go back to what happened in the post War era  post World War II  when the nuclear scientists who'd been involved in making the atomic bomb  in many cases were concerned that they should do all they could to alert the world to the dangers. And they were inspired not by the young Einstein  who did the great work in relativity  but by the old Einstein  the icon of poster and t shirt  who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws. He was premature. But he was a moral compass    an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control. And perhaps the greatest living person is someone I'm privileged to know  Joe Rothblatt. Equally untidy office there  as you can see. He's    years old  and he founded the Pugwash movement. He persuaded Einstein  as his last act  to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell. And he sets an example of the concerned scientist. And I think to harness science optimally  to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed  we need latter day counterparts of people like Joseph Rothblatt. We need not just campaigning physicists  but we need biologists  computer experts and environmentalists as well. And I think academics and independent entrepreneurs have a special obligation because they have more freedom than those in government service  or company employees subject to commercial pressure. I wrote my book   Our Final Century   as a scientist  just a general scientist. But there's one respect  I think  in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective  and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future. The stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture    outside the American Bible Belt  anyway    but most people  even those who are familiar with evolution  aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead. The sun has been shining for four and a half billion years  but it'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out. On that schematic picture  a sort of time lapse picture  we're halfway. And it'll be another six billion before that happens  and any remaining life on Earth is vaporized. There's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there  experiencing the sun's demise  but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria. The unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go  here on Earth and probably far beyond. So we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity in our Earth and beyond. If you represent the Earth's lifetime by a single year  say from January when it was made to December  the   st century would be a quarter of a second in June    a tiny fraction of the year. But even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective  our century is very  very special  the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet. As I should have shown this earlier  it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun  it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria. When Einstein died in       one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon by Herblock in the Washington Post. The plaque reads   Albert Einstein lived here.  And I'd like to end with a vignette  as it were  inspired by this image. We've been familiar for    years with this image  the fragile beauty of land  ocean and clouds  contrasted with the sterile moonscape on which the astronauts left their footprints. But let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar  not just for    years  but for the entire  .  billion year history of our Earth. What would they have seen  Over nearly all that immense time  Earth's appearance would have changed very gradually. The only abrupt worldwide change would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super eruptions. Apart from those brief traumas  nothing happens suddenly. The continental landmasses drifted around. Ice cover waxed and waned. Successions of new species emerged  evolved and became extinct. But in just a tiny sliver of the Earth's history  the last one millionth part  a few thousand years  the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before. This signaled the start of agriculture. Change has accelerated as human populations rose. Then other things happened even more abruptly. Within just    years    that's one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth's age    the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise  and ominously fast. The planet became an intense emitter of radio waves    the total output from all TV and cell phones and radar transmissions. And something else happened. Metallic objects    albeit very small ones  a few tons at most    escaped into orbit around the Earth. Some journeyed to the moons and planets. A race of advanced extraterrestrials watching our solar system from afar could confidently predict Earth's final doom in another six billion years. But could they have predicted this unprecedented spike less than halfway through the Earth's life  These human induced alterations occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime and seemingly occurring with runaway speed  If they continued their vigil  what might these hypothetical aliens witness in the next hundred years  Will some spasm foreclose Earth's future  Or will the biosphere stabilize  Or will some of the metallic objects launched from the Earth spawn new oases  a post human life elsewhere  The science done by the young Einstein will continue as long as our civilization  but for civilization to survive  we'll need the wisdom of the old Einstein    humane  global and farseeing. And whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the Earth  far beyond the Earth as depicted here. Thank you very much. I've got apparently    minutes to convince you that history has a direction  an arrow  that in some fundamental sense  it's good  that the arrow points to something positive. Now  when the TED people first approached me about giving this upbeat talk       that was before the cartoon of Muhammad had triggered global rioting. It was before the avian flu had reached Europe. It was before Hamas had won the Palestinian election  eliciting various counter measures by Israel. And to be honest  if I had known when I was asked to give this upbeat talk that even as I was giving the upbeat talk  the apocalypse would be unfolding       I might have said   Is it okay if I talk about something else   But I didn't  OK. So we're here. I'll do what I can. I'll do what I can. I've got to warn you  the sense in which my worldview is upbeat has always been kind of subtle  sometimes even elusive. The sense in which I can be uplifting and inspiring    I mean  there's always been a kind of a certain grim dimension to the way I try to uplift  so if grim inspiration       if grim inspiration is not a contradiction in terms  that is  I'm afraid  the most you can hope for. OK  today    that's if I succeed. I'll see what I can do. OK  Now  in one sense  the claim that history has a direction is not that controversial. If you're just talking about social structure  OK  clearly that's gotten more complex a little over the last        years    has reached higher and higher levels. And in fact  that's actually sustaining a long standing trend that predates human beings  OK  that biological evolution was doing for us. Because what happened in the beginning  this stuff encases itself in a cell  then cells start hanging out together in societies. Eventually they get so close  they form multicellular organisms  then you get complex multicellular organisms  they form societies. But then at some point  one of these multicellular organisms does something completely amazing with this stuff  which is it launches a whole second kind of evolution  cultural evolution. And amazingly  that evolution sustains the trajectory that biological evolution had established toward greater complexity. By cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas. A lot of you have heard the term  memes.  The evolution of technology  I pay a lot of attention to  so  you know  one of the first things you got was a little hand axe. Generations go by  somebody says  hey  why don't we put it on a stick  Just absolutely delights the little ones. Next best thing to a video game. This may not seem to impress  but technological evolution is progressive  so another            years  and armaments technology takes you here. Impressive. And the rate of technological evolution speeds up  so a mere quarter of a century after this  you get this  OK. And this. I'm sorry    it was a cheap laugh  but I wanted to find a way to transition back to this idea of the unfolding apocalypse  and I thought that might do it. So  what threatens to happen with this unfolding apocalypse is the collapse of global social organization. Now  first let me remind you how much work it took to get us where we are  to be on the brink of true global social organization. Originally  you had the most complex societies  the hunter gatherer village. Stonehenge is the remnant of a chiefdom  which is what you get with the invention of agriculture  multi village polity with centralized rule. With the invention of writing  you start getting cities. This is blurry. I kind of like that because it makes it look like a one celled organism and reminds you how many levels organic organization has already moved through to get to this point. And then you get to  you know  you get empires. I want to stress  you know  social organization can transcend political bounds. This is the Silk Road connecting the Chinese Empire and the Roman Empire. So you had social complexity spanning the whole continent  even if no polity did similarly. Today  you've got nation states. Point is  there's obviously collaboration and organization going on beyond national bounds. This is actually just a picture of the earth at night  and I'm just putting it up because I think it's pretty. Does kind of convey the sense that this is an integrated system. Now  I explained this growth of complexity by reference to something called  non zero sumness.  Assuming that a few of you did not do the assigned reading  very quickly  the key idea is the distinction between zero sum games  in which correlations are inverse  always a winner and a loser. Non zero sum games in which correlations can be positive  OK. So like in tennis  usually it's win lose  it always adds up to zero zero sum. But if you're playing doubles  the person on your side of the net  they're in the same boat as you  so you're playing a non zero sum game with them. It's either for the better or for the worse  OK. A lot of forms of non zero sum behavior in the realm of economics and so on in everyday life often leads to cooperation. The argument I make is basically that  well  non zero sum games have always been part of life. You have them in hunter gatherer societies  but then through technological evolution  new forms of technology arise that facilitate or encourage the playing of non zero sum games  involving more people over larger territory. Social structure adapts to accommodate this possibility and to harness this productive potential  so you get cities  you know  and you get all the non zero sum games you don't think about that are being played across the world. Like  have you ever thought when you buy a car  how many people on how many different continents contributed to the manufacture of that car  Those are people in effect you're playing a non zero sum game with. I mean  there are certainly plenty of them around. Now  this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way  because when you think of non zero  you think win win  you know  that's good. Well  there are a few reasons that actually it's not intrinsically upbeat. First of all  it can accommodate  it doesn't deny the existence of inequality exploitation war. But there's a more fundamental reason that it's not intrinsically upbeat  because a non zero sum game  all it tells you for sure is that the fortunes will be correlated for better or worse. It doesn't necessarily predict a win win outcome. So  in a way  the question is  on what grounds am I upbeat at all about history  And the answer is  first of all  on balance I would say people have played their games to more win win outcomes than lose lose outcomes. On balance  I think history is a net positive in the non zero sum game department. And a testament to this is the thing that most amazes me  most impresses me  and most uplifts me  which is that there is a moral dimension to history  there is a moral arrow. We have seen moral progress over time.       years ago  members of one Greek city state considered members of another Greek city state subhuman and treated them that way. And then this moral revolution arrived  and they decided that actually  no  Greeks are human beings. It's just the Persians who aren't fully human and don't deserve to be treated very nicely. But this was progress    you know  give them credit. And now today  we've seen more progress. I think    I hope    most people here would say that all people everywhere are human beings  deserve to be treated decently  unless they do something horrendous  regardless of race or religion. And you have to read your ancient history to realize what a revolution that has been  OK. This was not a prevalent view  few thousand years ago  and I attribute it to this non zero sum dynamic. I think that's the reason there is as much tolerance toward nationalities  ethnicities  religions as there is today. If you asked me  you know  why am I not in favor of bombing Japan  well  I'm only half joking when I say they built my car. We have this non zero sum relationship  and I think that does lead to a kind of a tolerance to the extent that you realize that someone else's welfare is positively correlated with yours    you're more likely to cut them a break. I kind of think this is a kind of a business class morality. Unfortunately  I don't fly trans Atlantic business class often enough to know  or any other kind of business class really  but I assume that in business class  you don't hear many expressions of  you know  bigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups  because the people who are flying trans Atlantic business class are doing business with all these people  they're making money off all these people. And I really do think that  in that sense at least  capitalism has been a constructive force  and more fundamentally  it's a non zero sumness that has been a constructive force in expanding people's realm of moral awareness. I think the non zero sum dynamic  which is not only economic by any means    it's not always commerce    but it has driven us to the verge of a moral truth  which is the fundamental equality of everyone. It has done that. As it has moved global  moved us toward a global level of social organization  it has driven us toward moral truth. I think that's wonderful. Now  back to the unfolding apocalypse. And you may wonder  OK  that's all fine  sounds great    moral direction in history    but what about this so called clash of civilizations  Well  first of all  I would emphasize that it fits into the non zero sum framework  OK. If you look at the relationship between the so called Muslim world and Western world    two terms I don't like  but can't really avoid  in such a short span of time  they're efficient if nothing else    it is non zero sum. And by that I mean  if people in the Muslim world get more hateful  more resentful  less happy with their place in the world  it'll be bad for the West. If they get more happy  it'll be good for the West. So that is a non zero sum dynamic. And I would say the non zero sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time because of technological trends  but more intense in a kind of negative way. It's the downside correlation of their fortunes that will become more and more possible. And one reason is because of something I call the  growing lethality of hatred.  More and more  it's possible for grassroots hatred abroad to manifest itself in the form of organized violence on American soil. And that's pretty new  and I think it's probably going to get a lot worse    this capacity    because of trends in information technology  in technologies that can be used for purposes of munitions like biotechnology and nanotechnology. We may be hearing more about that today. And there's something I worry about especially  which is that this dynamic will lead to a kind of a feedback cycle that puts us on a slippery slope. What I have in mind is  terrorism happens here  we overreact to it. That  you know  we're not sufficiently surgical in our retaliation leads to more hatred abroad  more terrorism. We overreact because being human  we feel like retaliating  and it gets worse and worse and worse. You could call this the positive feedback of negative vibes  but I think in something so spooky  we really shouldn't have the word positive there at all  even in a technical sense. So let's call it the death spiral of negativity. I assure you if it happens  at the end  both the West and the Muslim world will have suffered. So  what do we do  Well  first of all  we can do a lot more with arms control  the international regulation of dangerous technologies. I have a whole global governance sermon that I will spare you right now  because I don't think that's going to be enough anyway  although it's essential. I think we're going to have to have a major round of moral progress in the world. I think you're just going to have to see less hatred among groups  less bigotry  and  you know  racial groups  religious groups  whatever. I've got to admit I feel silly saying that. It sounds so kind of Pollyannaish. I feel like Rodney King  you know  saying  why can't we all just get along  But hey  I don't really see any alternative  given the way I read the situation. There's going to have to be moral progress. There's going to have to be a lessening of the amount of hatred in the world  given how dangerous it's becoming. In my defense  I'd say  as naive as this may sound  it's ultimately grounded in cynicism. That is to say       thank you  thank you. That is to say  remember  my whole view of morality is that it boils down to self interest. It's when people's fortunes are correlated. It's when your welfare conduces to mine  that I decide  oh yeah  I'm all in favor of your welfare. That's what's responsible for this growth of this moral progress so far  and I'm saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes  and if people respond to it intelligently  we will see the development of tolerance and so on    the norms that we need  you know. We will see the further evolution of this kind of business class morality. So  these two things  you know  if they get people's attention and drive home the positive correlation and people do what's in their self interests  which is further the moral evolution  then they could actually have a constructive effect. And that's why I lump growing lethality of hatred and death spiral of negativity under the general rubric  reasons to be cheerful. Doing the best I can  OK. I never called myself Mr. Uplift. I'm just doing what I can here. Now  launching a moral revolution has got to be hard  right  I mean  what do you do  And I think the answer is a lot of different people are going to have to do a lot of different things. We all start where we are. Speaking as an American who has children whose security            years down the road I worry about    what I personally want to start out doing is figuring out why so many people around the world hate us  OK. I think that's a worthy research project myself. I also like it because it's an intrinsically kind of morally redeeming exercise. Because to understand why somebody in a very different culture does something    somebody you're kind of viewing as alien  who's doing things you consider strange in a culture you consider strange    to really understand why they do the things they do is a morally redeeming accomplishment  because you've got to relate their experience to yours. To really understand it  you've got to say   Oh  I get it. So when they feel resentful  it's kind of like the way I feel resentful when this happens  and for somewhat the same reasons.  That's true understanding. And I think that is an expansion of your moral compass when you manage to do that. It's especially hard to do when people hate you  OK  because you don't really  in a sense  want to completely understand why people hate you. I mean  you want to hear the reason  but you don't want to be able to relate to it. You don't want it to make sense  right   Laughter  You don't want to say   Well  yeah  I can kind of understand how a human being in those circumstances would hate the country I live in.  That's not a pleasant thing  but I think it's something that we're going to have to get used to and work on. Now  I want to stress that to understand  you know    there are people who don't like this whole business of understanding the grassroots  the root causes of things  they don't want to know why people hate us. I want to understand it. The reason you're trying to understand why they hate us  is to get them to quit hating us. The idea when you go through this moral exercise of really coming to appreciate their humanity and better understand them  is part of an effort to get them to appreciate your humanity in the long run. I think it's the first step toward that. That's the long term goal. There are people who worry about this  and in fact  I  myself  apparently  was denounced on national TV a couple of nights ago because of an op ed I'd written. It was kind of along these lines  and the allegation was that I have  quote   affection for terrorists.  Now  the good news is that the person who said it was Ann Coulter. I mean  if you've got to have an enemy  do make it Ann Coulter. But it's not a crazy concern  OK  because understanding behavior can lead to a kind of empathy  and it can make it a little harder to deliver tough love  and so on. But I think we're a lot closer to erring on the side of not comprehending the situation clearly enough  than in comprehending it so clearly that we just can't  you know  get the army out to kill terrorists. So I'm not really worried about it. So       I mean  we're going to have to work on a lot of fronts  but if we succeed    if we succeed    then once again  non zero sumness and the recognition of non zero sum dynamics will have forced us to a higher moral level. And a kind of saving higher moral level  something that kind of literally saves the world. If you look at the word  salvation  in the Bible    the Christian usage that we're familiar with    saving souls  that people go to heaven    that's actually a latecomer. The original meaning of the word  salvation  in the Bible is about saving the social system.  Yahweh is our Savior  means  He has saved the nation of Israel   which at the time  was a pretty high level social organization. Now  social organization has reached the global level  and I guess  if there's good news I can say I'm bringing you  it's just that all the salvation of the world requires is the intelligent pursuit of self interests in a disciplined and careful way. It's going to be hard. I say we give it a shot anyway because we've just come too far to screw it up now. Thanks. If you haven't ordered yet  I generally find the rigatoni with the spicy tomato sauce goes best with diseases of the small intestine. So  sorry    it just feels like I should be doing stand up up here because of the setting. No  what I want to do is take you back to      in London for the next few minutes  and tell the story    in brief    of this outbreak  which in many ways  I think  helped create the world that we live in today  and particularly the kind of city that we live in today. This period in       in the middle part of the   th century  in London's history  is incredibly interesting for a number of reasons. But I think the most important one is that London was this city of  .  million people  and it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point. But it was also the largest city that had ever been built. And so the Victorians were trying to live through and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living  this scale of living that we  you know  now call  metropolitan living.  And it was in many ways  at this point in the mid     s  a complete disaster. They were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with an Elizabethan public infrastructure. So people  for instance  just to gross you out for a second  had cesspools of human waste in their basement. Like  a foot to two feet deep. And they would just kind of throw the buckets down there and hope that it would somehow go away  and of course it never really would go away. And all of this stuff  basically  had accumulated to the point where the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in. It was an amazingly smelly city. Not just because of the cesspools  but also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people. Not just the horses  but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk  that they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic until literally their milk ran out and they died  and then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street. So  you would just walk around London at this point and just be overwhelmed with this stench. And what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system became convinced that it was the smell that was killing everybody  that was creating these diseases that would wipe through the city every three or four years. And cholera was really the great killer of this period. It arrived in London in       and every four or five years another epidemic would take                people in London and throughout the U.K. And so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem. We had to get rid of the smell. And so  in fact  they concocted a couple of early  you know  founding public health interventions in the system of the city  one of which was called the  Nuisances Act   which they got everybody as far as they could to empty out their cesspools and just pour all that waste into the river. Because if we get it out of the streets  it'll smell much better  and    oh right  we drink from the river. So what ended up happening  actually  is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera because  as we now know  cholera is actually in the water. It's a waterborne disease  not something that's in the air. It's not something you smell or inhale  it's something you ingest. And so one of the founding moments of public health in the   th century effectively poisoned the water supply of London much more effectively than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing. So this was the state of London in       and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions  and in the midst of all this scientific confusion about what was actually killing people  it was a very talented classic   th century multi disciplinarian named John Snow  who was a local doctor in Soho in London  who had been arguing for about four or five years that cholera was  in fact  a waterborne disease  and had basically convinced nobody of this. The public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say. And he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies  but nothing had really stuck. And part of    what's so interesting about this story to me is that in some ways  it's a great case study in how cultural change happens  how a good idea eventually comes to win out over much worse ideas. And Snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored. And then on one day  August   th of       a young child  a five month old girl whose first name we don't know  we know her only as Baby Lewis  somehow contracted cholera  came down with cholera at    Broad Street. You can't really see it in this map  but this is the map that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book. It's in the middle of Soho  in this working class neighborhood  this little girl becomes sick and it turns out that the cesspool  that they still continue to have  despite the Nuisances Act  bordered on an extremely popular water pump  local watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of Soho  that all the residents from Soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to. And so this little girl inadvertently ended up contaminating the water in this popular pump  and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of England erupted about two or three days later. Literally     percent of the neighborhood died in seven days  and much more would have died if people hadn't fled after the initial outbreak kicked in. So it was this incredibly terrifying event. You had these scenes of entire families dying over the course of    hours of cholera  alone in their one room apartments  in their little flats. Just an extraordinary  terrifying scene. Snow lived near there  heard about the outbreak  and in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast because he thought an outbreak that concentrated could actually potentially end up convincing people that  in fact  the real menace of cholera was in the water supply and not in the air. He suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably involve a single point source. One single thing that everybody was going to because it didn't have the traditional slower path of infections that you might expect. And so he went right in there and started interviewing people. He eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure  who's kind of the other protagonist of the book    this guy  Henry Whitehead  who was a local minister  who was not at all a man of science  but was incredibly socially connected  he knew everybody in the neighborhood. And he managed to track down  Whitehead did  many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump  or who hadn't drunk water from the pump. And eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak. He found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick. People who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick. And he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods  people who hadn't  you know  percentages of people who hadn't  but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see. Something that would take in a sense a higher level view of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood. And so he created this map  which basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods as black bars at each address. And you can see in this map  the pump right at the center of it and you can see that one of the residences down the way had about    people dead. And the map is actually a little bit bigger. As you get further and further away from the pump  the deaths begin to grow less and less frequent. And so you can see this something poisonous emanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance. And so  with the help of this map  and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that Whitehead did  eventually  actually  the authorities slowly started to come around. It took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story  but by       when the next big cholera outbreak came to London  the authorities had been convinced    in part because of this story  in part because of this map    that in fact the water was the problem. And they had already started building the sewers in London  and they immediately went to this outbreak and they told everybody to start boiling their water. And that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since. So  part of this story  I think    well  it's a terrifying story  it's a very dark story and it's a story that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world. It's also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic  which is to say that it's possible to solve these problems if we listen to reason  if we listen to the kind of wisdom of these kinds of maps  if we listen to people like Snow and Whitehead  if we listen to the locals who understand what's going on in these kinds of situations. And what it ended up doing is making the idea of large scale metropolitan living a sustainable one. When people were looking at    percent of their neighborhoods dying in the space of seven days  there was a widespread consensus that this couldn't go on  that people weren't meant to live in cities of  .  million people. But because of what Snow did  because of this map  because of the whole series of reforms that happened in the wake of this map  we now take for granted that cities have    million people  cities like this one are in fact sustainable things. We don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself quite the way that  you know  Rome did  and be    percent of its size in     years or     years. And so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map. It's a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life  the life that we're enjoying here today. Thank you very much. What I'm going to do  in the spirit of collaborative creativity  is simply repeat many of the points that the three people before me have already made  but do them    this is called  creative collaboration   it's actually called  borrowing     but do it through a particular perspective  and that is to ask about the role of users and consumers in this emerging world of collaborative creativity that Jimmy and others have talked about. Let me just ask you  to start with  this simple question  who invented the mountain bike  Because traditional economic theory would say  well  the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big R D lab where they were thinking up new projects  and it came out of there. It didn't come from there. Another answer might be  well  it came from a sort of lone genius working in his garage  who  working away on different kinds of bikes  comes up with a bike out of thin air. It didn't come from there. The mountain bike came from users  came from young users  particularly a group in Northern California  who were frustrated with traditional racing bikes  which were those sort of bikes that Eddy Merckx rode  or your big brother  and they're very glamorous. But also frustrated with the bikes that your dad rode  which sort of had big handlebars like that  and they were too heavy. So  they got the frames from these big bikes  put them together with the gears from the racing bikes  got the brakes from motorcycles  and sort of mixed and matched various ingredients. And for the first  I don't know  three to five years of their life  mountain bikes were known as  clunkers.  And they were just made in a community of bikers  mainly in Northern California. And then one of these companies that was importing parts for the clunkers decided to set up in business  start selling them to other people  and gradually another company emerged out of that  Marin  and it probably was  I don't know      maybe even     years  before the big bike companies realized there was a market. Thirty years later  mountain bike sales and mountain bike equipment account for    percent of bike sales in America. That's    billion dollars. This is a category entirely created by consumers that would not have been created by the mainstream bike market because they couldn't see the need  the opportunity  they didn't have the incentive to innovate. The one thing I think I disagree with about Yochai's presentation is when he said the Internet causes this distributive capacity for innovation to come alive. It's when the Internet combines with these kinds of passionate pro am consumers    who are knowledgeable  they've got the incentive to innovate  they've got the tools  they want to    that you get this kind of explosion of creative collaboration. And out of that  you get the need for the kind of things that Jimmy was talking about  which is our new kinds of organization  or a better way to put it  how do we organize ourselves without organizations  That's now possible  you don't need an organization to be organized  to achieve large and complex tasks  like innovating new software programs. So this is a huge challenge to the way we think creativity comes about. The traditional view  still enshrined in much of the way that we think about creativity    in organizations  in government    is that creativity is about special people  wear baseball caps the wrong way round  come to conferences like this  in special places  elite universities  R D labs in the forests  water  maybe special rooms in companies painted funny colors  you know  bean bags  maybe the odd table football table. Special people  special places  think up special ideas  then you have a pipeline that takes the ideas down to the waiting consumers  who are passive. They can say  yes  or  no  to the invention. That's the idea of creativity. What's the policy recommendation out of that if you're in government  or you're running a large company  More special people  more special places. Build creative clusters in cities  create more R D parks  so on and so forth. Expand the pipeline down to the consumers. Well this view  I think  is increasingly wrong. I think it's always been wrong  because I think always creativity has been highly collaborative  and it's probably been largely interactive. But it's increasingly wrong  and one of the reasons it's wrong is that the ideas are flowing back up the pipeline. The ideas are coming back from the consumers  and they're often ahead of the producers. Why is that  Well  one issue is that radical innovation  when you've got ideas that affect a large number of technologies or people  have a great deal of uncertainty attached to them. The payoffs to innovation are greatest where the uncertainty is highest. And when you get a radical innovation  it's often very uncertain how it can be applied. The whole history of telephony is a story of dealing with that uncertainty. The very first landline telephones  the inventors thought that they would be used for people to listen in to live performances from West End theaters. When the mobile telephone companies invented SMS  they had no idea what it was for  it was only when that technology got into the hands of teenage users that they invented the use. So the more radical the innovation  the more the uncertainty  the more you need innovation in use to work out what a technology is for. All of our patents  our entire approach to patents and invention  is based on the idea that the inventor knows what the invention is for  we can say what it's for. More and more  the inventors of things will not be able to say that in advance. It will be worked out in use  in collaboration with users. We like to think that invention is a sort of moment of creation  there is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea. The truth is that most creativity is cumulative and collaborative  like Wikipedia  it develops over a long period of time. The second reason why users are more and more important is that they are the source of big  disruptive innovations. If you want to find the big new ideas  it's often difficult to find them in mainstream markets  in big organizations. And just look inside large organizations and you'll see why that is so. So  you're in a big corporation. You're obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder. Do you go into your board and say   Look  I've got a fantastic idea for an embryonic product in a marginal market  with consumers we've never dealt with before  and I'm not sure it's going to have a big payoff  but it could be really  really big in the future   No  what you do  is you go in and you say   I've got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovation to an existing product we sell through existing channels to existing users  and I can guarantee you get this much return out of it over the next three years.  Big corporations have an in built tendency to reinforce past success. They've got so much sunk in it that it's very difficult for them to spot emerging new markets. Emerging new markets  then  are the breeding grounds for passionate users. Best example  who in the music industry     years ago  would have said   Yes  let's invent a musical form which is all about dispossessed black men in ghettos expressing their frustration with the world through a form of music that many people find initially quite difficult to listen to. That sounds like a winner  we'll go with it.  So what happens  Rap music is created by the users. They do it on their own tapes  with their own recording equipment  they distribute it themselves.    years later  rap music is the dominant musical form of popular culture    would never have come from the big companies. Had to start    this is the third point    with these pro ams. This is the phrase that I've used in some stuff which I've done with a think tank in London called Demos  where we've been looking at these people who are amateurs    i.e.  they do it for the love of it    but they want to do it to very high standards. And across a whole range of fields    from software  astronomy  natural sciences  vast areas of leisure and culture like kite surfing  so on and so forth    you find people who want to do things because they love it  but they want to do these things to very high standards. They work at their leisure  if you like. They take their leisure very seriously  they acquire skills  they invest time  they use technology that's getting cheaper    it's not just the Internet  cameras  design technology  leisure technology  surfboards  so on and so forth. Largely through globalization  a lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper. More knowledgeable consumers  more educated  more able to connect with one another  more able to do things together. Consumption  in that sense  is an expression of their productive potential. Why  we found  people were interested in this  is that at work they don't feel very expressed. They don't feel as if they're doing something that really matters to them  so they pick up these kinds of activities. This has huge organizational implications for very large areas of life. Take astronomy as an example  which Yochai has already mentioned. Twenty years ago     years ago  only big professional astronomers with very big telescopes could see far into space. And there's a big telescope in Northern England called Jodrell Bank  and when I was a kid  it was amazing  because the moon shots would take off  and this thing would move on rails. And it was huge    it was absolutely enormous. Now  six amateur astronomers  working with the Internet  with Dobsonian digital telescopes    which are pretty much open source    with some light sensors developed over the last    years  the Internet    they can do what Jodrell Bank could only do    years ago. So here in astronomy  you have this vast explosion of new productive resources. The users can be producers. What does this mean  then  for our organizational landscape  Well  just imagine a world  for the moment  divided into two camps. Over here  you've got the old  traditional corporate model  special people  special places  patent it  push it down the pipeline to largely waiting  passive consumers. Over here  let's imagine we've got Wikipedia  Linux  and beyond    open source. This is open  this is closed. This is new  this is traditional. Well  the first thing you can say  I think with certainty  is what Yochai has said already    is there is a great big struggle between those two organizational forms. These people over there will do everything they can to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding  because they're threatened by them. And so the debates about copyright  digital rights  so on and so forth    these are all about trying to stifle  in my view  these kinds of organizations. What we're seeing is a complete corruption of the idea of patents and copyright. Meant to be a way to incentivize invention  meant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge  they are increasingly being used by large companies to create thickets of patents to prevent innovation taking place. Let me just give you two examples. The first is  imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist and saying   I've got a fantastic idea. I've invented this brilliant new program that is much  much better than Microsoft Outlook.  Which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture competing with Microsoft  with Microsoft Outlook  No one. That is why the competition with Microsoft is bound to come    will only come    from an open source kind of project. So  there is a huge competitive argument about sustaining the capacity for open source and consumer driven innovation  because it's one of the greatest competitive levers against monopoly. There'll be huge professional arguments as well. Because the professionals  over here in these closed organizations    they might be academics  they might be programmers  they might be doctors  they might be journalists    my former profession    say   No  no    you can't trust these people over here.  When I started in journalism    Financial Times     years ago    it was very  very exciting to see someone reading the newspaper. And you'd kind of look over their shoulder on the Tube to see if they were reading your article. Usually they were reading the share prices  and the bit of the paper with your article on was on the floor  or something like that  and you know   For heaven's sake  what are they doing  They're not reading my brilliant article   And we allowed users  readers  two places where they could contribute to the paper  the letters page  where they could write a letter in  and we would condescend to them  cut it in half  and print it three days later. Or the op ed page  where if they knew the editor    had been to school with him  slept with his wife    they could write an article for the op ed page. Those were the two places. Shock  horror  now  the readers want to be writers and publishers. That's not their role  they're supposed to read what we write. But they don't want to be journalists. The journalists think that the bloggers want to be journalists  they don't want to be journalists  they just want to have a voice. They want to  as Jimmy said  they want to have a dialogue  a conversation. They want to be part of that flow of information. What's happening there is that the whole domain of creativity is expanding. So  there's going to be a tremendous struggle. But  also  there's going to be tremendous movement from the open to the closed. What you'll see  I think  is two things that are critical  and these  I think  are two challenges for the open movement. The first is  can we really survive on volunteers  If this is so critical  do we not need it funded  organized  supported in much more structured ways  I think the idea of creating the Red Cross for information and knowledge is a fantastic idea  but can we really organize that  just on volunteers  What kind of changes do we need in public policy and funding to make that possible  What's the role of the BBC  for instance  in that world  What should be the role of public policy  And finally  what I think you will see is the intelligent  closed organizations moving increasingly in the open direction. So it's not going to be a contest between two camps  but  in between them  you'll find all sorts of interesting places that people will occupy. New organizational models coming about  mixing closed and open in tricky ways. It won't be so clear cut  it won't be Microsoft versus Linux    there'll be all sorts of things in between. And those organizational models  it turns out  are incredibly powerful  and the people who can understand them will be very  very successful. Let me just give you one final example of what that means. I was in Shanghai  in an office block built on what was a rice paddy five years ago    one of the       skyscrapers they've built in Shanghai in the last    years. And I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan. Timothy Chan set up an Internet business in     . Didn't go into the Internet  kept his money  decided to go into computer games. He runs a company called Shanda  which is the largest computer games company in China. Nine thousand servers all over China  has     million subscribers. At any one time  there are four million people playing one of his games. How many people does he employ to service that population      people. Well  how can he service     million people from     employees  Because basically  he doesn't service them. He gives them a platform  he gives them some rules  he gives them the tools and then he kind of orchestrates the conversation  he orchestrates the action. But actually  a lot of the content is created by the users themselves. And it creates a kind of stickiness between the community and the company which is really  really powerful. The best measure of that  so you go into one of his games  you create a character that you develop in the course of the game. If  for some reason  your credit card bounces  or there's some other problem  you lose your character. You've got two options. One option  you can create a new character  right from scratch  but with none of the history of your player. That costs about     dollars. Or you can get on a plane  fly to Shanghai  queue up outside Shanda's offices    cost probably          dollars    and reclaim your character  get your history back. Every morning  there are     people queuing outside their offices to reclaim these characters.  Laughter  So this is about companies built on communities  that provide communities with tools  resources  platforms in which they can share. He's not open source  but it's very  very powerful. So here is one of the challenges  I think  for people like me  who do a lot of work with government. If you're a games company  and you've got a million players in your game  you only need one percent of them to be co developers  contributing ideas  and you've got a development workforce of        people. Imagine you could take all the children in education in Britain  and one percent of them were co developers of education. What would that do to the resources available to the education system  Or if you got one percent of the patients in the NHS to  in some sense  be co producers of health. The reason why    despite all the efforts to cut it down  to constrain it  to hold it back    why these open models will still start emerging with tremendous force  is that they multiply our productive resources. And one of the reasons they do that is that they turn users into producers  consumers into designers. Thank you very much.
