Ten years ago exactly  I was in Afghanistan. I was covering the war in Afghanistan  and I witnessed  as a reporter for Al Jazeera  the amount of suffering and destruction that emerged out of a war like that. Then  two years later  I covered another war    the war in Iraq. I was placed at the center of that war because I was covering the war from the northern part of Iraq. And the war ended with a regime change  like the one in Afghanistan. And that regime that we got rid of was actually a dictatorship  an authoritarian regime  that for decades created a great sense of paralysis within the nation  within the people themselves. However  the change that came through foreign intervention created even worse circumstances for the people and deepened the sense of paralysis and inferiority in that part of the world. For decades  we have lived under authoritarian regimes    in the Arab world  in the Middle East. These regimes created something within us during this period. I'm    years old right now. For the last    years  I have seen almost the same faces for kings and presidents ruling us    old  aged  authoritarian  corrupt situations    regimes that we have seen around us. And for a moment I was wondering  are we going to live in order to see real change happening on the ground  a change that does not come through foreign intervention  through the misery of occupation  through nations invading our land and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes  The Iraqis  yes  they got rid of Saddam Hussein  but when they saw their land occupied by foreign forces they felt very sad  they felt that their dignity had suffered. And this is why they revolted. This is why they did not accept. And actually other regimes  they told their citizens   Would you like to see the situation of Iraq  Would you like to see civil war  sectarian killing  Would you like to see destruction  Would you like to see foreign troops on your land   And the people thought for themselves   Maybe we should live with this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in  instead of having the second scenario.  That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen. For    years  unfortunately we have found ourselves reporting images of destruction  images of killing  of sectarian conflicts  images of violence  emerging from a magnificent piece of land  a region that one day was the source of civilizations and art and culture for thousands of years. Now I am here to tell you that the future that we were dreaming for has eventually arrived. A new generation  well educated  connected  inspired by universal values and a global understanding  has created a new reality for us. We have found a new way to express our feelings and to express our dreams  these young people who have restored self confidence in our nations in that part of the world  who have given us new meaning for freedom and empowered us to go down to the streets. Nothing happened. No violence. Nothing. Just step out of your house  raise your voice and say   We would like to see the end of the regime.  This is what happened in Tunisia. Over a few days  the Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars in the security agencies  billions of dollars in maintaining  trying to maintain  its prisons  collapsed  disappeared  because of the voices of the public. People who were inspired to go down to the streets and to raise their voices  they tried to kill. The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people. They found something called Facebook. They found something called Twitter. They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues. And they said   These kids are misled.  Therefore  they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them  bring them back home. This is what they were telling. This is their propaganda.  Bring these kids home because they are misled.  But yes  these youth who have been inspired by universal values  who are idealistic enough to imagine a magnificent future and  at the same time  realistic enough to balance this kind of imagination and the process leading to it    not using violence  not trying to create chaos    these young people  they did not go home. Parents actually went to the streets and they supported them. And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia. We in Al Jazeera were banned from Tunisia for years  and the government did not allow any Al Jazeera reporter to be there. But we found that these people in the street  all of them are our reporters  feeding our newsroom with pictures  with videos and with news. And suddenly that newsroom in Doha became a center that received all this kind of input from ordinary people    people who are connected and people who have ambition and who have liberated themselves from the feeling of inferiority. And then we took that decision  We are unrolling the news. We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people. We are going to spread the message. Yes  some of these young people are connected to the Internet  but the connectivity in the Arab world is very little  is very small  because of many problems that we are suffering from. But Al Jazeera took the voice from these people and we amplified  it . We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world    and internationally  globally  through our English channel. And then people started to feel that there's something new happening. And then Zine al Abidine Ben Ali decided to leave. And then Egypt started  and Hosni Mubarak decided to leave. And now Libya as you see it. And then you have Yemen. And you have many other countries trying to see and to rediscover that feeling of   How do we imagine a future which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant   I want to tell you something  that the Internet and connectivity has created  a  new mindset. But this mindset has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from. And while this was the major difference between many initiatives before to create change  before we thought  and governments told us    and even sometimes it was true    that change was imposed on us  and people rejected that  because they thought that it is alien to their culture. Always  we believed that change will spring from within  that change should be a reconciliation with culture  cultural diversity  with our faith in our tradition and in our history  but at the same time  open to universal values  connected with the world  tolerant to the outside. And this is the moment that is happening right now in the Arab world. This is the right moment  and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the region. How did the elite deal with that    the so called political elite  In front of Facebook  they brought the camels in Tahrir Square. In front of Al Jazeera  they started creating tribalism. And then when they failed  they started speaking about conspiracies that emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington in order to divide the Arab world. They started telling the West   Be aware of Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda is taking over our territories. These are Islamists trying to create new Imaras. Be aware of these people who  are  coming to you in order to ruin your great civilization.  Fortunately  people right now cannot be deceived. Because this corrupt elite in that region has lost even the power of deception. They could not  and they cannot  imagine how they could really deal with this reality. They have lost. They have been detached from their people  from the masses  and now we are seeing them collapsing one after the other. Al Jazeera is not a tool of revolution. We do not create revolutions. However  when something of that magnitude happens  we are at the center of the coverage. We were banned from Egypt  and our correspondents  some of them were arrested. But most of our camera people and our journalists  they went underground in Egypt    voluntarily    to report what happened in Tahrir Square. For    days  our cameras were broadcasting  live  the voices of the people in Tahrir Square. I remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone    ordinary person who I don't know    from Tahrir Square. He told me   We appeal to you not to switch off the cameras. If you switch off the cameras tonight  there will be a genocide. You are protecting us by showing what is happening at Tahrir Square.  I felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them   Make your best not to switch off the cameras at night  because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story    and they feel protected as well.  So we have a chance to create a new future in that part of the world. We have a chance to go and to think of the future as something which is open to the world. Let us not repeat the mistake of Iran  of  the  Mosaddeq revolution. Let us free ourselves    especially in the West    from thinking about that part of the world based on oil interest  or based on interests of the illusion of stability and security. The stability and security of authoritarian regimes cannot create but terrorism and violence and destruction. Let us accept the choice of the people. Let us not pick and choose who we would like to rule their future. The future should be ruled by people themselves  even sometimes if they are voices that might now scare us. But the values of democracy and the freedom of choice that is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time is the best opportunity for the world  for the West and the East  to see stability and to see security and to see friendship and to see tolerance emerging from the Arab world  rather than the images of violence and terrorism. Let us support these people. Let us stand for them. And let us give up our narrow selfishness in order to embrace change  and in order to celebrate with the people of that region a great future and hope and tolerance. The future has arrived  and the future is now. I thank you very much. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  I just have a couple of questions for you. Thank you for coming here. How would you characterize the historical significance of what's happened  Is this a story of the year  a story of the decade or something more  Wadah Khanfar  Actually  this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered. We have covered many wars. We have covered a lot of tragedies  a lot of problems  a lot of conflict zones  a lot of hot spots in the region  because we were centered at the middle of it. But this is a story    it is a great story  it is beautiful. It is not something that you only cover because you have to cover a great incident. You are witnessing change in history. You are witnessing the birth of a new era. And this is what the story's all about. CA  There are a lot of people in the West who are still skeptical  or think this may just be an intermediate stage before much more alarming chaos. You really believe that if there are democratic elections in Egypt now  that a government could emerge that espouses some of the values you've spoken about so inspiringly  WK  And people actually  after the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime  the youth who have organized themselves in certain groups and councils  they are guarding the transformation and they are trying to put it on a track in order to satisfy the values of democracy  but at the same time also to make it reasonable and to make it rational  not to go out of order. In my opinion  these people are much more wiser than  not only the political elite  even the intellectual elite  even opposition leaders including political parties. At this moment in time  the youth in the Arab world are much more wiser and capable of creating the change than the old    including the political and cultural and ideological old regimes. CA  We are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way. What should people here at TED  here in the West  do if they want to connect or make a difference and they believe in what's happening here  WK  I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world    that people care  people care about this great transformation. Mohamed Nanabhay who's sitting with us  the head of Aljazeera.net  he told me that a       percent increase of accessing our website from various parts of the world. Fifty percent of it is coming from America. Because we discovered that people care  and people would like to know    they are receiving the stream through our Internet. Unfortunately in the United States  we are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time for Al Jazeera English. But I can tell you  this is the moment to celebrate through connecting ourselves with those people in the street and expressing our support to them and expressing this kind of feeling  universal feeling  of supporting the weak and the oppressed to create a much better future for all of us. CA  Well Wadah  a group of members of the TED community  TEDxCairo  are meeting as we speak. They've had some speakers there. I believe they've heard your talk. Thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us. Thank you so much. Two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris  and the phone rang and I heard   Hey  JR  you won the TED Prize     . You have to make a wish to save the world.  I was lost. I mean  I can't save the world. Nobody can. The world is fucked up. Come on  you have dictators ruling the world  population is growing by millions  there's no more fish in the sea  the North Pole is melting and as the last TED Prize winner said  we're all becoming fat. Except maybe French people. Whatever. So I called back and I told her   Look  Amy  tell the TED guys I just won't show up. I can't do anything to save the world.  She said   Hey  JR  your wish is not to save the world  but to change the world.   Oh  all right.   That's cool.  I mean  technology  politics  business do change the world    not always in a good way  but they do. What about art  Could art change the world  I started when I was    years old. And at that time  I was not thinking about changing the world. I was doing graffiti    writing my name everywhere  using the city as a canvas. I was going in the tunnels of Paris  on the rooftops with my friends. Each trip was an excursion  was an adventure. It was like leaving our mark on society  to say   I was here   on the top of a building. So when I found a cheap camera on the subway  I started documenting those adventures with my friends and gave them back as photocopies    really small photos just that size. That's how  at    years old  I started pasting them. And I did my first  expo de rue   which means sidewalk gallery. And I framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising. I mean  the city's the best gallery I could imagine. I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery and let them decide if my work was nice enough to show it to people. I would control it directly with the public in the streets. So that's Paris. I would change    depending on the places I would go    the title of the exhibition. That's on the Champs Elysees. I was quite proud of that one. Because I was just    and I was just up there on the top of the Champs Elysees. Then when the photo left  the frame was still there. November       the streets are burning. A large wave of riots had broken into the first projects of Paris. Everyone was glued to the TV  watching disturbing  frightening images taken from the edge of the neighborhood. I mean  these kids  without control  throwing Molotov cocktails  attacking the cops and the firemen  looting everything they could in the shops. These were criminals  thugs  dangerous  destroying their own environment. And then I saw it    could it be possible     my photo on a wall revealed by a burning car    a pasting I'd done a year earlier    an illegal one    still there. I mean  these were the faces of my friends. I know those guys. All of them are not angels  but they're not monsters either. So it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television. So I went back there with a    mm lens. It was the only one I had at that time. But with that lens  you have to be as close as    inches from the person. So you can do it only with their trust. So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet. They were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves. And then I pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of Paris with the name  age  even building number of these guys. A year later  the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris. And we go from thug images  who've been stolen and distorted by the media  who's now proudly taking over his own image. That's where I realized the power of paper and glue. So could art change the world  A year later  I was listening to all the noise about the Middle East conflict. I mean  at that time  trust me  they were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict. So with my friend Marco  we decided to go there and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis. Are they so different  When we got there  we just went in the street  started talking with people everywhere  and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media. So we decided to take portraits of Palestinians and Israelis doing the same jobs    taxi driver  lawyer  cooks. Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment. Not a smile    that really doesn't tell about who you are and what you feel. They all accepted to be pasted next to the other. I decided to paste in eight Israeli and Palestinian cities and on both sides of the wall. We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever. We called the project Face   Face. The experts said   No way. The people will not accept. The army will shoot you  and Hamas will kidnap you.  We said   Okay  let's try and push as far as we can.  I love the way that people will ask me   How big will my photo be    It will be as big as your house.  When we did the wall  we did the Palestinian side. So we arrived with just our ladders and we realized that they were not high enough. And so Palestinians guys say   Calm down. No wait. I'm going to find you a solution.  So he went to the Church of Nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born. We did Face   Face with only six friends  two ladders  two brushes  a rented car  a camera and        square feet of paper. We had all sorts of help from all walks of life. Okay  for example  that's Palestine. We're in Ramallah right now. We're pasting portraits    so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market. People come around us and start asking   What are you doing here    Oh  we're actually doing an art project and we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job. And those ones are actually two taxi drivers.  And then there was always a silence.  You mean you're pasting an Israeli face    doing a face    right here    Well  yeah  yeah  that's part of the project.  And I would always leave that moment  and we would ask them   So can you tell me who is who   And most of them couldn't say. We even pasted on Israeli military towers  and nothing happened. When you paste an image  it's just paper and glue. People can tear it  tag on it  or even pee on it    some are a bit high for that  I agree    but the people in the street  they are the curator. The rain and the wind will take them off anyway. They are not meant to stay. But exactly four years after  the photos  most of them are still there. Face   Face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible    and  you know what  even easy. We didn't push the limit  we just showed that they were further than anyone thought. In the Middle East  I experienced my work in places without  many  museums. So the reactions in the street were kind of interesting. So I decided to go further in this direction and go in places where there were zero museums. When you go in these developing societies  women are the pillars of their community  but the men are still the ones holding the streets. So we were inspired to create a project where men will pay tribute to women by posting their photos. I called that project Women Are Heroes. When I listened to all the stories everywhere I went on the continents  I couldn't always understand the complicated circumstances of their conflict. I just observed. Sometimes there was no words  no sentence  just tears. I just took their pictures and pasted them. Women Are Heroes took me around the world. Most of the places I went to  I decided to go there because I've heard about it through the media. So for example  in June       I was watching TV in Paris  and then I heard about this terrible thing that happened in Rio de Janeiro    the first favela of Brazil named Providencia. Three kids    that was three students    were  detained  by the army because they were not carrying their papers. And the army took them  and instead of bringing them to the police station  they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces. I was shocked. All Brazil was shocked. I heard it was one of the most violent favelas  because the largest drug cartel controls it. So I decided to go there. When I arrived    I mean  I didn't have any contact with any NGO. There was none in place    no association  no NGOs  nothing    no eyewitnesses. So we just walked around  and we met a woman  and I showed her my book. And she said   You know what  We're hungry for culture. We need culture out there.  So I went out and I started with the kids. I just took a few photos of the kids  and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them. The day after  I came back and they were already scratched. But that's okay. I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them. Then the next day  I held a meeting on the main square and some women came. They were all linked to the three kids that got killed. There was the mother  the grandmother  the best friend    they all wanted to shout the story. After that day  everyone in the favela gave me the green light. I took more photos  and we started the project. The drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place  so I told them   You know what  I'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons. You see that enough in the media. What I want to show is the incredible life and energy. I've been seeing it around me the last few days.  So that's a really symbolic pasting  because that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city. And that's where the three kids got arrested  and that's the grandmother of one of them. And on that stairs  that's where the traffickers always stand and there's a lot of exchange of fire. Everyone there understood the project. And then we pasted everywhere    the whole hill. What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in. I mean  you should see that. They would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter and then have a really long lens  and we would see ourselves  on TV  pasting. And they would put a number   Please call this number if you know what's going on in Providencia.  We just did a project and then left so the media wouldn't know. So how can we know about the project  So they had to go and find the women and get an explanation from them. So you create a bridge between the media and the anonymous women. We kept traveling. We went to Africa  Sudan  Sierra Leone  Liberia  Kenya. In war torn places like Monrovia  people come straight to you. I mean  they want to know what you're up to. They kept asking me   What is the purpose of your project  Are you an NGO  Are you the media   Art. Just doing art. Some people question   Why is it in black and white  Don't you have color in France   Or they tell you   Are these people all dead   Some who understood the project would explain it to others. And to a man who did not understand  I heard someone say   You know  you've been here for a few hours trying to understand  discussing with your fellows. During that time  you haven't thought about what you're going to eat tomorrow. This is art.  I think it's people's curiosity that motivates them to come into the projects. And then it becomes more. It becomes a desire  a need  an armor. On this bridge that's in Monrovia  ex rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait of a woman that might have been raped during the war. Women are always the first ones targeted during conflict. This is Kibera  Kenya  one of the largest slums of Africa. You might have seen images about the post election violence that happened there in     . This time we covered the roofs of the houses  but we didn't use paper  because paper doesn't prevent the rain from leaking inside the house    vinyl does. Then art becomes useful. So the people kept it. You know what I love is  for example  when you see the biggest eye there  there are so  many  houses inside. And I went there a few months ago    photos are still there    and it was missing a piece of the eye. So I asked the people what happened.  Oh  that guy just moved.  When the roofs were covered  a woman said as a joke   Now God can see me.  When you look at Kibera now  they look back. Okay  India. Before I start that  just so you know  each time we go to a place  we don't have authorization  so we set up like commandos    we're a group of friends who arrive there  and we try to paste on the walls. But there are places where you just can't paste on a wall. In India it was just impossible to paste. I heard culturally and because of the law  they would just arrest us at the first pasting. So we decided to paste white  white on the walls. So imagine white guys pasting white papers. So people would come to us and ask us   Hey  what are you up to    Oh  you know  we're just doing art.   Art   Of course  they were confused. But you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets  and the more dust you would have going up in the air  on the white paper you can almost see  but there is this sticky part like when you reverse a sticker. So the more dust you have  the more it will reveal the photo. So we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves. Thank you. So we didn't get caught this time. Each project    that's a film from Women Are Heroes. Okay. For each project we do a film. And most of what you see    that's a trailer from  Women Are Heroes     its images  photography  taken one after the other. And the photos kept traveling even without us. Hopefully  you'll see the film  and you'll understand the scope of the project and what the people felt when they saw those photos. Because that's a big part of it. There's layers behind each photo. Behind each image is a story. Women Are Heroes created a new dynamic in each of the communities  and the women kept that dynamic after we left. For example  we did books    not for sale    that all the community would get. But to get it  they would have to  get  it signed by one of the women. We did that in most of the places. We go back regularly. And so in Providencia  for example  in the favela  we have a cultural center running there. In Kibera  each year we cover more roofs. Because of course  when we left  the people who were just at the edge of the project said   Hey  what about my roof   So we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project. A really important point for me is that I don't use any brand or corporate sponsors. So I have no responsibility to anyone but myself and the subjects. And that is for me one of the more important things in the work. I think  today  as important as the result is the way you do things. And that has always been a central part of the work. And what's interesting is that fine line that I have with images and advertising. We just did some pasting in Los Angeles on another project in the last weeks. And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum. But yesterday the city called them and said   Look  you're going to have to tear it down. Because this can be taken for advertising  and because of the law  it has to be taken down.  But tell me  advertising for what  The people I photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community. But they asked me for a promise basically. They asked me   Please  make our story travel with you.  So I did. That's Paris. That's Rio. In each place  we built exhibitions with a story  and the story traveled. You understand the full scope of the project. That's London. New York. And today  they are with you in Long Beach. All right  recently I started a public art project where I don't use my artwork anymore. I use Man Ray  Helen Levitt  Giacomelli  other people's artwork. It doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not. The importance is what you do with the images  the statement it makes where it's pasted. So for example  I pasted the photo of the minaret in Switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country. This image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in Chernobyl originally  and I pasted it in Southern Italy  where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground. In some ways  art can change the world. Art is not supposed to change the world  to change practical things  but to change perceptions. Art can change the way we see the world. Art can create an analogy. Actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions  and then enables you to change the world. When I do my work  I have two kinds of reactions. People say   Oh  why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan. They would be really useful.  Or   How can we help   I presume that you belong to the second category  and that's good  because for that project  I'm going to ask you to take the photos and paste them. So now my wish is  I wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project  and together we'll turn the world inside out. And this starts right now. Yes  everyone in the room. Everyone watching. I wanted that wish to actually start now. So a subject you're passionate about  a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos    tell me what you stand for. Take the photos  the portraits  upload it    I'll give you all the details    and I'll send you back your poster. Join by groups and reveal things to the world. The full data is on the website    insideoutproject.net    that is launching today. What we see changes who we are. When we act together  the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts. So I hope that  together  we'll create something that the world will remember. And this starts right now and depends on you. Thank you. Thank you. This is Revolution  . . No one was a hero. No one was a hero. Because everyone was a hero. Everyone has done something. We all use Wikipedia. If you think of the concept of Wikipedia where everyone is collaborating on content  and at the end of the day you've built the largest encyclopedia in the world. From just an idea that sounded crazy  you have the largest encyclopedia in the world. And in the Egyptian revolution  the Revolution  .   everyone has contributed something  small or big. They contributed something    to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions. It was actually really inspiring to see all these Egyptians completely changing. If you look at the scene  Egypt  for    years  had been in a downhill    going into a downhill. Everything was going bad. Everything was going wrong. We only ranked high when it comes to poverty  corruption  lack of freedom of speech  lack of political activism. Those were the achievements of our great regime. Yet  nothing was happening. And it's not because people were happy or people were not frustrated. In fact  people were extremely frustrated. But the reason why everyone was silent is what I call the psychological barrier of fear. Everyone was scared. Not everyone. There were actually a few brave Egyptians that I have to thank for being so brave    going into protests as a couple of hundred  getting beaten up and arrested. But in fact  the majority were scared. Everyone did not want really to get in trouble. A dictator cannot live without the force. They want to make people live in fear. And that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years  and here comes the Internet  technology  BlackBerry  SMS. It's helping all of us to connect. Platforms like YouTube  Twitter  Facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that   Wow  I'm not alone. There are a lot of people who are frustrated.  There are lots of people who are frustrated. There are lots of people who actually share the same dream. There are lots of people who care about their freedom. They probably have the best life in the world. They are living in happiness. They are living in their villas. They are happy. They don't have problems. But they are still feeling the pain of the Egyptian. A lot of us  we're not really happy when we see a video of an Egyptian man who's eating the trash while others are stealing billions of Egyptian pounds from the wealth of the country. The Internet has played a great role  helping these people to speak up their minds  to collaborate together  to start thinking together. It was an educational campaign. Khaled Saeed was killed in June     . I still remember the photo. I still remember every single detail of that photo. The photo was horrible. He was tortured  brutally tortured to death. But then what was the answer of the regime   He choked on a pile of hash     that was their answer   He's a criminal. He's someone who escaped from all these bad things.  But people did not relate to this. People did not believe this. Because of the Internet  the truth prevailed and everyone knew the truth. And everyone started to think that  this guy could be my brother.  He was a middle class guy. His photo was remembered by all of us. A page was created. An anonymous administrator was basically inviting people to join the page  and there was no plan.  What are we going to do    I don't know.  In a few days  tens of thousands of people there    angry Egyptians who were asking the ministry of interior affairs   Enough. Get those who killed this guy. To just bring them to justice.  But of course  they don't listen. It was an amazing story    how everyone started feeling the ownership. Everyone was an owner in this page. People started contributing ideas. In fact  one of the most ridiculous ideas was   Hey  let's have a silent stand. Let's get people to go in the street  face the sea  their back to the street  dressed in black  standing up silently for one hour  doing nothing and then just leaving  going back home.  For some people  that was like   Wow  silent stand. And next time it's going to be vibration.  People were making fun of the idea. But actually when people went to the street    the first time it was thousands of people in Alexandria    it felt like    it was amazing. It was great because it connected people from the virtual world  bringing them to the real world  sharing the same dream  the same frustration  the same anger  the same desire for freedom. And they were doing this thing. But did the regime learn anything  Not really. They were actually attacking them. They were actually abusing them  despite the fact of how peaceful these guys were    they were not even protesting. And things had developed until the Tunisian revolution. This whole page was  again  managed by the people. In fact  the anonymous admin job was to collect ideas  help people to vote on them and actually tell them what they are doing. People were taking shots and photos  people were reporting violations of human rights in Egypt  people were suggesting ideas  they were actually voting on ideas  and then they were executing the ideas  people were creating videos. Everything was done by the people to the people  and that's the power of the Internet. There was no leader. The leader was everyone on that page. The Tunisian experiment  as Amir was saying  inspired all of us  showed us that there is a way. Yes we can. We can do it. We have the same problems  we can just go in the streets. And when I saw the street on the   th  I went back and said   Egypt before the   th is never going to be Egypt after the   th. The revolution is happening. This is not the end  this is the beginning of the end.  I was detained on the   th night. Thank God I announced the locations and everything. But they detained me. And I'm not going to talk about my experience  because this is not about me. I was detained for    days  blindfolded  handcuffed. And I did not really hear anything. I did not know anything. I was not allowed to speak with anyone. And I went out. The next day I was in Tahrir. Seriously  with the amount of change I had noticed in this square  I thought it was    years. I never had in my mind to see this Egyptian  the amazing Egyptian. The fear is no longer fear. It's actually strength    it's power. People were so empowered. It was amazing how everyone was so empowered and now asking for their rights. Completely opposite. Extremism became tolerance. Who would  have  imagined before the   th  if I tell you that hundreds of thousands of Christians are going to pray and tens of thousands of Muslims are going to protect them  and then hundreds of thousands of Muslims are going to pray and tens of thousands of Christians are going to protect them    this is amazing. All the stereotypes that the regime was trying to put on us through their so called propaganda  or mainstream media  are proven wrong. This whole revolution showed us how ugly such a regime was and how great and amazing the Egyptian man  the Egyptian woman  how simple and amazing these people are whenever they have a dream. When I saw that  I went back and I wrote on Facebook. And that was a personal belief  regardless of what's going on  regardless of the details. I said that   We are going to win. We are going to win because we don't understand politics. We're going to win because we don't play their dirty games. We're going to win because we don't have an agenda. We're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts. We're going to win because we have dreams. We're going to win because we are willing to stand up for our dreams.  And that's actually what happened. We won. And that's not because of anything  but because we believed in our dream. The winning here is not the whole details of what's going to happen in the political scene. The winning is the winning of the dignity of every single Egyptian. Actually  I had this taxi driver telling me   Listen  I am breathing freedom. I feel that I have dignity that I have lost for so many years.  For me that's winning  regardless of all the details. My last word to you is a statement I believe in  which Egyptians have proven to be true  that the power of the people is much stronger than the people in power. Thanks a lot. Well  this is about state budgets. This is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning. But I want to tell you  I think it's an important topic that we need to care about. State budgets are big  big money    I'll show you the numbers    and they get very little scrutiny. The understanding is very low. Many of the people involved have special interests or short term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are. And these budgets are the key for our future  they're the key for our kids. Most education funding    whether it's K through     or the great universities or community colleges    most of the money for those things is coming out of these state budgets. But we have a problem. Here's the overall picture. U.S. economy is big      .  trillion. Now out of that pie  the government spends    percent. So this is combining the federal level  which is the largest  the state level and the local level. And it's really in this combined way that you get an overall sense of what's going on  because there's a lot of complex things like Medicaid and research money that flow across those boundaries. But we're spending    percent. Well what are we taking in  Simple business question. Answer is    percent. Now this leaves    percent deficit  sort of a mind blowing number. And some of that  in fact  is due to the fact that we've had an economic recession. Receipts go down  some spending programs go up  but most of it is not because of that. Most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends  and that creates a huge challenge. In fact  this is the forecast picture. There are various things in here  I could say we might raise more revenue  or medical innovation will make the spending even higher. It is an increasingly difficult picture  even assuming the economy does quite well    probably better than it will do. This is what you see at this overall level. Now how did we get here  How could you have a problem like this  After all  at least on paper  there's this notion that these state budgets are balanced. Only one state says they don't have to balance the budget. But what this means actually is that there's a pretense. There's no real  true balancing going on  and in a sense  the games they play to hide that actually obscure the topic so much that people don't see things that are actually pretty straight forward challenges. When Jerry Brown was elected  this was the challenge that was put to him. That is  through various gimmicks and things  a so called balanced budget had led him to have    billion missing out of the    billion in proposed spending. Now he's put together some thoughts  About half of that he'll cut  another half  perhaps in a very complex set of steps  taxes will be approved. But even so  as you go out into those future years  various pension costs  health costs go up enough  and the revenue does not go up enough. So you get a big squeeze. What were those things that allowed us to hide this  Well  some really nice little tricks. And these were somewhat noticed. The paper said   It's not really balanced. It's got holes. It perpetuates deficit spending. It's riddled with gimmicks.  And really when you get down to it  the guys at Enron never would have done this. This is so blatant  so extreme. Is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do  They borrow money. They're not supposed to  but they figure out a way. They make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out. They sell off the assets. They defer the payments. They sell off the revenues from tobacco. And California's not unique. In fact  there's about five states that are worse and only really four states that don't face this big challenge. So it's systemic across the entire country. It really comes from the fact that certain long term obligations    health care  where innovation makes it more expensive  early retirement and pension  where the age structure gets worse for you  and just generosity    that these mis accounting things allow to develop over time  that you've got a problem. This is the retiree health care benefits. Three million set aside     billion dollar liability    much worse than the car companies. And everybody looked at that and knew that that was headed toward a huge problem. The forecast for the medical piece alone is to go from    percent of the budget to    percent. Well what's going to give  Well in order to accommodate that  you would have to cut education spending in half. It really is this young versus the old to some degree. If you don't change that revenue picture  if you don't solve what you're doing in health care  you're going to be deinvesting in the young. The great University of California university system  the great things that have gone on  won't happen. So far it's meant layoffs  increased class sizes. Within the education community there's this discussion of   Should it just be the young teachers who get laid off  or the less good teachers who get laid off   And there's a discussion  if you're going to increase class sizes  where do you do that  How much effect does that have  And unfortunately  as you get into that  people get confused and think  well maybe you think that's okay. In fact  no  education spending should not be cut. There's ways  if it's temporary  to minimize the impact  but it's a problem. It's also really a problem for where we need to go. Technology has a role to play. Well we need money to experiment with that  to get those tools in there. There's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness  measuring them  giving them feedback  taking videos in the classroom. That's something I think is very  very important. Well you have to allocate dollars for that system and for that incentive pay. In a situation where you have growth  you put the new money into this. Or even if you're flat  you might shift money into it. But with the type of cuts we're talking about  it will be far  far harder to get these incentives for excellence  or to move over to use technology in the new way. So what's going on  Where's the brain trust that's in error here  Well there really is no brain trust. It's sort of the voters. It's sort of us showing up. Just look at this spending. California will spend over     billion  Microsoft      Google  about   . The amount of IQ in good numeric analysis  both inside Google and Microsoft and outside  with analysts and people of various opinions    should they have spent on that  No  they wasted their money on this. What about this thing     it really is quite phenomenal. Everybody has an opinion. There's great feedback. And the numbers are used to make decisions. If you go over the education spending and the health care spending    particularly these long term trends    you don't have that type of involvement on a number that's more important in terms of equity  in terms of learning. So what do we need to do  We need better tools. We can get some things out on the Internet. I'm going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture. We need lots more. There's a few good books  one about school spending and where the money comes from    how that's changed over time  and the challenge. We need better accounting. We need to take the fact that the current employees  the future liabilities they create  that should come out of the current budget. We need to understand why they've done the pension accounting the way they have. It should be more like private accounting. It's the gold standard. And finally  we need to really reward politicians. Whenever they say there's these long term problems  we can't say   Oh  you're the messenger with bad news  We just shot you.  In fact  there are some like these  Erskine Bowles  Alan Simpson and others  who have gone through and given proposals for this overall federal health spending state level problem. But in fact  their work was sort of pushed off. In fact  the week afterwards  some tax cuts were done that made the situation even worse than their assumptions. So we need these pieces. Now I think this is a solvable problem. It's a great country with lots of people. But we have to draw those people in  because this is about education. And just look at what happened with the tuitions with the University of California and project that out for another three  four  five years    it's unaffordable. And that's the kind of thing    the investment in the young    that makes us great  allows us to contribute. It allows us to do the art  the biotechnology  the software and all those magic things. And so the bottom line is we need to care about state budgets because they're critical for our kids and our future. Thank you. There's actually a major health crisis today in terms of the shortage of organs. The fact is that we're living longer. Medicine has done a much better job of making us live longer  and the problem is  as we age  our organs tend to fail more  and so currently there are not enough organs to go around. In fact  in the last    years  the number of patients requiring an organ has doubled  while in the same time  the actual number of transplants has barely gone up. So this is now a public health crisis. So that's where this field comes in that we call the field of regenerative medicine. It really involves many different areas. You can use  actually  scaffolds  biomaterials    they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt    but specific materials you can actually implant in patients and they will do well and help you regenerate. Or we can use cells alone  either your very own cells or different stem cell populations. Or we can use both. We can use  actually  biomaterials and the cells together. And that's where the field is today. But it's actually not a new field. Interestingly  this is a book that was published back in     . It's titled  The Culture of Organs.  The first author  Alexis Carrel  a Nobel Prize winner. He actually devised some of the same technologies used today for suturing blood vessels  and some of the blood vessel grafts we use today were actually designed by Alexis. But I want you to note his co author  Charles Lindbergh. That's the same Charles Lindbergh who actually spent the rest of his life working with Alexis at the Rockefeller Institute in New York in the area of the culture of organs. So if the field's been around for so long  why so few clinical advances  And that really has to do to many different challenges. But if I were to point to three challenges  the first one is actually the design of materials that could go in your body and do well over time. And many advances now  we can do that fairly readily. The second challenge was cells. We could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body. Over the last    years  we've basically tackled that. Many scientists can now grow many different types of cells. Plus we have stem cells. But even now        there's still certain cells that we just can't grow from the patient. Liver cells  nerve cells  pancreatic cells    we still can't grow them even today. And the third challenge is vascularity  the actual supply of blood to allow those organs or tissues to survive once we regenerate them. So we can actually use biomaterials now. This is actually a biomaterial. We can weave them  knit them  or we can make them like you see here. This is actually like a cotton candy machine. You saw the spray going in. That was like the fibers of the cotton candy creating this structure  this tubularized structure  which is a biomaterial that we can then use to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so. And that's exactly what we did here. This is actually a patient who  was  presented with a deceased organ  and we then created one of these smart biomaterials  and then we then used that smart biomaterial to replace and repair that patient's structure. What we did was we actually used the biomaterial as a bridge so that the cells in the organ could walk on that bridge  if you will  and help to bridge the gap to regenerate that tissue. And you see that patient now six months after with an X ray showing you the regenerated tissue  which is fully regenerated when you analyze it under the microscope. We can also use cells alone. These are actually cells that we obtained. These are stem cells that we create from specific sources  and we can drive them to become heart cells  and they start beating in culture. So they know what to do. The cells genetically know what to do  and they start beating together. Now today  many clinical trials are using different kinds of stem cells for heart disease. So that's actually now in patients. Or if we're going to use larger structures to replace larger structures  we can then use the patient's own cells  or some cell population  and the biomaterials  the scaffolds  together. So the concept here  so if you do have a deceased or injured organ  we take a very small piece of that tissue  less than half the size of a postage stamp. We then tease the cells apart  we grow the cells outside the body. We then take a scaffold  a biomaterial    again  looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt    we then shape that material  and we then use those cells to coat that material one layer at a time    very much like baking a layer cake  if you will. We then place it in an oven like device  and we're able to create that structure and bring it out. This is actually a heart valve that we've engineered  and you can see here  we have the structure of the heart valve and we've seeded that with cells  and then we exercise it. So you see the leaflets opening and closing    of this heart valve that's currently being used experimentally to try to get it to further studies. Another technology that we have used in patients actually involves bladders. We actually take a very small piece of the bladder from the patient    less than half the size of a postage stamp. We then grow the cells outside the body  take the scaffold  coat the scaffold with the cells    the patient's own cells  two different cell types. We then put it in this oven like device. It has the same conditions as the human body       degrees centigrade     percent oxygen. A few weeks later  you have your engineered organ that we're able to implant back into the patient. For these specific patients  we actually just suture these materials. We use three dimensional imagining analysis  but we actually created these biomaterials by hand. But we now have better ways to create these structures with the cells. We use now some type of technologies  where for solid organs  for example  like the liver  what we do is we take discard livers. As you know  a lot of organs are actually discarded  not used. So we can take these liver structures  which are not going to be used  and we then put them in a washing machine like structure that will allow the cells to be washed away. Two weeks later  you have something that looks like a liver. You can hold it like a liver  but it has no cells  it's just a skeleton of the liver. And we then can re perfuse the liver with cells  preserving the blood vessel tree. So we actually perfuse first the blood vessel tree with the patient's own blood vessel cells  and we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells. And we now have been able just to show the creation of human liver tissue just this past month using this technology. Another technology that we've used is actually that of printing. This is actually a desktop inkjet printer  but instead of using ink  we're using cells. And you can actually see here the printhead going through and printing this structure  and it takes about    minutes to print this structure. And there's a  D elevator that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through. And then finally you're able to get that structure out. You can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it. And this is actually a piece of bone that I'm going to show you in this slide that was actually created with this desktop printer and implanted as you see here. That was all new bone that was implanted using these techniques. Another more advanced technology we're looking at right now  our next generation of technologies  are more sophisticated printers. This particular printer we're designing now is actually one where we print right on the patient. So what you see here    I know it sounds funny  but that's the way it works. Because in reality  what you want to do is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound  and you have a scanner  basically like a flatbed scanner. That's what you see here on the right side. You see a scanner technology that first scans the wound on the patient and then it comes back with the printheads actually printing the layers that you require on the patients themselves. This is how it actually works. Here's the scanner going through  scanning the wound. Once it's scanned  it sends information in the correct layers of cells where they need to be. And now you're going to see here a demo of this actually being done in a representative wound. And we actually do this with a gel so that you can lift the gel material. So once those cells are on the patient they will stick where they need to be. And this is actually new technology still under development. We're also working on more sophisticated printers. Because in reality  our biggest challenge are the solid organs. I don't know if you realize this  but    percent of the patients on the transplant list are actually waiting for a kidney. Patients are dying every day because we don't have enough of those organs to go around. So this is more challenging    large organ  vascular  a lot of blood vessel supply  a lot of cells present. So the strategy here is    this is actually a CT scan  an X ray    and we go layer by layer  using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and  D reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys. We then are able to actually image those  do     degree rotation to analyze the kidney in its full volumetric characteristics  and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a printing computerized form. So we go layer by layer through the organ  analyzing each layer as we go through the organ  and we then are able to send that information  as you see here  through the computer and actually design the organ for the patient. This actually shows the actual printer. And this actually shows that printing. In fact  we actually have the printer right here. So while we've been talking today  you can actually see the printer back here in the back stage. That's actually the actual printer right now  and that's been printing this kidney structure that you see here. It takes about seven hours to print a kidney  so this is about three hours into it now. And Dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now  and we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys that we printed a little bit earlier today. Put a pair of gloves here. Thank you. Go backwards. So  these gloves are a little bit small on me  but here it is. You can actually see that kidney as it was printed earlier today. Has a little bit of consistency to it. This is Dr. Kang who's been working with us on this project  and part of our team. Thank you  Dr. Kang. I appreciate it. So this is actually a new generation. This is actually the printer that you see here onstage. And this is actually a new technology we're working on now. In reality  we now have a long history of doing this. I'm going to share with you a clip in terms of technology we have had in patients now for a while. And this is actually a very brief clip    only about    seconds    of a patient who actually received an organ. I was missing school. It was pretty much miserable. I couldn't go out and play basketball at recess without feeling like I was going to pass out when I got back inside. I felt so sick. I was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis  and I don't even like to think about what my life would be like if I was on that. So after the surgery  life got a lot better for me. I was able to do more things. I was able to wrestle in high school. I became the captain of the team  and that was great. I was able to be a normal kid with my friends. And because they used my own cells to build this bladder  it's going to be with me. I've got it for life  so I'm all set. Juan Enriquez  These experiments sometimes work  and it's very cool when they do. Luke  come up please. So Luke  before last night  when's the last time you saw Tony  LM  Ten years ago  when I had my surgery    and it's really great to see him. JE  And tell us a little bit about what you're doing. LM  Well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut. I'm a sophomore and studying communications  TV and mass media  and basically trying to live life like a normal kid  which I always wanted growing up. But it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida and my kidneys and bladder weren't working. I went through about    surgeries  and it seemed impossible to do that when I was in kidney failure when I was   . And this surgery came along and basically made me who I am today and saved my life. JE  And Tony's done hundreds of these  LM  What I know from  he's working really hard in his lab and coming up with crazy stuff. I know I was one of the first    people to have this surgery. And when I was     I didn't realize how amazing it was. I was a little kid  and I was like   Yeah. I'll have that. I'll have that surgery.  All I wanted to do was to get better  and I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older and I see the amazing things that he's doing. JE  When you got this call out of the blue    Tony's really shy  and it took a lot of convincing to get somebody as modest as Tony to allow us to bring Luke. So Luke  you go to your communications professors    you're majoring in communications    and you ask them for permission to come to TED  which might have a little bit to do with communications  and what was their reaction  LM  Most of my professors were all for it  and they said   Bring pictures and show me the clips online   and  I'm happy for you.  There were a couple that were a little stubborn  but I had to talk to them. I pulled them aside. JE  Well  it's an honor and a privilege to meet you. Thank you so much.  LM  Thank you so much.  JE  Thank you  Tony. So I was born on the last day of the last year of the '  s. I was raised on  Free to be you and me     hip hop    not as many woohoos for hip hop in the house. Thank you. Thank you for hip hop    and Anita Hill. My parents were radicals    who became  well  grown ups. My dad facetiously says   We wanted to save the world  and instead we just got rich.  We actually just got  middle class  in Colorado Springs  Colorado  but you get the picture. I was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy. At this ripe old age of     I've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up in this horrible  beautiful time  and I've decided  for me  it's been a real journey and paradox. The first paradox is that growing up is about rejecting the past and then promptly reclaiming it. Feminism was the water I grew up in. When I was just a little girl  my mom started what is now the longest running women's film festival in the world. So while other kids were watching sitcoms and cartoons  I was watching very esoteric documentaries made by and about women. You can see how this had an influence. But she was not the only feminist in the house. My dad actually resigned from the male only business club in my hometown because he said he would never be part of an organization that would one day welcome his son  but not his daughter. He's actually here today. The trick here is my brother would become an experimental poet  not a businessman  but the intention was really good. In any case  I didn't readily claim the feminist label  even though it was all around me  because I associated it with my mom's women's groups  her swishy skirts and her shoulder pads    none of which had much cachet in the hallways of Palmer High School where I was trying to be cool at the time. But I suspected there was something really important about this whole feminism thing  so I started covertly tiptoeing into my mom's bookshelves and picking books off and reading them    never  of course  admitting that I was doing so. I didn't actually claim the feminist label until I went to Barnard College and I heard Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner speak for the first time. They were the co authors of a book called  Manifesta.  So what very profound epiphany  you might ask  was responsible for my feminist click moment  Fishnet stockings. Jennifer Baumgardner was wearing them. I thought they were really hot. I decided  okay  I can claim the feminist label. Now I tell you this    I tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself  because I think part of the work of feminism is to admit that aesthetics  that beauty  that fun do matter. There are lots of very modern political movements that have caught fire in no small part because of cultural hipness. Anyone heard of these two guys as an example  So my feminism is very indebted to my mom's  but it looks very different. My mom says   patriarchy.  I say   intersectionality.  So race  class  gender  ability  all of these things go into our experiences of what it means to be a woman. Pay equity  Yes. Absolutely a feminist issue. But for me  so is immigration.  Applause  Thank you. My mom says   Protest march.  I say   Online organizing.  I co edit  along with a collective of other super smart  amazing women  a site called Feministing.com. We are the most widely read feminist publication ever  and I tell you this because I think it's really important to see that there's a continuum. Feminist blogging is basically the   st century version of consciousness raising. But we also have a straightforward political impact. Feministing has been able to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of Walmart. We got a misogynist administrator sending us hate mail fired from a Big Ten school. And one of our biggest successes is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of Iowa who say   I Googled Jessica Simpson and stumbled on your site. I realized feminism wasn't about man hating and Birkenstocks.  So we're able to pull in the next generation in a totally new way. My mom says   Gloria Steinem.  I say   Samhita Mukhopadhyay  Miriam Perez  Ann Friedman  Jessica Valenti  Vanessa Valenti  and on and on and on and on.  We don't want one hero. We don't want one icon. We don't want one face. We are thousands of women and men across this country doing online writing  community organizing  changing institutions from the inside out    all continuing the incredible work that our mothers and grandmothers started. Thank you. Which brings me to the second paradox  sobering up about our smallness and maintaining faith in our greatness all at once. Many in my generation    because of well intentioned parenting and self esteem education    were socialized to believe that we were special little snowflakes    who were going to go out and save the world. These are three words many of us were raised with. We walk across graduation stages  high on our overblown expectations  and when we float back down to earth  we realize we don't know what the heck it means to actually save the world anyway. The mainstream media often paints my generation as apathetic  and I think it's much more accurate to say we are deeply overwhelmed. And there's a lot to be overwhelmed about  to be fair    an environmental crisis  wealth disparity in this country unlike we've seen since       and globally  a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity. Xenophobia's on the rise. The trafficking of women and girls. It's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed. I experienced this firsthand myself when I graduated from Barnard College in     . I was fired up  I was ready to make a difference. I went out and I worked at a non profit  I went to grad school  I phone banked  I protested  I volunteered  and none of it seemed to matter. And on a particularly dark night of December of       I sat down with my family  and I said that I had become very disillusioned. I admitted that I'd actually had a fantasy    kind of a dark fantasy    of writing a letter about everything that was wrong with the world and then lighting myself on fire on the White House steps. My mom took a drink of her signature Sea Breeze  her eyes really welled with tears  and she looked right at me and she said   I will not stand for your desperation.  She said   You are smarter  more creative and more resilient than that.  Which brings me to my third paradox. Growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly and being fulfilled by failing really well. There's a writer I've been deeply influenced by  Parker Palmer  and he writes that many of us are often whiplashed  between arrogant overestimation of ourselves and a servile underestimation of ourselves.  You may have guessed by now  I did not light myself on fire. I did what I know to do in desperation  which is write. I wrote the book I needed to read. I wrote a book about eight incredible people all over this country doing social justice work. I wrote about Nia Martin Robinson  the daughter of Detroit and two civil rights activists  who's dedicating her life to environmental justice. I wrote about Emily Apt who initially became a caseworker in the welfare system because she decided that was the most noble thing she could do  but quickly learned  not only did she not like it  but she wasn't really good at it. Instead  what she really wanted to do was make films. So she made a film about the welfare system and had a huge impact. I wrote about Maricela Guzman  the daughter of Mexican immigrants  who joined the military so she could afford college. She was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp and went on to co organize a group called the Service Women's Action Network. What I learned from these people and others was that I couldn't judge them based on their failure to meet their very lofty goals. Many of them are working in deeply intractable systems    the military  congress  the education system  etc. But what they managed to do within those systems was be a humanizing force. And at the end of the day  what could possibly be more important than that  Cornel West says   Of course it's a failure. But how good a failure is it   This isn't to say we give up our wildest  biggest dreams. It's to say we operate on two levels. On one  we really go after changing these broken systems of which we find ourselves a part. But on the other  we root our self esteem in the daily acts of trying to make one person's day more kind  more just  etc. So when I was a little girl  I had a couple of very strange habits. One of them was I used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home  and I would suck the thumb of my left hand and hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand. I was listening to her talk on the phone  which she did a lot. She was talking about board meetings  she was founding peace organizations  she was coordinating carpools  she was consoling friends    all these daily acts of care and creativity. And surely  at three and four years old  I was listening to the soothing sound of her voice  but I think I was also getting my first lesson in activist work. The activists I interviewed had nothing in common  literally  except for one thing  which was that they all cited their mothers as their most looming and important activist influences. So often  particularly at a young age  we look far afield for our models of the meaningful life  and sometimes they're in our own kitchens  talking on the phone  making us dinner  doing all that keeps the world going around and around. My mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory  or certainty  or security even. It's about embracing the paradox. It's about acting in the face of overwhelm. And it's about loving people really well. And at the end of the day  these things make for a lifetime of challenge and reward. Thank you. Khan Academy is most known for its collection of videos  so before I go any further  let me show you a little bit of a montage. This animal's fossils are only found in this area of South America    a nice clean band here    and this part of Africa. We can integrate over the surface  and the notation usually is a capital sigma. National Assembly  They create the Committee of Public Safety  which sounds like a very nice committee. Notice  this is an aldehyde  and it's an alcohol. Start differentiating into effector and memory cells. A galaxy. Hey  There's another galaxy. Oh  look  There's another galaxy. And for dollars  is their    million  plus the    million dollars from the American manufacturer. If this does not blow your mind  then you have no emotion. covering everything from basic arithmetic  all the way to vector calculus  and some of the stuff that you saw up there. We have a million students a month using the site  watching on the order of     to         videos a day. But what we're going to talk about in this is how we're going to the next level. But before I do that  I want to talk a little bit about really just how I got started. And some of you all might know  about five years ago  I was an analyst at a hedge fund  and I was in Boston  and I was tutoring my cousins in New Orleans  remotely. And I started putting the first YouTube videos up  really just as a kind of nice to have  just kind of a supplement for my cousins  something that might give them a refresher or something. And as soon as I put those first YouTube videos up  something interesting happened. Actually  a bunch of interesting things happened. The first was the feedback from my cousins. They told me that they preferred me on YouTube than in person. And once you get over the backhanded nature of that  there was actually something very profound there. They were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin to their cousin. At first it's very unintuitive  but when you think about it from their point of view  it makes a ton of sense. You have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin  without feeling like they're wasting my time. If they have to review something that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago  or maybe a couple of years ago  they don't have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin. They can just watch those videos  if they're bored  they can go ahead. They can watch at their own time and pace. Probably the least appreciated aspect of this is the notion that the very first time that you're trying to get your brain around a new concept  the very last thing you need is another human being saying   Do you understand this   And that's what was happening with the interaction with my cousins before  and now they can just do it in the intimacy of their own room. The other thing that happened is    I put them on YouTube just    I saw no reason to make it private  so I let other people watch it  and then people started stumbling on it  and I started getting some comments and some letters and all sorts of feedback from random people around the world. These are just a few. This is actually from one of the original calculus videos. Someone wrote it on YouTube  it was a YouTube comment   First time I smiled doing a derivative.  Let's pause here. This person did a derivative  and then they smiled. In response to that same comment    this is on the thread  you can go on YouTube and look at the comments    someone else wrote   Same thing here. I actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day  since I remember seeing all of this matrix text in class  and here I'm all like  'I know kung fu.'  We get a lot of feedback along those lines. This clearly was helping people. But then  as the viewership kept growing and kept growing  I started getting letters from people  and it was starting to become clear that it was more than just a nice to have. This is just an excerpt from one of those letters   My    year old son has autism  and has had a terrible time with math. We have tried everything  viewed everything  bought everything. We stumbled on your video on decimals  and it got through. Then we went on to the dreaded fractions. Again  he got it. We could not believe it. He is so excited.  And so you can imagine  here I was  an analyst at a hedge fund    it was very strange for me to do something of social value. But I was excited  so I kept going. And then a few other things started to dawn on me  that not only would it help my cousins right now  or these people who were sending letters  but that this content will never grow old  that it could help their kids or their grandkids. If Isaac Newton had done YouTube videos on calculus  I wouldn't have to. Assuming he was good. We don't know. The other thing that happened    and even at this point  I said   OK  maybe it's a good supplement. It's good for motivated students. It's good for maybe home schoolers.  But I didn't think it would somehow penetrate the classroom. Then I started getting letters from teachers  and the teachers would write  saying   We've used your videos to flip the classroom. You've given the lectures  so now what we do     And this could happen in every classroom in America tomorrow     what I do is I assign the lectures for homework  and what used to be homework  I now have the students doing in the classroom.  And I want to pause here    I want to pause here  because there's a couple of interesting things. One  when those teachers are doing that  there's the obvious benefit    the benefit that now their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did  they can pause  repeat at their own pace  at their own time. But the more interesting thing    and this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom    by removing the one size fits all lecture from the classroom  and letting students have a self paced lecture at home  then when you go to the classroom  letting them do work  having the teacher walk around  having the peers actually be able to interact with each other  these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom. They took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience       kids with their fingers on their lips  not allowed to interact with each other. A teacher  no matter how good  has to give this one size fits all lecture to    students    blank faces  slightly antagonistic    and now it's a human experience  now they're actually interacting with each other. So once the Khan Academy    I quit my job  and we turned into a real organization    we're a not for profit    the question is  how do we take this to the next level  How do we take what those teachers were doing to its natural conclusion  And so  what I'm showing over here  these are actual exercises that I started writing for my cousins. The ones I started were much more primitive. This is a more competent version of it. But the paradigm here is  we'll generate as many questions as you need  until you get that concept  until you get    in a row. And the Khan Academy videos are there. You get hints  the actual steps for that problem  if you don't know how to do it. The paradigm here seems like a very simple thing     in a row  you move on. But it's fundamentally different than what's happening in classrooms right now. In a traditional classroom  you have homework  lecture  homework  lecture  and then you have a snapshot exam. And that exam  whether you get a    percent  an    percent  a    percent or a    percent  the class moves on to the next topic. And even that    percent student    what was the five percent they didn't know  Maybe they didn't know what happens when you raise something to the zeroth power. Then you build on that in the next concept. That's analogous to    imagine learning to ride a bicycle. Maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time  and I give you a bicycle for two weeks  then I come back after two weeks  and say   Well  let's see. You're having trouble taking left turns. You can't quite stop. You're an    percent bicyclist.  So I put a big  C  stamp on your forehead    and then I say   Here's a unicycle.  But as ridiculous as that sounds  that's exactly what's happening in our classrooms right now. And the idea is you fast forward and good students start failing algebra all of the sudden  and start failing calculus all of the sudden  despite being smart  despite having good teachers  and it's usually because they have these Swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation. So our model is  learn math the way you'd learn anything  like riding a bicycle. Stay on that bicycle. Fall off that bicycle. Do it as long as necessary  until you have mastery. The traditional model  it penalizes you for experimentation and failure  but it does not expect mastery. We encourage you to experiment. We encourage you to fail. But we do expect mastery. This is just another one of the modules. This is trigonometry. This is shifting and reflecting functions. And they all fit together. We have about    of these right now. You can go to the site right now  it's all free  not trying to sell anything. But the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map. That top node right there  that's literally single digit addition  it's like one plus one is equal to two. The paradigm is  once you get    in a row on that  it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules. Further down the knowledge map  we're getting into more advanced arithmetic. Further down  you start getting into pre algebra and early algebra. Further down  you start getting into algebra one  algebra two  a little bit of precalculus. And the idea is  from this we can actually teach everything    well  everything that can be taught in this type of a framework. So you can imagine    and this is what we are working on    from this knowledge map  you have logic  you have computer programming  you have grammar  you have genetics  all based off of that core of  if you know this and that  now you're ready for this next concept. Now that can work well for an individual learner  and I encourage you to do it with your kids  but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself. It'll change what happens at the dinner table. But what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about. And so what I'm showing you here  this is data from a pilot in the Los Altos school district  where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes  and completely gutted their old math curriculum. These kids aren't using textbooks  or getting one size fits all lectures. They're doing Khan Academy  that software  for roughly half of their math class. I want to be clear  we don't view this as a complete math education. What it does is    this is what's happening in Los Altos    it frees up time    it's the blocking and tackling  making sure you know how to move through a system of equations  and it frees up time for the simulations  for the games  for the mechanics  for the robot building  for the estimating how high that hill is based on its shadow. And so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day  every kid works at their own pace    this is actually a live dashboard from the Los Altos school district    and they look at this dashboard. Every row is a student. Every column is one of those concepts. Green means the student's already proficient. Blue means they're working on it    no need to worry. Red means they're stuck. And what the teacher does is literally just say   Let me intervene on the red kids.  Or even better   Let me get one of the green kids  who are already proficient in that concept  to be the first line of attack  and actually tutor their peer.  Now  I come from a very data centric reality  so we don't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions   What don't you understand  What do you understand   and all the rest. So our paradigm is to arm teachers with as much data as possible    data that  in any other field  is expected  in finance  marketing  manufacturing    so the teachers can diagnose what's wrong with the students so they can make their interaction as productive as possible. Now teachers know exactly what the students have been up to  how long they've spent each day  what videos they've watched  when did they pause the videos  what did they stop watching  what exercises are they using  what have they focused on  The outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on. The inner circle shows the videos they're focused on. The data gets pretty granular  so you can see the exact problems the student got right or wrong. Red is wrong  blue is right. The leftmost question is the first one the student attempted. They watched the video over there. And you can see  eventually they were able to get    in a row. It's almost like you can see them learning over those last    problems. They also got faster    the height is how long it took them. When you talk about self paced learning  it makes sense for everyone    in education speak   differentiated learning     but it's kind of crazy  what happens when you see it in a classroom. Because every time we've done this  in every classroom we've done  over and over again  if you go five days into it  there's a group of kids who've raced ahead and a group who are a little bit slower. In a traditional model  in a snapshot assessment  you say   These are the gifted kids  these are the slow kids. Maybe they should be tracked differently. Maybe we should put them in different classes.  But when you let students work at their own pace    we see it over and over again    you see students who took a little bit extra time on one concept or the other  but once they get through that concept  they just race ahead. And so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago  you now would think are gifted. And we're seeing it over and over again. It makes you really wonder how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from were really just due to a coincidence of time. Now as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos  our goal is to use technology to humanize  not just in Los Altos  but on a global scale  what's happening in education. And that brings up an interesting point. A lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom is focused on student to teacher ratios. In our mind  the relevant metric is  student to valuable human time  with the teacher ratio. So in a traditional model  most of the teacher's time is spent doing lectures and grading and whatnot. Maybe five percent of their time is sitting next to students and working with them. Now      percent of their time is. So once again  using technology  not just flipping the classroom  you're humanizing the classroom  I'd argue  by a factor of five or   . As valuable as that is in Los Altos  imagine what it does to the adult learner  who's embarrassed to go back and learn stuff they should have known before going back to college. Imagine what it does to a street kid in Calcutta  who has to help his family during the day  and that's the reason he or she can't go to school. Now they can spend two hours a day and remediate  or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or don't know. Now imagine what happens where    we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom. But this is all one system. There's no reason why you can't have that peer to peer tutoring beyond that one classroom. Imagine what happens if that student in Calcutta all of the sudden can tutor your son  or your son can tutor that kid in Calcutta. And I think what you'll see emerging is this notion of a global one world classroom. And that's essentially what we're trying to build. Thank you. Bill Gates  I'll ask about two or three questions. Salman Khan  Oh  OK. BG  I've seen some things you're doing in the system  that have to do with motivation and feedback    energy points  merit badges. Tell me what you're thinking there. SK  Oh yeah. No  we have an awesome team working on it. I have to be clear  it's not just me anymore. I'm still doing all the videos  but we have a rock star team doing the software. We've put a bunch of game mechanics in there  where you get badges  we're going to start having leader boards by area  you get points. It's actually been pretty interesting. Just the wording of the badging  or how many points you get for doing something  we see on a system wide basis  like tens of thousands of fifth graders or sixth graders going one direction or another  depending what badge you give them. BG  And the collaboration you're doing with Los Altos  how did that come about  SK  Los Altos  it was kind of crazy. Once again  I didn't expect it to be used in classrooms. Someone from their board came and said   What would you do if you had carte Blanche in a classroom   I said   Well  every student would work at their own pace  on something like this  we'd give a dashboard.  They said   This is kind of radical. We have to think about it.  Me and the rest of the team were like   They're never going to want to do this.  But literally the next day they were like   Can you start in two weeks   BG  So fifth grade math is where that's going on right now  SK  It's two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes. They're doing it at the district level. I think what they're excited about is they can follow these kids  not only in school  on Christmas  we saw some of the kids were doing it. We can track everything  track them as they go through the entire district. Through the summers  as they go from one teacher to the next  you have this continuity of data that even at the district level  they can see. BG  So some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and track actually what's going on with those kids. So you're getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they think they need  SK  Oh yeah. Most of those were specs by the teachers. We made some of those for students so they could see their data  but we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves. And they're saying   Hey  this is nice  but     Like that focus graph  a lot of the teachers said   I have a feeling a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic.  So we made that focus diagram. So it's all been teacher driven. It's been pretty crazy. BG  Is this ready for prime time  Do you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out  SK  Yeah  it's ready. We've got a million people on the site already  so we can handle a few more. No  no reason why it really can't happen in every classroom in America tomorrow. BG  And the vision of the tutoring thing. The idea there is  if I'm confused about a topic  somehow right in the user interface  I'd find people who are volunteering  maybe see their reputation  and I could schedule and connect up with those people  SK  Absolutely. And this is something I recommend everyone in this audience do. Those dashboards the teachers have  you can go log in right now and you can essentially become a coach for your kids  your nephews  your cousins  or maybe some kids at the Boys and Girls Club. And yeah  you can start becoming a mentor  a tutor  really immediately. But yeah  it's all there. BG  Well  it's amazing. I think you just got a glimpse of the future of education. BG  Thank you. SK  Thank you. Imagine if you could record your life    everything you said  everything you did  available in a perfect memory store at your fingertips  so you could go back and find memorable moments and relive them  or sift through traces of time and discover patterns in your own life that previously had gone undiscovered. Well that's exactly the journey that my family began five and a half years ago. This is my wife and collaborator  Rupal. And on this day  at this moment  we walked into the house with our first child  our beautiful baby boy. And we walked into a house with a very special home video recording system. Deb Roy  This moment and thousands of other moments special for us were captured in our home because in every room in the house  if you looked up  you'd see a camera and a microphone  and if you looked down  you'd get this bird's eye view of the room. Here's our living room  the baby bedroom  kitchen  dining room and the rest of the house. And all of these fed into a disc array that was designed for a continuous capture. So here we are flying through a day in our home as we move from sunlit morning through incandescent evening and  finally  lights out for the day. Over the course of three years  we recorded eight to    hours a day  amassing roughly a quarter million hours of multi track audio and video. So you're looking at a piece of what is by far the largest home video collection ever made. And what this data represents for our family at a personal level  the impact has already been immense  and we're still learning its value. Countless moments of unsolicited natural moments  not posed moments  are captured there  and we're starting to learn how to discover them and find them. But there's also a scientific reason that drove this project  which was to use this natural longitudinal data to understand the process of how a child learns language    that child being my son. And so with many privacy provisions put in place to protect everyone who was recorded in the data  we made elements of the data available to my trusted research team at MIT so we could start teasing apart patterns in this massive data set  trying to understand the influence of social environments on language acquisition. So we're looking here at one of the first things we started to do. This is my wife and I cooking breakfast in the kitchen  and as we move through space and through time  a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen. In order to convert this opaque         hours of video into something that we could start to see  we use motion analysis to pull out  as we move through space and through time  what we call space time worms. And this has become part of our toolkit for being able to look and see where the activities are in the data  and with it  trace the pattern of  in particular  where my son moved throughout the home  so that we could focus our transcription efforts  all of the speech environment around my son    all of the words that he heard from myself  my wife  our nanny  and over time  the words he began to produce. So with that technology and that data and the ability to  with machine assistance  transcribe speech  we've now transcribed well over seven million words of our home transcripts. And with that  let me take you now for a first tour into the data. So you've all  I'm sure  seen time lapse videos where a flower will blossom as you accelerate time. I'd like you to now experience the blossoming of a speech form. My son  soon after his first birthday  would say  gaga  to mean water. And over the course of the next half year  he slowly learned to approximate the proper adult form   water.  So we're going to cruise through half a year in about    seconds. No video here  so you can focus on the sound  the acoustics  of a new kind of trajectory  gaga to water. Gaga gaga gaga guga guga guga wada gaga gaga guga gaga wader guga guga water water water water water water water water water. DR  He sure nailed it  didn't he. So he didn't just learn water. Over the course of the    months  the first two years that we really focused on  this is a map of every word he learned in chronological order. And because we have full transcripts  we've identified each of the     words that he learned to produce by his second birthday. He was an early talker. And so we started to analyze why. Why were certain words born before others  This is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us. The way to interpret this apparently simple graph is  on the vertical is an indication of how complex caregiver utterances are based on the length of utterances. And the  horizontal  axis is time. And all of the data  we aligned based on the following idea  Every time my son would learn a word  we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard that contained that word. And we would plot the relative length of the utterances. And what we found was this curious phenomena  that caregiver speech would systematically dip to a minimum  making language as simple as possible  and then slowly ascend back up in complexity. And the amazing thing was that bounce  that dip  lined up almost precisely with when each word was born    word after word  systematically. So it appears that all three primary caregivers    myself  my wife and our nanny    were systematically and  I would think  subconsciously restructuring our language to meet him at the birth of a word and bring him gently into more complex language. And the implications of this    there are many  but one I just want to point out  is that there must be amazing feedback loops. Of course  my son is learning from his linguistic environment  but the environment is learning from him. That environment  people  are in these tight feedback loops and creating a kind of scaffolding that has not been noticed until now. But that's looking at the speech context. What about the visual context  We're not looking at    think of this as a dollhouse cutaway of our house. We've taken those circular fish eye lens cameras  and we've done some optical correction  and then we can bring it into three dimensional life. So welcome to my home. This is a moment  one moment captured across multiple cameras. The reason we did this is to create the ultimate memory machine  where you can go back and interactively fly around and then breathe video life into this system. What I'm going to do is give you an accelerated view of    minutes  again  of just life in the living room. That's me and my son on the floor. And there's video analytics that are tracking our movements. My son is leaving red ink. I am leaving green ink. We're now on the couch  looking out through the window at cars passing by. And finally  my son playing in a walking toy by himself. Now we freeze the action     minutes  we turn time into the vertical axis  and we open up for a view of these interaction traces we've just left behind. And we see these amazing structures    these little knots of two colors of thread we call  social hot spots.  The spiral thread we call a  solo hot spot.  And we think that these affect the way language is learned. What we'd like to do is start understanding the interaction between these patterns and the language that my son is exposed to to see if we can predict how the structure of when words are heard affects when they're learned    so in other words  the relationship between words and what they're about in the world. So here's how we're approaching this. In this video  again  my son is being traced out. He's leaving red ink behind. And there's our nanny by the door. Nanny  All right.  Baby  Aaaa.  DR  She offers water  and off go the two worms over to the kitchen to get water. And what we've done is use the word  water  to tag that moment  that bit of activity. And now we take the power of data and take every time my son ever heard the word water and the context he saw it in  and we use it to penetrate through the video and find every activity trace that co occurred with an instance of water. And what this data leaves in its wake is a landscape. We call these wordscapes. This is the wordscape for the word water  and you can see most of the action is in the kitchen. That's where those big peaks are over to the left. And just for contrast  we can do this with any word. We can take the word  bye  as in  good bye.  And we're now zoomed in over the entrance to the house. And we look  and we find  as you would expect  a contrast in the landscape where the word  bye  occurs much more in a structured way. So we're using these structures to start predicting the order of language acquisition  and that's ongoing work now. In my lab  which we're peering into now  at MIT    this is at the media lab. This has become my favorite way of videographing just about any space. Three of the key people in this project  Philip DeCamp  Rony Kubat and Brandon Roy are pictured here. Philip has been a close collaborator on all the visualizations you're seeing. And Michael Fleischman was another Ph.D. student in my lab who worked with me on this home video analysis  and he made the following observation  that  just the way that we're analyzing how language connects to events which provide common ground for language  that same idea we can take out of your home  Deb  and we can apply it to the world of public media.  And so our effort took an unexpected turn. Think of mass media as providing common ground and you have the recipe for taking this idea to a whole new place. We've started analyzing television content using the same principles    analyzing event structure of a TV signal    episodes of shows  commercials  all of the components that make up the event structure. And we're now  with satellite dishes  pulling and analyzing a good part of all the TV being watched in the United States. And you don't have to now go and instrument living rooms with microphones to get people's conversations  you just tune into publicly available social media feeds. So we're pulling in about three billion comments a month  and then the magic happens. You have the event structure  the common ground that the words are about  coming out of the television feeds  you've got the conversations that are about those topics  and through semantic analysis    and this is actually real data you're looking at from our data processing    each yellow line is showing a link being made between a comment in the wild and a piece of event structure coming out of the television signal. And the same idea now can be built up. And we get this wordscape  except now words are not assembled in my living room. Instead  the context  the common ground activities  are the content on television that's driving the conversations. And what we're seeing here  these skyscrapers now  are commentary that are linked to content on television. Same concept  but looking at communication dynamics in a very different sphere. And so fundamentally  rather than  for example  measuring content based on how many people are watching  this gives us the basic data for looking at engagement properties of content. And just like we can look at feedback cycles and dynamics in a family  we can now open up the same concepts and look at much larger groups of people. This is a subset of data from our database    just        out of several million    and the social graph that connects them through publicly available sources. And if you put them on one plain  a second plain is where the content lives. So we have the programs and the sporting events and the commercials  and all of the link structures that tie them together make a content graph. And then the important third dimension. Each of the links that you're seeing rendered here is an actual connection made between something someone said and a piece of content. And there are  again  now tens of millions of these links that give us the connective tissue of social graphs and how they relate to content. And we can now start to probe the structure in interesting ways. So if we  for example  trace the path of one piece of content that drives someone to comment on it  and then we follow where that comment goes  and then look at the entire social graph that becomes activated and then trace back to see the relationship between that social graph and content  a very interesting structure becomes visible. We call this a co viewing clique  a virtual living room if you will. And there are fascinating dynamics at play. It's not one way. A piece of content  an event  causes someone to talk. They talk to other people. That drives tune in behavior back into mass media  and you have these cycles that drive the overall behavior. Another example    very different    another actual person in our database    and we're finding at least hundreds  if not thousands  of these. We've given this person a name. This is a pro amateur  or pro am media critic who has this high fan out rate. So a lot of people are following this person    very influential    and they have a propensity to talk about what's on TV. So this person is a key link in connecting mass media and social media together. One last example from this data  Sometimes it's actually a piece of content that is special. So if we go and look at this piece of content  President Obama's State of the Union address from just a few weeks ago  and look at what we find in this same data set  at the same scale  the engagement properties of this piece of content are truly remarkable. A nation exploding in conversation in real time in response to what's on the broadcast. And of course  through all of these lines are flowing unstructured language. We can X ray and get a real time pulse of a nation  real time sense of the social reactions in the different circuits in the social graph being activated by content. So  to summarize  the idea is this  As our world becomes increasingly instrumented and we have the capabilities to collect and connect the dots between what people are saying and the context they're saying it in  what's emerging is an ability to see new social structures and dynamics that have previously not been seen. It's like building a microscope or telescope and revealing new structures about our own behavior around communication. And I think the implications here are profound  whether it's for science  for commerce  for government  or perhaps most of all  for us as individuals. And so just to return to my son  when I was preparing this talk  he was looking over my shoulder  and I showed him the clips I was going to show to you today  and I asked him for permission    granted. And then I went on to reflect   Isn't it amazing  this entire database  all these recordings  I'm going to hand off to you and to your sister     who arrived two years later     and you guys are going to be able to go back and re experience moments that you could never  with your biological memory  possibly remember the way you can now   And he was quiet for a moment. And I thought   What am I thinking  He's five years old. He's not going to understand this.  And just as I was having that thought  he looked up at me and said   So that when I grow up  I can show this to my kids   And I thought   Wow  this is powerful stuff.  So I want to leave you with one last memorable moment from our family. This is the first time our son took more than two steps at once    captured on film. And I really want you to focus on something as I take you through. It's a cluttered environment  it's natural life. My mother's in the kitchen  cooking  and  of all places  in the hallway  I realize he's about to do it  about to take more than two steps. And so you hear me encouraging him  realizing what's happening  and then the magic happens. Listen very carefully. About three steps in  he realizes something magic is happening  and the most amazing feedback loop of all kicks in  and he takes a breath in  and he whispers  wow  and instinctively I echo back the same. And so let's fly back in time to that memorable moment. Come here. Can you do it  Oh  boy. Can you do it  Baby  Yeah. DR  Ma  he's walking. DR  Thank you. This is a river. This is a stream. This is a river. This is happening all over the country. There are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the United States. On this map  the colored areas represent water conflicts. Similar problems are emerging in the east as well. The reasons vary state to state  but mostly in the details. There are       miles of dewatered streams in Montana alone. They would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife. They're the veins of the ecosystem  and they're often empty veins. I want to tell you the story of just one of these streams because it's an archetype for the larger story. This is Prickly Pear Creek. It runs through a populated area from East Helena to Lake Helena. It supports wild fish including cutthroat  brown and rainbow trout. Nearly every year for more than a hundred years  it's looked like this in the summer. How did we get here  Well  it started back in the late     s when people started settling in places like Montana. In short  there was a lot of water and there weren't very many people. But as more people showed up wanting water  the folks who were there first got a little concerned  and in       Montana passed its first water law. It basically said  everybody near the stream can share in the stream. Oddly  a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream  and the folks who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers. There were precedent setting suits in      and       both involving Prickly Pear Creek. And in       the Montana Supreme Court ruled in a case involving Prickly Pear that the folks who were there first had the first  or  senior water rights.  These senior water rights are key. The problem is that all over the west now it looks like this. Some of these creeks have claims for    to     times more water than is actually in the stream. And the senior water rights holders  if they don't use their water right  they risk losing their water right  along with the economic value that goes with it. So they have no incentive to conserve. So it's not just about the number of people  the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you don't use it. So after decades of lawsuits and     years  now  of experience  we still have this. It's a broken system. There's a disincentive to conserve  because  if you don't use your water right  you can lose your water right. And I'm sure you all know  this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities. Okay. Now I'm going to change gears here. Most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation's free  and some of you'll be happy to know that it involves beer. There's another thing happening around the country  which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint. They're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water  they're trying to be really efficient with their water use  and they're concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand. Well  it's a national problem  but I'm going to tell you another story from Montana  and it involves beer. I bet you didn't know  it takes about   pints of water to make a pint of beer. If you include all the drain  it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer. Now the brewers in Montana have already done a lot to reduce their water consumption  but they still use millions of gallons of water. I mean  there's water in beer. So what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem  These ecosystems are really important to the Montana brewers and their customers. After all  there's a strong correlation between water and fishing  and for some  there's a strong correlation between fishing and beer. So the Montana brewers and their customers are concerned  and they're looking for some way to address the problem. So how can they address this remaining water footprint  Remember Prickly Pear. Up until now  business water stewardship has been limited to measuring and reducing  and we're suggesting that the next step is to restore. Remember Prickly Pear. It's a broken system. You've got a disincentive to conserve  because if you don't use your water right  you risk losing your water right. Well  we decided to connect these two worlds    the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these creeks. In some states  senior water rights holders can leave their water in stream while legally protecting it from others and maintaining their water right. After all  it is their water right  and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream  it's their right to do so. But they have no incentive to do so. So  working with local water trusts  we created an incentive to do so. We pay them to leave their water in stream. That's what's happening here. This individual has made the choice and is closing this water diversion  leaving the water in the stream. He doesn't lose the water right  he just chooses to apply that right  or some portion of it  to the stream  instead of to the land. Because he's the senior water rights holder  he can protect the water from other users in the stream. Okay  He gets paid to leave the water in the stream. This guy's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream. We then take the measured water  we divide it into thousand gallon increments. Each increment gets a serial number and a certificate  and then the brewers and others buy those certificates as a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems. The brewers pay to restore water to the stream. It provides a simple  inexpensive and measurable way to return water to these degraded ecosystems  while giving farmers an economic choice and giving businesses concerned about their water footprints an easy way to deal with them. After     years of conflict and     years of dry streams  a circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved  we put together a market based  willing buyer  willing seller solution    a solution that does not require litigation. It's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints a real opportunity to put water where it's critically needed  into these degraded ecosystems  while at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice about how their water is used. These transactions create allies  not enemies. They connect people rather than dividing them. And they provide needed economic support for rural communities. And most importantly  it's working. We've returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems. We've connected senior water rights holders with brewers in Montana  with hotels and tea companies in Oregon and with high tech companies that use a lot of water in the Southwest. And when we make these connections  we can and we do turn this into this. Thank you very much. When I got my current job  I was given a good piece of advice  which was to interview three politicians every day. And from that much contact with politicians  I can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another. They have what I called  logorrhea dementia   which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane. But what they do have is incredible social skills. When you meet them  they lock into you  they look you in the eye  they invade your personal space  they massage the back of your head. I had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago who kept his hand on my inner thigh throughout the whole meal    squeezing it. I once    this was years ago    I saw Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate. And they were friends  and they hugged each other and they were laughing  and their faces were like this far apart. And they were moving and grinding and moving their arms up and down each other. And I was like   Get a room. I don't want to see this.  But they have those social skills. Another case  Last election cycle  I was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire  and he was campaigning with his five perfect sons  Bip  Chip  Rip  Zip  Lip and Dip. And he's going into a diner. And he goes into the diner  introduces himself to a family and says   What village are you from in New Hampshire   And then he describes the home he owned in their village. And so he goes around the room  and then as he's leaving the diner  he first names almost everybody he's just met. I was like   Okay  that's social skill.  But the paradox is  when a lot of these people slip into the policy making mode  that social awareness vanishes and they start talking like accountants. So in the course of my career  I have covered a series of failures. We sent economists in the Soviet Union with privatization plans when it broke up  and what they really lacked was social trust. We invaded Iraq with a military oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities. We had a financial regulatory regime based on the assumptions that traders were rational creatures who wouldn't do anything stupid. For    years  I've been covering school reform and we've basically reorganized the bureaucratic boxes    charters  private schools  vouchers    but we've had disappointing results year after year. And the fact is  people learn from people they love. And if you're not talking about the individual relationship between a teacher and a student  you're not talking about that reality. But that reality is expunged from our policy making process. And so that's led to a question for me  Why are the most socially attuned people on earth completely dehumanized when they think about policy  And I came to the conclusion  this is a symptom of a larger problem. That  for centuries  we've inherited a view of human nature based on the notion that we're divided selves  that reason is separated from the emotions and that society progresses to the extent that reason can suppress the passions. And it's led to a view of human nature that we're rational individuals who respond in straightforward ways to incentives  and it's led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior is. And it's produced a great amputation  a shallow view of human nature. We're really good at talking about material things  but we're really bad at talking about emotions. We're really good at talking about skills and safety and health  we're really bad at talking about character. Alasdair MacIntyre  the famous philosopher  said that   We have the concepts of the ancient morality of virtue  honor  goodness  but we no longer have a system by which to connect them.  And so this has led to a shallow path in politics  but also in a whole range of human endeavors. You can see it in the way we raise our young kids. You go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon and you watch the kids come out  and they're wearing these    pound backpacks. If the wind blows them over  they're like beetles stuck there on the ground. You see these cars that drive up    usually it's Saabs and Audis and Volvos  because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car  so long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy    that's fine. They get picked up by these creatures I've called uber moms  who are highly successful career women who have taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard. And you can usually tell the uber moms because they actually weigh less than their own children. So at the moment of conception  they're doing little butt exercises. Babies flop out  they're flashing Mandarin flashcards at the things. Driving them home  and they want them to be enlightened  so they take them to Ben   Jerry's ice cream company with its own foreign policy. In one of my books  I joke that Ben   Jerry's should make a pacifist toothpaste    doesn't kill germs  just asks them to leave. It would be a big seller. And they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula  and Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores where all the cashiers look like they're on loan from Amnesty International. They buy these seaweed based snacks there called Veggie Booty with Kale  which is for kids who come home and say   Mom  mom  I want a snack that'll help prevent colon rectal cancer.  And so the kids are raised in a certain way  jumping through achievement hoops of the things we can measure    SAT prep  oboe  soccer practice. They get into competitive colleges  they get good jobs  and sometimes they make a success of themselves in a superficial manner  and they make a ton of money. And sometimes you can see them at vacation places like Jackson Hole or Aspen. And they've become elegant and slender    they don't really have thighs  they just have one elegant calve on top of another. They have kids of their own  and they've achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people  so their grandmoms look like Gertrude Stein  their daughters looks like Halle Berry    I don't know how they've done that. They get there and they realize it's fashionable now to have dogs a third as tall as your ceiling heights. So they've got these furry     pound dogs    all look like velociraptors  all named after Jane Austen characters. And then when they get old  they haven't really developed a philosophy of life  but they've decided   I've been successful at everything  I'm just not going to die.  And so they hire personal trainers  they're popping Cialis like breath mints. You see them on the mountains up there. They're cross country skiing up the mountain with these grim expressions that make Dick Cheney look like Jerry Lewis. And as they whiz by you  it's like being passed by a little iron Raisinet going up the hill. And so this is part of what life is  but it's not all of what life is. And over the past few years  I think we've been given a deeper view of human nature and a deeper view of who we are. And it's not based on theology or philosophy  it's in the study of the mind  across all these spheres of research  from neuroscience to the cognitive scientists  behavioral economists  psychologists  sociology  we're developing a revolution in consciousness. And when you synthesize it all  it's giving us a new view of human nature. And far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature  it's a new humanism  it's a new enchantment. And I think when you synthesize this research  you start with three key insights. The first insight is that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species  the unconscious mind does most of the work. And so one way to formulate that is the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute  of which it can be consciously aware of about   . And this leads to oddities. One of my favorite is that people named Dennis are disproportionately likely to become dentists  people named Lawrence become lawyers  because unconsciously we gravitate toward things that sound familiar  which is why I named my daughter President of the United States Brooks. Another finding is that the unconscious  far from being dumb and sexualized  is actually quite smart. So one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture. It's really hard to imagine a sofa  how it's going to look in your house. And the way you should do that is study the furniture  let it marinate in your mind  distract yourself  and then a few days later  go with your gut  because unconsciously you've figured it out. The second insight is that emotions are at the center of our thinking. People with strokes and lesions in the emotion processing parts of the brain are not super smart  they're actually sometimes quite helpless. And the  giant  in the field is in the room tonight and is speaking tomorrow morning    Antonio Damasio. And one of the things he's really shown us is that emotions are not separate from reason  but they are the foundation of reason because they tell us what to value. And so reading and educating your emotions is one of the central activities of wisdom. Now I'm a middle aged guy. I'm not exactly comfortable with emotions. One of my favorite brain stories described these middle aged guys. They put them into a brain scan machine    this is apocryphal by the way  but I don't care    and they had them watch a horror movie  and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives. And the brain scans were identical in both activities. It was just sheer terror. So me talking about emotion is like Gandhi talking about gluttony  but it is the central organizing process of the way we think. It tells us what to imprint. The brain is the record of the feelings of a life. And the third insight is that we're not primarily self contained individuals. We're social animals  not rational animals. We emerge out of relationships  and we are deeply interpenetrated  one with another. And so when we see another person  we reenact in our own minds what we see in their minds. When we watch a car chase in a movie  it's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase. When we watch pornography  it's a little like having sex  though probably not as good. And we see this when lovers walk down the street  when a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia gets caught up in an emotional contagion  the deep interpenetration. And this revolution in who we are gives us a different way of seeing  I think  politics  a different way  most importantly  of seeing human capital. We are now children of the French Enlightenment. We believe that reason is the highest of the faculties. But I think this research shows that the British Enlightenment  or the Scottish Enlightenment  with David Hume  Adam Smith  actually had a better handle on who we are    that reason is often weak  our sentiments are strong  and our sentiments are often trustworthy. And this work corrects that bias in our culture  that dehumanizing bias. It gives us a deeper sense of what it actually takes for us to thrive in this life. When we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily    things like grades  SAT's  degrees  the number of years in schooling. What it really takes to do well  to lead a meaningful life  are things that are deeper  things we don't really even have words for. And so let me list just a couple of the things I think this research points us toward trying to understand. The first gift  or talent  is mindsight    the ability to enter into other people's minds and learn what they have to offer. Babies come with this ability. Meltzoff  who's at the University of Washington  leaned over a baby who was    minutes old. He wagged his tongue at the baby. The baby wagged her tongue back. Babies are born to interpenetrate into Mom's mind and to download what they find    their models of how to understand reality. In the United States     percent of babies have a deep two way conversation with Mom and they learn models to how to relate to other people. And those people who have models of how to relate have a huge head start in life. Scientists at the University of Minnesota did a study in which they could predict with    percent accuracy  at age    months  who was going to graduate from high school  based on who had good attachment with mom. Twenty percent of kids do not have those relationships. They are what we call avoidantly attached. They have trouble relating to other people. They go through life like sailboats tacking into the wind    wanting to get close to people  but not really having the models of how to do that. And so this is one skill of how to hoover up knowledge  one from another. A second skill is equipoise  the ability to have the serenity to read the biases and failures in your own mind. So for example  we are overconfidence machines. Ninety five percent of our professors report that they are above average teachers. Ninety six percent of college students say they have above average social skills. Time magazine asked Americans   Are you in the top one percent of earners   Nineteen percent of Americans are in the top one percent of earners. This is a gender linked trait  by the way. Men drown at twice the rate of women  because men think they can swim across that lake. But some people have the ability and awareness of their own biases  their own overconfidence. They have epistemological modesty. They are open minded in the face of ambiguity. They are able to adjust strength of the conclusions to the strength of their evidence. They are curious. And these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ. The third trait is metis  what we might call street smarts    it's a Greek word. It's a sensitivity to the physical environment  the ability to pick out patterns in an environment    derive a gist. One of my colleagues at the Times did a great story about soldiers in Iraq who could look down a street and detect somehow whether there was an IED  a landmine  in the street. They couldn't tell you how they did it  but they could feel cold  they felt a coldness  and they were more often right than wrong. The third is what you might call sympathy  the ability to work within groups. And that comes in tremendously handy  because groups are smarter than individuals. And face to face groups are much smarter than groups that communicate electronically  because    percent of our communication is non verbal. And the effectiveness of a group is not determined by the IQ of the group  it's determined by how well they communicate  how often they take turns in conversation. Then you could talk about a trait like blending. Any child can say   I'm a tiger   pretend to be a tiger. It seems so elementary. But in fact  it's phenomenally complicated to take a concept  I  and a concept  tiger  and blend them together. But this is the source of innovation. What Picasso did  for example  was take the concept  Western art  and the concept  African masks  and blend them together    not only the geometry  but the moral systems entailed in them. And these are skills  again  we can't count and measure. And then the final thing I'll mention is something you might call limerence. And this is not an ability  it's a drive and a motivation. The conscious mind hungers for success and prestige. The unconscious mind hungers for those moments of transcendence  when the skull line disappears and we are lost in a challenge or a task    when a craftsman feels lost in his craft  when a naturalist feels at one with nature  when a believer feels at one with God's love. That is what the unconscious mind hungers for. And many of us feel it in love when lovers feel fused. And one of the most beautiful descriptions I've come across in this research of how minds interpenetrate was written by a great theorist and scientist named Douglas Hofstadter at the University of Indiana. He was married to a woman named Carol  and they had a wonderful relationship. When their kids were five and two  Carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly. And Hofstadter wrote a book called  I Am a Strange Loop.  In the course of that book  he describes a moment    just months after Carol has died    he comes across her picture on the mantel  or on a bureau in his bedroom. And here's what he wrote   I looked at her face  and I looked so deeply that I felt I was behind her eyes. And all at once I found myself saying as tears flowed  'That's me. That's me.' And those simple words brought back many thoughts that I had had before  about the fusion of our souls into one higher level entity  about the fact that at the core of both our souls lay our identical hopes and dreams for our children  about the notion that those hopes were not separate or distinct hopes  but were just one hope  one clear thing that defined us both  that welded us into a unit    the kind of unit I had but dimly imagined before being married and having children. I realized that  though Carol had died  that core piece of her had not died at all  but had lived on very determinedly in my brain.  The Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom. Through his suffering  Hofstadter understood how deeply interpenetrated we are. Through the policy failures of the last    years  we have come to acknowledge  I think  how shallow our view of human nature has been. And now as we confront that shallowness and the failures that derive from our inability to get the depths of who we are  comes this revolution in consciousness    these people in so many fields exploring the depth of our nature and coming away with this enchanted  this new humanism. And when Freud discovered his sense of the unconscious  it had a vast effect on the climate of the times. Now we are discovering a more accurate vision of the unconscious  of who we are deep inside  and it's going to have a wonderful and profound and humanizing effect on our culture. Thank you. I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that  by far  most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light. We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes. The Sun burns our peripheral vision. We see light reflected off the Moon. And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies  the known universe has come to us through light  across vast eras in cosmic history. And with all of our modern telescopes  we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe    these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the Big Bang. And yet  the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent. I'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself  because space can wobble like a drum. It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold. Now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe    a sonic composition. And while we've never heard the sounds from space  we really should  in the next few years  start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there. So in this ambition to capture songs from the universe  we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have  because black holes can bang on space time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song  which I'd like to play for you    some of our predictions for what that song will be like. Now black holes are dark against a dark sky. We can't see them directly. They're not brought to us with light  at least not directly. We can see them indirectly  because black holes wreak havoc on their environment. They destroy stars around them. They churn up debris in their surroundings. But they won't come to us directly through light. We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background  but we haven't yet. And yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen  and that's because they bang on space time like a drum. Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein    to whom we owe so much. Einstein realized that if space were empty  if the universe were empty  it would be like this picture  except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it. But if we were freely falling through the space  even without this helpful grid  we might be able to paint it ourselves  because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines  undeflected straight paths through the universe. Einstein also realized    and this is the real meat of the matter    that if you put energy or mass in the universe  it would curve space  and a freely falling object would pass by  let's say  the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space. It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity. Now even light will be bent by those paths. And you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun  as the Earth is  or the Moon around the Earth. These are the natural curves in space. What Einstein did not realize was that  if you took our Sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers    so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across  you would make a black hole  an object so dense that if light veered too close  it would never escape    a dark shadow against the universe. It wasn't Einstein who realized this  it was Karl Schwarzschild who was a German Jew in World War I    joined the German army already an accomplished scientist  working on the Russian front. I like to imagine Schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire  and then  in between  calculating Einstein's equations    as you do in the trenches. And he was reading Einstein's recently published general theory of relativity  and he was thrilled by this theory. And he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary  curves so strong that space would rain down into them  space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole. And even light could not escape this current. Light would be dragged down the hole as everything else would be  and all that would be left would be a shadow. Now he wrote to Einstein  and he said   As you will see  the war has been kind to me enough. Despite the heavy gunfire  I've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas.  And Einstein was very impressed with his exact solution  and I should hope also the dedication of the scientist. This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions. And he took Schwarzschild's idea to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week. But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity. He did not believe they existed in nature. He thought nature would protect us from their formation. It was decades before the term  black hole  was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects    in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime. Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole. It's actually not massive enough. But if we did a little thought experiment    as Einstein was very fond of doing    we could imagine putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers  and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit  maybe    kilometers outside of the black hole sun. And it would be self illuminated  because now the Sun's gone  we have no other source of light    so let's make our little Earth self illuminated. And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even    km outside of this crushed black hole. This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan  more or less. It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth. But basically that's what we're talking about. We're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan. So we move this Earth very close       kilometers outside    and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole. There's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe  but you actually have to get very close to fall in. But what's very impressive is that  from our vantage point  we can always see the Earth. It cannot hide behind the black hole. The light from the Earth  some of it falls in  but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us. So you can't hide anything behind a black hole. If this were Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons  don't hide behind the black hole. They can see you. Now  our Sun will not collapse to a black hole    it's not massive enough    but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy. And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way  this is what it would look like. We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes. And if we were to fall towards this black hole  we would see all of that light lensed around it  and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened. It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't  anymore than light can escape. But even though the black hole is dark from the outside  it's not dark on the inside  because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us. And even though  due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation  our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time  it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us  right before we were crushed to death by the black hole. It would be like a near death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel  but it's a total death experience. And there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel. Now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole  but black holes can be heard  even if they're not seen. Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation    imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together. Maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes    each one    times the mass of the Sun. So now we're going to crush them down to    kilometers across. They can be spinning hundreds of times a second. At the end of their lives  they're going around each other very near the speed of light. So they're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second  and as they do so  they not only curve space  but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space  an actual wave on space time. Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe. And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light. This computer simulation is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard. It took almost    years for anyone in the world to crack this problem. This was one of the groups. It shows two black holes in orbit around each other  again  with these helpfully painted curves. And if you can see    it's kind of faint    but if you can see the red waves emanating out  those are the gravitational waves. They're literally the sounds of space ringing  and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning  quiet black hole at the end of the day. If you were standing near enough  your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space. You would literally hear the sound. Now of course  your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully  so you might have trouble understanding what's going on. But I'd like to play for you the sound that we predict. This is from my group    a slightly less glamorous computer modeling. Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole. The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close. If it gets far away  it's a little too quiet. But it comes in like a mallet  and it literally cracks space  wobbling it like a drum. And we can predict what the sound will be. We know that  as it falls in  it gets faster and it gets louder. And eventually  we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy. Then it's gone. Now I've never heard it that loud    it's actually more dramatic. At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic. It's sort of like ding  ding  ding. This is another sound from my group. No  I'm not showing you any images  because black holes don't leave behind helpful trails of ink  and space is not painted  showing you the curves. But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this  you want to get moving. Want to get away from the sound. Both black holes are moving. Both black holes are getting closer together. In this case  they're both wobbling quite a lot. And then they're going to merge. Now it's gone. Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging    that it chirps up at the end. Now that's our prediction for what we'll see. Luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach  California. And surely  somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged. And surely  the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years  or a million years  at the speed of light to get to us. But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear. There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth    one called LIGO    which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers. It's a remarkably ambitious experiment  and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years    to pick this up. There's also a mission proposed for space  which hopefully will launch in the next ten years  called LISA. And LISA will be able to see super massive black holes    black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun. In this Hubble image  we see two galaxies. They look like they're frozen in some embrace. And each one probably harbors a super massive black hole at its core. But they're not frozen  they're actually merging. These two black holes are colliding  and they will merge over a billion year time scale. It's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration. But LISA could see the final stages of two super massive black holes earlier in the universe's history  the last    minutes before they fall together. And it's not just black holes  but it's also any big disturbance in the universe    and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang. When that expression was coined  it was derisive    like   Oh  who would believe in a Big Bang   But now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang. It might make a sound. This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside. We don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe. So imagine you're inside the Big Bang. It's everywhere  it's all around you  and the space is wobbling chaotically. Fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us. Galaxies form  and generations of stars form in those galaxies  and around one star  at least one star  is a habitable planet. And here we are frantically building these experiments  doing these calculations  writing these computer codes. Imagine a billion years ago  two black holes collided. That song has been ringing through space for all that time. We weren't even here. It gets closer and closer           years ago  we're still doing cave paintings. It's like hurry  build your instruments. It's getting closer and closer  and in    ... whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity    we'll build them  we'll turn on the machines and  bang  we'll catch it    the first song from space. If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up  it would sound like this. It's literally the definition of noise. It's white noise  it's such a chaotic ringing. But it's around us everywhere  presumably  if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe. And if we pick it up  it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation  of our observable universe. So within the next few years  we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit  render the universe in audio. But if we detect those earliest moments  it'll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang  which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest  most elusive  questions. If we run the movie of our universe backwards  we know that there was a Big Bang in our past  and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it  but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang  I mean we have to ask  has it happened before  Will it happen again  I mean  in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge to reignite wonder  we can ask questions  at least for this last minute  that honestly might evade us forever. But we have to ask  Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history  Or  is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse    each branch with its own Big Bang in its past    maybe some of them with black holes playing drums  maybe some without    maybe some with sentient life  and maybe some without    not in our past  not in our future  but somehow fundamentally connected to us  So we have to wonder  if there is a multiverse  in some other patch of that multiverse  are there creatures  Here's my multiverse creatures. Are there other creatures in the multiverse  wondering about us and wondering about their own origins  And if they are  I can imagine them as we are  calculating  writing computer code  building instruments  trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there. Thank you. Thank you. Back in New York  I am the head of development for a non profit called Robin Hood. When I'm not fighting poverty  I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company. Now in our town  where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff  you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action. I remember my first fire. I was the second volunteer on the scene  so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in. But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be. When I found the captain  he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner  who was surely having one of the worst days of her life. Here it was  the middle of the night  she was standing outside in the pouring rain  under an umbrella  in her pajamas  barefoot  while her house was in flames. The other volunteer who had arrived just before me    let's call him Lex Luther    got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog. The dog  I was stunned with jealousy. Here was some lawyer or money manager who  for the rest of his life  gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature  just because he beat me by five seconds. Well  I was next. The captain waved me over. He said   Bezos  I need you to go into the house. I need you to go upstairs  past the fire  and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes.  I swear. So  not exactly what I was hoping for  but off I went    up the stairs  down the hall  past the 'real' firefighters  who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point  into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes. Now I know what you're thinking  but I'm no hero. I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door. We took our treasures outside to the homeowner  where  not surprisingly  his received much more attention than did mine. A few weeks later  the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home. The act of kindness she noted above all others  someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes. In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter  I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale  but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis. And you know what I've learned  They all matter. So as I look around this room at people who either have achieved  or are on their way to achieving  remarkable levels of success  I would offer this reminder  don't wait. Don't wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody's life. If you have something to give  give it now. Serve food at a soup kitchen. Clean up a neighborhood park. Be a mentor. Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody's life  but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one. So get in the game. Save the shoes. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Mark  Mark  come back. Mark Bezos  Thank you. There's a beautiful statement on the screen that says   Light creates ambiance  light makes the feel of a space  and light is also the expression of structure.  Well  that was not by me. That was  of course  by Le Corbusier  the famous architect. And here you can see what he meant in one of his beautiful buildings    the chapel Notre Dame Du Haut De Ronchamp    where he creates this light that he could only make because there's also dark. And I think that is the quintessence of this    minute talk    that there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well being without proper darkness. So this is how we normally would light our offices. We have codes and standards that tell us that the lights should be so much Lux and of great uniformity. This is how we create uniform lighting from one wall to the other in a regular grid of lamps. And that is quite different from what I just showed you from Le Corbusier. If we would apply these codes and standards to the Pantheon in Rome  it would never have looked like this  because this beautiful light feature that goes around there all by itself can only appear because there is also darkness in that same building. And the same is more or less what Santiago Calatrava said when he said   Light  I make it in my buildings for comfort.  And he didn't mean the comfort of a five course dinner as opposed to a one course meal  but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people. He meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun. And he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky  and where you can experience the sun  that give us a better life in the built environment  just because of the relevance of light in its brightness and also in its shadows. And what it all boils down to is  of course  the sun. And this image of the Sun may suggest that the Sun is something evil and aggressive  but we should not forget that all energy on this planet actually comes from the Sun  and light is only a manifestation of that energy. The sun is for dynamics  for color changes. The sun is for beauty in our environment  like in this building    the High Museum in Atlanta  which has been created by Renzo Piano from Italy  together with Arup Lighting  a brilliant team of lighting designers  who created a very subtle modulation of light across the space  responding to what the sun does outside  just because of all these beautiful openings in the roof. So in an indirect way  you can see the sun. And what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum. They created this shade that you can see here  which actually covers the sun  but opens up to the good light from the sky. And here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process with physical models  with quantitative as well as qualitative methods  to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely holistic with the architecture. They allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way. As you can see here  there's some direct light on the floor  but they could easily figure out where that comes from. And they allow people in that building to really enjoy the sun  the good part of the sun. And enjoying the sun can be in many different ways  of course. It can be just like this  or maybe like this  which is rather peculiar  but this is in         the viewing of a sun eclipse in the United States. And it's just a bit bright up there  so these people have found a very intriguing solution. This is  I think  a very illustrative image of what I try to say    that the beautiful dynamics of sun  bringing these into the building  creates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives. And this is all about darkness as much as it is about lightness  of course  because otherwise you don't see these dynamics. As opposed to the first office that I showed you in the beginning of the talk  this is a well known office  which is the Weidt Group. They are in green energy consulting  or something like that. And they really practice what they preach because this office doesn't have any electric lighting at all. It has only  on one side  this big  big glass window that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range. So it can be very dim over there  and you do your work  and it can be very bright over there  and you do your work. But actually  the human eye turns out to be remarkably adaptable to all these different light conditions that together create an environment that is never boring and that is never dull  and therefore helps us to enhance our lives. I really owe a short introduction of this man to you. This is Richard Kelly who was born     years ago  which is the reason I bring him up now  because it's kind of an anniversary year. In the     s  Richard Kelly was the first person to really describe a methodology of modern lighting design. And he coined three terms  which are  focal glow    ambient luminescence  and  play of the brilliants     three very distinctly different ideas about light in architecture that all together make up this beautiful experience. So to begin with  focal glow. He meant something like this    where the light gives direction to the space and helps you to get around. Or something like this  which is the lighting design he did for General Motors  for the car showroom. And you enter that space  and you feel like   Wow  This is so impressive   just because of this focal point  this huge light source in the middle. To me  it is something from theater  and I will get back to that a little bit later. It's the spotlight on the artist that helps you to focus. It could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds and lights up a patch of the land  highlighting it compared to the dim environment. Or it can be in today's retail  in the shopping environment    lighting the merchandise and creating accents that help you to get around. Ambient luminescence is something very different. Richard Kelly saw it as something infinite  something without any focus  something where all details actually dissolve in infinity. And I see it as a very comfortable kind of light that really helps us to relax and to contemplate. It could also be something like this  the National Museum of Science in London  where this blue is embracing all the exhibitions and galleries in one large gesture. And then finally  Kelly's play of brilliants added to that really some play  I think  of the skyline of Hong Kong  or perhaps the chandelier in the opera house  or in the theater here  which is the decoration  the icing on the cake  something playful  something that is just an addition to the architectural environment  I would say. These three distinct elements  together  make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better. And we can only create these out of darkness. And I will explain that further. And I guess that is something that Richard Kelly  here on the left  was explaining to Ludwig Mies van Der Rohe. And behind them  you see that Seagram Building that later turned into an icon of modern lighting design. Those times  there were some early attempts also for light therapy already. You can see here a photo from the United States Library of Medicine  where people are put in the sun to get better. It's a little bit of a different story  this health aspect of light  than what I'm telling you today. In today's modern medicine  there is a real understanding of light in an almost biochemical way. And there is the idea that  when we look at things  it is the yellow light that helps us the most  that we are the most sensitive for. But our circadian rhythms  which are the rhythms that help us to wake and sleep and be alert and relaxed and so forth and so on  they are much more triggered by blue light. And by modulating the amount of blue in our environment  we can help people to relax  or to be alert  to fall asleep  or to stay awake. And that is how  maybe in the near future  light can help hospitals to make people better sooner  recover them quicker. Maybe in the airplane  we can overcome jet lag like that. Perhaps in school  we can help children to learn better because they concentrate more on their work. And you can imagine a lot more applications. But I would like to talk further about the combination of light and darkness as a quality in our life. So light is  of course  for social interaction also    to create relationships with all the features around us. It is the place where we gather around when we have to say something to each other. And it is all about this planet. But when you look at this planet at night  it looks like this. And I think this is the most shocking image in my talk today. Because all this light here goes up to the sky. It never reaches the ground where it was meant for. It never is to the benefit of people. It only spoils the darkness. So at a global scale  it looks like this. And  I mean  that is quite amazing  what you see here    how much light goes up into the sky and never reaches the ground. Because if we look at the Earth the way it should be  it would be something like this very inspiring image where darkness is for our imagination and for contemplation and to help us to relate to everything. The world is changing though  and urbanization is a big driver of everything. I took this photo two weeks ago in Guangzhou  and I realized that    years ago  there was nothing like this  of these buildings. It was just a much smaller city  and the pace of urbanization is incredible and enormous. And we have to understand these main questions  How do people move through these new urban spaces  How do they share their culture  How do we tackle things like mobility  And how can light help there  Because the new technologies  they seem to be in a really interesting position to contribute to the solutions of urbanization and to provide us with better environments. It's not that long ago that our lighting was just done with these kinds of lamps. And of course  we had the metal halide lamps and fluorescent lamps and things like that. Now we have LED  but here you see the latest one  and you see how incredibly small it is. And this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity  because this tiny  tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it. And we can actually leave it out where it's not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness. So that is a really interesting proposition  I think  and a new way of lighting the architectural environment with our well being in mind. The problem is  though  that I wanted to explain to you how this really works    but I can have four of these on my finger  so you would not be able to really see them. So I asked our laboratory to do something about it  and they said   Well  we can do something.  They created for me the biggest LED in the world especially for TEDx in Amsterdam. So here it is. It's the same thing as you can see over there    just     times bigger. And I will very quickly show you how it works. So just to explain. Now  every LED that is made these days gives blue light. Now  this is not very pleasant and comfortable. And for that reason  we cover the LED with a phosphor cap. And the phosphor is excited by the blue and makes the light white and warm and pleasant. And then when you add the lens to that  you can bundle the light and send it wherever you need it without any need to spill any light to the sky or anywhere else. So you can preserve the darkness and make the light. I just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works. Thank you. We can go further. So we have to rethink the way we light our cities. We have to think again about light as a default solution. Why are all these motorways permanently lit  Is it really needed  Can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness  Can we be much more gentle with light  Like here    this is a very low light level actually. Can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create  so they really want to connect with it  like here  Or can we create simply sculptures that are very inspiring to be in and to be around  And can we preserve the darkness  Because to find a place like this today on Earth is really very  very challenging. And to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult. Even in the oceans  we are creating a lot of light that we could actually ban also for animal life to have a much greater well being. And it's known that migrating birds  for example  get very disoriented because of these offshore platforms. And we discovered that when we make those lights green  the birds  they actually go the right way. They are not disturbed anymore. And it turns out once again that spectral sensitivity is very important here. In all of these examples  I think  we should start making the light out of darkness  and use the darkness as a canvas    like the visual artists do  like Edward Hopper in this painting. I think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting. I think  when I see it  I start to think  who are those people  Where have they come from  Where are they going  What just happened  What will be happening in the next five minutes  And it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light. Edward Hopper was a real master in creating the narration by working with light and dark. And we can learn from that and create more interesting and inspiring architectural environments. We can do that in commercial spaces like this. And you can still also go outside and enjoy the greatest show in the universe  which is  of course  the universe itself. So I give you this wonderful  informative image of the sky  ranging from the inner city  where you may see one or two stars and nothing else  all the way to the rural environments  where you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance of the constellations and the stars. In architecture  it works just the same. By appreciating the darkness when you design the light  you create much more interesting environments that truly enhance our lives. This is the most well known example  Tadao Ando's Church of the Light. But I also think of Peter Zumthor's spa in Vals  where light and dark  in very gentle combinations  alter each other to define the space. Or Richard MacCormac's Southwark tube station in London  where you can really see the sky  even though you are under the ground. And finally  I want to point out that a lot of this inspiration comes from theater. And I think it's fantastic that we are today experiencing TEDx in a theater for the first time because I think we really owe to the theater a big thanks. It wouldn't be such an inspiring scenography without this theater. And I think the theater is a place where we truly enhance life with light. Thank you very much. If I should have a daughter  instead of  Mom   she's going to call me  Point B   because that way she knows that no matter what happens  at least she can always find her way to me. And I'm going to paint solar systems on the backs of her hands so she has to learn the entire universe before she can say   Oh  I know that like the back of my hand.  And she's going to learn that this life will hit you hard in the face  wait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach. But getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air. There is hurt  here  that cannot be fixed by Band Aids or poetry. So the first time she realizes that Wonder Woman isn't coming  I'll make sure she knows she doesn't have to wear the cape all by herself  because no matter how wide you stretch your fingers  your hands will always be too small to catch all the pain you want to heal. Believe me  I've tried.  And  baby   I'll tell her  don't keep your nose up in the air like that. I know that trick  I've done it a million times. You're just smelling for smoke so you can follow the trail back to a burning house  so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire to see if you can save him. Or else find the boy who lit the fire in the first place  to see if you can change him. But I know she will anyway  so instead I'll always keep an extra supply of chocolate and rain boots nearby  because there is no heartbreak that chocolate can't fix. Okay  there's a few that chocolate can't fix. But that's what the rain boots are for  because rain will wash away everything  if you let it. I want her to look at the world through the underside of a glass bottom boat  to look through a microscope at the galaxies that exist on the pinpoint of a human mind  because that's the way my mom taught me. That there'll be days like this. When you open your hands to catch and wind up with only blisters and bruises  when you step out of the phone booth and try to fly and the very people you want to save are the ones standing on your cape  when your boots will fill with rain  and you'll be up to your knees in disappointment. And those are the very days you have all the more reason to say thank you. Because there's nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline  no matter how many times it's sent away. You will put the wind in win some  lose some. You will put the star in starting over  and over. And no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute  be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life. And yes  on a scale from one to over trusting  I am pretty damn naive. But I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar. It can crumble so easily  but don't be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it.  Baby   I'll tell her   remember  your momma is a worrier  and your poppa is a warrior  and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes who never stops asking for more.  Remember that good things come in threes and so do bad things. Always apologize when you've done something wrong  but don't you ever apologize for the way your eyes refuse to stop shining. Your voice is small  but don't ever stop singing. And when they finally hand you heartache  when they slip war and hatred under your door and offer you handouts on street corners of cynicism and defeat  you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. All right  so I want you to take a moment  and I want you to think of three things that you know to be true. They can be about whatever you want    technology  entertainment  design  your family  what you had for breakfast. The only rule is don't think too hard. Okay  ready  Go. Okay. So here are three things I know to be true. I know that Jean Luc Godard was right when he said that   A good story has a beginning  a middle and an end  although not necessarily in that order.  I know that I'm incredibly nervous and excited to be up here  which is greatly inhibiting my ability to keep it cool. And I know that I have been waiting all week to tell this joke. Why was the scarecrow invited to TED  Because he was out standing in his field. I'm sorry. Okay  so these are three things I know to be true. But there are plenty of things I have trouble understanding. So I write poems to figure things out. Sometimes the only way I know how to work through something is by writing a poem. Sometimes I get to the end of the poem  look back and go   Oh  that's what this is all about   and sometimes I get to the end of the poem and haven't solved anything  but at least I have a new poem out of it. Spoken word poetry is the art of performance poetry. I tell people it involves creating poetry that doesn't just want to sit on paper  that something about it demands it be heard out loud or witnessed in person. When I was a freshman in high school  I was a live wire of nervous hormones. And I was underdeveloped and over excitable. And despite my fear of ever being looked at for too long  I was fascinated by the idea of spoken word poetry. I felt that my two secret loves  poetry and theater  had come together  had a baby  a baby I needed to get to know. So I decided to give it a try. My first spoken word poem  packed with all the wisdom of a    year old  was about the injustice of being seen as unfeminine. The poem was very indignant  and mainly exaggerated  but the only spoken word poetry that I had seen up until that point was mainly indignant  so I thought that's what was expected of me. The first time that I performed  the audience of teenagers hooted and hollered their sympathy  and when I came off the stage  I was shaking. I felt this tap on my shoulder  and I turned around to see this giant girl in a hoodie sweatshirt emerge from the crowd. She was maybe eight feet tall and looked like she could beat me up with one hand  but instead she just nodded at me and said   Hey  I really felt that. Thanks.  And lightning struck. I was hooked. I discovered this bar on Manhattan's Lower East Side that hosted a weekly poetry open Mic  and my bewildered  but supportive  parents took me to soak in every ounce of spoken word that I could. I was the youngest by at least a decade  but somehow the poets at the Bowery Poetry Club didn't seem bothered by the    year old wandering about. In fact  they welcomed me. And it was here  listening to these poets share their stories  that I learned that spoken word poetry didn't have to be indignant  it could be fun or painful or serious or silly. The Bowery Poetry Club became my classroom and my home  and the poets who performed encouraged me to share my stories as well. Never mind the fact that I was   . They told me   Write about being   .  So I did and stood amazed every week when these brilliant  grown up poets laughed with me and groaned their sympathy and clapped and told me   Hey  I really felt that too.  Now I can divide my spoken word journey into three steps. Step one was the moment I said   I can. I can do this.  And that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie. Step two was the moment I said   I will. I will continue. I love spoken word. I will keep coming back week after week.  And step three began when I realized I didn't have to write indignant poems  if that's not what I was. There were things that were specific to me  and the more that I focused on those things  the weirder my poetry got  but the more that it felt like mine. It's not just the adage  Write what you know.  It's about gathering up all of the knowledge and experience you've collected up to now to help you dive into the things you don't know. I use poetry to help me work through what I don't understand  but I show up to each new poem with a backpack full of everywhere else that I've been. When I got to university  I met a fellow poet who shared my belief in the magic of spoken word poetry. And actually  Phil Kaye and I coincidentally also share the same last name. When I was in high school I had created Project V.O.I.C.E. as a way to encourage my friends to do spoken word with me. But Phil and I decided to reinvent Project V.O.I.C.E.  this time changing the mission to using spoken word poetry as a way to entertain  educate and inspire. We stayed full time students  but in between we traveled  performing and teaching nine year olds to MFA candidates  from California to Indiana to India to a public high school just up the street from campus. And we saw over and over the way that spoken word poetry cracks open locks. But it turns out sometimes  poetry can be really scary. Turns out sometimes  you have to trick teenagers into writing poetry. So I came up with lists. Everyone can write lists. And the first list that I assign is     Things I Know to be True.  And here's what happens  you would discover it too if we all started sharing our lists out loud. At a certain point  you would realize that someone has the exact same thing  or one thing very similar  to something on your list. And then someone else has something the complete opposite of yours. Third  someone has something you've never even heard of before. Fourth  someone has something you thought you knew everything about  but they're introducing a new angle of looking at it. And I tell people that this is where great stories start from    these four intersections of what you're passionate about and what others might be invested in. And most people respond really well to this exercise. But one of my students  a freshman named Charlotte  was not convinced. Charlotte was very good at writing lists  but she refused to write any poems.  Miss   she'd say   I'm just not interesting. I don't have anything interesting to say.  So I assigned her list after list  and one day I assigned the list     Things I Should Have Learned by Now.  Number three on Charlotte's list was   I should have learned not to crush on guys three times my age.  I asked her what that meant  and she said   Miss  it's kind of a long story.  And I said   Charlotte  it sounds pretty interesting to me.  And so she wrote her first poem  a love poem unlike any I had ever heard before. And the poem began   Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man.   Did you see him on    Minutes  racing Michael Phelps in a pool    nothing but swim trunks on    diving in the water  determined to beat this swimming champion  After the race  he tossed his wet  cloud white hair and said  'You're a god.' No  Anderson  you're the god.  Now  I know that the number one rule to being cool is to seem unfazed  to never admit that anything scares you or impresses you or excites you. Somebody once told me it's like walking through life like this. You protect yourself from all the unexpected miseries or hurt that might show up. But I try to walk through life like this. And yes  that means catching all of those miseries and hurt  but it also means that when beautiful  amazing things just fall out of the sky  I'm ready to catch them. I use spoken word to help my students rediscover wonder  to fight their instincts to be cool and unfazed and  instead  actively pursue being engaged with what goes on around them  so that they can reinterpret and create something from it. It's not that I think that spoken word poetry is the ideal art form. I'm always trying to find the best way to tell each story. I write musicals  I make short films alongside my poems. But I teach spoken word poetry because it's accessible. Not everyone can read music or owns a camera  but everyone can communicate in some way  and everyone has stories that the rest of us can learn from. Plus  spoken word poetry allows for immediate connection. It's not uncommon to feel like you're alone or that nobody understands you  but spoken word teaches that if you have the ability to express yourself and the courage to present those stories and opinions  you could be rewarded with a room full of your peers  or your community  who will listen. And maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie who will connect with what you've shared. And that is an amazing realization to have  especially when you're   . Plus  now with YouTube  that connection's not even limited to the room we're in. I'm so lucky that there's this archive of performances that I can share with my students. It allows for even more opportunities for them to find a poet or a poem that they connect to. Once you've figured this out  it is tempting to keep writing the same poem  or keep telling the same story  over and over  once you've figured out that it will gain you applause. It's not enough to just teach that you can express yourself. You have to grow and explore and take risks and challenge yourself. And that is step three  infusing the work you're doing with the specific things that make you you  even while those things are always changing. Because step three never ends. But you don't get to start on step three  until you take step one first   I can.  I travel a lot while I'm teaching  and I don't always get to watch all of my students reach their step three  but I was very lucky with Charlotte  that I got to watch her journey unfold the way it did. I watched her realize that  by putting the things that she knows to be true into the work she's doing  she can create poems that only Charlotte can write  about eyeballs and elevators and Dora the Explorer. And I'm trying to tell stories only I can tell    like this story. I spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to tell this story  and I wondered if the best way was going to be a PowerPoint  a short film    And where exactly was the beginning  the middle or the end  I wondered whether I'd get to the end of this talk and finally have figured it all out  or not. And I always thought that my beginning was at the Bowery Poetry Club  but it's possible that it was much earlier. In preparing for TED  I discovered this diary page in an old journal. I think December   th was probably supposed to be   th. It's clear that when I was a child  I definitely walked through life like this. I think that we all did. I would like to help others rediscover that wonder    to want to engage with it  to want to learn  to want to share what they've learned  what they've figured out to be true and what they're still figuring out. So I'd like to close with this poem. When they bombed Hiroshima  the explosion formed a mini supernova  so every living animal  human or plant that received direct contact with the rays from that sun was instantly turned to ash. And what was left of the city soon followed. The long lasting damage of nuclear radiation caused an entire city and its population to turn into powder. When I was born  my mom says I looked around the whole hospital room with a stare that said   This  I've done this before.  She says I have old eyes. When my Grandpa Genji died  I was only five years old  but I took my mom by the hand and told her   Don't worry  he'll come back as a baby.  And yet  for someone who's apparently done this already  I still haven't figured anything out yet. My knees still buckle every time I get on a stage. My self confidence can be measured out in teaspoons mixed into my poetry  and it still always tastes funny in my mouth. But in Hiroshima  some people were wiped clean away  leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page. So no matter that I have inhibitions to fill all my pockets  I keep trying  hoping that one day I'll write a poem I can be proud to let sit in a museum exhibit as the only proof I existed. My parents named me Sarah  which is a biblical name. In the original story  God told Sarah she could do something impossible  and    she laughed  because the first Sarah  she didn't know what to do with impossible. And me  Well  neither do I  but I see the impossible every day. Impossible is trying to connect in this world  trying to hold onto others while things are blowing up around you  knowing that while you're speaking  they aren't just waiting for their turn to talk    they hear you. They feel exactly what you feel at the same time that you feel it. It's what I strive for every time I open my mouth    that impossible connection. There's this piece of wall in Hiroshima that was completely burnt black by the radiation. But on the front step  a person who was sitting there blocked the rays from hitting the stone. The only thing left now is a permanent shadow of positive light. After the A bomb  specialists said it would take    years for the radiation damaged soil of Hiroshima City to ever grow anything again. But that spring  there were new buds popping up from the earth. When I meet you  in that moment  I'm no longer a part of your future. I start quickly becoming part of your past. But in that instant  I get to share your present. And you  you get to share mine. And that is the greatest present of all. So if you tell me I can do the impossible    I'll probably laugh at you. I don't know if I can change the world yet  because I don't know that much about it    and I don't know that much about reincarnation either  but if you make me laugh hard enough  sometimes I forget what century I'm in. This isn't my first time here. This isn't my last time here. These aren't the last words I'll share. But just in case  I'm trying my hardest to get it right this time around. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I was only four years old when I saw my mother load a washing machine for the very first time in her life. That was a great day for my mother. My mother and father had been saving money for years to be able to buy that machine  and the first day it was going to be used  even Grandma was invited to see the machine. And Grandma was even more excited. Throughout her life she had been heating water with firewood  and she had hand washed laundry for seven children. And now she was going to watch electricity do that work. My mother carefully opened the door  and she loaded the laundry into the machine  like this. And then  when she closed the door  Grandma said   No  no  no  no. Let me  let me push the button.  And Grandma pushed the button  and she said   Oh  fantastic  I want to see this  Give me a chair  Give me a chair  I want to see it   and she sat down in front of the machine  and she watched the entire washing program. She was mesmerized. To my grandmother  the washing machine was a miracle. Today  in Sweden and other rich countries  people are using so many different machines. Look  the homes are full of machines. I can't even name them all. And they also  when they want to travel  they use flying machines that can take them to remote destinations. And yet  in the world  there are so many people who still heat the water on fire  and they cook their food on fire. Sometimes they don't even have enough food  and they live below the poverty line. There are two billion fellow human beings who live on less than two dollars a day. And the richest people over there    there's one billion people    and they live above what I call the  air line   because they spend more than     a day on their consumption. But this is just one  two  three billion people  and obviously there are seven billion people in the world  so there must be one  two  three  four billion people more who live in between the poverty and the air line. They have electricity  but the question is  how many have washing machines  I've done the scrutiny of market data  and I've found that  indeed  the washing machine has penetrated below the air line  and today there's an additional one billion people out there who live above the  wash line.  And they consume more than     per day. So two billion have access to washing machines. And the remaining five billion  how do they wash  Or  to be more precise  how do most of the women in the world wash  Because it remains hard work for women to wash. They wash like this  by hand. It's a hard  time consuming labor  which they have to do for hours every week. And sometimes they also have to bring water from far away to do the laundry at home  or they have to bring the laundry away to a stream far off. And they want the washing machine. They don't want to spend such a large part of their life doing this hard work with so relatively low productivity. And there's nothing different in their wish than it was for my grandma. Look here  two generations ago in Sweden    picking water from the stream  heating with firewood and washing like that. They want the washing machine in exactly the same way. But when I lecture to environmentally concerned students  they tell me   No  everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines.  How can we tell this woman that she ain't going to have a washing machine  And then I ask my students  I've asked them    over the last two years I've asked   How many of you doesn't use a car   And some of them proudly raise their hand and say   I don't use a car.  And then I put the really tough question   How many of you hand wash your jeans and your bed sheets   And no one raised their hand. Even the hardcore in the green movement use washing machines. So how come  this is  something that everyone uses and they think others will not stop it  What is special with this  I had to do an analysis about the energy used in the world. Here we are. Look here  you see the seven billion people up there  the air people  the wash people  the bulb people and the fire people. One unit like this is an energy unit of fossil fuel    oil  coal or gas. That's what most of electricity and the energy in the world is. And it's    units used in the entire world  and the richest one billion  they use six of them. Half of the energy is used by one seventh of the world's population. And these ones who have washing machines  but not a house full of other machines  they use two. This group uses three  one each. And they also have electricity. And over there they don't even use one each. That makes    of them. But the main concern for the environmentally interested students    and they are right    is about the future. What are the trends  If we just prolong the trends  without any real advanced analysis  to       there are two things that can increase the energy use. First  population growth. Second  economic growth. Population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here because they have high child mortality and they have many children per woman. And  with  that you will get two extra  but that won't change the energy use very much. What will happen is economic growth. The best of here in the emerging economies    I call them the New East    they will jump the air line.  Wopp   they will say. And they will start to use as much as the Old West are doing already. And these people  they want the washing machine. I told you. They'll go there. And they will double their energy use. And we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light. And they'll get a two child family without a stop in population growth. But the total energy consumption will increase to    units. And these    units    still the richest people use most of it. So what needs to be done  Because the risk  the high probability of climate change is real. It's real. Of course they must be more energy efficient. They must change behavior in some way. They must also start to produce green energy  much more green energy. But until they have the same energy consumption per person  they shouldn't give advice to others    what to do and what not to do. Here we can get more green energy all over. This is what we hope may happen. It's a real challenge in the future. But I can assure you that this woman in the favela in Rio  she wants a washing machine. She's very happy about her minister of energy that provided electricity to everyone    so happy that she even voted for her. And she became Dilma Rousseff  the president elect of one of the biggest democracies in the world    moving from minister of energy to president. If you have democracy  people will vote for washing machines. They love them. And what's the magic with them  My mother explained the magic with this machine the very  very first day. She said   Now Hans  we have loaded the laundry. The machine will make the work. And now we can go to the library.  Because this is the magic  you load the laundry  and what do you get out of the machine  You get books out of the machines  children's books. And mother got time to read for me. She loved this. I got the  ABC's     this is where I started my career as a professor  when my mother had time to read for me. And she also got books for herself. She managed to study English and learn that as a foreign language. And she read so many novels  so many different novels here. And we really  we really loved this machine. And what we said  my mother and me   Thank you industrialization. Thank you steel mill. Thank you power station. And thank you chemical processing industry that gave us time to read books.  Thank you very much. I just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival. It's a place where women run the show  have sex to say hello  and play rules the day    where fun is serious business. And no  this isn't Burning Man or San Francisco. Ladies and gentlemen  meet your cousins. This is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of Congo. Bonobos are  together with chimpanzees  your living closest relative. That means we all share a common ancestor  an evolutionary grandmother  who lived around six million years ago. Now  chimpanzees are well known for their aggression. But unfortunately  we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution. But bonobos show us the other side of the coin. While chimpanzees are dominated by big  scary guys  bonobo society is run by empowered females. These guys have really worked something out  since this leads to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet. But unfortunately  bonobos are the least understood of the great apes. They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle  and it has been very difficult to study them. The Congo is a paradox    a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty  but also the heart of darkness itself    the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the First World War. Not surprisingly  this destruction also endangers bonobo survival. Bushmeat trades and forest loss means we couldn't fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world    and we're not even sure of that to be honest. Yet  in this land of violence and chaos  you can hear hidden laughter swaying the trees. Who are these cousins  We know them as the  make love  not war  apes since they have frequent  promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues. Now  I'm not saying this is the solution to all of humanity's problems    since there's more to bonobo life than the Kama Sutra. Bonobos  like humans  love to play throughout their entire lives. Play is not just child's games. For us and them  play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance. It's where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game. Play increases creativity and resilience  and it's all about the generation of diversity    diversity of interactions  diversity of behaviors  diversity of connections. And when you watch bonobo play  you're seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter  dance and ritual. Play is the glue that binds us together. Now  I don't know how you play  but I want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild. First  it's a ball game bonobo style    and I do not mean football. So here  we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game. Have a look what she's doing. It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase   she's got him by the balls.  Only I think that he's rather loving it here  right  Yeah. So sex play is common in both bonobos and humans. And this video is really interesting because it shows    this video's really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play    such as testicles    and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust    while at the same time being tremendous fun. But play's a shapeshifter. Play's a shapeshifter  and it can take many forms  some of which are more quiet  imaginative  curious    maybe where wonder is discovered anew. And I want you to see  this is Fuku  a young female  and she is quietly playing with water. I think  like her  we sometimes play alone  and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds. And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore  drives us to interact  and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity. So these are just small tasters into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present. But they also hold a secret for our future  a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation. The secret is that play is the key to these capacities. In other words  play is our adaptive wildcard. In order to adapt successfully to a changing world  we need to play. But will we make the most of our playfulness  Play is not frivolous. Play's essential. For bonobos and humans alike  life is not just red in tooth and claw. In times when it seems least appropriate to play  it might be the times when it is most urgent. And so  my fellow primates  let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together  as we rediscover creativity  fellowship and wonder. Thank you. Today I want to talk about design  but not design as we usually think about it. I want to talk about what is happening now in our scientific  biotechnological culture  where  for really the first time in history  we have the power to design bodies  to design animal bodies  to design human bodies. In the history of our planet  there have been three great waves of evolution. The first wave of evolution is what we think of as Darwinian evolution. So  as you all know  species lived in particular ecological niches and particular environments  and the pressures of those environments selected which changes  through random mutation in species  were going to be preserved. Then human beings stepped out of the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history and created the second great wave of evolution  which was we changed the environment in which we evolved. We altered our ecological niche by creating civilization. And that has been the second great    couple         years          years    flow of our evolution. By changing our environment  we put new pressures on our bodies to evolve. Whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities  all the way through modern medicine  we have changed our own evolution. Now we're entering a third great wave of evolutionary history  which has been called many things   intentional evolution    evolution by design     very different than intelligent design    whereby we are actually now intentionally designing and altering the physiological forms that inhabit our planet. So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species  as well as our cultures  because of this change. Now we actually have been doing it for a long time. We started selectively breeding animals many  many thousands of years ago. And if you think of dogs for example  dogs are now intentionally designed creatures. There isn't a dog on this earth that's a natural creature. Dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like. But we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them. We don't have to do it that way anymore. This is a beefalo. A beefalo is a buffalo cattle hybrid. And they are now making them  and someday  perhaps pretty soon  you will have beefalo patties in your local supermarket. This is a geep  a goat sheep hybrid. The scientists that made this cute little creature ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards. I think they said it tasted like chicken. This is a cama. A cama is a camel llama hybrid  created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama. And they are now using these in certain cultures. Then there's the liger. This is the largest cat in the world    the lion tiger hybrid. It's bigger than a tiger. And in the case of the liger  there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild. But these were created by scientists using both selective breeding and genetic technology. And then finally  everybody's favorite  the zorse. None of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures. And so one of the things we've been doing is using genetic enhancement  or genetic manipulation  of normal selective breeding pushed a little bit through genetics. And if that were all this was about  then it would be an interesting thing. But something much  much more powerful is happening now. These are normal mammalian cells genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene taken out of deep sea jellyfish. We all know that some deep sea creatures glow. Well  they've now taken that gene  that bioluminescent gene  and put it into mammal cells. These are normal cells. And what you see here is these cells glowing in the dark under certain wavelengths of light. Once they could do that with cells  they could do it with organisms. So they did it with mouse pups  kittens. And by the way  the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green is because that's a bioluminescent gene from coral  while this is from jellyfish. They did it with pigs. They did it with puppies. And  in fact  they did it with monkeys. And if you can do it with monkeys    though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes    if they can do it in monkeys  they can probably figure out how to do it in apes  which means they can do it in human beings. In other words  it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark. Be easier to find us at night. And in fact  right now in many states  you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets. These are zebra fish. They're normally black and silver. These are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered to be yellow  green  red  and they are actually available now in certain states. Other states have banned them. Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures. There is no area of the government    not the EPA or the FDA    that controls genetically engineered pets. And so some states have decided to allow them  some states have decided to ban them. Some of you may have read about the FDA's consideration right now of genetically engineered salmon. The salmon on top is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon  using a gene from these salmon and from one other fish that we eat  to make it grow much faster using a lot less feed. And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision on whether  pretty soon  you could be eating this fish    it'll be sold in the stores. And before you get too worried about it  here in the United States  the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically modified components to it. So even as we worry about it  we have allowed it to go on in this country    much different in Europe    without any regulation  and even without any identification on the package. These are all the first cloned animals of their type. So in the lower right here  you have Dolly  the first cloned sheep    now happily stuffed in a museum in Edinburgh  Ralph the rat  the first cloned rat  CC the cat  for cloned cat  Snuppy  the first cloned dog    Snuppy for Seoul National University puppy    created in South Korea by the very same man that some of you may remember had to end up resigning in disgrace because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo  which he had not. He actually was the first person to clone a dog  which is a very difficult thing to do  because dog genomes are very plastic. This is Prometea  the first cloned horse. It's a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy  a real  gold ring  of cloning  because there are many horses that win important races who are geldings. In other words  the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed. But if you can clone that horse  you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud. These were the first cloned calves  the first cloned grey wolves  and then  finally  the first cloned piglets  Alexis  Chista  Carrel  Janie and Dotcom. In addition  we've started to use cloning technology to try to save endangered species. This is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create. So with antithrombin in that goat    that goat has been genetically modified so that the molecules of its milk actually include the molecule of antithrombin that GTC Genetics wants to create. And then in addition  transgenic pigs  knockout pigs  from the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea  are pigs that they are going to use  in fact  to try to create all kinds of drugs and other industrial types of chemicals that they want the blood and the milk of these animals to produce for them  instead of producing them in an industrial way. These are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species. The guar is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate. A somatic cell  a body cell  was taken from its body  gestated in the ovum of a cow  and then that cow gave birth to a guar. Same thing happened with the mouflon  where it's an endangered species of sheep. It was gestated in a regular sheep body  which actually raises an interesting biological problem. We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies. We have our nucleic DNA that everybody thinks of as our DNA  but we also have DNA in our mitochondria  which are the energy packets of the cell. That DNA is passed down through our mothers. So really  what you end up having here is not a guar and not a mouflon  but a guar with cow mitochondria  and therefore cow mitochondrial DNA  and a mouflon with another species of sheep's mitochondrial DNA. These are really hybrids  not pure animals. And it raises the question of how we're going to define animal species in the age of biotechnology    a question that we're not really sure yet how to solve. This lovely creature is an Asian cockroach. And what they've done here is they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top  and it's on a big computer tracking ball. And now  using a joystick  they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right  forwards or backwards. They've created a kind of insect bot  or bugbot. It gets worse than that    or perhaps better than that. This actually is one of DARPA's very important    DARPA is the Defense Research Agency    one of their projects. These goliath beetles are wired in their wings. They have a computer chip strapped to their backs  and they can fly these creatures around the lab. They can make them go left  right. They can make them take off. They can't actually make them land. They put them about one inch above the ground  and then they shut everything off and they go pfft. But it's the closest they can get to a landing. And in fact  this technology has gotten so developed that this creature    this is a moth    this is the moth in its pupa stage  and that's when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology  so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth  it is already prewired. The wires are already in its body  and they can just hook it up to their technology  and now they've got these bugbots that they can send out for surveillance. They can put little cameras on them and perhaps someday deliver other kinds of ordinance to warzones. It's not just insects. This is the ratbot  or the robo rat by Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate. Again  it's got technology    it's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres  it's got a camera on top of its head. The scientists can make this creature go left  right. They have it running through mazes  controlling where it's going. They've now created an organic robot. The graduate students in Sanjiv Talwar's lab said   Is this ethical  We've taken away the autonomy of this animal.  I'll get back to that in a minute. There's also been work done with monkeys. This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke. He took owl monkeys  wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they moved  especially looking at the movement of their right arm. The computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways. They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm  which you see here in the picture  put the arm in another room. Pretty soon  the computer learned  by reading the monkey's brainwaves  to make that arm in the other room do whatever the monkey's arm did. Then he put a video monitor in the monkey's cage that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm  and the monkey got fascinated. The monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm  this prosthetic arm would do. And eventually she was moving it and moving it  and eventually stopped moving her right arm and  staring at the screen  could move the prosthetic arm in the other room only with her brainwaves    which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have three independent functional arms. And it's not just technology that we're putting into animals. This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida. He took        and then        disaggregated rat neurons    so these are just individual neurons from rats    put them on a chip. They self aggregated into a network  became an integrated chip. And he used that as the IT piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator. So now we have organic computer chips made out of living  self aggregating neurons. Finally  Mussa Ivaldi of Northwestern took a completely intact  independent lamprey eel brain. This is a brain from a lamprey eel. It is living    fully intact brain in a nutrient medium with these electrodes going off to the sides  attached photosensitive sensors to the brain  put it into a cart    here's the cart  the brain is sitting there in the middle    and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart  when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart  the cart moves toward the light  when you turn it off  it moves away. It's photophilic. So now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain. Is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts  sitting there in its nutrient medium  I don't know  but in fact it is a fully living brain that we have managed to keep alive to do our bidding. So  we are now at the stage where we are creating creatures for our own purposes. This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti of the University of Massachusetts. He altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin  put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being. Genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with xenotransplantation. This is where we are in this process. Finally  not that long ago  Craig Venter created the first artificial cell  where he took a cell  took a DNA synthesizer  which is a machine  created an artificial genome  put it in a different cell    the genome was not of the cell he put it in    and that cell then reproduced as the other cell. In other words  that was the first creature in the history of the world that had a computer as its parent    it did not have an organic parent. And so  asks The Economist   The first artificial organism and its consequences.  So you may have thought that the creation of life was going to happen in something that looked like that. But in fact  that's not what Frankenstein's lab looks like. This is what Frankenstein's lab looks like. This is a DNA synthesizer  and here at the bottom are just bottles of A  T  C and G    the four chemicals that make up our DNA chain. And so  we need to ask ourselves some questions. For the first time in the history of this planet  we are able to directly design organisms. We can manipulate the plasmas of life with unprecedented power  and it confers on us a responsibility. Is everything okay  Is it okay to manipulate and create whatever creatures we want  Do we have free reign to design animals  Do we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us and say   Look  I want a dog. I'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund  the body of a retriever  maybe some pink fur  and let's make it glow in the dark   Does industry get to create creatures who  in their milk  in their blood  and in their saliva and other bodily fluids  create the drugs and industrial molecules we want and then warehouse them as organic manufacturing machines  Do we get to create organic robots  where we remove the autonomy from these animals and turn them just into our playthings  And then the final step of this  once we perfect these technologies in animals and we start using them in human beings  what are the ethical guidelines that we will use then  It's already happening. It's not science fiction. We are not only already using these things in animals  some of them we're already beginning to use on our own bodies. We are now taking control of our own evolution. We are directly designing the future of the species of this planet. It confers upon us an enormous responsibility that is not just the responsibility of the scientists and the ethicists who are thinking about it and writing about it now. It is the responsibility of everybody because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies we will have in the future. Thanks. I want you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities  or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again. We at Berkeley Bionics call these robots exoskeletons. These are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning  and it will give you extra strength  and it will further enhance your speed  and it will help you  for instance  to manage your balance. It is actually the true integration of the man and the machine. But not only that    it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there. This is just not some blue sky thinking. To show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the American soldier  that on average does carry about     lbs. on their backs  and they are being asked to carry more equipment. Obviously  this is resulting in some major complications    back injuries     percent of them    chronic back injuries. So we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this issue. So let me now introduce to you HULC    or the Human Universal Load Carrier. Soldier  With the HULC exoskeleton  I can carry     lbs. over varied terrain for many hours. Its flexible design allows for deep squats  crawls and high agility movements. It senses what I want to do  where I want to go  and then augments my strength and endurance. Eythor Bender  We are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device  this new exoskeleton this year. So this is for real. Now let's turn our heads towards the wheelchair users  something that I'm particularly passionate about. There are    million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide. This is about one percent of the total population. And that's actually a conservative estimate. We are talking here about  oftentimes  very young individuals with spinal cord injuries  that in the prime of their life      s    s    s    hit a wall and the wheelchair's the only option. But it is also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers. And the only option  pretty much    when it's stroke or other complications    is the wheelchair. And that is actually for the last     years  since its very successful introduction  I must say. So we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility. Let me now introduce you to eLEGS that is worn by Amanda Boxtel that    years ago was spinal cord injured  and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for    years until now. Amanda Boxtel  Thank you. EB  Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set. It has sensors. It's completely non invasive  sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back. There are battery packs here as well that power motors that are sitting at her hips  as well as her knee joints  that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural gait. AB  I was    years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me. In a split second  I lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis. Not long afterwards  a doctor strode into my hospital room  and he said   Amanda  you'll never walk again.  And that was    yeas ago. He robbed every ounce of hope from my being. Adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again  to rock climb and even handcycle. But nothing has been invented that enables me to walk  until now. Thank you. EB  As you can see  we have the technology  we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you. It's in our hands  and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations    not only for the soldiers  or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users  but for everyone. AB  Thanks. Pep Rosenfeld  Folks  you've just met Claron McFadden. She is a world class soprano singer who studied in Rochester  New York. Her celebrated operatic roles are numerous and varied. In August       Claron was awarded the Amsterdam Prize for the Arts  winning praise for her brilliance  her amazing and extensively wide repertoire and her vivid stage personality. Please welcome Claron McFadden. Claron McFadden  The human voice  mysterious  spontaneous  primal. For me  the human voice is the vessel on which all emotions travel    except  perhaps  jealousy. And the breath  the breath is the captain of that vessel. A child is born  takes its first breath    Whah  And we behold the wondrous beauty of vocal expression    mysterious  spontaneous and primal. A few years ago  I did a meditation retreat in Thailand. I wanted a place where I would have total silence and total solitude. I spent two weeks at this retreat in my own little hut    no music  no nothing    sounds of nature  trying to find the essence of concentration  being in the moment. On my last day  the woman who looked after the place  she came and we spoke for a minute  and then she said to me   Would you sing something for me   And I thought  but this is a place of total quiet and silence. I can't make noise. She said   Please  sing for me.  So I closed my eyes  I took breath and the first thing that came up and out was  Summertime   Porgy and Bess. Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high. Oh  your daddy's rich and your ma is good lookin'. So hush little baby  don't you cry. And I opened my eyes  and I saw that she had her eyes closed. And after a moment  she opened her eyes and she looked at me and she said   It's like meditation.  And in that moment I understood that everything I had gone to Thailand to look for  to search for  I had it already in my singing    the calm  but alertness  the focus  but awareness  and being totally in the moment. When you're totally in the moment    when I'm totally in the moment  the vessel of expression is open. The emotions can flow from me to you and back. It's an extremely profound experience. There's a piece by a composer  an American composer called John Cage. It's called  Aria.  It was written for an amazing singer called Cathy Berberian. And the thing about this piece that's so special    if you see it behind me    it's not notated in any way. No notes  no flats  no sharps. But it's a kind of structure. And the singer  within this structure  has total freedom to be creative  spontaneous. For example  there are different colors and each color gets a different type of singing    pop  country and western  opera  jazz    and you just have to be consistent with that color. You see there are different lines. You choose in your own tempo in your own way to follow the line  but you must respect it  more or less. And these little dots  these represent a sort of sound that's not a vocal  not a lyrical way of expressing the voice. Using the body    it could be sneezing  it could be coughing  animals    Exactly.  Laughter  Clapping  whatever. And there's different text. There's Armenian  Russian  French  English  Italian. So within this structure  one is free. To me  this piece is an ode to the voice  because it's mysterious  as we can see. It's quite spontaneous. And it's primal. So I would like to share this piece with you  It's  Aria   of John Cage. Hampart zoum Dirouhi Di questa Terra Naprasno Conscience et Tsk  tsk  tsk.

You think I've lost my way  and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat. I get that all the time in Dubai.  Here on holiday are you  dear    Come to visit the children  How long are you staying   Well actually  I hope for a while longer yet. I have been living and teaching in the Gulf for over    years. And in that time  I have seen a lot of changes. Now that statistic is quite shocking. And I want to talk to you today about language loss and the globalization of English. I want to tell you about my friend who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi. And one fine day  she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary. But it was she who ended up learning all the Arabic words for the local plants  as well as their uses    medicinal uses  cosmetics  cooking  herbal. How did those students get all that knowledge  Of course  from their grandparents and even their great grandparents. It's not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations. But sadly  today  languages are dying at an unprecedented rate. A language dies every    days. Now  at the same time  English is the undisputed global language. Could there be a connection  Well I don't know. But I do know that I've seen a lot of changes. When I first came out to the Gulf  I came to Kuwait in the days when it was still a hardship post. Actually  not that long ago. That is a little bit too early. But nevertheless  I was recruited by the British Council  along with about    other teachers. And we were the first non Muslims to teach in the state schools there in Kuwait. We were brought to teach English because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education. And of course  the U.K. benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth. Okay. Now this is the major change that I've seen    how teaching English has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today. No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum  and no longer the sole domain of mother England  it has become a bandwagon for every English speaking nation on earth. And why not  After all  the best education    according to the latest World University Rankings    is to be found in the universities of the U.K. and the U.S. So everybody wants to have an English education  naturally. But if you're not a native speaker  you have to pass a test. Now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone  Perhaps you have a computer scientist who's a genius. Would he need the same language as a lawyer  for example  Well  I don't think so. We English teachers reject them all the time. We put a stop sign  and we stop them in their tracks. They can't pursue their dream any longer  'til they get English. Now let me put it this way  if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer  would I stop him from entering my British University  I don't think so. But indeed  that is exactly what we do. We English teachers are the gatekeepers. And you have to satisfy us first that your English is good enough. Now it can be dangerous to give too much power to a narrow segment of society. Maybe the barrier would be too universal. Okay.  But   I hear you say   what about the research  It's all in English.  So the books are in English  the journals are done in English  but that is a self fulfilling prophecy. It feeds the English requirement. And so it goes on. I ask you  what happened to translation  If you think about the Islamic Golden Age  there was lots of translation then. They translated from Latin and Greek into Arabic  into Persian  and then it was translated on into the Germanic languages of Europe and the Romance languages. And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe. Now don't get me wrong  I am not against teaching English  all you English teachers out there. I love it that we have a global language. We need one today more than ever. But I am against using it as a barrier. Do we really want to end up with     languages and the main one being English  or Chinese  We need more than that. Where do we draw the line  This system equates intelligence with a knowledge of English  which is quite arbitrary. And I want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today's intelligentsia stand did not have to have English  they didn't have to pass an English test. Case in point  Einstein. He  by the way  was considered remedial at school because he was  in fact  dyslexic. But fortunately for the world  he did not have to pass an English test. Because they didn't start until      with TOEFL  the American test of English. Now it's exploded. There are lots and lots of tests of English. And millions and millions of students take these tests every year. Now you might think  you and me   Those fees aren't bad  they're okay   but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people. So immediately  we're rejecting them. It brings to mind a headline I saw recently   Education  The Great Divide.  Now I get it  I understand why people would want to focus on English. They want to give their children the best chance in life. And to do that  they need a Western education. Because  of course  the best jobs go to people out of the Western Universities  that I put on earlier. It's a circular thing. Okay. Let me tell you a story about two scientists  two English scientists. They were doing an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals. But they couldn't get the results they wanted. They really didn't know what to do  until along came a German scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb  whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does German. So bingo  problem solved. If you can't think a thought  you are stuck. But if another language can think that thought  then  by cooperating  we can achieve and learn so much more. My daughter came to England from Kuwait. She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic. It's an Arabic medium school. She had to translate it into English at her grammar school. And she was the best in the class at those subjects. Which tells us that when students come to us from abroad  we may not be giving them enough credit for what they know  and they know it in their own language. When a language dies  we don't know what we lose with that language. This is    I don't know if you saw it on CNN recently    they gave the Heroes Award to a young Kenyan shepherd boy who couldn't study at night in his village  like all the village children  because the kerosene lamp  it had smoke and it damaged his eyes. And anyway  there was never enough kerosene  because what does a dollar a day buy for you  So he invented a cost free solar lamp. And now the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home. When he received his award  he said these lovely words   The children can lead Africa from what it is today  a dark continent  to a light continent.  A simple idea  but it could have such far reaching consequences. People who have no light  whether it's physical or metaphorical  cannot pass our exams  and we can never know what they know. Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark. Let us celebrate diversity. Mind your language. Use it to spread great ideas. Thank you very much. The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm is actually quite simple. We don't want Iran to get the bomb. Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility. The gray boxes that you see  these are real time control systems. Now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and valves  we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge. The gray boxes don't run Windows software  they are a completely different technology. But if we manage to place a good Windows virus on a notebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gray box  then we are in business. And this is the plot behind Stuxnet. So we start with a Windows dropper. The payload goes onto the gray box  damages the centrifuge  and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed    mission accomplished. That's easy  huh  I want to tell you how we found that out. When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago  it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was. The only thing that was known is it's very  very complex on the Windows part  the dropper part  used multiple zero day vulnerabilities. And it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes  these real time control systems. So that got our attention  and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with Stuxnet and checked this thing out. And then some very funny things happened. Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat that didn't like our cheese    sniffed  but didn't want to eat. Didn't make sense to me. And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese  I realized  well  this is a directed attack. It's completely directed. The dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found  and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect is actually running on that target. And if not  Stuxnet does nothing. So that really got my attention  and we started to work on this nearly around the clock  because I thought   Well  we don't know what the target is. It could be  let's say for example  a U.S. power plant  or a chemical plant in Germany. So we better find out what the target is soon.  So we extracted and decompiled the attack code  and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs    a smaller one and a bigger one. And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered by people who obviously had all insider information. They knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack. They probably even know the shoe size of the operator. So they know everything. And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet is complex and high tech  let me tell you this  the payload is rocket science. It's way above everything that we have ever seen before. Here you see a sample of this actual attack code. We are talking about    around about        lines of code. Looks pretty much like old style assembly language. And I want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code. So what we were looking for is  first of all  system function calls  because we know what they do. And then we were looking for timers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world    to potential real world targets. So we do need target theories that we can prove or disprove. In order to get target theories  we remember that it's definitely hardcore sabotage  it must be a high value target and it is most likely located in Iran  because that's where most of the infections had been reported. Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area. It basically boils down to the Bushehr nuclear power plant and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant. So I told my assistant   Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base.  And I phoned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data. And that worked pretty well. So we were able to associate the small digital warhead with the rotor control. The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge  that black object that you see. And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor  you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode. What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creepy    obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy  that they would not be able to figure this out quickly. The big digital warhead    we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures. So for example  the number     really stands out in that code  you can't overlook it. I started to research scientific literature on how these centrifuges are actually built in Natanz and found they are structured in what is called a cascade  and each cascade holds     centrifuges. So that made sense  that was a match. And it even got better. These centrifuges in Iran are subdivided into     what is called  stages. And guess what we found in the attack code  An almost identical structure. So again  that was a real good match. And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at. Now don't get me wrong here  it didn't go like this. These results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor. And we often went into just a dead end and had to recover. Anyway  so we figured out that both digital warheads were actually aiming at one and the same target  but from different angles. The small warhead is taking one cascade  and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down  and the big warhead is talking to six cascades and manipulating valves. So in all  we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is. It is Natanz  and it is only Natanz. So we don't have to worry that other targets might be hit by Stuxnet. Here's some very cool stuff that we saw    really knocked my socks off. Down there is the gray box  and on the top you see the centrifuges. Now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors    so for example  from pressure sensors and vibration sensors    and it provides legitimate program code  which is still running during the attack  with fake input data. And as a matter of fact  this fake input data is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet. So it's just like from the Hollywood movies where during the heist  the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video. That's cool  huh  The idea here is obviously not only to fool the operators in the control room. It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive. The idea is to circumvent a digital safety system. We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough. So for example  in a power plant  when your big steam turbine gets too over speed  you must open relief valves within a millisecond. Obviously  this cannot be done by a human operator. So this is where we need digital safety systems. And when they are compromised  then real bad things can happen. Your plant can blow up. And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it. That's scary. But it gets worse. And this is very important  what I'm going to say. Think about this  this attack is generic. It doesn't have anything to do  in specifics  with centrifuges  with uranium enrichment. So it would work as well  for example  in a power plant or in an automobile factory. It is generic. And you don't have    as an attacker    you don't have to deliver this payload by a USB stick  as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet. You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading. Just spread it as wide as possible. And if you do that  what you end up with is a cyber weapon of mass destruction. That's the consequence that we have to face. So unfortunately  the biggest number of targets for such attacks are not in the Middle East. They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan. So all of the green areas  these are your target rich environments. We have to face the consequences  and we better start to prepare right now. Thanks. Chris Anderson  I've got a question. Ralph  it's been quite widely reported that people assume that Mossad is the main entity behind this. Is that your opinion  Ralph Langner  Okay  you really want to hear that  Yeah. Okay. My opinion is that the Mossad is involved  but that the leading force is not Israel. So the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower. There is only one  and that's the United States    fortunately  fortunately. Because otherwise  our problems would even be bigger. CA  Thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us. Thank you  Ralph. Adrian Kohler  Well  we're here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse. Basil Jones  But actually we're going to start this evolution with a hyena. AK  The ancestor of the horse. Okay  we'll do something with it. Hahahaha. The hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called  Faustus in Africa   a Handspring Production from       where it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy. This production was directed by South African artist and theater director  William Kentridge. So it needed a very articulate front paw. But  like all puppets  it has other attributes. BJ  One of them is breath  and it kind of breathes. AK  Haa haa haaa. BJ  Breath is really important for us. It's the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage. It's the thing that distinguishes the puppet    AK  Oops. BJ  From an actor. Puppets always have to try to be alive. It's their kind of ur story onstage  that desperation to live. AK  Yeah  it's basically a dead object  as you can see  and it only lives because you make it. An actor struggles to die onstage  but a puppet has to struggle to live. And in a way that's a metaphor for life. BJ  So every moment it's on the stage  it's making the struggle. So we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up to the minute   th century technology    to turn nouns into verbs. AK  Well actually I prefer to say that it's an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life. BJ  Okay so. AK  It has ears that move passively when the head goes. BJ  And it has these bulkheads made out of plywood  covered with fabric    curiously similar  in fact  to the plywood canoes that Adrian's father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop. AK  In Port Elizabeth  the village outside Port Elizabeth in South Africa. BJ  His mother was a puppeteer. And when we met at art school and fell in love in       I hated puppets. I really thought they were so beneath me. I wanted to become an avant garde artist    and Punch and Judy was certainly not where I wanted to go. And  in fact  it took about    years to discover the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa  where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry  to learn a renewed  or a new  respect for this art form. AK  So in       I persuaded Basil and some friends of mine to form a puppet company. And    years later  miraculously  we collaborated with a company from Mali  the Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako  where we made a piece about a tall giraffe. It was just called  Tall Horse   which was a life sized giraffe. BJ  And here again  you see the same structure. The bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane  but it's ultimately the same structure. It's got two people inside it on stilts  which give them the height  and somebody in the front who's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head. AK  The person in the hind legs is also controlling the tail  a bit like the hyena    same mechanism  just a bit bigger. And he's controlling the ear movement. BJ  So this production was seen by Tom Morris of the National Theatre in London. And just around that time  his mother had said   Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo called 'War Horse'   AK  It's about a boy who falls in love with a horse. The horse is sold to the First World War  and he joins up to find his horse. BJ  So Tom gave us a call and said   Do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the National Theatre   AK  It seemed a lovely idea. BJ  But it had to ride. It had to have a rider. AK  It had to have a rider  and it had to participate in cavalry charges. A play about early   th century plowing technology and cavalry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the National Theatre in London. But they agreed to go along with it for a while. So we began with a test. BJ  This is Adrian and Thys Stander  who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse  and our next door neighbor Katherine  riding on a ladder. The weight is really difficult when it's up above your head. AK  And once we put Katherine through that particular brand of hell  we knew that we might be able to make a horse  which could be ridden. So we made a model. This is a cardboard model  a little bit smaller than the hyena. You'll notice that the legs are plywood legs and the canoe structure is still there. BJ  And the two manipulators are inside. But we didn't realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipulator  because we couldn't manipulate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time. AK  We started work on the prototype after the model was approved  and the prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated. We had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones. And we had a crate built for it. It had to be shipped to London. We were going to test drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town  and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet. BJ  So we got a camera  and we posed the puppet in various galloping stances. And we sent it off to the National Theatre  hoping that they believed that we created something that worked. AK  A month later  we were there in London with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us. BJ  About    people. AK  We were terrified. We opened the lid  we took the horse out  and it did work  it walked and it was able to be ridden. Here I have an    second clip of the very first walk of the prototype. This is in the National Theatre studio  the place where they cook new ideas. It had by no means got the green light yet. The choreographer  Toby Sedgwick  invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse  which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs  grew up into the big horse. And Nick Starr  the director of the National Theatre  saw that particular moment  he was standing next to me    he nearly wet himself. And so the show was given the green light. And we went back to Cape Town and redesigned the horse completely. Here is the plan. And here is our factory in Cape Town where we make horses. You can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there. The horses are completely handmade. There is very little   th century technology in them. We used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood and some of the aluminum pieces. But because they have to be light and flexible  and each one of them is different  they can't be mass produced  unfortunately. So here are some half finished horses ready to be worked in London. And now we would like to introduce you to Joey. Joey boy  you there  Joey. Joey. Joey  come here. No  no  I haven't got it. He's got it  it's in his pocket. BJ  Joey. AK  Joey  Joey  Joey  Joey. Come here. Stand here where people can see you. Move around. Come on. I'd just like to describe    I won't talk too loud. He might get irritated. Here  Craig is working the head. He has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand. Each one of them operates either an ear  separately  or the head  up and down. But he also controls the head directly by using his hand. The ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse. When they point right back  the horse is fearful or angry  depending upon what's going on in front of him  around him. Or  when he's more relaxed  the head comes down and the ears listen  either side. Horses' hearing is very important. It's almost more important than their eyesight. Over here  Tommy's got what you call the heart position. He's working the leg. You see the string tendon from the hyena  the hyena's front leg  automatically pulls the hoop up. Horses are so unpredictable. The way a hoof comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it's a convincing horse action. The hind legs have got the same action. BJ  And Mikey also has  in his fingers  the ability to move the tail from left to right  and up and down with the other hand. And together  there's quite a complex possibility of tail expression. AK  You want to say something about the breathing  BJ  We had a big challenge with breathing. Adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two and make it breathe like that    because that's how a horse would breathe  with an expanded chest. But we realized that  if that were to be happening  you wouldn't  as an audience  see the breath. So he made a channel in here  and the chest moves up and down in that channel. So it's anti naturalistic really  the up and down movement  but it feels like breath. And it's very  very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees. AK  Other emotional stuff. If I were to touch the horse here on his skin  the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside and get the skin to quiver. You'll notice  of course  that the puppet is made out of cane lines. And I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice  that I was making a three dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space. But of course  it was the cane is light  the cane is flexible  the cane is durable and the cane is moldable. And so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane. The skin itself is made out of a see through nylon mesh  which  if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear  she can light the background and the horse becomes ghostlike. You see the skeletal structure of it. Or if you light it from above  it becomes more solid. Again  that was a practical consideration. The guys inside the horse have to be able to see out. They have to be able to act along with their fellow actors in the production. And it's very much an in the moment activity that they're engaged in. It's three heads making one character. But now we would like you to put Joey through some paces. And plant. Thank you. And now just    All the way from sunny California we have Zem Joaquin who's going to ride the horse for us. So we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly. BJ  Not being able to talk to one another while they're onstage because they're mic'd. The sound that that very large chest makes  of the horse    the whinnying and the nickering and everything    that starts usually with one performer  carries on with a second person and ends with a third. AK  Mikey Brett from Leicestershire. Mikey Brett  Craig  Leo  Zem Joaquin and Basil and me. Thank you. Thank you. As a boy  I loved cars. When I turned     I lost my best friend to a car accident. Like this. And then I decided I'd dedicate my life to saving one million people every year. Now I haven't succeeded  so this is just a progress report  but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self driving cars. I saw the concept first in the DARPA Grand Challenges where the U.S. government issued a prize to build a self driving car that could navigate a desert. And even though a hundred teams were there  these cars went nowhere. So we decided at Stanford to build a different self driving car. We built the hardware and the software. We made it learn from us  and we set it free in the desert. And the unimaginable happened  it became the first car to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge  winning Stanford   million dollars. Yet I still hadn't saved a single life. Since  our work has focused on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves    any street in California. We've driven         miles. Our cars have sensors by which they magically can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving. It's the perfect driving mechanism. We've driven in cities  like in San Francisco here. We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway  . We've encountered joggers  busy highways  toll booths  and this is without a person in the loop  the car just drives itself. In fact  while we drove         miles  people didn't even notice. Mountain roads  day and night  and even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco. Sometimes our cars get so crazy  they even do little stunts. What  Second Man  It's driving itself. Sebastian Thrun  Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life  but I can do something for all the people who died. Do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people  And do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error  and can therefore be prevented by machines  Do you realize that we could change the capacity of highways by a factor of two or three if we didn't rely on human precision on staying in the lane    improve body position and therefore drive a little bit closer together on a little bit narrower lanes  and do away with all traffic jams on highways  Do you realize that you  TED users  spend an average of    minutes per day in traffic  wasting your time on your daily commute  You could regain this time. This is four billion hours wasted in this country alone. And it's  .  billion gallons of gasoline wasted. Now I think there's a vision here  a new technology  and I'm really looking forward to a time when generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars. Thank you.
