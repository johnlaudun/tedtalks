So here it is. You can check  I am short  I'm French  I have a pretty strong French accent  so that's going to be clear in a moment. Maybe a sobering thought and something you all know about. And I suspect many of you gave something to the people of Haiti this year. And there is something else I believe in the back of your mind you also know. That is  every day         children die of entirely preventable causes. That's a Haiti earthquake every eight days. And I suspect many of you probably gave something towards that problem as well  but somehow it doesn't happen with the same intensity. So why is that  Well  here is a thought experiment for you. Imagine you have a few million dollars that you've raised    maybe you're a politician in a developing country and you have a budget to spend. You want to spend it on the poor  How do you go about it  Do you believe the people who tell you that all we need to do is to spend money  That we know how to eradicate poverty  we just need to do more  Or do you believe the people who tell you that aid is not going to help  on the contrary it might hurt  it might exacerbate corruption  dependence  etc.  Or maybe you turn to the past. After all  we have spent billions of dollars on aid. Maybe you look at the past and see. Has it done any good  And  sadly  we don't know. And worst of all  we will never know. And the reason is that    take Africa for example. Africans have already got a lot of aid. These are the blue bars. And the GDP in Africa is not making much progress. Okay  fine. How do you know what would have happened without the aid  Maybe it would have been much worse  or maybe it would have been better. We have no idea. We don't know what the counterfactual is. There's only one Africa. So what do you do  To give the aid  and hope and pray that something comes out of it  Or do you focus on your everyday life and let the earthquake every eight days continue to happen  The thing is  if we don't know whether we are doing any good  we are not any better than the Medieval doctors and their leeches. Sometimes the patient gets better  sometimes the patient dies. Is it the leeches  Is it something else  We don't know. So here are some other questions. They're smaller questions  but they are not that small. Immunization  that's the cheapest way to save a child's life. And the world has spent a lot of money on it  The GAVI and the Gates Foundations are each pledging a lot of money towards it  and developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort. And yet  every year at least    million children do not get the immunization they should get. So this is what you call a  last mile problem.  The technology is there  the infrastructure is there  and yet it doesn't happen. So you have your million. How do you use your million to solve this last mile problem  And here's another question  Malaria. Malaria kills almost         people every year  most of them in Sub Saharan Africa  most of them under five. In fact  that is the leading cause of under five mortality. We already know how to kill malaria  but some people come to you and say   You have your millions. How about bed nets   Bed nets are very cheap. For    dollars  you can manufacture and ship an insecticide treated bed net and you can teach someone to use them. And  not only do they protect the people who sleep under them  but they have these great contagion benefits. If half of a community sleeps under a net  the other half also benefits because the contagion of the disease spread. And yet  only a quarter of kids at risk sleep under a net. Societies should be willing to go out and subsidize the net  give them for free  or  for that matter  pay people to use them because of those contagion benefits.  Not so fast   say other people.  If you give the nets for free  people are not going to value them. They're not going to use them  or at least they're not going to use them as bed nets  maybe as fishing nets.  So  what do you do  Do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage  or do you make people pay in order to make sure that they really value them  How do you know  And a third question  Education. Maybe that's the solution  maybe we should send kids to school. But how do you do that  Do you hire teachers  Do you build more schools  Do you provide school lunch  How do you know  So here is the thing. I cannot answer the big question  whether aid did any good or not. But these three questions  I can answer them. It's not the Middle Ages anymore  it's the   st century. And in the   th century  randomized  controlled trials have revolutionized medicine by allowing us to distinguish between drugs that work and drugs that don't work. And you can do the same randomized  controlled trial for social policy. You can put social innovation to the same rigorous  scientific tests that we use for drugs. And in this way  you can take the guesswork out of policy making by knowing what works  what doesn't work and why. And I'll give you some examples with those three questions. So I start with immunization. Here's Udaipur District  Rajasthan. Beautiful. Well  when I started working there  about one percent of children were fully immunized. That's bad  but there are places like that. Now  it's not because the vaccines are not there    they are there and they are free    and it's not because parents do not care about their kids. The same child that is not immunized against measles  if they do get measles  parents will spend thousands of rupees to help them. So you get these empty village subcenters and crowded hospitals. So what is the problem  Well  part of the problem  surely  is people do not fully understand. After all  in this country as well  all sorts of myths and misconceptions go around immunization. So if that's the case  that's difficult  because persuasion is really difficult. But maybe there is another problem as well. It's going from intention to action. Imagine you are a mother in Udaipur District  Rajasthan. You have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized. And maybe when you get there  what you find is this  The subcenter is closed. Ao you have to come back  and you are so busy and you have so many other things to do  you will always tend to postpone and postpone  and eventually it gets too late. Well  if that's the problem  then that's much easier. Because A  we can make it easy  and B  we can maybe give people a reason to act today  rather than wait till tomorrow. So these are simple ideas  but we didn't know. So let's try them. So what we did is we did a randomized  controlled trial in     villages in Udaipur Districts. So the blue dots are selected randomly. We made it easy    I'll tell you how in a moment. In the red dots  we made it easy and gave people a reason to act now. The white dots are comparisons  nothing changed. So we make it easy by organizing this monthly camp where people can get their kids immunized. And then you make it easy and give a reason to act now by adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization. Now  a kilo of lentils is tiny. It's never going to convince anybody to do something that they don't want to do. On the other hand  if your problem is you tend to postpone  then it might give you a reason to act today rather than later. So what do we find  Well  beforehand  everything is the same. That's the beauty of randomization. Afterwards  the camp    just having the camp    increases immunization from six percent to    percent. That's full immunization. That's not bad  that's a good improvement. Add the lentils and you reach to    percent. So here you've got your answer. Make it easy and give a kilo of lentils  you multiply immunization rate by six. Now  you might say   Well  but it's not sustainable. We cannot keep giving lentils to people.  Well  it turns out it's wrong economics  because it is cheaper to give lentils than not to give them. Since you have to pay for the nurse anyway  the cost per immunization ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don't. How about bed nets  Should you give them for free  or should you ask people to pay for them  So the answer hinges on the answer to three simple questions. One is  If people must pay for a bed net  are they going to purchase them  The second one is  If I give bed nets for free  are people going to use them  And the third one is  Do free bed nets discourage future purchase  The third one is important because if we think people get used to handouts  it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets. Now this is a debate that has generated a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric. It's more ideological than practical  but it turns out it's an easy question. We can know the answer to this question. We can just run an experiment. And many experiments have been run  and they all have the same results  so I'm just going to talk to you about one. And this one that was in Kenya  they went around and distributed to people vouchers  discount vouchers. So people with their voucher could get the bed net in the local pharmacy. And some people get     percent discount  and some people get    percent discounts  and some people get    percent discount  etc. And now we can see what happens. So  how about the purchasing  Well  what you can see is that when people have to pay for their bed nets  the coverage rate really falls down a lot. So even with partial subsidy  three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net  and now you only have    percent of the people with the bed nets  you lose the health immunity  that's not great. Second thing is  how about the use  Well  the good news is  people  if they have the bed nets  will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it. If they get it for free  they use it. If they have to pay for it  they use it. How about the long term  In the long term  people who got the free bed nets  one year later  were offered the option to purchase a bed net at two dollars. And people who got the free one were actually more likely to purchase the second one than people who didn't get a free one. So people do not get used to handouts  they get used to nets. Maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit. So  that's for bed nets. So you will think   That's great. You know how to immunize kids  you know how to give bed nets.  But what politicians need is a range of options. They need to know  Out of all the things I could do  what is the best way to achieve my goals  So suppose your goal is to get kids into school. There are so many things you could do. You could pay for uniforms  you could eliminate fees  you could build latrines  you could give girls sanitary pads  etc.  etc. So what's the best  Well  at some level  we think all of these things should work. So  is that sufficient  If we think they should work intuitively  should we go for them  Well  in business  that's certainly not the way we would go about it. Consider for example transporting goods. Before the canals were invented in Britain before the Industrial Revolution  goods used to go on horse carts. And then canals were built  and with the same horseman and the same horse  you could carry ten times as much cargo. So should they have continued to carry the goods on the horse carts  on the ground  that they would eventually get there  Well  if that had been the case  there would have been no Industrial Revolution. So why shouldn't we do the same with social policy  In technology  we spend so much time experimenting  fine tuning  getting the absolute cheapest way to do something  so why aren't we doing that with social policy  Well  with experiments  what you can do is answer a simple question. Suppose you have     dollars to spend on various interventions. How many extra years of education do you get for your hundred dollars  Now I'm going to show you what we get with various education interventions. So the first ones are if you want the usual suspects  hire teachers  school meals  school uniforms  scholarships. And that's not bad. For your hundred dollars  you get between one and three extra years of education. Things that don't work so well is bribing parents  just because so many kids are already going to school that you end up spending a lot of money. And here are the most surprising results. Tell people the benefits of education  that's very cheap to do. So for every hundred dollars you spend doing that  you get    extra years of education. And  in places where there are worms  intestinal worms  cure the kids of their worms. And for every hundred dollars  you get almost    extra years of education. So this is not your intuition  this is not what people would have gone for  and yet  these are the programs that work. We need that kind of information  we need more of it  and then we need to guide policy. So now  I started from the big problem  and I couldn't answer it. And I cut it into smaller questions  and I have the answer to these smaller questions. And they are good  scientific  robust answers. So let's go back to Haiti for a moment. In Haiti  about         people died    actually  a bit more by the latest estimate. And the response of the world was great  Two billion dollars got pledged just last month  so that's about        dollars per death. That doesn't sound like that much when you think about it. But if we were willing to spend        dollars for every child under five who dies  that would be    billion per year just for that problem. And yet it doesn't happen. So  why is that  Well  I think what part of the problem is that  in Haiti  although the problem is huge  somehow we understand it  it's localized. You give your money to Doctors Without Borders  you give your money to Partners In Health  and they'll send in the doctors  and they'll send in the lumber  and they'll helicopter things out and in. And the problem of poverty is not like that. So  first  it's mostly invisible  second  it's huge  and third  we don't know whether we are doing the right thing. There's no silver bullet. You cannot helicopter people out of poverty. And that's very frustrating. But look what we just did today. I gave you three simple answers to three questions  Give lentils to immunize people  provide free bed nets  deworm children. With immunization or bed nets  you can save a life for     dollars per life saved. With deworming  you can get an extra year of education for three dollars. So we cannot eradicate poverty just yet  but we can get started. And maybe we can get started small with things that we know are effective. Here's an example of how this can be powerful. Deworming. Worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines. They are not beautiful and don't kill anybody. And yet  when the young global leader in Davos showed the numbers I gave you  they started Deworm the World. And thanks to Deworm the World  and the effort of many country governments and foundations     million school aged children got dewormed in     . So this evidence is powerful. It can prompt action. So we should get started now. It's not going to be easy. It's a very slow process. You have to keep experimenting  and sometimes ideology has to be trumped by practicality. And sometimes what works somewhere doesn't work elsewhere. So it's a slow process  but there is no other way. These economics I'm proposing  it's like   th century medicine. It's a slow  deliberative process of discovery. There is no miracle cure  but modern medicine is saving millions of lives every year  and we can do the same thing. And now  maybe  we can go back to the bigger question that I started with at the beginning. I cannot tell you whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference  but can we come back here in    years and say   What we have done  it really prompted a change for the better.  I believe we can and I hope we will. Thank you. How do you explain when things don't go as we assume  Or better  how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions  For example  Why is Apple so innovative  Year after year  after year  they're more innovative than all their competition. And yet  they're just a computer company. They're just like everyone else. They have the same access to the same talent  the same agencies  the same consultants  the same media. Then why is it that they seem to have something different  Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement  He wasn't the only man who suffered in pre civil rights America  and he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day. Why him  And why is it that the Wright brothers were able to figure out controlled  powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified  better funded    and they didn't achieve powered man flight  and the Wright brothers beat them to it. There's something else at play here. About three and a half years ago  I made a discovery. And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked  and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it. As it turns out  there's a pattern. As it turns out  all the great inspiring leaders and organizations in the world  whether it's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers  they all think  act and communicate the exact same way. And it's the complete opposite to everyone else. All I did was codify it  and it's probably the world's simplest idea. I call it the golden circle. Why  How  What  This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't. Let me define the terms really quickly. Every single person  every single organization on the planet knows what they do      percent. Some know how they do it  whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your USP. But very  very few people or organizations know why they do what they do. And by  why  I don't mean  to make a profit.  That's a result. It's always a result. By  why   I mean  What's your purpose  What's your cause  What's your belief  Why does your organization exist  Why do you get out of bed in the morning  And why should anyone care  As a result  the way we think  we act  the way we communicate is from the outside in  it's obvious. We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing. But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations    regardless of their size  regardless of their industry    all think  act and communicate from the inside out. Let me give you an example. I use Apple because they're easy to understand and everybody gets it. If Apple were like everyone else  a marketing message from them might sound like this   We make great computers. They're beautifully designed  simple to use and user friendly. Want to buy one    Meh.  That's how most of us communicate. That's how most marketing and sales are done  that's how we communicate interpersonally. We say what we do  we say how we're different or better and we expect some sort of a behavior  a purchase  a vote  something like that. Here's our new law firm  We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients  we always perform for our clients. Here's our new car  It gets great gas mileage  it has leather seats. Buy our car. But it's uninspiring. Here's how Apple actually communicates.  Everything we do  we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed  simple to use and user friendly. We just happen to make great computers. Want to buy one   Totally different  right  You're ready to buy a computer from me. I just reversed the order of the information. What it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do  people buy why you do it. This explains why every single person in this room is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple. But we're also perfectly comfortable buying an MP  player from Apple  or a phone from Apple  or a DVR from Apple. As I said before  Apple's just a computer company. Nothing distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors. Their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products. In fact  they tried. A few years ago  Gateway came out with flat screen TVs. They're eminently qualified to make flat screen TVs. They've been making flat screen monitors for years. Nobody bought one. Dell came out with MP  players and PDAs  and they make great quality products  and they can make perfectly well designed products    and nobody bought one. In fact  talking about it now  we can't even imagine buying an MP  player from Dell. Why would you buy one from a computer company  But we do it every day. People don't buy what you do  they buy why you do it. The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have. The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe. Here's the best part  None of what I'm telling you is my opinion. It's all grounded in the tenets of biology. Not psychology  biology. If you look at a cross section of the human brain  from the top down  the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle. Our newest brain  our Homo sapien brain  our neocortex  corresponds with the  what  level. The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language. The middle two sections make up our limbic brains  and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings  like trust and loyalty. It's also responsible for all human behavior  all decision making  and it has no capacity for language. In other words  when we communicate from the outside in  yes  people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures. It just doesn't drive behavior. When we can communicate from the inside out  we're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior  and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do. This is where gut decisions come from. Sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures  and they say   I know what all the facts and details say  but it just doesn't feel right.  Why would we use that verb  it doesn't  feel  right  Because the part of the brain that controls decision making doesn't control language. The best we can muster up is   I don't know.  It just doesn't feel right.  Or sometimes you say you're leading with your heart or soul. I hate to break it to you  those aren't other body parts controlling your behavior. It's all happening here in your limbic brain  the part of the brain that controls decision making and not language. But if you don't know why you do what you do  and people respond to why you do what you do  then how will you ever get people to vote for you  or buy something from you  or  more importantly  be loyal and want to be a part of what it is that you do. The goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have  the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe. The goal is not just to hire people who need a job  it's to hire people who believe what you believe. I always say that  you know  if you hire people just because they can do a job  they'll work for your money  but if they believe what you believe  they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears. Nowhere else is there a better example than with the Wright brothers. Most people don't know about Samuel Pierpont Langley. And back in the early   th century  the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day. Everybody was trying it. And Samuel Pierpont Langley had  what we assume  to be the recipe for success. Even now  you ask people   Why did your product or why did your company fail   and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things  under capitalized  the wrong people  bad market conditions. It's always the same three things  so let's explore that. Samuel Pierpont Langley was given        dollars by the War Department to figure out this flying machine. Money was no problem. He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well connected  he knew all the big minds of the day. He hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic. The New York Times followed him around everywhere  and everyone was rooting for Langley. Then how come we've never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley  A few hundred miles away in Dayton Ohio  Orville and Wilbur Wright  they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success. They had no money  they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop  not a single person on the Wright brothers' team had a college education  not even Orville or Wilbur  and The New York Times followed them around nowhere. The difference was  Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause  by a purpose  by a belief. They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine  it'll change the course of the world. Samuel Pierpont Langley was different. He wanted to be rich  and he wanted to be famous. He was in pursuit of the result. He was in pursuit of the riches. And lo and behold  look what happened. The people who believed in the Wright brothers' dream worked with them with blood and sweat and tears. The others just worked for the paycheck. They tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out  they would have to take five sets of parts  because that's how many times they would crash before supper. And  eventually  on December   th        the Wright brothers took flight  and no one was there to even experience it. We found out about it a few days later. And further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing  The day the Wright brothers took flight  he quit. He could have said   That's an amazing discovery  guys  and I will improve upon your technology   but he didn't. He wasn't first  he didn't get rich  he didn't get famous  so he quit. People don't buy what you do  they buy why you do it. If you talk about what you believe  you will attract those who believe what you believe. But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe  Something called the law of diffusion of innovation  if you don't know the law  you know the terminology. The first  .   of our population are our innovators. The next   .   of our population are our early adopters. The next     are your early majority  your late majority and your laggards. The only reason these people buy touch tone phones is because you can't buy rotary phones anymore. We all sit at various places at various times on this scale  but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass market success or mass market acceptance of an idea  you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between    and    percent market penetration  and then the system tips. I love asking businesses   What's your conversion on new business   They love to tell you   It's about    percent   proudly. Well  you can trip over     of the customers. We all have about     who just  get it.  That's how we describe them  right  That's like that gut feeling   Oh  they just get it.  The problem is  How do you find the ones that get it before doing business versus the ones who don't get it  So it's this here  this little gap that you have to close  as Jeffrey Moore calls it   Crossing the Chasm     because  you see  the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first. And these guys  the innovators and the early adopters  they're comfortable making those gut decisions. They're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available. These are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iPhone when they first came out  when you could have bought one off the shelf the next week. These are the people who spent        dollars on flat screen TVs when they first came out  even though the technology was substandard. And  by the way  they didn't do it because the technology was so great  they did it for themselves. It's because they wanted to be first. People don't buy what you do  they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe. In fact  people will do the things that prove what they believe. The reason that person bought the iPhone in the first six hours  stood in line for six hours  was because of what they believed about the world  and how they wanted everybody to see them  They were first. People don't buy what you do  they buy why you do it. So let me give you a famous example  a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation. First  the famous failure. It's a commercial example. As we said before  the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions. You should have success then. Look at TiVo. From the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago to this current day  they are the single highest quality product on the market  hands down  there is no dispute. They were extremely well funded. Market conditions were fantastic. I mean  we use TiVo as verb. I TiVo stuff on my piece of junk Time Warner DVR all the time. But TiVo's a commercial failure. They've never made money. And when they went IPO  their stock was at about    or    dollars and then plummeted  and it's never traded above   . In fact  I don't think it's even traded above six  except for a couple of little spikes. Because you see  when TiVo launched their product  they told us all what they had. They said   We have a product that pauses live TV  skips commercials  rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking.  And the cynical majority said   We don't believe you. We don't need it. We don't like it. You're scaring us.  What if they had said   If you're the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life  boy  do we have a product for you. It pauses live TV  skips commercials  memorizes your viewing habits  etc.  etc.  People don't buy what you do  they buy why you do it  and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe. Now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation. In the summer of               people showed up on the mall in Washington to hear Dr. King speak. They sent out no invitations  and there was no website to check the date. How do you do that  Well  Dr. King wasn't the only man in America who was a great orator. He wasn't the only man in America who suffered in a pre civil rights America. In fact  some of his ideas were bad. But he had a gift. He didn't go around telling people what needed to change in America. He went around and told people what he believed.  I believe  I believe  I believe   he told people. And people who believed what he believed took his cause  and they made it their own  and they told people. And some of those people created structures to get the word out to even more people. And lo and behold          people showed up on the right day at the right time to hear him speak. How many of them showed up for him  Zero. They showed up for themselves. It's what they believed about America that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August. It's what they believed  and it wasn't about black versus white      of the audience was white. Dr. King believed that there are two types of laws in this world  those that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by men. And not until all the laws that are made by men are consistent with the laws made by the higher authority will we live in a just world. It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life. We followed  not for him  but for ourselves. By the way  he gave the  I have a dream  speech  not the  I have a plan  speech. Listen to politicians now  with their comprehensive    point plans. They're not inspiring anybody. Because there are leaders and there are those who lead. Leaders hold a position of power or authority  but those who lead inspire us. Whether they're individuals or organizations  we follow those who lead  not because we have to  but because we want to. We follow those who lead  not for them  but for ourselves. And it's those who start with  why  that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them. Thank you very much. I'm an ecologist  mostly a coral reef ecologist. I started out in Chesapeake Bay and went diving in the winter and became a tropical ecologist overnight. And it was really a lot of fun for about    years. I mean  somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet. And that was what I did. And I ended up in Jamaica  in the West Indies  where the coral reefs were really among the most extraordinary  structurally  that I ever saw in my life. And this picture here  it's really interesting  it shows two things  First of all  it's in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far  and film was so slow in the     s and early   s  you took pictures in black and white. The other thing it shows you is that  although there's this beautiful forest of coral  there are no fish in that picture. Those reefs at Discovery Bay  Jamaica were the most studied coral reefs in the world for    years. We were the best and the brightest. People came to study our reefs from Australia  which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs. And the view of scientists about how coral reefs work  how they ought to be  was based on these reefs without any fish. Then  in       there was a hurricane  Hurricane Allen. I put half the lab up in my house. The wind blew very strong. The waves were    to    feet high. And the reefs disappeared  and new islands formed  and we thought   Well  we're real smart. We know that hurricanes have always happened in the past.  And we published a paper in Science  the first time that anybody ever described the destruction on a coral reef by a major hurricane. And we predicted what would happen  and we got it all wrong. And the reason was because of overfishing  and the fact that a last common grazer  a sea urchin  died. And within a few months after that sea urchin dying  the seaweed started to grow. And that is the same reef  that's the same reef    years ago  that's the same reef today. The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica have a few percent live coral cover and a lot of seaweed and slime. And that's more or less the story of the coral reefs of the Caribbean  and increasingly  tragically  the coral reefs worldwide. Now  that's my little  depressing story. All of us in our   s and   s have comparable depressing stories. There are tens of thousands of those stories out there  and it's really hard to conjure up much of a sense of well being  because it just keeps getting worse. And the reason it keeps getting worse is that after a natural catastrophe  like a hurricane  it used to be that there was some kind of successional sequence of recovery  but what's going on now is that overfishing and pollution and climate change are all interacting in a way that prevents that. And so I'm going to sort of go through and talk about those three kinds of things. We hear a lot about the collapse of cod. It's difficult to imagine that two  or some historians would say three world wars were fought during the colonial era for the control of cod. Cod fed most of the people of Western Europe. It fed the slaves brought to the Antilles  the song  Jamaica Farewell      Ackee rice salt fish are nice     is an emblem of the importance of salt cod from northeastern Canada. It all collapsed in the   s and the   s         people lost their jobs. And that was the beginning of a kind of serial depletion from bigger and tastier species to smaller and not so tasty species  from species that were near to home to species that were all around the world  and what have you. It's a little hard to understand that  because you can go to a Costco in the United States and buy cheap fish. You ought to read the label to find out where it came from  but it's still cheap  and everybody thinks it's okay. It's hard to communicate this  and one way that I think is really interesting is to talk about sport fish  because people like to go out and catch fish. It's one of those things. This picture here shows the trophy fish  the biggest fish caught by people who pay a lot of money to get on a boat  go to a place off of Key West in Florida  drink a lot of beer  throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water  come back with the biggest and the best fish  and the champion trophy fish are put on this board  where people take a picture  and this guy is obviously really excited about that fish. Well  that's what it's like now  but this is what it was like in the     s from the same boat in the same place on the same board on the same dock. The trophy fish were so big that you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it. And the average size trophy fish weighed     to     pounds  goliath grouper  and if you wanted to go out and kill something  you could pretty much count on being able to catch one of those fish. And they tasted really good. And people paid less in      dollars to catch that than what people pay now to catch those little  tiny fish. And that's everywhere. It's not just the fish  though  that are disappearing. Industrial fishing uses big stuff  big machinery. We use nets that are    miles long. We use longlines that have one million or two million hooks. And we trawl  which means to take something the size of a tractor trailer truck that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds  put it on a big chain  and drag it across the sea floor to stir up the bottom and catch the fish. Think of it as being kind of the bulldozing of a city or of a forest  because it clears it away. And the habitat destruction is unbelievable. This is a photograph  a typical photograph  of what the continental shelves of the world look like. You can see the rows in the bottom  the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn. What that was  was a forest of sponges and coral  which is a critical habitat for the development of fish. What it is now is mud  and the area of the ocean floor that has been transformed from forest to level mud  to parking lot  is equivalent to the entire area of all the forests that have ever been cut down on all of the earth in the history of humanity. We've managed to do that in the last     to     years. We tend to think of oil spills and mercury and we hear a lot about plastic these days. And all of that stuff is really disgusting  but what's really insidious is the biological pollution that happens because of the magnitude of the shifts that it causes to entire ecosystems. And I'm going to just talk very briefly about two kinds of biological pollution  one is introduced species and the other is what comes from nutrients. So this is the infamous Caulerpa taxifolia  the so called killer algae. A book was written about it. It's a bit of an embarrassment. It was accidentally released from the aquarium in Monaco  it was bred to be cold tolerant to have in peoples aquaria. It's very pretty  and it has rapidly started to overgrow the once very rich biodiversity of the northwestern Mediterranean. I don't know how many of you remember the movie  The Little Shop of Horrors   but this is the plant of  The Little Shop of Horrors.  But  instead of devouring the people in the shop  what it's doing is overgrowing and smothering virtually all of the bottom dwelling life of the entire northwestern Mediterranean Sea. We don't know anything that eats it  we're trying to do all sorts of genetics and figure out something that could be done  but  as it stands  it's the monster from hell  about which nobody knows what to do. Now another form of pollution that's biological pollution is what happens from excess nutrients. The green revolution  all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer  we use too much of it. It's subsidized  which is one of the reasons we used too much of it. It runs down the rivers  and it feeds the plankton  the little microscopic plant cells in the coastal water. But since we ate all the oysters and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton  there's nothing to eat the plankton and there's more and more of it  so it dies of old age  which is unheard of for plankton. And when it dies  it falls to the bottom and then it rots  which means that bacteria break it down. And in the process they use up all the oxygen  and in using up all the oxygen they make the environment utterly lethal for anything that can't swim away. So  what we end up with is a microbial zoo dominated by bacteria and jellyfish  as you see on the left in front of you. And the only fishery left    and it is a commercial fishery    is the jellyfish fishery you see on the right  where there used to be prawns. Even in Newfoundland where we used to catch cod  we now have a jellyfish fishery. And another version of this sort of thing is what is often called red tides or toxic blooms. That picture on the left is just staggering to me. I have talked about it a million times  but it's unbelievable. In the upper right of that picture on the left is almost the Mississippi Delta  and the lower left of that picture is the Texas Mexico border. You're looking at the entire northwestern Gulf of Mexico  you're looking at one toxic dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish  made by that beautiful little creature on the lower right. And in the upper right you see this black sort of cloud moving ashore. That's the same species. And as it comes to shore and the wind blows  and little droplets of the water get into the air  the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up with people with acute respiratory distress. And that's retirement homes on the west coast of Florida. A friend and I did this thing in Hollywood we called Hollywood ocean night  and I was trying to figure out how to explain to actors what's going on. And I said   So  imagine you're in a movie called 'Escape from Malibu' because all the beautiful people have moved to North Dakota  where it's clean and safe. And the only people who are left there are the people who can't afford to move away from the coast  because the coast  instead of being paradise  is harmful to your health.  And then this is amazing. It was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France. This is from the coast of Brittany  which is being enveloped in this green  algal slime. The reason that it attracted so much attention  besides the fact that it's disgusting  is that sea birds flying over it are asphyxiated by the smell and die  and a farmer died of it  and you can imagine the scandal that happened. And so there's this war between the farmers and the fishermen about it all  and the net result is that the beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff on a regular basis. And then  of course  there's climate change  and we all know about climate change. I guess the iconic figure of it is the melting of the ice in the Arctic Sea. Think about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the Northwest Passage. Well  the Northwest Passage is already there. I think it's sort of funny  it's on the Siberian coast  maybe the Russians will charge tolls. The governments of the world are taking this really seriously. The military of the Arctic nations is taking it really seriously. For all the denial of climate change by government leaders  the CIA and the navies of Norway and the U.S. and Canada  whatever are busily thinking about how they will secure their territory in this inevitability from their point of view. And  of course  Arctic communities are toast. The other kinds of effects of climate change    this is coral bleaching. It's a beautiful picture  right  All that white coral. Except it's supposed to be brown. What happens is that the corals are a symbiosis  and they have these little algal cells that live inside them. And the algae give the corals sugar  and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection. But when it gets too hot  the algae can't make the sugar. The corals say   You cheated. You didn't pay your rent.  They kick them out  and then they die. Not all of them die  some of them survive  some more are surviving  but it's really bad news. To try and give you a sense of this  imagine you go camping in July somewhere in Europe or in North America  and you wake up the next morning  and you look around you  and you see that    percent of the trees  as far as you can see  have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked. And you come home  and you discover that    percent of all the trees in North America and in Europe have dropped their leaves. And then you read in the paper a few weeks later   Oh  by the way  a quarter of those died.  Well  that's what happened in the Indian Ocean during the      El Nino  an area vastly greater than the size of North America and Europe  when    percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died. And then the really scary thing about all of this    the overfishing  the pollution and the climate change    is that each thing doesn't happen in a vacuum. But there are these  what we call  positive feedbacks  the synergies among them that make the whole vastly greater than the sum of the parts. And the great scientific challenge for people like me in thinking about all this  is do we know how to put Humpty Dumpty back together again  I mean  because we  at this point  we can protect it. But what does that mean  We really don't know. So what are the oceans going to be like in    or    years  Well  there won't be any fish except for minnows  and the water will be pretty dirty  and all those kinds of things and full of mercury  etc.  etc. And dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they'll start to merge  and we can imagine something like the dead zonification of the global  coastal ocean. Then you sure won't want to eat fish that were raised in it  because it would be a kind of gastronomic Russian roulette. Sometimes you have a toxic bloom  sometimes you don't. That doesn't sell. The really scary things though are the physical  chemical  oceanographic things that are happening. As the surface of the ocean gets warmer  the water is lighter when it's warmer  it becomes harder and harder to turn the ocean over. We say it becomes more strongly stratified. The consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries  of the sardines of California or in Peru or whatever  those slow down and those fisheries collapse. And  at the same time  water from the surface  which is rich in oxygen  doesn't make it down and the ocean turns into a desert. So the question is  How are we all going to respond to this  And we can do all sorts of things to fix it  but in the final analysis  the thing we really need to fix is ourselves. It's not about the fish  it's not about the pollution  it's not about the climate change. It's about us and our greed and our need for growth and our inability to imagine a world that is different from the selfish world we live in today. So the question is  Will we respond to this or not  I would say that the future of life and the dignity of human beings depends on our doing that. Thank you.  Applause  I bring to you a message from tens of thousands of people    in the villages  in the slums  in the hinterland of the country    who have solved problems through their own genius  without any outside help. When our home minister announces a few weeks ago a war on one third of India  about     districts that he mentioned were ungovernable  he missed the point. The point that we have been stressing for the last    years  the point that people may be economically poor  but they're not poor in the mind. In other words  the minds on the margin are not the marginal minds. That is the message  which we started    years ago. And what did it start  Let me just tell you  briefly  my personal journey  which led me to come to this point. In '    '    I was in Bangladesh advising the government and the research council there how to help scientists work on the lands  on the fields of the poor people  and how to develop research technologies  which are based on the knowledge of the people. I came back in '  . I had been tremendously invigorated by the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country  which had    percent landlessness but amazing creativity. I started looking at my own work  The work that I had done for the previous    years  almost every time  had instances of knowledge that people had shared. Now  I was paid in dollars as a consultant  and I looked at my income tax return and tried to ask myself   Is there a line in my return  which shows how much of this income has gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible  Was it because I'm brilliant that I'm getting this reward  or because of the revolution  Is it that I write very well  Is it that I articulate very well  Is it that I analyze the data very well  Is it because I'm a professor  and  therefore  I must be entitled to this reward from society   I tried to convince myself that   No  no  I have worked for the policy changes. You know  the public policy will become more responsive to the needs of the poor  and  therefore I think it's okay.  But it appeared to me that all these years that I'd been working on exploitation    exploitation by landlords  by moneylenders  by traders    gave me an insight that probably I was also an exploiter  because there was no line in my income tax return which showed this income accrued because of the brilliance of the people    those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me    and nothing ever went back to them. So much so  that much of my work till that time was in the English language. The majority of the people from whom I learned didn't know English. So what kind of a contributor was I  I was talking about social justice  and here I was  a professional who was pursuing the most unjust act    of taking knowledge from the people  making them anonymous  getting rent from that knowledge by sharing it and doing consultancy  writing papers and publishing them in the papers  getting invited to the conferences  getting consultancies and whatever have you. So then  a dilemma rose in the mind that  if I'm also an exploiter  then this is not right  life cannot go on like that. And this was a moment of great pain and trauma because I couldn't live with it any longer. So I did a review of ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research  wrote  read about     papers. And I came to the conclusion that while dilemma is unique  dilemma is not unique  the solution had to be unique. And one day    I don't know what happened    while coming back from the office towards home  maybe I saw a honey bee or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee  life would be wonderful. What the honey bee does  it pollinates  takes nectar from the flower  pollinates another flower  cross pollinates. And when it takes the nectar  the flowers don't feel shortchanged. In fact  they invite the honey bees through their colors  and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves. These are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network  that whenever we learn something from people it must be shared with them in their language. They must not remain anonymous. And I must tell you that after    years  I have not made one percent of change in the professional practice of this art. That is a great tragedy    which I'm carrying still with me and I hope that all of you will carry this with you    that the profession still legitimizes publication of knowledge of people without attributing them by making them anonymous. The research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences or Research Councils of the U.K. or of Indian Councils of Science Research do not require that whatever you learn from people  you must share back with them. We are talking about an accountable society  a society that is fair and just  and we don't even do justice in the knowledge market. And India wants to be a knowledge society. How will it be a knowledge society  So  obviously  you cannot have two principles of justice  one for yourself and one for others. It must be the same. You cannot discriminate. You cannot be in favor of your own values  which are at a distance from the values that you espouse. So  fairness to one and to the other is not divisible. Look at this picture. Can you tell me where has it been taken from  and what is it meant for  Anybody  I'm a professor  I must quiz you.  Laughter  Anybody  Any guess at all  Pardon   Audience Member  Rajasthan.  Anil Gupta  But what has it been used for  What has it been used for  Pardon  You know  you're so right. We must give him a hand  because this man knows how insensitive our government is. Look at this. This is the site of the government of India. It invites tourists to see the shame of our country. I'm so sorry to say that. Is this a beautiful picture or is it a terrible picture  It depends upon how you look at the life of the people. If this woman has to carry water on her head for miles and miles and miles  you cannot be celebrating that. We should be doing something about it. And let me tell you  with all the science and technology at our command  millions of women still carry water on their heads. And we do not ask this question. You must have taken tea in the morning. Think for a minute. The leaves of the tea  plucked from the bushes  you know what the action is  The action is  The lady picks up a few leaves  puts them in the basket on the backside. Just do it    times  you will realize the pain in this shoulder. And she does it a few thousand times every day. The rice that you ate in the lunch  and you will eat today  is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture  millions of them  every season  in the paddy season  when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water. And feet in the water will develop fungus  infections  and that infection pains because then other insects bite that point. And every year    .  percent of the paddy is transplanted manually. No machines have been developed. So the silence of scientists  of technologists  of public policy makers  of the change agent  drew our attention that this is not on  this is not on  this is not the way society will work. This is not what our parliament would do. You know  we have a program for employment  One hundred      million people have to be given jobs for     days by this great country. Doing what  Breaking stones  digging earth. So we asked a question to the parliament  Do poor have heads  Do poor have legs  mouth and hands  but no head  So Honey Bee Network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich. And what has happened  An anonymous  faceless  nameless person gets in contact with the network  and then gets an identity. This is what Honey Bee Network is about. And this network grew voluntarily  continues to be voluntary  and has tried to map the minds of millions of people of our country and other parts of the world who are creative. They could be creative in terms of education  they may be creative in terms of culture  they may be creative in terms of institutions  but a lot of our work is in the field of technological creativity  the innovations  either in terms of contemporary innovations  or in terms of traditional knowledge. And it all begins with curiosity. It all begins with curiosity. This person  whom we met    and you will see it on the website  www.sristi.org    this tribal person  he had a wish. And he said   If my wish gets fulfilled     somebody was sick and he had to monitor     God  please cure him. And if you cure him  I will get my wall painted.  And this is what he got painted. Somebody was talking yesterday about Maslowian hierarchy. There could be nothing more wrong than the Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment. Kabir  Rahim  all the great Sufi saints  they were all poor people  and they had a great reason.  Applause  Please do not ever think that only after meeting your physiological needs and other needs can you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment. Any person anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment  only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something. Look at this. We saw it in Shodh Yatra. Every six months we walk in different parts of the country. I've walked about       kilometers in the last    years. So on the wayside we found these dung cakes  which are used as a fuel. Now  this lady  on the wall of the dung cake heap  has made a painting. That's the only space she could express her creativity. And she's so marvelous. Look at this lady  Ram Timari Devi  on a grain bin. In Champaran  we had a Shodh Yatra and we were walking in the land where Gandhiji went to hear about the tragedy  pain of indigo growers. Bhabi Mahato in Purulia and Bankura. Look at what she has done. The whole wall is her canvas. She's sitting there with a broom. Is she an artisan or an artist  Obviously she's an artist  she's a creative person. If we can create markets for these artists  we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones. They will be paid for what they are good at  not what they're bad at. Look at what Rojadeen has done. In Motihari in Champaran  there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack and  obviously  there's a limited market for tea. Every morning you have tea  as well as coffee. So he thought  why don't I convert a pressure cooker into a coffee machine  So this is a coffee machine. Just takes a few hundred rupees. People bring their own cooker  he attaches a valve and a steam pipe  and now he gives you espresso coffee.  Laughter  Now  this is a real  affordable coffee percolator that works on gas. Look at what Sheikh Jahangir has done. A lot of poor people do not have enough grains to get ground. So this fellow is bringing a flour grinding machine on a two wheeler. If you have     grams        one kilogram  he will grind it for it for you  the flourmill will not grind such a small quantity. Please understand the problem of poor people. They have needs which have to be met efficiently in terms of energy  in terms of cost  in terms of quality. They don't want second standard  second quality outputs. But to be able to give them high quality output you need to adapt technology to their needs. And that is what Sheikh Jahangir did. But that's not enough  what he did. Look at what he did here. If you have clothes  and you don't have enough time to wash them  he brought a washing machine to your doorstep  mounted on a two wheeler. So here's a model where a two wheeler washing machine ... He is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep. You bring your water  you bring your soap  I wash the clothes for you. Charge    paisa  one rupee for you per lot  and a new business model can emerge. Now  what we need is  we need people who will be able to scale them up. Look at this. It looks like a beautiful photograph. But you know what it is  Can anybody guess what it is  Somebody from India would know  of course. It's a tawa. It's a hot plate made of clay. Now  what is the beauty in it  When you have a non stick pan  it costs about  maybe      rupees  five dollars  six dollars. This is less than a dollar and this is non stick  it is coated with one of these food grade materials. And the best part is that  while you use a costly non stick pan  you eat the so called Teflon or Teflon like material because after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone  It has gone in your stomach. It was not meant for that.  Laughter  You know  But here in this clay hot plate  it will never go into your stomach. So it is better  it is safer  it is affordable  it is energy efficient. In other words  solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper  need not be  so called  jugaad  need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement. They have to be better  they have to be more efficient  they have to be affordable. And that is what Mansukh Bhai Prajapati has done. He has designed this plate with a handle. And now with one dollar  you can afford a better alternative than the people market is offering you. This lady  she developed a herbal pesticide formulation. We filed the patent for her  the National Innovation Foundation. And who knows  Somebody will license this technology and develop marketable products  and she would get revenue. Now  let me mention one thing  I think we need a polycentric model of development  where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country  in different parts of the world  would solve the needs of locality in a very efficient and adaptive manner. Higher the local fit  greater is the chance of scaling up. In the scaling up  there's an inherent inadequacy to match the needs of the local people  point by point  with the supply that you're making. So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch  Things can scale up  and they have scaled up. For example  cell phones  We have     million cellphones in this country. Now  it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone  only three options on the cellphone. It has     options  I'm paying for      I'm using only three but I'm willing to live with it  therefore it is scaling up. But if I had to get a match to match  obviously  I would need a different design of a cellphone. So what we're saying is that scalability should not become an enemy of sustainability. There must be a place in the world for solutions that are only relevant for a locality  and yet  one can be able to fund them. One of the greatest studies that we've been finding is that many times investors would ask this question     What is a scalable model      as if the need of a community  which is only located in a space and time and has those needs only located in those places  has no legitimate right to get them for free because it's not part of a larger scale. So either you sub optimize your needs to a larger scale or else you remain out. Now  the eminent model  the long tail model tells you that small sales of a large number of books  for example  having only a few copies sold can still be a viable model. And we must find a mechanism where people will pool in the portfolio  will invest in the portfolio  where different innovations will go to a small number of people in their localities  and yet  the overall platform of the model will become viable. Look at what he is doing. Saidullah Sahib is an amazing man. At the age of     he is linking up something very creative. Saidullah Sahib  I couldn't wait for the boat. I had to meet my love. My desperation made me an innovator. Even love needs help from technology. Innovation is the light of my wife  Noor. New inventions are the passion of my life. My technology. AG  Saidulluh Sahib is in Motihari  again in Champaran. Wonderful human being  but he stills sells  at this age  honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood  because we haven't been able to convince the water park people  the lake people  in  unclear  operations. And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people in Mumbai    where there was a flood a few years ago and people had to walk    kilometers  wading in the water    that  look  you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office because you can then go to those lanes where your buses will not go  where your transport will not go. So we have not yet cracked the problem of making it available as a rescue device  as a vending device during the floods in eastern India  when you have to deliver things to people in different islands where they're marooned. But the idea has a merit. The idea has a merit. What has Appachan done  Appachan  unfortunately  is no more  but he has left behind a message. A very powerful message Appachan  I watch the world wake up every day. It's not that a coconut fell on my head  and I came upon this idea. With no money to fund my studies  I scaled new heights. Now  they call me the local Spiderman. My technology. AG  Many of you might not realize and believe that we have sold this product internationally    what I call a G G model  grassroots to global. And a professor in the University of Massachusetts  in the zoology department  bought this climber because she wanted to study the insect diversity of the top of the tree canopy. And this device makes it possible for her to take samples from a larger number of palms  rather than only a few  because otherwise she had to make a big platform and then climb her  unclear  would climb on that. So  you know  we are advancing the frontiers of science. Remya Jose has developed ... you can go to the YouTube and find India Innovates and then you will find these videos. Innovation by her when she was in class   th  a washing machine cum exercising machine. Mr. Kharai who is a physically challenged person  one and a half foot height  only. But he has modified a two wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and flexibility. This innovation is from the slums of Rio. And this person  Mr. Ubirajara. We were talking about  my friends in Brazil  how we scale up this model in China and Brazil. And we have a very vibrant network in China  particularly  but also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world. This stand on the front wheel  you will not find on any cycle. India and China have the largest number of cycles. But this innovation emerged in Brazil. The point is  none of us should be parochial  none of us should be so nationalistic to believe that all good ideas will come only from our country. No  we have to have the humility to learn from knowledge of economically poor people  wherever they are. And look at this whole range of cycle based innovations  cycle that's a sprayer  cycle that generates energy from the shocks on the road. I can't change the condition of the road  but I can make the cycle run faster. That is what Kanak Das has done. And in South Africa  we had taken our innovators  and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa as to how innovation can become a means of liberation from the drudgery that people have. And this is a donkey cart which they modified. There's an axle here  of        kg  serving no purpose. Remove it  the cart needs one donkey less. This is in China. This girl needed a breathing apparatus. These three people in the village sat down and decided to think   How do we elongate the life of this girl of our village   They were not related to her  but they tried to find out   How can we use ...   They used a cycle  they put together a breathing apparatus. And this breathing apparatus now saved the life  and she's very welcome. There's a whole range of innovations that we have. A car  which runs on compressed air with six paisa per kilometer. Assam  Kanak Gogoi. And you would not find this car in U.S. or Europe  but this is available in India. Now  this lady  she used to do the winding of the yarn for Pochampally Saree. In one day         times  she had to do this winding to generate two sarees. This is what her son has done after seven years of struggle. She said   Change your profession.  He said   I can't. This is the only thing I know  but I'll invent a machine  which will solve your problem.  And this is what he did  a sewing machine in Uttar Pradesh. So  this is what SRISTI is saying   Give me a place to stand  and I will move the world.  I will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children for creativity  a whole range of things. We have sold things all over the world  from Ethiopia to Turkey to U.S. to wherever. Products have gone to the market  a few. These are the people whose knowledge made this Herbavate cream for eczema possible. And here  a company which licensed this herbal pesticide put a photograph of the innovator on the packing so that every time a user uses it  it asks the user   You can also be an innovator. If you have an idea  send it back to us.  So  creativity counts  knowledge matters  innovations transform  incentives inspire. And incentives  not just material  but also non material incentives. Thank you. For me  this story begins about    years ago  when I was a hospice doctor at the University of Chicago. And I was taking care of people who were dying and their families in the South Side of Chicago. And I was observing what happened to people and their families over the course of their terminal illness. And in my lab  I was studying the widower effect  which is a very old idea in the social sciences  going back     years  known as  dying of a broken heart.  So  when I die  my wife's risk of death can double  for instance  in the first year. And I had gone to take care of one particular patient  a woman who was dying of dementia. And in this case  unlike this couple  she was being cared for by her daughter. And the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother. And the daughter's husband  he also was sick from his wife's exhaustion. And I was driving home one day  and I get a phone call from the husband's friend  calling me because he was depressed about what was happening to his friend. So here I get this call from this random guy that's having an experience that's being influenced by people at some social distance. And so I suddenly realized two very simple things  First  the widowhood effect was not restricted to husbands and wives. And second  it was not restricted to pairs of people. And I started to see the world in a whole new way  like pairs of people connected to each other. And then I realized that these individuals would be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby. And then  in fact  these people were embedded in other sorts of relationships  marriage and spousal and friendship and other sorts of ties. And that  in fact  these connections were vast and that we were all embedded in this broad set of connections with each other. So I started to see the world in a completely new way and I became obsessed with this. I became obsessed with how it might be that we're embedded in these social networks  and how they affect our lives. So  social networks are these intricate things of beauty  and they're so elaborate and so complex and so ubiquitous  in fact  that one has to ask what purpose they serve. Why are we embedded in social networks  I mean  how do they form  How do they operate  And how do they effect us  So my first topic with respect to this  was not death  but obesity. It had become trendy to speak about the  obesity epidemic.  And  along with my collaborator  James Fowler  we began to wonder whether obesity really was epidemic and could it spread from person to person like the four people I discussed earlier. So this is a slide of some of our initial results. It's       people in the year     . Every dot is a person. We make the dot size proportional to people's body size  so bigger dots are bigger people. In addition  if your body size  if your BMI  your body mass index  is above       if you're clinically obese    we also colored the dots yellow. So  if you look at this image  right away you might be able to see that there are clusters of obese and non obese people in the image. But the visual complexity is still very high. It's not obvious exactly what's going on. In addition  some questions are immediately raised  How much clustering is there  Is there more clustering than would be due to chance alone  How big are the clusters  How far do they reach  And  most importantly  what causes the clusters  So we did some mathematics to study the size of these clusters. This here shows  on the Y axis  the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese and  on the X axis  the degrees of separation between the two people. On the far left  you see the purple line. It says that  if your friends are obese  your risk of obesity is    percent higher. And the next bar over  the  red  line  says if your friend's friends are obese  your risk of obesity is    percent higher. And then the next line over says if your friend's friend's friend  someone you probably don't even know  is obese  your risk of obesity is    percent higher. And it's only when you get to your friend's friend's friend's friends that there's no longer a relationship between that person's body size and your own body size. Well  what might be causing this clustering  There are at least three possibilities  One possibility is that  as I gain weight  it causes you to gain weight. A kind of induction  a kind of spread from person to person. Another possibility  very obvious  is homophily  or  birds of a feather flock together  here  I form my tie to you because you and I share a similar body size. And the last possibility is what is known as confounding  because it confounds our ability to figure out what's going on. And here  the idea is not that my weight gain is causing your weight gain  nor that I preferentially form a tie with you because you and I share the same body size  but rather that we share a common exposure to something  like a health club that makes us both lose weight at the same time. When we studied these data  we found evidence for all of these things  including for induction. And we found that if your friend becomes obese  it increases your risk of obesity by about    percent in the same given time period. There can be many mechanisms for this effect  One possibility is that your friends say to you something like    you know  they adopt a behavior that spreads to you    like  they say   Let's go have muffins and beer   which is a terrible combination.  Laughter  But you adopt that combination  and then you start gaining weight like them. Another more subtle possibility is that they start gaining weight  and it changes your ideas of what an acceptable body size is. Here  what's spreading from person to person is not a behavior  but rather a norm  An idea is spreading. Now  headline writers had a field day with our studies. I think the headline in The New York Times was   Are you packing it on  Blame your fat friends.   Laughter  What was interesting to us is that the European headline writers had a different take  They said   Are your friends gaining weight  Perhaps you are to blame.  And we thought this was a very interesting comment on America  and a kind of self serving   not my responsibility  kind of phenomenon. Now  I want to be very clear  We do not think our work should or could justify prejudice against people of one or another body size at all. Our next questions was  Could we actually visualize this spread  Was weight gain in one person actually spreading to weight gain in another person  And this was complicated because we needed to take into account the fact that the network structure  the architecture of the ties  was changing across time. In addition  because obesity is not a unicentric epidemic  there's not a Patient Zero of the obesity epidemic    if we find that guy  there was a spread of obesity out from him    it's a multicentric epidemic. Lots of people are doing things at the same time. And I'm about to show you a    second video animation that took me and James five years of our lives to do. So  again  every dot is a person. Every tie between them is a relationship. We're going to put this into motion now  taking daily cuts through the network for about    years. The dot sizes are going to grow  you're going to see a sea of yellow take over. You're going to see people be born and die    dots will appear and disappear    ties will form and break  marriages and divorces  friendings and defriendings. A lot of complexity  a lot is happening just in this    year period that includes the obesity epidemic. And  by the end  you're going to see clusters of obese and non obese individuals within the network. Now  when looked at this  it changed the way I see things  because this thing  this network that's changing across time  it has a memory  it moves  things flow within it  it has a kind of consistency    people can die  but it doesn't die  it still persists    and it has a kind of resilience that allows it to persist across time. And so  I came to see these kinds of social networks as living things  as living things that we could put under a kind of microscope to study and analyze and understand. And we used a variety of techniques to do this. And we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena. We looked at smoking and drinking behavior  and voting behavior  and divorce    which can spread    and altruism. And  eventually  we became interested in emotions. Now  when we have emotions  we show them. Why do we show our emotions  I mean  there would be an advantage to experiencing our emotions inside  you know  anger or happiness. But we don't just experience them  we show them. And not only do we show them  but others can read them. And  not only can they read them  but they copy them. There's emotional contagion that takes place in human populations. And so this function of emotions suggests that  in addition to any other purpose they serve  they're a kind of primitive form of communication. And that  in fact  if we really want to understand human emotions  we need to think about them in this way. Now  we're accustomed to thinking about emotions in this way  in simple  sort of  brief periods of time. So  for example  I was giving this talk recently in New York City  and I said   You know when you're on the subway and the other person across the subway car smiles at you  and you just instinctively smile back   And they looked at me and said   We don't do that in New York City.   Laughter  And I said   Everywhere else in the world  that's normal human behavior.  And so there's a very instinctive way in which we briefly transmit emotions to each other. And  in fact  emotional contagion can be broader still. Like we could have punctuated expressions of anger  as in riots. The question that we wanted to ask was  Could emotion spread  in a more sustained way than riots  across time and involve large numbers of people  not just this pair of individuals smiling at each other in the subway car  Maybe there's a kind of below the surface  quiet riot that animates us all the time. Maybe there are emotional stampedes that ripple through social networks. Maybe  in fact  emotions have a collective existence  not just an individual existence. And this is one of the first images we made to study this phenomenon. Again  a social network  but now we color the people yellow if they're happy and blue if they're sad and green in between. And if you look at this image  you can right away see clusters of happy and unhappy people  again  spreading to three degrees of separation. And you might form the intuition that the unhappy people occupy a different structural location within the network. There's a middle and an edge to this network  and the unhappy people seem to be located at the edges. So to invoke another metaphor  if you imagine social networks as a kind of vast fabric of humanity    I'm connected to you and you to her  on out endlessly into the distance    this fabric is actually like an old fashioned American quilt  and it has patches on it  happy and unhappy patches. And whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch. So  this work with emotions  which are so fundamental  then got us to thinking about  Maybe the fundamental causes of human social networks are somehow encoded in our genes. Because human social networks  whenever they are mapped  always kind of look like this  the picture of the network. But they never look like this. Why do they not look like this  Why don't we form human social networks that look like a regular lattice  Well  the striking patterns of human social networks  their ubiquity and their apparent purpose beg questions about whether we evolved to have human social networks in the first place  and whether we evolved to form networks with a particular structure. And notice first of all    so  to understand this  though  we need to dissect network structure a little bit first    and notice that every person in this network has exactly the same structural location as every other person. But that's not the case with real networks. So  for example  here is a real network of college students at an elite northeastern university. And now I'm highlighting a few dots. If you look here at the dots  compare node B in the upper left to node D in the far right  B has four friends coming out from him and D has six friends coming out from him. And so  those two individuals have different numbers of friends. That's very obvious  we all know that. But certain other aspects of social network structure are not so obvious. Compare node B in the upper left to node A in the lower left. Now  those people both have four friends  but A's friends all know each other  and B's friends do not. So the friend of a friend of A's is  back again  a friend of A's  whereas the friend of a friend of B's is not a friend of B's  but is farther away in the network. This is known as transitivity in networks. And  finally  compare nodes C and D  C and D both have six friends. If you talk to them  and you said   What is your social life like   they would say   I've got six friends. That's my social experience.  But now we  with a bird's eye view looking at this network  can see that they occupy very different social worlds. And I can cultivate that intuition in you by just asking you  Who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network  Would you rather be C or D  You'd rather be D  on the edge of the network. And now who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip    not about you    was spreading through the network   Laughter  Now  you would rather be C. So different structural locations have different implications for your life. And  in fact  when we did some experiments looking at this  what we found is that    percent of the variation in how many friends you have is explained by your genes. And this is not surprising. We know that some people are born shy and some are born gregarious. That's obvious. But we also found some non obvious things. For instance     percent in the variation in whether your friends know each other is attributable to your genes. Whether your friends know each other has not just to do with their genes  but with yours. And we think the reason for this is that some people like to introduce their friends to each other    you know who you are    and others of you keep them apart and don't introduce your friends to each other. And so some people knit together the networks around them  creating a kind of dense web of ties in which they're comfortably embedded. And finally  we even found that    percent of the variation in whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network can also be attributed to their genes. So whether you find yourself in the middle or on the edge is also partially heritable. Now  what is the point of this  How does this help us understand  How does this help us figure out some of the problems that are affecting us these days  Well  the argument I'd like to make is that networks have value. They are a kind of social capital. New properties emerge because of our embeddedness in social networks  and these properties inhere in the structure of the networks  not just in the individuals within them. So think about these two common objects. They're both made of carbon  and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arranged in one particular way    on the left    and you get graphite  which is soft and dark. But if you take the same carbon atoms and interconnect them a different way  you get diamond  which is clear and hard. And those properties of softness and hardness and darkness and clearness do not reside in the carbon atoms  they reside in the interconnections between the carbon atoms  or at least arise because of the interconnections between the carbon atoms. So  similarly  the pattern of connections among people confers upon the groups of people different properties. It is the ties between people that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts. And so it is not just what's happening to these people    whether they're losing weight or gaining weight  or becoming rich or becoming poor  or becoming happy or not becoming happy    that affects us  it's also the actual architecture of the ties around us. Our experience of the world depends on the actual structure of the networks in which we're residing and on all the kinds of things that ripple and flow through the network. Now  the reason  I think  that this is the case is that human beings assemble themselves and form a kind of superorganism. Now  a superorganism is a collection of individuals which show or evince behaviors or phenomena that are not reducible to the study of individuals and that must be understood by reference to  and by studying  the collective. Like  for example  a hive of bees that's finding a new nesting site  or a flock of birds that's evading a predator  or a flock of birds that's able to pool its wisdom and navigate and find a tiny speck of an island in the middle of the Pacific  or a pack of wolves that's able to bring down larger prey. Superorganisms have properties that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals. I think understanding social networks and how they form and operate can help us understand not just health and emotions but all kinds of other phenomena    like crime  and warfare  and economic phenomena like bank runs and market crashes and the adoption of innovation and the spread of product adoption. Now  look at this. I think we form social networks because the benefits of a connected life outweigh the costs. If I was always violent towards you or gave you misinformation or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs  you would cut the ties to me  and the network would disintegrate. So the spread of good and valuable things is required to sustain and nourish social networks. Similarly  social networks are required for the spread of good and valuable things  like love and kindness and happiness and altruism and ideas. I think  in fact  that if we realized how valuable social networks are  we'd spend a lot more time nourishing them and sustaining them  because I think social networks are fundamentally related to goodness. And what I think the world needs now is more connections. Thank you. We invent. My company invents all kinds of new technology in lots of different areas. And we do that for a couple of reasons. We invent for fun    invention is a lot of fun to do    and we also invent for profit. The two are related because the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn't fun  you wouldn't have the time to do it. So we do this fun and profit oriented inventing for most of what we do  but we also have a program where we invent for humanity    where we take some of our best inventors  and we say   Are there problems where we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has      and to solve it in the way we try to solve problems  which is with dramatic  crazy  out of the box solutions. Bill Gates is one of those smartest guys of ours that work on these problems and he also funds this work  so thank you. So I'm going to briefly discuss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where we've got some solutions underway. Vaccination is one of the key techniques in public health  a fantastic thing. But in the developing world a lot of vaccines spoil before they're administered  and that's because they need to be kept cold. Almost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures. They go bad very quickly if you don't  and if you don't have stable power grid  this doesn't happen  so kids die. It's not just the loss of the vaccine that matters  it's the fact that those kids don't get vaccinated. This is one of the ways that vaccines are carried  These are Styrofoam chests. These are being carried by people  but they're also put on the backs of pickup trucks. We've got a different solution. Now  one of these Styrofoam chests will last for about four hours with ice in it. And we thought  well  that's not really good enough. So we made this thing. This lasts six months with no power  absolutely zero power  because it loses less than a half a watt. Now  this is our second generations prototype. The third generation prototype is  right now  in Uganda being tested. Now  the reason we were able to come up with this is two key ideas  One is that this is similar to a cryogenic Dewar  something you'd keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in. They have incredible insulation  so let's put some incredible insulation here. The other idea is kind of interesting  which is  you can't reach inside anymore. Because if you open it up and reach inside  you'd let the heat in  the game would be over. So the inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine. It vends out little individual vials. So a simple idea  which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed in Africa and around the world. We'll move on to malaria. Malaria is one of the great public health problems. Esther Duflo talked a little bit about this. Two hundred million people a year. Every    seconds a child in Africa dies     will die during my talk. And there's no way for us here in this country to grasp really what that means to the people involved. Another comment of Esther's was that we react when there's a tragedy like Haiti  but that tragedy is ongoing. So what can we do about it  Well  there are a lot of things people have tried for many years for solving malaria. You can spray  the problem is there are environmental issues. You can try to treat people and create awareness. That's great  except the places that have malaria really bad  they don't have health care systems. A vaccine would be a terrific thing  only they don't work yet. People have tried for a long time. There are a couple of interesting candidates. It's a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for. You can distribute bed nets  and bed nets are very effective if you use them. You don't always use them for that. People fish with them. They don't always get to everyone. And bed nets have an effect on the epidemic  but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets. Now  malaria is an incredibly complicated disease. We could spend hours going over this. It's got this sort of soap opera like lifestyle  they have sex  they burrow into your liver  they tunnel into your blood cells ... it's an incredibly complicated disease  but that's actually one of the things we find interesting about it and why we work on malaria  There's a lot of potential ways in. One of those ways might be better diagnosis. So we hope this year to prototype each of these devices. One does an automatic malaria diagnosis in the same way that a diabetic's glucose meter works  You take a drop of blood  you put it in there and it automatically tells you. Today  you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure  create a bunch of microscope slides and have a trained person examine it. The other thing is  you know  it would be even better if you didn't have to draw the blood. And if you look through the eye  or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye  in fact  you may be able to do this directly  without drawing any blood at all  or through your nail beds. Because if you actually look through your fingernails  you can see blood vessels  and once you see blood vessels  we think we can see the malaria. We can see it because of this molecule called hemozoin. It's produced by the malaria parasite and it's a very interesting crystalline substance. Interesting  anyway  if you're a solid state physicist. There's a lot of cool stuff we can do with it. This is our femtosecond laser lab. So this creates pulses of light that last a femtosecond. That's really  really  really short. This is a pulse of light that's only about one wavelength of light long  so it's a whole bunch of photons all coming and hitting simultaneously. It creates a very high peak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things  in particular  it lets you find hemozoin. So here's an image of red blood cells  and now we can actually map where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are inside those red blood cells. And using both this technique and other optical techniques  we think we can make those diagnostics. We also have another hemozoin oriented therapy for malaria  a way  in acute cases  to actually take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system. Sort of like doing dialysis  but for relieving the parasite load. This is our thousand core supercomputer. We're kind of software guys  and so nearly any problem that you pose  we like to try to solve with some software. One of the problems that you have if you're trying to eradicate malaria or reduce it is you don't know what's the most effective thing to do. Okay  we heard about bed nets earlier. You spend a certain amount per bed net. Or you could spray. You can give drug administration. There's all these different interventions but they have different kinds of effectiveness. How can you tell  So we've created  using our supercomputer  the world's best computer model of malaria  which we'll show you now. We picked Madagascar. We have every road  every village  every  almost  square inch of Madagascar. We have all of the precipitation data and the temperature data. That's very important because the humidity and precipitation tell you whether you've got standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed. So that sets the stage on which you do this. You then have to introduce the mosquitoes  and you have to model that and how they come and go. Ultimately  it gives you this. This is malaria spreading across Madagascar. And this is this latter part of the rainy season. We're going to the dry season now. It nearly goes away in the dry season  because there's no place for the mosquitoes to breed. And then  of course  the next year it comes roaring back. By doing these kinds of simulations  we want to eradicate or control malaria thousands of times in software before we actually have to do it in real life  to be able to simulate both the economic trade offs    how many bed nets versus how much spraying     or the social trade offs    what happens if unrest breaks out  We also try to study our foe. This is a high speed camera view of a mosquito. And  in a moment  we're going to see a view of the airflow. Here  we're trying to visualize the airflow around the wings of the mosquito with little particles we're illuminating with a laser. By understanding how mosquitoes fly  we hope to understand how to make them not fly. Now  one of the ways you can make them not fly is with DDT. This is a real ad. This is one of those things you just can't make up. Once upon a time  this was the primary technique  and  in fact  many countries got rid of malaria through DDT. The United States did. In       there were         cases a year of malaria in the United States  but DDT and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it. So we thought   Well  we've done all these things that are focused on the Plasmodium  the parasite involved. What can we do to the mosquito  Well  let's try to kill it with consumer electronics.  Now  that sounds silly  but each of these devices has something interesting in it that maybe you could use. Your Blu ray player has a very cheap blue laser. Your laser printer has a mirror galvanometer that's used to steer a laser beam very accurately  that's what makes those little dots on the page. And  of course  there's signal processing and digital cameras. So what if we could put all that together to shoot them out of the sky with lasers  Now  in our company  this is what we call  the pinky suck moment.  What if we could do that  Now  just suspend disbelief for a moment  and let's think of what could happen if we could do that. Well  we could protect very high value targets like clinics. Clinics are full of people that have malaria. They're sick  and so they're less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes. You really want to protect them. Of course  if you do that  you could also protect your backyard. And farmers could protect their crops that they want to sell to Whole Foods because our photons are     percent organic.  Laughter  They're completely natural. Now  it actually gets better than this. You could  if you're really smart  you could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug before you zap it  and you could listen to the wing beat frequency and you could measure the size. And then you could decide   Is this an insect I want to kill  or an insect I don't want to kill   Moore's law made computing cheap  so cheap we can weigh the life of an individual insect and decide thumbs up or thumbs down.  Laughter  Now  it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes. They're the only ones that are dangerous. Mosquitoes only drink blood to lay eggs. Mosquitoes actually live ... their day to day nutrition comes from nectar  from flowers    in fact  in the lab  we feed ours raisins    but the female needs the blood meal. So  this sounds really crazy  right  Would you like to see it  Audience  Yeah  Nathan Myhrvold  Okay  so our legal department prepared a disclaimer  and here it is. Now  after thinking about this a little bit we thought  you know  it probably would be simpler to do this with a nonlethal laser. So  Eric Johanson  who built the device  actually  with parts from eBay  and Pablos Holman over here  he's got mosquitoes in the tank. We have the device over here. And we're going to show you  instead of the kill laser  which will be a very brief  instantaneous pulse  we're going to have a green laser pointer that's going to stay on the mosquito for  actually  quite a long period of time  otherwise  you can't see it very well. Take it away Eric. Eric Johanson  What we have here is a tank on the other side of the stage. And we have ... this computer screen can actually see the mosquitoes as they fly around. And Pablos  if he stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit we can see them flying around. Now  that's a fairly straightforward image processing routine  and let me show you how it works. Here you can see that the insects are being tracked as they're flying around  which is kind of fun. Next we can actually light them up with a laser.  Laughter  Now  this is a low powered laser  and we can actually pick up a wing beat frequency. So you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around. NM  That's a mosquito wing beat you're hearing. EJ  Finally  let's see what this looks like. There you can see mosquitoes as they fly around  being lit up. This is slowed way down so that you have an opportunity to see what's happening. Here we have it running at high speed mode. So this system that was built for TED is here to illustrate that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this  and we're looking very hard at how to make it highly cost effective to use in places like Africa and other parts of the world. NM  So it wouldn't be any fun to show you that without showing you what actually happens when we hit 'em. This is very satisfying. This is one of the first ones we did. The energy's a little bit high here. We'll loop around here in just a second  and you'll see another one. Here's another one. Bang. An interesting thing is  we kill them all the time  we've never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair. The wing motor is very resilient. I mean  here we're blowing wings off but the wing motor keeps all the way down. So  that's what I have. Thanks very much. I'm going to tell you two things today  One is what we have lost  and two  a way to bring it back. And let me start with this. This is my baseline  This is the Mediterranean coast with no fish  bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae. Something like this is what I first saw when I jumped in the water for the first time in the Mediterranean coast off Spain. Now  if an alien came to earth    let's call him Joe    what would Joe see  If Joe jumped in a coral reef  there are many things the alien could see. Very unlikely  Joe would jump on a pristine coral reef  a virgin coral reef with lots of coral  sharks  crocodiles  manatees  groupers  turtles  etc. So  probably  what Joe would see would be in this part  in the greenish part of the picture. Here we have the extreme with dead corals  microbial soup and jellyfish. And where the diver is  this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now  with very few corals  algae overgrowing the corals  lots of bacteria  and where the large animals are gone. And this is what most marine scientists have seen too. This is their baseline. This is what they think is natural because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems. So I'm going to get us all on a time machine  and we're going to the left  we're going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like. And let's start with this time machine  the Line Islands  where we have conducted a series of National Geographic expeditions. This sea is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati that spans across the equator and it has several uninhabited  unfished  pristine islands and a few inhabited islands. So let's start with the first one  Christmas Island  over       people. Most of the reefs are dead  most of the corals are dead    overgrown by algae    and most of the fish are smaller than the pencils we use to count them. We did     hours of diving here in     . We didn't see a single shark. This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in      and he described a huge abundance of sharks biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats while they were going ashore. Let's move the dial a little bit to the past. Fanning Island        people. The corals are doing better here. Lots of small fish. This is what many divers would consider paradise. This is where you can see most of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. And many people think this is really  really beautiful  if this is your baseline. If we go back to a place like Palmyra Atoll  where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago  the corals are doing better and there are sharks. You can see sharks in every single dive. And this is something that is very unusual in today's coral reefs. But then  if we shift the dial          years back  then we get to the places where the corals are absolutely healthy and gorgeous  forming spectacular structures  and where the predators are the most conspicuous thing  where you see between    and    sharks per dive. What have we learned from these places  This is what we thought was natural. This is what we call the biomass pyramid. If we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them  this is what we would expect. Most of the biomass is low on the food chain  the herbivores  the parrotfish  the surgeonfish that eat the algae. Then the plankton feeders  these little damselfish  the little animals floating in the water. And then we have a lower biomass of carnivores  and a lower biomass of top head  or the sharks  the large snappers  the large groupers. But this is a consequence. This view of the world is a consequence of having studied degraded reefs. When we went to pristine reefs  we realized that the natural world was upside down  this pyramid was inverted. The top head does account for most of the biomass  in some places up to    percent  like Kingman Reef  which is now protected. The good news is that  in addition to having more predators  there's more of everything. The size of these boxes is bigger. We have more sharks  more biomass of snappers  more biomass of herbivores  too  like these parrot fish that are like marine goats. They clean the reef  everything that grows enough to be seen  they eat  and they keep the reef clean and allow the corals to replenish. Not only do these places    these ancient  pristine places    have lots of fish  but they also have other important components of the ecosystem like the giant clams  pavements of giant clams in the lagoons  up to        per square meter. These have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world  and they filter the water  they keep the water clean from microbes and pathogens. But still  now we have global warming. If we don't have fishing because these reefs are protected by law or their remoteness  this is great. But the water gets warmer for too long and the corals die. So how are these fish  these predators going to help  Well  what we have seen is that in this particular area during El Nino  year '    '    the water was too warm for too long  and many corals bleached and many died. In Christmas  where the food web is really trimmed down  where the large animals are gone  the corals have not recovered. In Fanning Island  the corals are not recovered. But you see here a big table coral that died and collapsed. And the fish have grazed the algae  so the turf of algae is a little lower. Then you go to Palmyra Atoll that has more biomass of herbivores  and the dead corals are clean  and the corals are coming back. And when you go to the pristine side  did this ever bleach  These places bleached too  but they recovered faster. The more intact  the more complete   and  the more complex your food web  the higher the resilience   and  the more likely that the system is going to recover from the short term impacts of warming events. And that's good news  so we need to recover that structure. We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there so the ecosystem can adapt to the effects of global warming. So if we have to reset the baseline  if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left  how can we do it  Well  there are several ways. One very clear way is the marine protected areas  especially no take reserves that we set aside to allow for the recovery for marine life. And let me go back to that image of the Mediterranean. This was my baseline. This is what I saw when I was a kid. And at the same time I was watching Jacques Cousteau's shows on TV  with all this richness and abundance and diversity. And I thought that this richness belonged to tropical seas  and that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea. But  little did I know  until I jumped for the first time in a marine reserve. And this is what I saw  lots of fish. After a few years  between five and seven years  fish come back  they eat the urchins  and then the algae grow again. So you have this little algal forest  and in the size of a laptop you can find more than     species of algae  mostly microscopic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then feed the fish  so that the system recovers. And this particular place  the Medes Islands Marine Reserve  is only    hectares  and it brings   million euros to the local economy     times more than fishing  and it represents    percent of all the tourist revenue. So these places not only help the ecosystem but also help the people who can benefit from the ecosystem. So let me just give you a summary of what no take reserves do. These places  when we protect them  if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby  this is what happens. The number of species increases    percent  so if you have       species you would expect     more in a marine reserve. This is very substantial. The size of organisms increases a third  so your fish are now this big. The abundance  how many fish you have per square meter  increases almost     percent. And the biomass    this is the most spectacular change     .  times greater biomass on average  just after five to seven years. In some places up to    times larger biomass inside the reserves. So we have all these things inside the reserve that grow  and what do they do  They reproduce. That's population biology    . If you don't kill the fish  they take a longer time to die  they grow larger and they reproduce a lot. And same thing for invertebrates. This is the example. These are egg cases laid by a snail off the coast of Chile  and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom. Outside the reserve  you cannot even detect this. One point three million eggs per square meter inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant. So these organisms reproduce  the little larvae juveniles spill over  they all spill over  and then people can benefit from them outside too. This is in the Bahamas  Nassau grouper. Huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve  and the closer you get to the reserve  the more fish you have. So the fishermen are catching more. You can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up. So there is spill over  there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help people around them  while at the same time the reserve is protecting the entire habitat. It is building resilience. So what we have now    or a world without reserves    is like a debit account where we withdraw all the time and we never make any deposit. Reserves are like savings accounts. We have this principal that we don't touch  that produces returns  social  economic and ecological. And if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves  this is like compound interest. Two examples  again  of how these reserves can benefit people. This is how much fishermen get everyday in Kenya  fishing over a series of years  in a place where there is no protection  it's a free for all. Once the most degrading fishing gear  seine nets  were removed  the fishermen were catching more. If you fish less  you're actually catching more. But if we add the no take reserve on top of that  the fishermen are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is protected. Another example  Nassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef. This is grouper sex  and the groupers aggregate around the full moons of December and January for a week. They used to aggregate up to the tens of thousands         groupers about this big in one hectare  in one aggregation. Fishermen knew about these things  they caught them  and they depleted them. When I went there for the first time in       there were only       groupers left. And the fishermen were authorized to catch    percent of the entire spawning population every year. So we did a simple analysis  and it doesn't take rocket science to figure out that  if you take    percent every year  your fishery is going to collapse very quickly. And with the fishery  the entire reproductive ability of the species goes extinct. It happened in many places around the Caribbean. And they would make       dollars per year  total  for the entire fishery  several fishing boats. Now  if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut  if we brought just    divers one month per year  the revenue would be more than    times higher and that would be sustainable over time. So how much of this do we have  If this is so good  if this is such a no brainer  how much of this do we have  And you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean's protected. We're getting closer to one percent now  thanks to the protections of the Chagos Archipelago  and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing. Scientific studies recommend that at least    percent of the ocean should be protected. The estimated range is between    and    percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience. Now  is this possible  People would ask  How much would that cost  Well  let's think about how much we are paying now to subsidize fishing     billion dollars per year. Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices. Well  there are a couple estimates of how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas covering    percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction of what we are now paying  the government hands out to a fishery that is collapsing. People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing. A creation of a network of reserves would provide direct employment for more than a million people plus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits. So how can we do that  If it's so clear that these savings accounts are good for the environment and for people  why don't we have        percent of the ocean  And how can we reach that goal  Well  there are two ways of getting there. The trivial solution is to create really large protected areas like the Chagos Archipelago. The problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people  where there is no social conflict  where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low. And a few of us  a few organizations in this room and elsewhere are working on this. But what about the rest of the coast of the world  where people live and make a living out of fishing  Well  there are three main reasons why we don't have tens of thousands of small reserves  The first one is that people have no idea what marine reserves do  and fishermen tend to be really  really defensive when it comes to regulating or closing an area  even if it's small. Second  the governance is not right because most coastal communities around the world don't have the authority to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it. It's a top down hierarchical structure where people wait for government agents to come and this is not effective. And the government doesn't have enough resources. Which takes us to the third reason  why we don't have many more reserves  is that the funding models have been wrong. NGOs and governments spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas  usually. So marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sink for government or philanthropic money  and this is not sustainable. So the solutions are just fixing these three issues. First  we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments to create no take reserves that are better than what we have now. It's the savings accounts versus the debit accounts with no deposits. Second  we need to redesign our governance so conservation efforts can be decentralized  so conservation efforts don't depend on work from NGOs or from government agencies and can be created by the local communities  like it happens in the Philippines and a few other places. And third  and very important  we need to develop new business models. The philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves is not sustainable. We really need to develop models  business models  where coastal conservation is an investment  because we already know that these marine reserves provide social  ecological and economic benefits. And I'd like to finish with one thought  which is that no one organization alone is going to save the ocean. There has been a lot of competition in the past  and we need to develop a new model of partnership  truly collaborative  where we are looking for complementing  not substituting. The stakes are just too high to continue the way we are going. So let's do that. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Thank you Enric. Enric Sala  Thank you. CA  That was a masterful job of pulling things together. First of all  your pyramid  your inverted pyramid  showing    percent biomass in the predators  that seems impossible. How could    percent survive on    percent  ES  Well  imagine that you have two gears of a watch  a big one and a small one. The big one is moving very slowly  and the small one is moving fast. That's basically it. The animals at the lower parts of the food chain  they reproduce very fast  they grow really fast  they produce millions of eggs. Up there  you have sharks and large fish that live        years. They reproduce very slowly  they have a slow metabolism  and  basically  they just maintain their biomass. So  basically  the production surplus of these guys down there is enough to maintain this biomass that is not moving. They are like capacitors of the system. CA  That's very fascinating. So  really  our picture of a food pyramid is just    we have to change that completely. ES  At least in the seas. What we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid is the equivalent of the Serengeti  with five lions per wildebeest. And on land  this cannot work. But at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure. We think this is universal. But we have started studying pristine reefs only very recently. CA  So the numbers you presented really are astonishing. You're saying we're spending    billion dollars now on subsidies. It would only cost    billion to set up    percent of the ocean as marine protected areas that actually give new living choices to the fishermen as well. If the world was a smarter place  we could solve this problem for negative    billion dollars. We've got    billion to spend on health care or something. ES  And then we have the under performance of fisheries that is    billion dollars. So again  one of the big solutions is have the World Trade Organization shifting the subsidies to sustainable practices. CA  Okay  so there's a lot of examples that I'm hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness. So thank you for those numbers. The last one's a personal question. A lot of the experience of people here who've been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this degradation  the places they saw that were beautiful getting worse  depressing. Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back. ES  It is a spiritual experience. We go there to try to understand the ecosystems  to try to measure or count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the places we know. But the best feeling is this biophilia that E.O. Wilson talks about  where humans have this sense of awe and wonder in front of untamed nature  of raw nature. And there  only there  you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem. And if it were not for these places that show hope  I don't think I could continue doing this job. It would be just too depressing. CA  Well  Enric  thank you so much for sharing some of that spiritual experience with us all. Thank you. ES  Thank you very much. Can I ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something    a movie  an album  a song or a book    and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked  and you anticipated that reaction  you waited for it  and it came back  and the person hated it  So  by way of introduction  that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years.  Laughter  I teach high school math. I sell a product to a market that doesn't want it  but is forced by law to buy it. I mean  it's just a losing proposition. So there's a useful stereotype about students that I see  a useful stereotype about you all. I could give you guys an algebra two final exam  and I would expect no higher than a    percent pass rate. And both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the U.S. today. To start with  I'd like to break math down into two categories. One is computation  this is the stuff you've forgotten. For example  factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one. This stuff is also really easy to relearn  provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning. Math reasoning    we'll call it the application of math processes to the world around us    this is hard to teach. This is what we would love students to retain  even if they don't go into mathematical fields. This is also something that  the way we teach it in the U.S. all but ensures they won't retain it. So  I'd like to talk about why that is  why that's such a calamity for society  what we can do about it and  to close with  why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher. So first  five symptoms that you're doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom. One is a lack of initiative  your students don't self start. You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re explain the entire thing at their desks. Students lack perseverance. They lack retention  you find yourself re explaining concepts three months later  wholesale. There's an aversion to word problems  which describes    percent of my students. And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation. This is really destructive. David Milch  creator of  Deadwood  and other amazing TV shows  has a really good description for this. He swore off creating contemporary drama  shows set in the present day  because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of  for example   Two and a Half Men   no disrespect  it shapes the neural pathways  he said  in such a way that they expect simple problems. He called it   an impatience with irresolution.  You're impatient with things that don't resolve quickly. You expect sitcom sized problems that wrap up in    minutes  three commercial breaks and a laugh track. And I'll put it to all of you  what you already know  that no problem worth solving is that simple. I am very concerned about this because I'm going to retire in a world that my students will run. I'm doing bad things to my own future and well being when I teach this way. I'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks    particularly mass adopted textbooks    teach math reasoning and patient problem solving  it's functionally equivalent to turning on  Two and a Half Men  and calling it a day. In all seriousness. Here's an example from a physics textbook. It applies equally to math. Notice  first of all here  that you have exactly three pieces of information there  each of which will figure into a formula somewhere  eventually  which the student will then compute. I believe in real life. And ask yourself  what problem have you solved  ever  that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance  where you didn't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out  or you didn't have sufficient information and had to go find some. I'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that. And the textbook  I think  knows how it's hamstringing students because  watch this  this is the practice problem set. When it comes time to do the actual problem set  we have problems like this right here where we're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit. And if the student still doesn't recognize the stamp this was molded from  it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula. You could literally  I mean this  pass this particular unit without knowing any physics  just knowing how to decode a textbook. That's a shame. So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math. Here's a really cool problem. I like this. It's about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift. But what you have here is actually four separate layers  and I'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers and  particularly  how when they're compressed together and presented to the student all at once  how that creates this impatient problem solving. I'll define them here  You have the visual. You also have the mathematical structure  talking about grids  measurements  labels  points  axes  that sort of thing. You have substeps  which all lead to what we really want to talk about  which section is the steepest. So I hope you can see. I really hope you can see how what we're doing here is taking a compelling question  a compelling answer  but we're paving a smooth  straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way. That's all we're doing here. So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students  we can have everything we're looking for in terms of patient problem solving. So right here I start with the visual  and I immediately ask the question  Which section is the steepest  And this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers. So you get people arguing against each other  friend versus friend  in pairs  journaling  whatever. And then eventually we realize it's getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line. And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A  B  C and D labels to talk about them more easily. And then as we start to define what does steepness mean  we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down  specifically what that means. And then and only then  we throw down that mathematical structure. The math serves the conversation  the conversation doesn't serve the math. And at that point  I'll put it to you that nine out of    classes are good to go on the whole slope  steepness thing. But if you need to  your students can then develop those substeps together. Do you guys see how this  right here  compared to that    which one creates that patient problem solving  that math reasoning  It's been obvious in my practice  to me. And I'll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein  who  I believe  has paid his dues. He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important  and yet in my practice  in the U.S. here  we just give problems to students  we don't involve them in the formulation of the problem. So    percent of what I do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving. And here's how it works. I like this question. It's about a water tank. The question is  How long will it take you to fill it up  First things first  we eliminate all the substeps. Students have to develop those  they have to formulate those. And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you'll need. None of it's a distractor  so we lose that. Students need to decide   All right  well  does the height matter  Does the side of it matter  Does the color of the valve matter  What matters here   Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum. So now we have a water tank. How long will it take you to fill it up  And that's it. And because this is the   st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms  not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks  we go out and we take a picture of it. So now we have the real deal. How long will it take it to fill it up  And then even better is we take a video  a video of someone filling it up. And it's filling up slowly  agonizingly slowly. It's tedious. Students are looking at their watches  rolling their eyes  and they're all wondering at some point or another   Man  how long is it going to take to fill up   That's how you know you've baited the hook  right  And that question  off this right here  is really fun for me because  like the intro  I teach kids    because of my inexperience    I teach the kids that are the most remedial  all right  And I've got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula  someone else knows how to work the formula better than me  so I won't talk about it. But here  every student is on a level playing field of intuition. Everyone's filled something up with water before  so I get kids answering the question   How long will it take   I've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation. We put names on the board  attach them to guesses  and kids have bought in here. And then we follow the process I've described. And the best part here  or one of the better parts is that we don't get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher's edition. We  instead  just watch the end of the movie. And that's terrifying  because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher's edition  that's great  but it's scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical. But those conversations have been so valuable  among the most valuable. So I'm here to report some really fun games with students who come pre installed with these viruses day one of the class. These are the kids who now  one semester in  I can put something on the board  totally new  totally foreign  and they'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year  which is just so fun. We're no longer averse to word problems  because we've redefined what a word problem is. We're no longer intimidated by math  because we're slowly redefining what math is. This has been a lot of fun. I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia  because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color  to encourage student intuition for that level playing field  to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation  to let students build the problem  because Einstein said so  and to finally  in total  just be less helpful  because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways  It's buying you out of your obligation  for patient problem solving and math reasoning  to be less helpful. And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high quality curriculum in our front pocket. It's ubiquitous and fairly cheap  and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous. I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got       views in two weeks. I get emails still from teachers in countries I've never visited saying   Wow  yeah. We had a good conversation about that. Oh  and by the way  here's how I made your stuff better   which  wow. I put this problem on my blog recently  In a grocery store  which line do you get into  the one that has one cart and    items or the line with four carts and three  five  two and one items. And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom  but it eventually got me on  Good Morning America  a few weeks later  which is just bizarre  right  And from all of this  I can only conclude that people  not just students  are really hungry for this. Math makes sense of the world. Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition. So I just really encourage you  whatever your stake is in education    whether you're a student  parent  teacher  policy maker  whatever    insist on better math curriculum. We need more patient problem solvers. Thank you.  Applause  I have a daughter  Mulan. And when she was eight  last year  she was doing a report for school or she had some homework about frogs. And we were at this restaurant  and she said   So  basically  frogs lay eggs and the eggs turn into tadpoles  and tadpoles turn into frogs.  And I said   Yeah. You know  I'm not really up on my frog reproduction that much. It's the females  I think  that lay the eggs  and then the males fertilize them. And then they become tadpoles and frogs.  And she says   What  Only the females have eggs   And I said   Yeah.  And she goes   And what's this fertilizing   So I kind of said   Oh  it's this extra ingredient  you know  that you need to create a new frog from the mom and dad frog.   Laughter  And she said   Oh  so is that true for humans too   And I thought   Okay  here we go.  I didn't know it would happen so quick  at eight. I was trying to remember all the guidebooks  and all I could remember was   Only answer the question they're asking. Don't give any more information.   Laughter  So I said   Yes.  And she said   And where do  um  where do human women  like  where do women lay their eggs   And I said   Well  funny you should ask.  Laughter  We have evolved to have our own pond. We have our very own pond inside our bodies. And we lay our eggs there  we don't have to worry about other eggs or anything like that. It's our own pond. And that's how it happens.  And she goes   Then how do they get fertilized   And I said   Well  Men  through their penis  they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out. And you go through the woman's vagina.  And so we're just eating  and her jaw just drops  and she goes   Mom  Like  where you go to the bathroom   And I said   I know. I know.  That's how we evolved. It does seem odd. It is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant right next to an amusement park ... Bad zoning  but ...   Laughter  She's like   What   And she goes   But Mom  but men and women can't ever see each other naked  Mom. So how could that ever happen   And then I go   Well   and then I put my Margaret Mead hat on.  Human males and females develop a special bond  and when they're much older  much  much older than you  and they have a very special feeling  then they can be naked together.  And she said   Mom  have you done this before   And I said   Yes.  And she said   But Mom  you can't have kids.  Because she knows that I adopted her and that I can't have kids. And I said   Yes.  And she said   Well  you don't have to do that again.  And I said   ...  And then she said   But how does it happen when a man and woman are together  Like  how do they know that's the time  Mom  does the man just say  'Is now the time to take off my pants '  And I said   Yes.   That is exactly right. That's exactly how it happens.  So we're driving home and she's looking out the window  and she goes   Mom. What if two just people saw each other on the street  like a man and a woman  they just started doing it. Would that ever happen   And I said   Oh  no. Humans are so private. Oh ...  And then she goes   What if there was like a party  and there was just like a whole bunch of girls and a whole bunch of boys  and there was a bunch of men and women and they just started doing it  Mom  Would that ever happen   And I said   Oh  no  no. That's not how we do it.  Then we got home and we see the cat. And she goes   Mom  how do cats do it   And I go   Oh  it's the same. It's basically the same.  And then she got all caught up in the legs.  But how would the legs go  Mom  I don't understand the legs.  She goes   Mom  everyone can't do the splits.  And I go   I know  but the legs ...  and I'm probably like   The legs get worked out.  And she goes   But I just can't understand it.  So I go   You know  why don't we go on the Internet  and maybe we can see ... like on Wikipedia.   Laughter  So we go online  and we put in  cats mating.  And  unfortunately  on YouTube  there's many cats mating videos. And we watched them and I'm so thankful  because she's just like   Wow  This is so amazing.  She goes   What about dogs   So we put in dogs mating  and  you know  we're watching it  and she's totally absorbed. And then she goes   Mom  do you think they would have  on the Internet  any humans mating   And then I realized that I had taken my little eight year old's hand  and taken her right into Internet porn.  Laughter  And I looked into this trusting  loving face  and I said   Oh  no. That would never happen.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm so happy to be here. Good afternoon. There's a medical revolution happening all around us  and it's one that's going to help us conquer some of society's most dreaded conditions  including cancer. The revolution is called angiogenesis  and it's based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels. So why should we care about blood vessels  Well  the human body is literally packed with them           miles worth in a typical adult. End to end  that would form a line that would circle the earth twice. The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries. We've got    billion of them in our bodies. And these are the vessels of life  and as I'll show you  they can also be the vessels of death. Now  the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adapt to whatever environment they're growing in. For example  in the liver  they form channels to detoxify the blood  in the lungs  they line air sacs for gas exchange. In muscle  they corkscrew  so that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation. And in nerves  they course along like power lines  keeping those nerves alive. We get most of these blood vessels when we're actually still in the womb. And what that means is that as adults  blood vessels don't normally grow. Except in a few special circumstances. In women  blood vessels grow every month  to build the lining of the uterus. During pregnancy  they form the placenta  which connects mom and baby. And after injury  blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab in order to heal a wound. And this is actually what it looks like  hundreds of blood vessels  all growing toward the center of the wound. So the body has the ability to regulate the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time. It does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances  stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis  such that  when we need a brief burst of blood vessels  the body can do this by releasing stimulators  proteins called angiogenic factors  that act as natural fertilizer  and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout. When those excess vessels are no longer needed  the body prunes them back to baseline  using naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis. There are other situations where we start beneath the baseline  and we need to grow more blood vessels  just to get back to normal levels    for example  after an injury    and the body can do that too  but only to that normal level  that set point. But what we now know  is that for a number of diseases  there are defects in the system  where the body can't prune back extra blood vessels  or can't grow enough new ones in the right place at the right time. And in these situations  angiogenesis is out of balance. And when angiogenesis is out of balance  a myriad of diseases result. For example  insufficient angiogenesis    not enough blood vessels    leads to wounds that don't heal  heart attacks  legs without circulation  death from stroke  nerve damage. And on the other end  excessive angiogenesis    too many blood vessels    drives disease  and we see this in cancer  blindness  arthritis  obesity  Alzheimer's disease. In total  there are more than    major diseases affecting more than a billion people worldwide  that all look on the surface to be different from one another  but all actually share abnormal angiogenesis as their common denominator. And this realization is allowing us to re conceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases  by controlling angiogenesis. Now  I'm going to focus on cancer  because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer    every type of cancer. So here we go. This is a tumor  dark  gray  ominous mass growing inside a brain. And under the microscope  you can see hundreds of these brown stained blood vessels  capillaries that are feeding cancer cells  bringing oxygen and nutrients. But cancers don't start out like this  and in fact  cancers don't start out with a blood supply. They start out as small  microscopic nests of cells  that can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size. That's the tip of a ballpoint pen. Then they can't get any larger because they don't have a blood supply  so they don't have enough oxygen or nutrients. In fact  we're probably forming these microscopic cancers all the time in our body. Autopsy studies from people who died in car accidents have shown that about    percent of women between the ages of    and    actually have microscopic cancers in their breasts. About    percent of men in their   s and   s have microscopic prostate cancers  and virtually     percent of us  by the time we reach our   s  will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid. Yet  without a blood supply  most of these cancers will never become dangerous. Dr. Judah Folkman  who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field  once called this  cancer without disease.  So the body's ability to balance angiogenesis  when it's working properly  prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers. And this turns out to be one of our most important defense mechanisms against cancer. In fact  if you actually block angiogenesis and prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells  tumors simply can't grow up. But once angiogenesis occurs  cancers can grow exponentially. And this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless  to being deadly. Cancer cells mutate  and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors  natural fertilizer  that tip the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer. And once those vessels invade the cancer  it can expand  it can invade local tissues  and the same vessels that are feeding tumors allow cancer cells to exit into the circulation as metastases. And unfortunately  this late stage of cancer is the one at which it's most likely to be diagnosed  when angiogenesis is already turned on  and cancer cells are growing like wild. So  if angiogenesis is a tipping point between a harmless cancer and a harmful one  then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution is a new approach to treating cancer by cutting off the blood supply. We call this antiangiogenic therapy  and it's completely different from chemotherapy  because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers. We can do this because tumor blood vessels are unlike normal  healthy vessels we see in other places of the body    they're abnormal  they're very poorly constructed  and because of that  they're highly vulnerable to treatments that target them. In effect  when we give cancer patients antiangiogenic therapy    here  an experimental drug for a glioma  which is a type of brain tumor    you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur when the tumor is being starved. Here's a woman with a breast cancer  being treated with the antiangiogenic drug called Avastin  which is FDA approved. And you can see that the halo of blood flow disappears after treatment. Well  I've just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy. So a few years ago  I asked myself   Can we take this one step further and treat other cancers  even in other species   So here is a nine year old boxer named Milo  who had a very aggressive tumor called a malignant neurofibroma growing on his shoulder. It invaded into his lungs. His veterinarian only gave him three months to live. So we created a cocktail of antiangiogenic drugs that could be mixed into his dog food  as well as an antiangiogenic cream  that could be applied on the surface of the tumor. And within a few weeks of treatment  we were able to slow down that cancer's growth  such that we were ultimately able to extend Milo s survival to six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted  all with a very good quality of life. And we've subsequently treated more than     dogs. We have about a    percent response rate  and improved survival for these pets that were about to be euthanized. So let me show you a couple of even more interesting examples. This is    year old dolphin living in Florida  and she had these lesions in her mouth that  over the course of three years  developed into invasive squamous cell cancers. So we created an antiangiogenic paste. We had it painted on top of the cancer three times a week. And over the course of seven months  the cancers completely disappeared  and the biopsies came back as normal. Here's a cancer growing on the lip of a Quarter Horse named Guinness. It's a very  very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma. It had already spread to his lymph nodes  so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip  and the oral cocktail  so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside. And over the course of six months  he experienced a complete remission. And here he is six years later  Guinness  with his very happy owner. Now obviously  antiangiogenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers. And in fact  the first pioneering treatments for people as well as dogs  are already becoming available. There are    different drugs     different cancer types. But the real question is  How well do these work in practice  So here's actually the patient survival data from eight different types of cancer. The bars represent survival time taken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy  or surgery  or radiation available. But starting in       when antiangiogenic therapies first became available  you can see that there has been a    to     percent improvement in survival for people with kidney cancer  multiple myeloma  colorectal cancer  and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. That's impressive. But for other tumors and cancer types  the improvements have only been modest. So I started asking myself   Why haven't we been able to do better   And the answer  to me  is obvious  we're treating cancer too late in the game  when it's already established  and oftentimes  it's already spread or metastasized. And as a doctor  I know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage  achieving a cure can be difficult  if not impossible. So I went back to the biology of angiogenesis  and started thinking  Could the answer to cancer be preventing angiogenesis  beating cancer at its own game  so the cancers could never become dangerous  This could help healthy people  as well as people who've already beaten cancer once or twice  and want to find a way to keep it from coming back. So to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer  I went back to look at cancer's causes. And what really intrigued me  was when I saw that diet accounts for    to    percent of environmentally caused cancers. Now the obvious thing is to think about what we could remove from our diet  what to strip out  take away. But I actually took a completely opposite approach  and began asking  What could we be adding to our diet that's naturally antiangiogenic  and that could boost the body's defense system  and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers  In other words  can we eat to starve cancer  Well  the answer is yes  and I'm going to show you how. And our search for this has taken us to the market  the farm and to the spice cabinet  because what we've discovered is that Mother Nature has laced a large number of foods and beverages and herbs with naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis. Here's a test system we developed. At the center is a ring from which hundreds of blood vessels are growing out in a starburst fashion. And we can use this system to test dietary factors at concentrations that are obtainable by eating. Let me show you what happens when we put in an extract from red grapes. The active ingredient is resveratrol  it's also found in red wine. This inhibits abnormal angiogenesis  by    percent. Here's what happens when we added an extract from strawberries. It potently inhibits angiogenesis. And extract from soybeans. And here is a growing list of antiangiogenic foods and beverages that we're interested in studying. For each food type  we believe that there are different potencies within different strains and varietals. And we want to measure this because  well  while you're eating a strawberry or drinking tea  why not select the one that's most potent for preventing cancer  So here are four different teas that we've tested. They're all common ones  Chinese jasmine  Japanese sencha  Earl Grey and a special blend that we prepared  and you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency  from less potent to more potent. But what's very cool is when we combine the two less potent teas together  the combination  the blend  is more potent than either one alone. This means there's food synergy. Here's some more data from our testing. Now in the lab  we can simulate tumor angiogenesis  represented here in a black bar. And using this system  we can test the potency of cancer drugs. So the shorter the bar  the less angiogenesis    that's good. And here are some common drugs that have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people. Statins  nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  and a few others    they inhibit angiogenesis  too. And here are the dietary factors going head to head against these drugs. You can see they clearly hold their own  and in some cases  they're more potent than the actual drugs. Soy  parsley  garlic  grapes  berries. I could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients. Imagine if we could create the world's first rating system  in which we could score foods according to their antiangiogenic  cancer preventative properties. And that's what we're doing right now. Now  I've shown you a bunch of lab data  and so the real question is  What is the evidence in people that eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer  Well  the best example I know is a study of        men followed over    years  in which it was found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes two to three times a week  had up to a    percent reduction in their risk of developing prostate cancer. Now  we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene  and lycopene is antiangiogenic. But what's even more interesting from this study  is that in those men who did develop prostate cancer  those who ate more servings of tomato sauce  actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer. So this human study is a prime example of how antiangiogenic substances present in food and consumed at practical levels  can have an impact on cancer. And we're now studying the role of a healthy diet    with Dean Ornish at UCSF and Tufts University    the role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis that we can find in the bloodstream. Obviously  what I've shared with you has some far ranging implications  even beyond cancer research. Because if we're right  it could impact consumer education  food services  public health and even the insurance industry. And in fact  some insurance companies are already beginning to think along these lines. Check out this ad from BlueCross BlueShield of Minnesota. For many people around the world  dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution  because not everybody can afford expensive end stage cancer treatments  but everybody could benefit from a healthy diet based on local  sustainable  antiangiogenic crops. Now  finally  I've talked to you about food  and I've talked to you about cancer  so there's just one more disease that I have to tell you about  and that's obesity. Because it turns out that adipose tissue    fat    is highly angiogenesis dependent. And like a tumor  fat grows when blood vessels grow. So the question is  Can we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply  The top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese mouse that eats nonstop until it turns fat  like this furry tennis ball. And the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse. If you take the obese mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor  it loses weight. Stop the treatment  gains the weight back. Restart the treatment  loses the weight. Stop the treatment  it gains the weight back. And  in fact  you can cycle the weight up and down simply by inhibiting angiogenesis. So this approach that we're taking for cancer prevention may also have an application for obesity. The truly interesting thing about this is that we can't take these obese mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal mouse's weight is supposed to be. In other words  we can't create supermodel mice. And this speaks to the role of angiogenesis in regulating healthy set points. Albert Szent Gy rgi once said   Discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen  and thinking what no one has thought.  I hope I've convinced you that for diseases like cancer  obesity and other conditions  there may be a great power in attacking their common denominator  angiogenesis. And that's what I think the world needs now. Thank you. June Cohen  I have a quick question for you. JC  So these drugs aren't exactly in mainstream cancer treatments right now. For anyone out here who has cancer  what would you recommend  Do you recommend pursuing these treatments now  for most cancer patients  William Li  There are antiangiogenic treatments that are FDA approved  and if you're a cancer patient  or working for one or advocating for one  you should ask about them. And there are many clinical trials. The Angiogenesis Foundation is following almost     companies  and there are about     more drugs in that pipeline. So  consider the approved ones  look for clinical trials  but then between what the doctor can do for you  we need to start asking what can we do for ourselves. This is one of the themes I'm talking about  We can empower ourselves to do the things that doctors can't do for us  which is to use knowledge and take action. And if Mother Nature has given us some clues  we think there might be a new future in the value of how we eat  and what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day. JC  Right. And along those lines  for people who might have risk factors for cancer  would you recommend pursuing any treatments prophylactically  or simply pursuing the right diet  with lots of tomato sauce  WL  Well  you know  there's abundant epidemiological evidence  and I think in the information age  it doesn't take long to go to a credible source like PubMed  the National Library of Medicine  to look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction based on diet and based on common medications. And that's certainly something that anybody can look into. JC  Okay. Well  thank you so much. About a year ago  I asked myself a question   Knowing what I know  why am I not a vegetarian   After all  I'm one of the green guys  I grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin. I started a site called TreeHugger    I care about this stuff. I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third. Cruelty  I knew that the    billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we  hypocritically  wouldn't even consider for our own cats  dogs and other pets. Environmentally  meat  amazingly  causes more emissions than all of transportation combined  cars  trains  planes  buses  boats  all of it. And beef production uses     times the water that most vegetables do. I also knew that I'm not alone. We as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the   s. So what was once the special little side treat now is the main  much more regular. So really  any of these angles should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian. Yet  there I was    chk  chk  chk    tucking into a big old steak. So why was I stalling  I realized that what I was being pitched was a binary solution. It was either you're a meat eater or you're a vegetarian  and I guess I just wasn't quite ready. Imagine your last hamburger. So my common sense  my good intentions  were in conflict with my taste buds. And I'd commit to doing it later  and not surprisingly  later never came. Sound familiar  So I wondered  might there be a third solution  And I thought about it  and I came up with one. I've been doing it for the last year  and it's great. It's called weekday veg. The name says it all  Nothing with a face Monday through Friday. On the weekend  your choice. Simple. If you want to take it to the next level  remember  the major culprits in terms of environmental damage and health are red and processed meats. So you want to swap those out with some good  sustainably harvested fish. It's structured  so it ends up being simple to remember  and it's okay to break it here and there. After all  cutting five days a week is cutting    percent of your meat intake. The program has been great  weekday veg. My footprint's smaller  I'm lessening pollution  I feel better about the animals  I'm even saving money. Best of all  I'm healthier  I know that I'm going to live longer  and I've even lost a little weight. So  please ask yourselves  for your health  for your pocketbook  for the environment  for the animals  What's stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot  After all  if all of us ate half as much meat  it would be like half of us were vegetarians. Thank you. I want to talk about penguins today. But first  I want to start by saying that we need a new operating system  for the oceans and for the Earth. When I came to the Galapagos    years ago  there were       people that lived in the Galapagos. Now there are over       . There were two Jeeps on Santa Cruz. Now  there are around a thousand trucks and buses and cars there. So the fundamental problems that we face are overconsumption and too many people. It's the same problems in the Galapagos  except  obviously  it's worse here  in some ways  than other places. Because we've only doubled the population of the Earth since the     s    a little more than doubled    but we have  .  billion people in the world  and we all like to consume. And one of the major problems that we have is our operating system is not giving us the proper feedback. We're not paying the true environmental costs of our actions. And when I came at age    to live on Fernandina  let me just say  that I had never camped before. I had never lived alone for any period of time  and I'd never slept with sea lions snoring next to me all night. But moreover  I'd never lived on an uninhabited island. Punta Espinosa is where I lived for over a year  and we call it uninhabited because there are no people there. But it's alive with life  it's hardly uninhabited. So a lot has happened in the last    years  and what I learned when I came to the Galapagos is the importance of wild places  wild things  certainly wildlife  and the amazing qualities that penguins have. Penguins are real athletes  They can swim     kilometers in a day. They can swim at the same speed day and night    that's faster than any Olympic swimmer. I mean  they can do like seven kilometers an hour and sustain it. But what is really amazing  because of this deepness here  Emperor penguins can go down more than     meters and they can hold their breath for    minutes. Magellanic penguins  the ones that I work on  they can dive to about    meters and they can stay down for about  .  minutes. Humans  without fins     meters   .  minutes. And I doubt anybody in this room could really hold their breath for  .  minutes. You have to train to be able to do that. So penguins are amazing athletes. The other thing is  I've never met anybody that really doesn't say that they like penguins. They're comical  they walk upright  and  of course  they're diligent. And  more importantly  they're well dressed. So they have all the criteria that people normally like. But scientifically  they're amazing because they're sentinels. They tell us about our world in a lot of different ways  and particularly the ocean. This is a picture of a Galapagos penguin that's on the front of a little zodiac here in the Galapagos. And that's what I came to study. I thought I was going to study the social behavior of Galapagos penguins  but you already know penguins are rare. These are the rarest penguins in the world. Why I thought I was going to be able to do that  I don't know. But the population has changed dramatically since I was first here. When I counted penguins for the first time and tried to do a census  we just counted all the individual beaks that we could around all these islands. We counted around        so I don't know how many penguins there really are  but I know I can count      . If you go and do it now  the national parks count about    . So we have a quarter of the penguins that we did    years ago. And this is true of most of our living systems. We have less than we had before  and most of them are in fairly steep decline. And I want to just show you a little bit about why. That's a penguin braying to tell you that it's important to pay attention to penguins. Most important of all  I didn't know what that was the first time I heard it. And you can imagine sleeping on Fernandina your first night there and you hear this lonesome  plaintful call. I fell in love with penguins  and it certainly has changed the rest of my life. What I found out I was studying is really the difference in how the Galapagos changes  the most extreme variation. You've heard about these El Ninos  but this is the extreme that penguins all over the world have to adapt to. This is a cold water event called La Nina. Where it's blue and it's green  it means the water is really cold. And so you can see this current coming up    in this case  the Humboldt Current    that comes all the way out to the Galapagos Islands  and this deep undersea current  the Cromwell Current  that upwells around the Galapagos. That brings all the nutrients  When this is cold in the Galapagos  it's rich  and there's plenty of food for everyone. When we have extreme El Nino events  you see all this red  and you see no green out here around the Galapagos. That means that there's no upwelling  and there's basically no food. So it's a real desert for not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas ... things die when there's no food. But we didn't even know that that affected the Galapagos when I went to study penguins. And you can imagine being on an island hoping you're going to see penguins  and you're in the middle of an El Nino event and there are no penguins. They're not breeding  they're not even around. I studied marine iguanas at that point. But this is a global phenomenon  we know that. And if you look along the coast of Argentina  where I work now  at a place called Punta Tombo    the largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about    degrees south latitude    you see that there's great variation here. Some years  the cold water goes all the way up to Brazil  and other years  in these La Nina years  it doesn't. So the oceans don't always act together  they act differently  but that is the kind of variation that penguins have to live with  and it's not easy. So when I went to study the Magellanic penguins  I didn't have any problems. There were plenty of them. This is a picture at Punta Tombo in February showing all the penguins along the beach. I went there because the Japanese wanted to start harvesting them and turning them into high fashion golf gloves  protein and oil. Fortunately  nobody has harvested any penguins and we're getting over         tourists a year to see them. But the population is declining and it's declined fairly substantially  about    percent since       when I started these surveys  in terms of number of active nests. Here  you can see where Punta Tombo is  and they breed in incredibly dense colonies. We know this because of long term science  because we have long term studies there. And science is important in informing decision makers  and also in changing how we do and knowing the direction of change that we're going in. And so we have this penguin project. The Wildlife Conservation Society has funded me along with a lot of individuals over the last    years to be able to produce these kinds of maps. And also  we know that it's not only Galapagos penguins that are in trouble  but Magellanics and many other species of penguins. And so we have started a global penguin society to try to focus on the real plight of penguins. This is one of the plights of penguins  oil pollution. Penguins don't like oil and they don't like to swim through oil. The nice thing is  if you look down here in Argentina  there's no surface oil pollution from this composite map. But  in fact  when we went to Argentina  penguins were often found totally covered in oil. So they were just minding their own business. They ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it. Because when tankers carry oil they have to have ballast at some point  so when they're empty  they have the ballast water in there. When they come back  they actually dump this oily ballast water into the ocean. Why do they do that  Because it's cheaper  because they don't pay the real environmental costs. We usually don't  and we want to start getting the accounting system right so we can pay the real cost. At first  the Argentine government said   No  there's no way. You can't find oiled penguins in Argentina. We have laws  and we can't have illegal dumping  it's against the law.  So we ended up spending nine years convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins. In some years  like this year  we found more than    percent of the adult penguins dead on the beach were covered in oil. These little blue dots are the fledglings    we do this survey every March    which means that they're only in the environment from January until March  so maybe three months at the most that they could get covered in oil. And you can see  in some years over    percent of the fledglings were oiled. Eventually  the government listened and  amazingly  they changed their laws. They moved the tanker lanes    kilometers farther off shore  and people are not doing as much illegal dumping. So what we're seeing now is very few penguins are oiled. Why are there even these penguins oiled  Because we've solved the problem in Chubut province  which is like a state in Argentina where Punta Tombo is    so that's about       kilometers of coastline    but we haven't solved the problem in northern Argentina  Uruguay and Brazil. So now I want to show you that penguins are affected. I'm just going to talk about two things. This is climate change. Now this has really been a fun study because I put satellite tags on the back of these Magellanic penguins. Try to convince donors to give you a couple thousand dollars to glue a satellite tag on the back of penguins. But we've been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go. We thought we needed a marine protected area of about    kilometers  and then we put a satellite tag on the back of a penguin. And what the penguins show us    and these are all the little dots from where the penguins' positions were for penguins in incubation in         and what you see is some of these individuals are going     kilometers away from their nests. So that means as their mate is sitting on the nest incubating the eggs  the other one is out there foraging  and the longer they have to stay gone  the worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back. And  of course  all of this then leads to a vicious cycle and you can't raise a lot of chicks. Here you see in         these are all the dots of where the penguins are    they were raising a little over a half of a chick. Here  you can see in       they raised almost three quarters of a chick per nest  and you can see that they're closer to Punta Tombo  they're not going as far away. This past year  in       you can see that they're now raising about a fourth of a chick  and some of these individuals are going more than     kilometers away from their nests. So it's kind of like you having a job in Chicago  and then you get transferred to St. Louis  and your mate is not happy about this because you've got to pay airfare  because you're gone longer. The same thing's true for penguins as well. And they're going about  on average now     kilometers farther than they did a decade ago. We need to be able to get information out to the general public. And so we started a publication with the Society for Conservation that we think presents cutting edge science in a new  novel way  because we have reporters that are good writers that actually can distill the information and make it accessible to the general public. So if you're interested in cutting edge science and smarter conservation  you should join with our    partners    some of them here in this room  like the Nature Conservancy    and look at this magazine because we need to get information out about conservation to the general public. Lastly I want to say that all of you  probably  have had some relationship at some time in your life with a dog  a cat  some sort of pet  and you recognized that those are individuals. And some of you consider them almost part of your family. If you had a relationship with a penguin  you'd see it in the same sort of way. They're amazing creatures that really change how you view the world because they're not that different from us  They're trying to make a living  they're trying to raise their offspring  they're trying to get on and survive in the world. This is Turbo the Penguin. Turbo's never been fed. He met us and got his name because he started standing under my diesel truck  a turbo truck  so we named him Turbo. Turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak  we let him in and he comes in here. And I just wanted to show you what happened one day when Turbo brought in a friend. So this is Turbo. He's coming up to one of my graduate students and flipper patting  which he would do to a female penguin. And you can see  he's not trying to bite. This guy has never been in before and he's trying to figure out   What is going on  What is this guy doing  This is really pretty weird.  And you'll see soon that my graduate student ... and you see  Turbo's pretty intent on his flipper patting. And now he's looking at the other guy  saying   You are really weird.  And now look at this  not friendly. So penguins really differ in their personalities just like our dogs and our cats. We're also trying to collect our information and become more technologically literate. So we're trying to put that in computers in the field. And penguins are always involved in helping us or not helping us in one way or another. This is a radio frequency ID system. You put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin that has a barcode  so it tells you who it is. It walks over the pad  and you know who it is. Okay  so here are a few penguins coming in. See  this one's coming back to its nest. They're all coming in at this time  walking across there  just kind of leisurely coming in. Here's a female that's in a hurry. She's got food. She's really rushing back  because it's hot  to try to feed her chicks. And then there's another fellow that will leisurely come by. Look how fat he is. He's walking back to feed his chicks. Then I realize that they're playing king of the box. This is my box up here  and this is the system that works. You can see this penguin  he goes over  he looks at those wires  does not like that wire. He unplugs the wire  we have no data. So  they really are pretty amazing creatures. OK. Most important thing is  Only you can change yourself  and only you can change the world and make it better  for people as well as penguins. So  thank you very much.  Applause  For the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy  and it's going to be a bit of a varied talk. I'll try to spin a story about energy  and oil's a convenient starting place. The talk will be broadly about energy  but oil's a good place to start. And one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff. You take about eight or so carbon atoms  about    hydrogen atoms  you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid  very energy dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels. It's great stuff. Now  as far as it goes  there's a lot of oil out there in the world. Here's my little pocket map of where it's all located. A bigger one for you to look at. But this is it  this is the oil in the world. Geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is. This is about     trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today. Now  that's just one story about oil  and we could end it there and say   Well  oil's going to last forever because  well  there's just a lot of it.  But there's actually more to the story than that. Oh  by the way  if you think you're very far from some of this oil       meters below where you're all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world. Come talk to me about it  I'll fill in some of the details if you want. So  that's one of the stories of oil  there's just a lot of it. But what about oil  Where is it in the energy system  Here's a little snapshot of     years of oil  and it's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those     years. Now  here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about  For the last    years  oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems. There was one kind of peak oil in       when oil represented    percent of global energy supply. Now  it's about    percent. It's been declining and I believe it will continue to decline. Gasoline consumption in the U.S. probably peaked in      and is declining. So oil is playing a less significant role every year. And so     years ago  there was a peak oil  just like  in the     s  there was a peak coal  and a hundred years before that  there was a peak wood. This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems. And what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades  Well  a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear  for starters. And what goes on in the future  Well  I think out ahead of us a few decades is peak gas  and beyond that  peak renewables. Now  I'll tell you another little  very important story about this picture. Now  I'm not pretending that energy use in total isn't increasing  it is    that's another part of the story. Come talk to me about it  we'll fill in some of the details    but there's a very important message here  This is     years of history  and for     years we've been systematically decarbonizing our energy system. Energy systems of the world becoming progressively    year on year  decade on decade  century on century    becoming less carbon intense. And that continues into the future with the renewables that we're developing today  reaching maybe    percent of primary energy by mid century. Now that might be the end of the story    Okay  we just replace it all with conventional renewables    but I think  actually  there's more to the story than that. And to tell the next part of the story    and this is looking out say      and beyond. What is the future of truly sustainable  carbon free energy  Well  we have to take a little excursion  and we'll start in central Texas. Here's a piece of limestone. I picked it up outside of Marble Falls  Texas. It's about     million years old. And it's just limestone  nothing really special about it. Now  here's a piece of chalk. I picked this up at MIT. It's a little younger. And it's different than this limestone  you can see that. You wouldn't build a building out of this stuff  and you wouldn't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this. Yeah  it's very different    no  it's not different. It's not different  it's the same stuff  calcium carbonate  calcium carbonate. What's different is how the molecules are put together. Now  if you think that's kind of neat  the story gets really neat right now. Off the coast of California comes this  It's an abalone shell. Now  millions of abalone every year make this shell. Oh  by the way  just in case you weren't already guessing  it's calcium carbonate. It's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this. But it's not the same stuff  it's different. It's thousands of times  maybe       times tougher than this. And why  Because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers  making this beautiful  iridescent mother of pearl. Very specialized material that the abalone self assembles  millions of abalone  all the time  every day  every year. This is pretty incredible stuff. All the same  what's different  How the molecules are put together. Now  what does this have to do with energy  Here's a piece of coal. And I'll suggest that this coal is about as exciting as this chalk. Now  whether we're talking about fuels or energy carriers  or perhaps novel materials for batteries or fuel cells  nature hasn't ever built those perfect materials yet because nature didn't need to. Nature didn't need to because  unlike the abalone shell  the survival of a species didn't depend on building those materials  until maybe now when it might just matter. So  when we think about the future of energy  imagine what would it be like if instead of this  we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently. And so that is my story. The oil will never run out. It's not because we have a lot of it. It's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills. It's because  well  thousands of years ago  people invented ideas    they had ideas  innovations  technology    and the Stone Age ended  not because we ran out of stones. It's ideas  it's innovation  it's technology that will end the age of oil  long before we run out of oil. Thank you very much. We're here today to announce the first synthetic cell  a cell made by starting with the digital code in the computer  building the chromosome from four bottles of chemicals  assembling that chromosome in yeast  transplanting it into a recipient bacterial cell and transforming that cell into a new bacterial species. So this is the first self replicating species that we've had on the planet whose parent is a computer. It also is the first species to have its own website encoded in its genetic code. But we'll talk more about the watermarks in a minute. This is a project that had its inception    years ago when our team then    we called the institute TIGR    was involved in sequencing the first two genomes in history. We did Haemophilus influenzae and then the smallest genome of a self replicating organism  that of Mycoplasma genitalium. And as soon as we had these two sequences we thought  if this is supposed to be the smallest genome of a self replicating species  could there be even a smaller genome  Could we understand the basis of cellular life at the genetic level  It's been a    year quest just to get to the starting point now to be able to answer those questions  because it's very difficult to eliminate multiple genes from a cell. You can only do them one at a time. We decided early on that we had to take a synthetic route  even though nobody had been there before  to see if we could synthesize a bacterial chromosome so we could actually vary the gene content to understand the essential genes for life. That started our    year quest to get here. But before we did the first experiments  we actually asked Art Caplan's team at the University of Pennsylvania to undertake a review of what the risks  the challenges  the ethics around creating new species in the laboratory were because it hadn't been done before. They spent about two years reviewing that independently and published their results in Science in     . Ham and I took two years off as a side project to sequence the human genome  but as soon as that was done we got back to the task at hand. In       we started a new institute  the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives  where we set out two goals  One  to understand the impact of our technology on the environment  and how to understand the environment better  and two  to start down this process of making synthetic life to understand basic life. In       we published our first success. So Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison developed some new methods for making error free DNA at a small level. Our first task was a       letter code bacteriophage  a virus that attacks only E. coli. So that was the phage phi X      which was chosen for historical reasons. It was the first DNA phage  DNA virus  DNA genome that was actually sequenced. So once we realized that we could make       base pair viral sized pieces  we thought  we at least have the means then to try and make serially lots of these pieces to be able to eventually assemble them together to make this mega base chromosome. So  substantially larger than we even thought we would go initially. There were several steps to this. There were two sides  We had to solve the chemistry for making large DNA molecules  and we had to solve the biological side of how  if we had this new chemical entity  how would we boot it up  activate it in a recipient cell. We had two teams working in parallel  one team on the chemistry  and the other on trying to be able to transplant entire chromosomes to get new cells. When we started this out  we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem  which is why we chose the smallest genome. And some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome to a much larger one. And we can walk through the reasons for that  but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from  whereas the larger  faster growing cell takes only two days. So there's only so many cycles we could go through in a year at six weeks per cycle. And you should know that basically     probably    percent plus of our experiments failed. So this was a debugging  problem solving scenario from the beginning because there was no recipe of how to get there. So  one of the most important publications we had was in     . Carole Lartigue led the effort to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome from one bacteria to another. I think philosophically  that was one of the most important papers that we've ever done because it showed how dynamic life was. And we knew  once that worked  that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those. We didn't know that it was going to take us several years more to get there. In       we reported the complete synthesis of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome  a little over         letters of genetic code  but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome. We think in part  because of its slow growth and  in part  cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms to keep these events from happening. It turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into had a nuclease  an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface  and was happy to eat the synthetic DNA that we gave it and never got transplantations. But at the time  that was the largest molecule of a defined structure that had been made. And so both sides were progressing  but part of the synthesis had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished using yeast  putting the fragments in yeast and yeast would assemble these for us. It's an amazing step forward  but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast. So in addition to doing the transplant  we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome out of the eukaryotic yeast into a form where we could transplant it into a recipient cell. So our team developed new techniques for actually growing  cloning entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast. So we took the same mycoides genome that Carole had initially transplanted  and we grew that in yeast as an artificial chromosome. And we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them. When we did these experiments  though  we could get the chromosome out of yeast but it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell. That little issue took the team two years to solve. It turns out  the DNA in the bacterial cell was actually methylated  and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme  from digesting the DNA. So what we found is if we took the chromosome out of yeast and methylated it  we could then transplant it. Further advances came when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes from the recipient capricolum cell. And once we had done that  now we can take naked DNA out of yeast and transplant it. So last fall when we published the results of that work in Science  we all became overconfident and were sure we were only a few weeks away from being able to now boot up a chromosome out of yeast. Because of the problems with Mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth about a year and a half ago  we decided to synthesize the much larger chromosome  the mycoides chromosome  knowing that we had the biology worked out on that for transplantation. And Dan led the team for the synthesis of this over one million base pair chromosome. But it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end  and it set us back three months because we had one error out of over a million base pairs in that sequence. So the team developed new debugging software  where we could test each synthetic fragment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type DNA. And we found that    out of the            base pair pieces we synthesized were completely accurate and compatible with a life forming sequence. We narrowed it down to one fragment  we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene. So accuracy is essential. There's parts of the genome where it cannot tolerate even a single error  and then there's parts of the genome where we can put in large blocks of DNA  as we did with the watermarks  and it can tolerate all kinds of errors. So it took about three months to find that error and repair it. And then early one morning  at   a.m. we got a text from Dan saying that  now  the first blue colonies existed. So  it's been a long route to get here     years from the beginning. We felt one of the tenets of this field was to make absolutely certain we could distinguish synthetic DNA from natural DNA. Early on  when you're working in a new area of science  you have to think about all the pitfalls and things that could lead you to believe that you had done something when you hadn't  and  even worse  leading others to believe it. So  we thought the worst problem would be a single molecule contamination of the native chromosome  leading us to believe that we actually had created a synthetic cell  when it would have been just a contaminant. So early on  we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the DNA to absolutely make clear that the DNA was synthetic. And the first chromosome we built in         the         base pair one    we simply assigned the names of the authors of the chromosome into the genetic code  but it was using just amino acid single letter translations  which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet. So the team actually developed a new code within the code within the code. So it's a new code for interpreting and writing messages in DNA. Now  mathematicians have been hiding and writing messages in the genetic code for a long time  but it's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists because  if you write long messages with the code that the mathematicians developed  it would more than likely lead to new proteins being synthesized with unknown functions. So the code that Mike Montague and the team developed actually puts frequent stop codons  so it's a different alphabet but allows us to use the entire English alphabet with punctuation and numbers. So  there are four major watermarks all over       base pairs of genetic code. The first one actually contains within it this code for interpreting the rest of the genetic code. So in the remaining information  in the watermarks  contain the names of  I think it's    different authors and key contributors to getting the project to this stage. And we also built in a website address so that if somebody decodes the code within the code within the code  they can send an email to that address. So it's clearly distinguishable from any other species  having    names in it  its own web address. And we added three quotations  because with the first genome we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound than just signing the work. So we won't give the rest of the code  but we will give the three quotations. The first is   To live  to err  to fall  to triumph and to recreate life out of life.  It's a James Joyce quote. The second quotation is   See things not as they are  but as they might be.  It's a quote from the  American Prometheus  book on Robert Oppenheimer. And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote   What I cannot build  I cannot understand.  So  because this is as much a philosophical advance as a technical advance in science  we tried to deal with both the philosophical and the technical side. The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions is that the extensive work that we've done    asking for ethical review  pushing the envelope on that side as well as the technical side    this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community  in the policy community and at the highest levels of the federal government. Even with this announcement  as we did in         that work was funded by the Department of Energy  so the work was reviewed at the level of the White House  trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it. And they came down on the side of open publication  which is the right approach    we've briefed the White House  we've briefed members of Congress  we've tried to take and push the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advances. So with that  I would like to open it first to the floor for questions. Yes  in the back. Reporter  Could you explain  in layman's terms  how significant a breakthrough this is please  Craig Venter  Can we explain how significant this is  I'm not sure we're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is. It's significant to us. Perhaps it's a giant philosophical change in how we view life. We actually view it as a baby step in terms of  it's taken us    years to be able to do the experiment we wanted to do    years ago on understanding life at its basic level. But we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we're already starting in numerous avenues to use this tool. We have  at the Institute  ongoing funding now from NIH in a program with Novartis to try and use these new synthetic DNA tools to perhaps make the flu vaccine that you might get next year. Because instead of taking weeks to months to make these  Dan's team can now make these in less than    hours. So when you see how long it took to get an H N  vaccine out  we think we can shorten that process quite substantially. In the vaccine area  Synthetic Genomics and the Institute are forming a new vaccine company because we think these tools can affect vaccines to diseases that haven't been possible to date  things where the viruses rapidly evolve  such with rhinovirus. Wouldn't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds  Or  more importantly  HIV  where the virus evolves so quickly the vaccines that are made today can't keep up with those evolutionary changes. Also  at Synthetic Genomics  we've been working on major environmental issues. I think this latest oil spill in the Gulf is a reminder. We can't see CO     we depend on scientific measurements for it and we see the beginning results of having too much of it    but we can see pre CO  now floating on the waters and contaminating the beaches in the Gulf. We need some alternatives for oil. We have a program with Exxon Mobile to try and develop new strains of algae that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources  make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries to make normal gasoline and diesel fuel out of CO . Those are just a couple of the approaches and directions that we're taking. I was here four years ago  and I remember  at the time  that the talks weren't put online. I think they were given to TEDsters in a box  a box set of DVDs  which they put on their shelves  where they are now. And actually  Chris called me a week after I'd given my talk  and said   We're going to start putting them online. Can we put yours online   And I said   Sure.  And four years later  it's been downloaded four million times. So I suppose you could multiply that by    or something to get the number of people who've seen it. And  as Chris says  there is a hunger for videos of me. Don't you feel  So  this whole event has been an elaborate build up to me doing another one for you  so here it is. Al Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate crisis. And I referenced that at the end of my last talk. So I want to pick up from there because I only had    minutes  frankly. So  as I was saying    You see  he's right. I mean  there is a major climate crisis  obviously  and I think if people don't believe it  they should get out more. But I believe there is a second climate crisis  which is as severe  which has the same origins  and that we have to deal with with the same urgency. And you may say  by the way   Look  I'm good. I have one climate crisis  I don't really need the second one.  But this is a crisis of  not natural resources    though I believe that's true    but a crisis of human resources. I believe fundamentally  as many speakers have said during the past few days  that we make very poor use of our talents. Very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be  or if they have any to speak of. I meet all kinds of people who don't think they're really good at anything. Actually  I kind of divide the world into two groups now. Jeremy Bentham  the great utilitarian philosopher  once spiked this argument. He said   There are two types of people in this world  those who divide the world into two types and those who do not.  Well  I do. I meet all kinds of people who don't enjoy what they do. They simply go through their lives getting on with it. They get no great pleasure from what they do. They endure it rather than enjoy it  and wait for the weekend. But I also meet people who love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else. If you said   Don't do this anymore   they'd wonder what you're talking about. It isn't what they do  it's who they are. They say   But this is me  you know. It would be foolish to abandon this  because it speaks to my most authentic self.  And it's not true of enough people. In fact  on the contrary  I think it's still true of a minority of people. And I think there are many possible explanations for it. And high among them is education  because education  in a way  dislocates very many people from their natural talents. And human resources are like natural resources  they're often buried deep. You have to go looking for them  they're not just lying around on the surface. You have to create the circumstances where they show themselves. And you might imagine education would be the way that happens  but too often  it's not. Every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment and it's not enough. Reform is no use anymore  because that's simply improving a broken model. What we need    and the word's been used many times in the past few days    is not evolution  but a revolution in education. This has to be transformed into something else. One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education. Innovation is hard  because it means doing something that people don't find very easy  for the most part. It means challenging what we take for granted  things that we think are obvious. The great problem for reform or transformation is the tyranny of common sense. Things that people think   It can't be done differently  that's how it's done.  I came across a great quote recently from Abraham Lincoln  who I thought you'd be pleased to have quoted at this point. He said this in December      to the second annual meeting of Congress. I ought to explain that I have no idea what was happening at the time. We don't teach American history in Britain. We suppress it. You know  this is our policy. No doubt  something fascinating was happening then  which the Americans among us will be aware of. But he said this   The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty  and we must rise with the occasion.  I love that. Not rise to it  rise with it.  As our case is new  so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves  and then we shall save our country.  I love that word   disenthrall.  You know what it means  That there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to  which we simply take for granted as the natural order of things  the way things are. And many of our ideas have been formed  not to meet the circumstances of this century  but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries. But our minds are still hypnotized by them  and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them. Now  doing this is easier said than done. It's very hard to know  by the way  what it is you take for granted. And the reason is that you take it for granted. Let me ask you something you may take for granted. How many of you here are over the age of     That's not what you take for granted  I'm sure you're familiar with that. Are there any people here under the age of     Great. Now  those over     could you put your hands up if you're wearing your wristwatch  Now that's a great deal of us  isn't it  Ask a room full of teenagers the same thing. Teenagers do not wear wristwatches. I don't mean they can't  they just often choose not to. And the reason is we were brought up in a pre digital culture  those of us over   . And so for us  if you want to know the time  you have to wear something to tell it. Kids now live in a world which is digitized  and the time  for them  is everywhere. They see no reason to do this. And by the way  you don't need either  it's just that you've always done it and you carry on doing it. My daughter never wears a watch  my daughter Kate  who's   . She doesn't see the point. As she says   It's a single function device.   Like  how lame is that   And I say   No  no  it tells the date as well.   It has multiple functions.  But  you see  there are things we're enthralled to in education. A couple of examples. One of them is the idea of linearity  that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right  you will end up set for the rest of your life. Everybody who's spoken at TED has told us implicitly  or sometimes explicitly  a different story  that life is not linear  it's organic. We create our lives symbiotically as we explore our talents in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us. But  you know  we have become obsessed with this linear narrative. And probably the pinnacle for education is getting you to college. I think we are obsessed with getting people to college. Certain sorts of college. I don't mean you shouldn't go  but not everybody needs to go  or go now. Maybe they go later  not right away. And I was up in San Francisco a while ago doing a book signing. There was this guy buying a book  he was in his   s. I said   What do you do   And he said   I'm a fireman.  I asked   How long have you been a fireman    Always. I've always been a fireman.   Well  when did you decide   He said   As a kid. Actually  it was a problem for me at school  because at school  everybody wanted to be a fireman.  He said   But I wanted to be a fireman.  And he said   When I got to the senior year of school  my teachers didn't take it seriously. This one teacher didn't take it seriously. He said I was throwing my life away if that's all I chose to do with it  that I should go to college  I should become a professional person  that I had great potential and I was wasting my talent to do that.  He said   It was humiliating. It was in front of the whole class and I felt dreadful. But it's what I wanted  and as soon as I left school  I applied to the fire service and I was accepted. You know  I was thinking about that guy recently  just a few minutes ago when you were speaking  about this teacher  because six months ago  I saved his life.  He said   He was in a car wreck  and I pulled him out  gave him CPR  and I saved his wife's life as well.  He said   I think he thinks better of me now.  You know  to me  human communities depend upon a diversity of talent  not a singular conception of ability. And at the heart of our challenges    At the heart of the challenge is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence. This linearity thing is a problem. When I arrived in L.A. about nine years ago  I came across a policy statement    very well intentioned    which said   College begins in kindergarten.  No  it doesn't. It doesn't. If we had time  I could go into this  but we don't. Kindergarten begins in kindergarten. A friend of mine once said   A three year old is not half a six year old.  They're three. But as we just heard in this last session  there's such competition now to get into kindergarten    to get to the right kindergarten    that people are being interviewed for it at three. Kids sitting in front of unimpressed panels  you know  with their resumes    Flicking through and saying   What  this is it    You've been around for    months  and this is it    You've achieved nothing    commit. Spent the first six months breastfeeding  I can see.  See  it's outrageous as a conception. The other big issue is conformity. We have built our education systems on the model of fast food. This is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day. There are two models of quality assurance in catering. One is fast food  where everything is standardized. The other is like Zagat and Michelin restaurants  where everything is not standardized  they're customized to local circumstances. And we have sold ourselves into a fast food model of education  and it's impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies. We have to recognize a couple of things here. One is that human talent is tremendously diverse. People have very different aptitudes. I worked out recently that I was given a guitar as a kid at about the same time that Eric Clapton got his first guitar. It worked out for Eric  that's all I'm saying. In a way    it did not for me. I could not get this thing to work no matter how often or how hard I blew into it. It just wouldn't work. But it's not only about that. It's about passion. Often  people are good at things they don't really care for. It's about passion  and what excites our spirit and our energy. And if you're doing the thing that you love to do  that you're good at  time takes a different course entirely. My wife's just finished writing a novel  and I think it's a great book  but she disappears for hours on end. You know this  if you're doing something you love  an hour feels like five minutes. If you're doing something that doesn't resonate with your spirit  five minutes feels like an hour. And the reason so many people are opting out of education is because it doesn't feed their spirit  it doesn't feed their energy or their passion. So I think we have to change metaphors. We have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education  a manufacturing model  which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people. We have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture. We have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process  it's an organic process. And you cannot predict the outcome of human development. All you can do  like a farmer  is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish. So when we look at reforming education and transforming it  it isn't like cloning a system. There are great ones  like KIPP's  it's a great system. There are many great models. It's about customizing to your circumstances and personalizing education to the people you're actually teaching. And doing that  I think  is the answer to the future because it's not about scaling a new solution  it's about creating a movement in education in which people develop their own solutions  but with external support based on a personalized curriculum. Now in this room  there are people who represent extraordinary resources in business  in multimedia  in the Internet. These technologies  combined with the extraordinary talents of teachers  provide an opportunity to revolutionize education. And I urge you to get involved in it because it's vital  not just to ourselves  but to the future of our children. But we have to change from the industrial model to an agricultural model  where each school can be flourishing tomorrow. That's where children experience life. Or at home  if that's what they choose  to be educated with their families or friends. There's been a lot of talk about dreams over the course of these few days. And I wanted to just very quickly    I was very struck by Natalie Merchant's songs last night  recovering old poems. I wanted to read you a quick  very short poem from W. B. Yeats  who some of you may know. He wrote this to his love  Maud Gonne  and he was bewailing the fact that he couldn't really give her what he thought she wanted from him. And he says   I've got something else  but it may not be for you.  He says this   Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths  Enwrought with gold and silver light  The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and the half light  I would spread the cloths under your feet  But I  being poor  have only my dreams  I have spread my dreams under your feet  Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.  And every day  everywhere  our children spread their dreams beneath our feet. And we should tread softly. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. I heard this amazing story about Miuccia Prada. She's an Italian fashion designer. She goes to this vintage store in Paris with a friend of hers. She's rooting around  she finds this one jacket by Balenciaga    she loves it. She's turning it inside out. She's looking at the seams. She's looking at the construction. Her friend says   Buy it already.  She said   I'll buy it  but I'm also going to replicate it.  Now  the academics in this audience may think   Well  that sounds like plagiarism.  But to a fashionista  what it really is is a sign of Prada's genius  that she can root through the history of fashion and pick the one jacket that doesn't need to be changed by one iota  and to be current and to be now. You might also be asking whether it's possible that this is illegal for her to do this. Well  it turns out that it's actually not illegal. In the fashion industry  there's very little intellectual property protection. They have trademark protection  but no copyright protection and no patent protection to speak of. All they have  really  is trademark protection  and so it means that anybody could copy any garment on any person in this room and sell it as their own design. The only thing that they can't copy is the actual trademark label within that piece of apparel. That's one reason that you see logos splattered all over these products. It's because it's a lot harder for knock off artists to knock off these designs because they can't knock off the logo. But if you go to Santee Alley  yeah. Canal Street  I know. And sometimes these are fun  right  Now  the reason for this  the reason that the fashion industry doesn't have any copyright protection is because the courts decided long ago that apparel is too utilitarian to qualify for copyright protection. They didn't want a handful of designers owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing. And then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleeve because Joe Blow owns it. But too utilitarian  I mean is that the way you think of fashion  This is Vivienne Westwood. No  We think of it as maybe too silly  too unnecessary. Now  those of you who are familiar with the logic behind copyright protection    which is that without ownership  there is no incentive to innovate    might be really surprised by both the critical success of the fashion industry and the economic success of this industry. What I'm going to argue today is that because there's no copyright protection in the fashion industry  fashion designers have actually been able to elevate utilitarian design  things to cover our naked bodies  into something that we consider art. Because there's no copyright protection in this industry  there's a very open and creative ecology of creativity. Unlike their creative brothers and sisters  who are sculptors or photographers or filmmakers or musicians  fashion designers can sample from all their peers' designs. They can take any element from any garment from the history of fashion and incorporate it into their own design. They're also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist. And here  I suspect  they were influenced by the costumes in Avatar. Maybe just a little. Can't copyright a costume either. Now  fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry. This wedding dress here is actually made of sporks  and this dress is actually made of aluminum. I've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes as they walk through. So  one of the magical side effects of having a culture of copying  which is really what it is  is the establishment of trends. People think this is a magical thing. How does it happen  Well  it's because it's legal for people to copy one another. Some people believe that there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain who sort of dictate to us what we're all going to wear  but if you talk to any designer at any level  including these high end designers  they always say their main inspiration comes from the street  where people like you and me remix and match our own fashion looks. And that's where they really get a lot of their creative inspiration  so it's both a top down and a bottom up kind of industry. Now  the fast fashion giants have probably benefited the most from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry. They are notorious for knocking off high end designs and selling them at very low prices. And they've been faced with a lot of lawsuits  but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers. The courts have said over and over again   You don't need any more intellectual property protection.  When you look at copies like this  you wonder  How do the luxury high end brands remain in business  If you can get it for     bucks  why pay a thousand  Well  that's one reason we had a conference here at USC a few years ago. We invited Tom Ford to come    the conference was called   Ready to Share  Fashion and the Ownership of Creativity     and we asked him exactly this question. Here's what he had to say. He had just come off a successful stint as the lead designer at Gucci  in case you didn't know. Tom Ford  And we found after much research that    actually not much research  quite simple research    that the counterfeit customer was not our customer. Johanna Blakley  Imagine that. The people on Santee Alley are not the ones who shop at Gucci. This is a very different demographic. And  you know  a knock off is never the same as an original high end design  at least in terms of the materials  they're always made of cheaper materials. But even sometimes a cheaper version can actually have some charming aspects  can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend. There's lots of virtues of copying. One that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to is that we now have a much broader palette of design choices to choose from than we ever have before  and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry  actually. And this is a good thing. We need lots of options. Fashion  whether you like it or not  helps you project who you are to the world. Because of fast fashion  global trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to. And this  actually  is good news to trendsetters  they want trends to be set so that they can move product. For fashionistas  they want to stay ahead of the curve. They don't want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing. And so  they want to move on to the next trend as soon as possible. I tell you  there is no rest for the fashionable. Every season  these designers have to struggle to come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody's going to love. And this  let me tell you  is very good for the bottom line. Now of course  there's a bunch of effects that this culture of copying has on the creative process. And Stuart Weitzman is a very successful shoe designer. He has complained a lot about people copying him  but in one interview I read  he said it has really forced him to up his game. He had to come up with new ideas  new things that would be hard to copy. He came up with this Bowden wedge heel that has to be made out of steel or titanium  if you make it from some sort of cheaper material  it'll actually crack in two. It forced him to be a little more innovative.  Music  And that actually reminded me of jazz great  Charlie Parker. I don't know if you've heard this anecdote  but I have. He said that one of the reasons he invented bebop was that he was pretty sure that white musicians wouldn't be able to replicate the sound.  Laughter  He wanted to make it too difficult to copy  and that's what fashion designers are doing all the time. They're trying to put together a signature look  an aesthetic that reflects who they are. When people knock it off  everybody knows because they've put that look out on the runway  and it's a coherent aesthetic. I love these Gallianos. Okay  we'll move on.  Laughter  This is not unlike the world of comedy. I don't know if you know that jokes also can't be copyright protected. So when one liners were really popular  everybody stole them from one another. But now  we have a different kind of comic. They develop a persona  a signature style  much like fashion designers. And their jokes  much like the fashion designs by a fashion designer  really only work within that aesthetic. If somebody steals a joke from Larry David  for instance  it's not as funny. Now  the other thing that fashion designers have done to survive in this culture of copying is they've learned how to copy themselves. They knock themselves off. They make deals with the fast fashion giants and they come up with a way to sell their product to a whole new demographic  the Santee Alley demographic. Now  some fashion designers will say   It's only in the United States that we don't have any respect. In other countries there is protection for our artful designs.  But if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world  it turns out that the protection that's offered is really ineffectual. In Japan  for instance  which I think is the third largest market  they have a design law  it protects apparel  but the novelty standard is so high  you have to prove that your garment has never existed before  it's totally unique. And that's sort of like the novelty standard for a U.S. patent  which fashion designers never get    rarely get here in the states. In the European Union  they went in the other direction. Very low novelty standard  anybody can register anything. But even though it's the home of the fast fashion industry and you have a lot of luxury designers there  they don't register their garments  generally  and there's not a lot of litigation. It turns out it's because the novelty standard is too low. A person can come in and take somebody else's gown  cut off three inches from the bottom  go to the E.U. and register it as a new  original design. So  that does not stop the knock off artists. If you look at the registry  actually  a lot of the registered things in the E.U. are Nike T shirts that are almost identical to one another. But this has not stopped Diane von Furstenberg. She is the head of the Council of Fashion Designers of America  and she has told her constituency that she is going to get copyright protection for fashion designs. The retailers have kind of quashed this notion though. I don't think the legislation is going anywhere  because they realized it is so hard to tell the difference between a pirated design and something that's just part of a global trend. Who owns a look  That is a very difficult question to answer. It takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time  and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive. You know  it's not just the fashion industry that doesn't have copyright protection. There's a bunch of other industries that don't have copyright protection  including the food industry. You cannot copyright a recipe because it's a set of instructions  it's fact  and you cannot copyright the look and feel of even the most unique dish. Same with automobiles. It doesn't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look  you cannot copyright the sculptural design. It's a utilitarian article  that's why. Same with furniture  it's too utilitarian. Magic tricks  I think they're instructions  sort of like recipes  no copyright protection. Hairdos  no copyright protection. Open source software  these guys decided they didn't want copyright protection. They thought it'd be more innovative without it. It's really hard to get copyright for databases. Tattoo artists  they don't want it  it's not cool. They share their designs. Jokes  no copyright protection. Fireworks displays  the rules of games  the smell of perfume  no. And some of these industries may seem sort of marginal to you  but these are the gross sales for low I.P. industries  industries with very little copyright protection  and there's the gross sales of films and books. It ain't pretty. So you talk to people in the fashion industry and they're like   Shhh  Don't tell anybody we can actually steal from each other's designs. It's embarrassing.  But you know what  It's revolutionary  and it's a model that a lot of other industries    like the ones we just saw with the really small bars    they might have to think about this. Because right now  those industries with a lot of copyright protection are operating in an atmosphere where it's as if they don't have any protection  and they don't know what to do. When I found out that there are a whole bunch of industries that didn't have copyright protection  I thought   What exactly is the underlying logic  I want a picture.  And the lawyers do not provide a picture  so I made one. These are the two main sort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law. It is more complex than this  but this will do. First  Is something an artistic object  Then it deserves protection. Is it a utilitarian object  Then no  it does not deserve protection. This is a difficult  unstable binary. The other one is  Is it an idea  Is it something that needs to freely circulate in a free society  No protection. Or is it a physically fixed expression of an idea  something that somebody made and they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it  The problem is that digital technology has completely subverted the logic of this physically fixed  expression versus idea concept. Nowadays  we don't really recognize a book as something that sits on our shelf or music as something that is a physical object that we can hold. It's a digital file. It is barely tethered to any sort of physical reality in our minds. And these things  because we can copy and transmit them so easily  actually circulate within our culture a lot more like ideas than like physically instantiated objects. Now  the conceptual issues are truly profound when you talk about creativity and ownership and  let me tell you  we don't want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out. They're smart. I'm with one. He's my boyfriend  he's okay. He's smart  he's smart. But you want an interdisciplinary team of people hashing this out  trying to figure out  What is the kind of ownership model  in a digital world  that's going to lead to the most innovation  And my suggestion is that fashion might be a really good place to start looking for a model for creative industries in the future.

Thank you so much.  Applause  Today  I want you to look at children who become suicide bombers through a completely different lens. In       there were     bomb blasts across Pakistan. I spent the year working with children who were training to become suicide bombers and with Taliban recruiters  trying to understand how the Taliban were converting these children into live ammunition and why these children were actively signing up to their cause. I want you to watch a short video from my latest documentary film   Children of the Taliban.  The Taliban now run their own schools. They target poor families and convince the parents to send their children. In return  they provide free food and shelter and sometimes pay the families a monthly stipend. We've obtained a propaganda video made by the Taliban. Young boys are taught justifications for suicide attacks and the execution of spies. I made contact with a child from Swat who studied in a madrassa like this. Hazrat Ali is from a poor farming family in Swat. He joined the Taliban a year ago when he was   . How do the Taliban in your area get people to join them  Hazrat Ali  They first call us to the mosque and preach to us. Then they take us to a madrassa and teach us things from the Koran. Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy  He tells me that children are then given months of military training. HA  They teach us to use machine guns  Kalashnikov  rocket launchers  grenades  bombs. They ask us to use them only against the infidels. Then they teach us to do a suicide attack. SOC  Would you like to carry out a suicide attack  HA  If God gives me strength. SOC  I  in my research  have seen that the Taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children  and I think it's a five step process. Step one is that the Taliban prey on families that are large  that are poor  that live in rural areas. They separate the parents from the children by promising to provide food  clothing  shelter to these children. Then they ship them off  hundreds of miles away to hard line schools that run along the Taliban agenda. Step two  They teach the children the Koran  which is Islam's holiest book  in Arabic  a language these children do not understand and cannot speak. They rely very heavily on teachers  who I have personally seen distort the message to these children as and when it suits their purpose to. These children are explicitly forbidden from reading newspapers  listening to radio  reading any books that the teachers do not prescribe them. If any child is found violating these rules  he is severely reprimanded. Effectively  the Taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information for these children. Step three  The Taliban want these children to hate the world that they currently live in. So they beat these children    I have seen it  they feed them twice a day dried bread and water  they rarely allow them to play games  they tell them that  for eight hours at a time  all they have to do is read the Koran. The children are virtual prisoners  they cannot leave  they cannot go home. Their parents are so poor  they have no resources to get them back. Step four  The older members of the Taliban  the fighters  start talking to the younger boys about the glories of martyrdom. They talk to them about how when they die  they will be received up with lakes of honey and milk  how there will be    virgins waiting for them in paradise  how there will be unlimited food  and how this glory is going to propel them to become heroes in their neighborhoods. Effectively  this is the brainwashing process that has begun. Step five  I believe the Taliban have one of the most effective means of propaganda. Their videos that they use are intercut with photographs of men and women and children dying in Iraq and Afghanistan and in Pakistan. And the basic message is that the Western powers do not care about civilian deaths  so those people who live in areas and support governments that work with Western powers are fair game. That's why Pakistani civilians  over       of whom have been killed in the last two years alone  are fair game. Now these children are primed to become suicide bombers. They're ready to go out and fight because they've been told that this is effectively their only way to glorify Islam. I want you to watch another excerpt from the film. This boy is called Zenola. He blew himself up  killing six. This boy is called Sadik. He killed   . This boy is called Messoud. He killed   . The Taliban are running suicide schools  preparing a generation of boys for atrocities against civilians. Do you want to carry out a suicide attack  Boy  I would love to. But only if I get permission from my dad. When I look at suicide bombers younger than me  or my age  I get so inspired by their terrific attacks. SOC  What blessing would you get from carrying out a suicide attack  Boy  On the day of judgment  God will ask me   Why did you do that   I will answer   My Lord  Only to make you happy  I have laid down my life fighting the infidels.  Then God will look at my intention. If my intention was to eradicate evil for Islam  then I will be rewarded with paradise. Singer    On the day of judgment     My God will call me     My body will be put back together     And God will ask me why I did this   SOC  I leave you all with this thought  If you grew up in these circumstances  faced with these choices  would you choose to live in this world or in the glorious afterlife  As one Taliban recruiter told me   There will always be sacrificial lambs in this war.  Thank you. Do you worry about what is going to kill you  Heart disease  cancer  a car accident  Most of us worry about things we can't control  like war  terrorism  the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti. But what really threatens humanity  A few years ago  Professor Vaclav Smil tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history. He called these   massively fatal discontinuities   meaning that they could kill up to     million people in the next    years. He looked at the odds of another world war  of a massive volcanic eruption  even of an asteroid hitting the Earth. But he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to     percent  and that is a severe flu pandemic. Now  you might think of flu as just a really bad cold  but it can be a death sentence. Every year         people in the United States die of seasonal flu. In the developing world  the data is much sketchier but the death toll is almost certainly higher. You know  the problem is if this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically  it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic. In       a new virus appeared that killed some    to     million people. It spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms. Are we safer today  Well  we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared  but this threat could reappear at any time. The good news is that we're at a moment in time when science  technology  globalization is converging to create an unprecedented possibility  the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one fifth of all deaths and countless misery on Earth. We can do this. We're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines  and if we get these to more people  we can certainly save more lives. But with new or better vaccines for malaria  TB  HIV  pneumonia  diarrhea  flu  we could end suffering that has been on the Earth since the beginning of time. So  I'm here to trumpet vaccines for you. But first  I have to explain why they're important because vaccines  the power of them  is really like a whisper. When they work  they can make history  but after a while you can barely hear them. Now  some of us are old enough to have a small  circular scar on our arms from an inoculation we received as children. But when was the last time you worried about smallpox  a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us  Or polio  How many of you remember the iron lung  We don't see scenes like this anymore because of vaccines. Now  it's interesting because there are    odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now  but we're still threatened by things like HIV and flu. Why is that  Well  here's the dirty little secret. Until recently  we haven't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked. We knew they worked through old fashioned trial and error. You took a pathogen  you modified it  you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened. This worked well for most pathogens  somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu  but not at all for HIV  for which humans have no natural immunity. So let's explore how vaccines work. They basically create a cache of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed. Now  when you get a viral infection  what normally happens is it takes days or weeks for your body to fight back at full strength  and that might be too late. When you're pre immunized  what happens is you have forces in your body pre trained to recognize and defeat specific foes. So that's really how vaccines work. Now  let's take a look at a video that we're debuting at TED  for the first time  on how an effective HIV vaccine might work. Narrator  A vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader. After HIV penetrates the body's mucosal barriers  it infects immune cells to replicate. The invader draws the attention of the immune system's front line troops. Dendritic cells  or macrophages  capture the virus and display pieces of it. Memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine are activated when they learn HIV is present from the front line troops. These memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed. Memory B cells turn into plasma cells  which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch onto HIV to prevent it from infecting cells  while squadrons of killer T cells seek out and destroy cells that are already HIV infected. The virus is defeated. Without a vaccine  these responses would have taken more than a week. By that time  the battle against HIV would already have been lost. Seth Berkley  Really cool video  isn't it  The antibodies you just saw in this video  in action  are the ones that make most vaccines work. So the real question then is  How do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and HIV  The principal challenge for both of these viruses is that they're always changing. So let's take a look at the flu virus. In this rendering of the flu virus  these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you. And also  what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus. When these mutate  they change their shape  and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore. So that's why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu. It's also why in the spring  we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year  put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall. Even worse  the most common influenza    influenza A    also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans  and they can recombine in those particular animals. In addition  wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza. So  you've got this situation  In       we had an H N  virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated cases with an apparent mortality rate of    percent. Now luckily  that particular virus  although very scary at the time  did not transmit from person to person very easily. This year's H N  threat was actually a human  avian  swine mixture that arose in Mexico. It was easily transmitted  but  luckily  was pretty mild. And so  in a sense  our luck is holding out  but you know  another wild bird could fly over at anytime. Now let's take a look at HIV. As variable as flu is  HIV makes flu look like the Rock of Gibraltar. The virus that causes AIDS is the trickiest pathogen scientists have ever confronted. It mutates furiously  it has decoys to evade the immune system  it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome. Here's a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to HIV  a much wilder target. In the video a moment ago  you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells. Now realize that in a recently infected person  there are millions of these ships  each one is just slightly different. Finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder. Now  in the    years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS  we've developed more drugs to treat HIV than all other viruses put together. These drugs aren't cures  but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence from a diagnosis of HIV  at least for those who can access them. The vaccine effort though is really quite different. Large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business. Many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine  but today  evidence tells us otherwise. In September  we had surprising but exciting findings from a clinical trial that took place in Thailand. For the first time  we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans    albeit  quite modestly    and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago. Newer concepts and early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models. But in the past few months  researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of an HIV infected individual. Now  what does this mean  We saw earlier that HIV is highly variable  that a broad neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of the virus. If you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models  they provide full protection from infection. In addition  these researchers found a new site on HIV where the antibodies can grab onto  and what's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates. It's like  as many times as the virus changes its clothes  it's still wearing the same socks  and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks. So what we've got is a situation. The Thai results tell us we can make an AIDS vaccine  and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that. This strategy  working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate  has never been done before in vaccine research. It's called retro vaccinology  and its implications extend way beyond that of just HIV. So think of it this way. We've got these new antibodies we've identified  and we know that they latch onto many  many variations of the virus. We know that they have to latch onto a specific part  so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part  present that through a vaccine  what we hope is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies. And that would create a universal HIV vaccine. Now  it sounds easier than it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site  and as you can imagine  these three dimensional structures are much harder to work on. And if you guys have ideas to help us solve this  we'd love to hear about it. But  you know  the research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases. So for instance  a biotechnology company has now found broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza  as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus. They're currently making a cocktail    an antibody cocktail    that can be used to treat severe  overwhelming cases of flu. In the longer term  what they can do is use these tools of retro vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine. Now  retro vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so called rational vaccine design. Let me give you another example. We talked about before the H and N spikes on the surface of the flu virus. Notice these other  smaller protuberances. These are largely hidden from the immune system. Now it turns out that these spots also don't change much when the virus mutates. If you can cripple these with specific antibodies  you could cripple all versions of the flu. So far  animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease  although you might get a mild case. So if this works in humans  what we're talking about is a universal flu vaccine  one that doesn't need to change every year and would remove the threat of death. We really could think of flu  then  as just a bad cold. Of course  the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it. So to do that  we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and  of course  smart delivery methods. So I want you to think back a few months ago. In June  the World Health Organization declared the first global flu pandemic in    years. The U.S. government promised     million doses of vaccine by October   th for the flu peak. Vaccines were promised to developing countries. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing. So what happened  Well  we first figured out how to make flu vaccines  how to produce them  in the early     s. It was a slow  cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs  millions of living chicken eggs. Viruses only grow in living things  and so it turned out that  for flu  chicken eggs worked really well. For most strains  you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg. Luckily for us  we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances. So today  we get our flu vaccines from ... chicken eggs  hundreds of millions of chicken eggs. Almost nothing has changed. The system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow. This year's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production  basically .  doses per egg. So  here's an alarming thought. What if that wild bird flies by again  You could see an avian strain that would infect the poultry flocks  and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines. So  Dan  Barber   if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm  I know where to get them. So right now  the world can produce about     million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains  and we can up that to about  .  billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu. But this assumes that our factories are humming because  in       the U.S. supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant. And the process still takes more than half a year. So are we better prepared than we were in       Well  with the new technologies emerging now  I hope we can say definitively   Yes.  Imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we're currently spending now in the United States. With a range of new technologies  we could. Here's an example  A company I'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the H spike of flu that sparks the immune system. If you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium  which creates a vigorous immune response  they've created a very powerful flu fighter. This vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria  E. coli. Now  as you know  bacteria reproduce quickly    it's like making yogurt    and so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories  in a few weeks  with no eggs  for a fraction of the cost of current methods. So here's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies. And  aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings    for example  the E. coli method I just talked about    look at the time saved  this would be lives saved. The developing world  mostly left out of the current response  sees the potential of these alternate technologies and they're leapfrogging the West. India  Mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines  and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use. Because these technologies are so efficient and relatively cheap  billions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them. Now think of where this leads us. New infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years. Some day  perhaps soon  we'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us. Will we be quick enough to react before millions die  Luckily  this year's flu was relatively mild. I say   luckily  in part because virtually no one in the developing world was vaccinated. So if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments  we will master these and new tools of vaccinology  and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives. No longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year. No longer does AIDS need to kill two million a year. No longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases  or indeed  anybody. Instead of having Vaclav Smil's  massively fatal discontinuity  of life  we can ensure the continuity of life. What the world needs now are these new vaccines  and we can make it happen. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Thank you. So  the science is changing. In your mind  Seth    I mean  you must dream about this    what is the kind of time scale on  let's start with HIV  for a game changing vaccine that's actually out there and usable  SB  The game change can come at any time  because the problem we have now is we've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans  we just need a better one. And with these types of antibodies  we know humans can make them. So  if we can figure out how to do that  then we have the vaccine  and what's interesting is there already is some evidence that we're beginning to crack that problem. So  the challenge is full speed ahead. CA  In your gut  do you think it's probably going to be at least another five years  SB  You know  everybody says it's    years  but it's been    years every    years. So I hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation  but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends. CA  And that's the same with universal flu vaccine  the same kind of thing  SB  I think flu is different. I think what happened with flu is we've got a bunch    I just showed some of this    a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now. They look good. The problem has been that  what we did is we invested in traditional technologies because that's what we were comfortable with. You also can use adjuvants  which are chemicals you mix. That's what Europe is doing  so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available  but  going back to what Michael Specter said  the anti vaccine crowd didn't really want that to happen. CA  And malaria's even further behind  SB  No  malaria  there is a candidate that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial and is currently in phase three trials now. It probably isn't the perfect vaccine  but it's moving along. CA  Seth  most of us do work where every month  we produce something  we get that kind of gratification. You've been slaving away at this for more than a decade  and I salute you and your colleagues for what you do. The world needs people like you. Thank you. SB  Thank you. I want to talk about what we learn from conservatives. And I'm at a stage in life where I'm yearning for my old days  so I want to confess to you that when I was a kid  indeed  I was a conservative. I was a Young Republican  a Teenage Republican  a leader in the Teenage Republicans. Indeed  I was the youngest member of any delegation in the      convention that elected Ronald Reagan to be the Republican nominee for president. Now  I know what you're thinking. You're thinking   That's not what the Internets say.  You're thinking   Wikipedia doesn't say this fact.  And indeed  this is just one of the examples of the junk that flows across the tubes in these Internets here. Wikipedia reports that this guy  this former congressman from Erie  Pennsylvania was  at the age of     one of the youngest people at the Republican National Convention  but it's just not true. Indeed  it drives me so nuts  let me just change this little fact here. All right. Okay  so ... perfect. Perfect. Okay  speaker Lawrence Lessig  right. Okay. Finally  truth will be brought here. Okay  see  It's done. It's almost done. Here we go.  ... Youngest Republican   okay  we're finished. That's it. Please save this. Great  here we go. And ... Wikipedia is fixed  finally. Okay  but no  this is really besides the point. But the thing I want you to think about when we think about conservatives    not so much this issue of the      convention    the thing to think about is this  They go to church. Now  you know  I mean  a lot of people go to church. I'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church. And I'm not talking about the God thing. I don't want to get into that  you know  that's not my point. They go to church  by which I mean  they do lots of things for free for each other. They hold potluck dinners. Indeed  they sell books about potluck dinners. They serve food to poor people. They share  they give  they give away for free. And it's the very same people leading Wall Street firms who  on Sundays  show up and share. And not only food  right. These very same people are strong believers  in lots of contexts  in the limits on the markets. They are in many important places against markets. Indeed  they  like all of us  celebrate this kind of relationship. But they're very keen that we don't let money drop into that relationship  else it turns into something like this. They want to regulate us  those conservatives  to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places. Because they understand  There are places for the market and places where the market should not exist  where we should be free to enjoy the fellowship of others. They recognize  Both of these things have to live together. And the second great thing about conservatives  they get ecology. Right  it was the first great Republican president of the   th century who taught us about environmental thinking    Teddy Roosevelt. They first taught us about ecology in the context of natural resources. And then they began to teach us in the context of innovation  economics. They understand  in that context   free.  They understand  free  is an important essential part of the cultural ecology as well. That's the thing I want you to think about them. Now  I know you don't believe me  really  here. So here's exhibit number one. I want to share with you my latest hero  Julian Sanchez  a libertarian who works at the  for many people   evil  Cato Institute. Okay  so Julian made this video. He's a terrible producer of videos  but it's great content  so I'm going to give you a little bit of it. So here he is beginning. Julian Sanchez  I'm going to make an observation about the way remix culture seems to be evolving ... Larry Lessig  So what he does is he begins to tell us about these three videos. This is this fantastic Brat Pack remix set to Lisztomania. Which  of course  spread virally. Hugely successful. And then some people from Brooklyn saw it. They decided they wanted to do the same. And then  of course  people from San Fransisco saw it. And San Franciscans thought they had to do the same as well. And so they're beautiful  but this libertarian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this. Here's lesson number one. JS  There's obviously also something really deeply great about this. They are acting in the sense that they're emulating the original mashup. And the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye and some experience with video editing. But this is also basically just a group of friends having an authentic social moment and screwing around together. It should feel familiar and kind of resonate for anyone who's had a sing a long or a dance party with a group of good friends. LL  Or ... JS  So that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at because here  remix isn't just about an individual doing something alone in his basement  it becomes an act of social creativity. And it's not just that it yields a different kind of product at the end  it's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other. All of our normal social interactions become a kind of invitation to this sort of collective expression. It's our real social lives themselves that are transmuted into art. LL  And so then  what this libertarian draws from these two points ... JS  One remix is about individuals using our shared culture as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience. Stage two  social remix  is really about using it to mediate people's relationships to each other. First  within each video  the Brat Pack characters are used as a kind of template for performing the social reality of each group. But there's also a dialogue between the videos  where  once the basic structure is established  it becomes a kind of platform for articulating the similarities and differences between the groups' social and physical worlds. LL  And then  here's for me  the critical key to what Julian has to say ... JS  Copyright policy isn't just about how to incentivize the production of a certain kind of artistic commodity  it's about what level of control we're going to permit to be exercised over our social realities    social realities that are now inevitably permeated by pop culture. I think it's important that we keep these two different kinds of public goods in mind. If we're only focused on how to maximize the supply of one  I think we risk suppressing this different and richer and  in some ways  maybe even more important one. LL  Right. Bingo. Point. Freedom needs this opportunity to both have the commercial success of the great commercial works and the opportunity to build this different kind of culture. And for that to happen  you need ideas like fair use to be central and protected  to enable this kind of innovation  as this libertarian tells us  between these two creative cultures  a commercial and a sharing culture. The point is they  he  here  gets that culture. Now  my concern is  we Dems  too often  not so much. All right  take for example this great company. In the good old days when this Republican ran that company  their greatest work was work that built on the past  right. All of the great Disney works were works that took works that were in the public domain and remixed them  or waited until they entered the public domain to remix them  to celebrate this add on remix creativity. Indeed  Mickey Mouse himself  of course  as  Steamboat Willie   is a remix of the then  very dominant  very popular  Steamboat Bill  by Buster Keaton. This man was a remixer extraordinaire. He is the celebration and ideal of exactly this kind of creativity. But then the company passes through this dark stage to this Democrat. Wildly different. This is the mastermind behind the eventual passage of what we call the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act  extending the term of existing copyrights by    years  so that no one could do to Disney what Disney did to the Brothers Grimm. Now  when we tried to challenge this  going to the Supreme Court  getting the Supreme Court  the bunch of conservatives there    if we could get them to wake up to this    to strike it down  we had the assistance of Nobel Prize winners including this right wing Nobel Prize winner  Milton Friedman  who said he would join our brief only if the word  no brainer  was in the brief somewhere. But apparently  no brains existed in this place when Democrats passed and signed this bill into law. Now  tiny little quibble of a footnote  Sonny Bono  you might say  was a Republican  but I don't buy it. This guy is no Republican. Okay  for a second example  think about this cultural hero  icon on the Left  creator of this character. Look at the site that he built   Star Wars  MashUps  inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon. Read the license. The license for these remixers assigns all of the rights to the remix back to Lucas. The mashup is owned by Lucas. Indeed  anything you add to the mashup  music you might add  Lucas has a worldwide perpetual right to exploit that for free. There is no creator here to be recognized. The creator doesn't have any rights. The creator is a sharecropper in this story. And we should remember who employed the sharecroppers  the Democrats  right  So the point is the Republicans here recognize that there's a certain need of ownership  a respect for ownership  the respect we should give the creator  the remixer  the owner  the property owner  the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff  and not a generation of sharecroppers. Now  I think there are lessons we should learn here  lessons about openness. Our lives are sharing activities  at least in part. Even for the head of Goldman Sachs  at least in part. And for that sharing activity to happen  we have to have well protected spaces of fair use. That's number one. Number two  This ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create. Freedom  which means without permission from anyone  the ability to create. And number three  We need to respect the creator  the creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them. Now  this explains the right wing nonprofit Creative Commons. Actually  it's not a right wing nonprofit  but of course    let me just tie it here    the Creative Commons  which is offering authors this simple way to mark their content with the freedoms they intended to carry. So that we go from a  all rights reserved  world to a  some rights reserved  world so that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content  building and creating on the basis of this creative copyrighted work. These tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a copyright the creator has licensed freely. And it explains the vast right wing conspiracy that's obviously developed around these licenses  as now more than     million digital objects are out there  licensed freely in this way. Now that picture of an ecology of creativity  the picture of an ecology of balanced creativity  is that the ecology of creativity we have right now  Well  as you all know  not many of us believe we do. I tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity just last week. I created a video which was based on a Wireside Chat that I'd given  and I uploaded it to YouTube. I then got this email from YouTube weirdly notifying me that there was content in that owned by the mysterious WMG that matched their content ID. So I didn't think much about it. And then on Twitter  somebody said to me   Your talk on YouTube was DMCA'd. Was that your purpose   imagining that I had this deep conspiracy to reveal the obvious flaws in the DMCA. I answered   No.  I didn't even think about it. But then I went to the site and all of the audio in my site had been silenced. My whole    minute video had been silenced because there were snippets in that video  a video about fair use  that included Warner Music Group music. Now  interestingly  they still sold ads for that music  if you played the silent video. You could still buy the music  but you couldn't hear anything because it had been silenced. So I did what the current regime says I must do to be free to use YouTube to talk about fair use. I went to this site  and I had to answer these questions. And then in an extraordinarily Bart Simpson like  juvenile way you've actually got to type out these words and get them right to reassert your freedom to speak. And I felt like I was in third grade again.  I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair. I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair.  This is absurd. It is outrageous. It is an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom we should be encouraging. And the question I ask you is  Who's fighting it  Well  interestingly  in the last presidential election  who was the number one  active opponent of this system of regulation in online speech  John McCain. Letter after letter attacking YouTube's refusal to be more respectful of fair use with their extraordinary notice and take down system  that led his campaign so many times to be thrown off the Internet. Now  that was the story of me then  my good old days of right wing lunacy. Let me come back to now  now when I'm a little leftist    I'm certainly left handed  so at least a lefty    And I wonder  can we on the Left expect to build this ecology of freedom  now  in a world where we know the extraordinarily powerful influences against it  where even icons of the Left like this entertain and push bills that would effectively ban the requirement of open access for government funded research  The president  who has supported a process that secretly negotiates agreements  which effectively lock us into the insane system of DMCA that we have adopted and likely lock us down a path of three strikes  you're out that  of course  the rest of the world are increasingly adopting. Not a single example of reform has been produced yet. And we're not going to see this change in this system anytime soon. So here's the lessons of openness that I think we need to learn. Openness is a commitment to a certain set of values. We need to speak of those values. The value of freedom. It's a value of community. It's a value of the limits in regulation. It's a value respecting the creator. Now  if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the Right  if we can take them and incorporate them  maybe we could do a little trade. We learn those values on the Left  and maybe they'll do health care or global warming legislation or something in the Right. Anyway  please join me in teaching these values. Thank you very much.
