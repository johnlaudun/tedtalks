I am very  very happy to be amidst some of the most    the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they're reflecting on my glasses. I am very happy and honored to be amidst very  very innovative and intelligent people. I have listened to the three previous speakers  and guess what happened  Every single thing I planned to say  they have said it here  and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say. But there is a saying in my culture that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something  that bud is a young one. So  I will    since I am not young and am very old  I still will say something. We are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment  because another conference is taking place in Berlin. It is the G  Summit. The G  Summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems should be a massive increase in aid  something akin to the Marshall Plan. Unfortunately  I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan. One  because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated. Its largest recipients were Germany and France  and it was only  .  percent of their GDP. An average African country receives foreign aid to the tune of        percent of its GDP  and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries. But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect. How the media covers Africa in the West  and the consequences of that. By displaying despair  helplessness and hopelessness  the media is telling the truth about Africa  and nothing but the truth. However  the media is not telling us the whole truth. Because despair  civil war  hunger and famine  although they're part and parcel of our African reality  they are not the only reality. And secondly  they are the smallest reality. Africa has    nations. We have civil wars only in six countries  which means that the media are covering only six countries. Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate through the web of despair and helplessness that the Western media largely presents to its audience. But the effect of that presentation is  it appeals to sympathy. It appeals to pity. It appeals to something called charity. And  as a consequence  the Western view of Africa's economic dilemma is framed wrongly. The wrong framing is a product of thinking that Africa is a place of despair. What should we do with it  We should give food to the hungry. We should deliver medicines to those who are ill. We should send peacekeeping troops to serve those who are facing a civil war. And in the process  Africa has been stripped of self initiative. I want to say that it is important to recognize that Africa has fundamental weaknesses. But equally  it has opportunities and a lot of potential. We need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa  from a challenge of despair  which is called poverty reduction  to a challenge of hope. We frame it as a challenge of hope  and that is worth creation. The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa is not the challenge of reducing poverty. It should be a challenge of creating wealth. Once we change those two things    if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction  you have the international cartel of good intentions moving onto the continent  with what  Medicines for the poor  food relief for those who are hungry  and peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war. And in the process  none of these things really are productive because you are treating the symptoms  not the causes of Africa's fundamental problems. Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines  ladies and gentlemen  does not create wealth for them. Wealth is a function of income  and income comes from you finding a profitable trading opportunity or a well paying job. Now  once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa  our second challenge will be  who are the wealth creating agents in any society  They are entrepreneurs.  Unclear  told us they are always about four percent of the population  but    percent are imitators. But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship. So  where should we be putting the money  We need to put money where it can productively grow. Support private investment in Africa  both domestic and foreign. Support research institutions  because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation. But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today  They are throwing large sums of money for primary health  for primary education  for food relief. The entire continent has been turned into a place of despair  in need of charity. Ladies and gentlemen  can any one of you tell me a neighbor  a friend  a relative that you know  who became rich by receiving charity  By holding the begging bowl and receiving alms  Does any one of you in the audience have that person  Does any one of you know a country that developed because of the generosity and kindness of another  Well  since I'm not seeing the hand  it appears that what I'm stating is true. Andrew Mwenda  I can see Bono says he knows the country. Which country is that  AM  Thank you very much. But let me tell you this. External actors can only present to you an opportunity. The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage depends on your internal capacity. Africa has received many opportunities. Many of them we haven't benefited much. Why  Because we lack the internal  institutional framework and policy framework that can make it possible for us to benefit from our external relations. I'll give you an example. Under the Cotonou Agreement  formerly known as the Lome Convention  African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe to export goods  duty free  to the European Union market. My own country  Uganda  has a quota to export        metric tons of sugar to the European Union market. We haven't exported one kilogram yet. We import        metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba. Secondly  under the beef protocol of that agreement  African countries that produce beef have quotas to export beef duty free to the European Union market. None of those countries  including Africa's most successful nation  Botswana  has ever met its quota. So  I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa's inability to engage the rest of the world in a more productive relationship is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework. And all forms of intervention need support  the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth  the kinds of institutions that increase productivity. How do we begin to do that  and why is aid the bad instrument  Aid is the bad instrument  and do you know why  Because all governments across the world need money to survive. Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order. You have to pay the army and the police to show law and order. And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial  they need really to have the army clobber the opposition. The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers on. Why should people support their government  Well  because it gives them good  paying jobs  or  in many African countries  unofficial opportunities to profit from corruption. The fact is no government in the world  with the exception of a few  like that of Idi Amin  can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule. Many countries in the  unclear   they need legitimacy. To get legitimacy  governments often need to deliver things like primary education  primary health  roads  build hospitals and clinics. If the government's fiscal survival depends on it having to raise money from its own people  such a government is driven by self interest to govern in a more enlightened fashion. It will sit with those who create wealth. Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business so that it can collect more tax revenues from them. The problem with the African continent and the problem with the aid industry is that it has distorted the structure of incentives facing the governments in Africa. The productive margin in our governments' search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy  it lies with international donors. Rather than sit with Ugandan    rather than sit with Ugandan entrepreneurs  Ghanaian businessmen  South African enterprising leaders  our governments find it more productive to talk to the IMF and the World Bank. I can tell you  even if you have ten Ph.Ds.  you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry. Why  Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand the incentives necessary to expand a business    it requires that you listen to the people  the private sector actors in that industry. Governments in Africa have therefore been given an opportunity  by the international community  to avoid building productive arrangements with your own citizens  and therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF and the World Bank  and then it is the IMF and the World Bank that tell them what its citizens need. In the process  we  the African people  have been sidelined from the policy making  policy orientation  and policy  implementation process in our countries. We have limited input  because he who pays the piper calls the tune. The IMF  the World Bank  and the cartel of good intentions in the world has taken over our rights as citizens  and therefore what our governments are doing  because they depend on aid  is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens. But I want to put a caveat on my argument  and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive. Some aid may have built a hospital  fed a hungry village. It may have built a road  and that road may have served a very good role. The mistake of the international aid industry is to pick these isolated incidents of success  generalize them  pour billions and trillions of dollars into them  and then spread them across the whole world  ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village  the skills  the practices  the norms and habits that allowed that small aid project to succeed    like in Sauri village  in Kenya  where Jeffrey Sachs is working    and therefore generalize this experience as the experience of everybody. Aid increases the resources available to governments  and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing you can have  as a person in Africa seeking a career. By increasing the political attractiveness of the state  especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa  aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions as every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state in order to get access to the foreign aid pie. Ladies and gentlemen  the most enterprising people in Africa cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business. Governments are not changing it. Why  Because they don't need to talk to their own citizens. They talk to international donors. So  the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government  and that has increased the political tensions in our countries precisely because we depend on aid. I also want to say that it is important for us to note that  over the last    years  Africa has been receiving increasing aid from the international community  in the form of technical assistance  and financial aid  and all other forms of aid. Between      and       our continent received     billion dollars of aid  and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa. Where has all the aid gone  I want to use the example of my own country  called Uganda  and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there. In the           budget  expected revenue   .  trillion shillings. The expected foreign aid   .  trillion. Uganda's recurrent expenditure    by recurrent what do I mean  Hand to mouth is  .  trillion. Why does the government of Uganda budget spend     percent of its own revenue  It's because there's somebody there called foreign aid  who contributes for it. But this shows you that the government of Uganda is not committed to spending its own revenue to invest in productive investments  but rather it devotes this revenue to paying structure of public expenditure. Public administration  which is largely patronage  takes     billion. The military      billion. Agriculture  which employs    percent of our poverty stricken citizens  takes only    billion. Trade and industry takes    billion. And let me show you  what does public expenditure    rather  public administration expenditure    in Uganda constitute  There you go.    cabinet ministers      presidential advisers  by the way  who never see the president  except on television. And when they see him physically  it is at public functions like this  and even there  it is him who advises them. We have    units of local government. Each local government is organized like the central government    a bureaucracy  a cabinet  a parliament  and so many jobs for the political hangers on. There were     and when our president wanted to amend the constitution and remove term limits  he had to create    new districts  and now there are   . Three hundred thirty three members of parliament. You need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament. One hundred thirty four commissions and semi autonomous government bodies  all of which have directors and the cars. And the final thing  this is addressed to Mr. Bono. In his work  he may help us on this. A recent government of Uganda study found that there are       four wheel drive motor vehicles at the Minister of Health headquarters. Uganda has     sub counties  each of them with a dispensary  none of which has an ambulance. So  the four wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters drive the ministers  the permanent secretaries  the bureaucrats and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects  while the poor die without ambulances and medicine. Finally  I want to say that before I came to speak here  I was told that the principle of TEDGlobal is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt. It should be short enough to arouse interest  but long enough to cover the subject. I hope I have achieved that. Thank you very much. I would like to tell you about a project which I started about    years ago. It's about making new forms of life. And these are made of this kind of tube    electricity tube  we call it in Holland. And we can start a film about that  and we can see a little bit backwards in time. Theo Jansen is working hard on this evolution. Theo Jansen  I want to put these forms of life on the beaches. And they should survive over there  on their own  in the future. Learning to live on their own    and it'll take couple of more years to let them walk on their own. Narrator  The mechanical beasts will not get their energy from food  but from the wind. The wind will move feathers on their back  which will drive their feet. The beast walks sideways on the wet sand of the beach  with its nose pointed into the wind. As soon as it walks into either the rolling surf or the dry sand  it stops  and walks in the opposite direction. Evolution has generated many species. This is the Animaris Currens Ventosa. TJ  This is a herd  and it is built according to genetic codes. And it is a sort of race  and each and every animal is different  and the winning codes will multiply. This is the wave  going from left to right. You can see this one. Yes  and now it goes from left to right. This is a new generation  a new family  which is able to store the wind. So  the wings pump up air in lemonade bottles  which are on top of that. And they can use that energy in case the wind falls away  and the tide is coming up  and there is still a little bit of energy to reach the dunes and save their lives  because they are drowned very easily. I could show you this animal. Thank you. So  the proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking. There are    numbers  which I call The    Holy Numbers. These are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way. In fact  it's a new invention of the wheel. It works the same as a wheel. The axis of a wheel stays on the same level  and this hip is staying on the same level as well. In fact  this is better than a wheel  because when you try to drive your bicycle on the beach  you will notice it's very hard to do. And the feet just step over the sand  and the wheel has to touch every piece of the ground in between. So       years after the invention of the wheel  we have a new wheel. I will show you  in the next video    can you start it  please     that very heavy loads can be moved. There's a guy pushing there  behind  but it can also walk on the wind very well. It's  .  tons. This is working on the stored wind in the bottles. It has a feeler  where it can feel obstacles and turn around. You see  it's going the other way. Can I have the feeler here  OK. Good. So  they have to survive all the dangers of the beach  and one of the big dangers is the sea. This is the sea. And it must feel the water of the sea. And this is the water feeler  and what's very important is this tube. It sucks in air normally  but when it swallows water  it feels the resistance of it. So  imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea. As soon as it touches the water    you should hear a sound of running air. Yes  So if it doesn't feel  it will be drowned  OK  Here we have the brain of the animal. In fact  it is a step counter  and it counts the steps. It's a binary step counter. So as soon it has been to the sea  it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here. And it always knows where it is on the beach. So it's very simple brain. It says  well  there's the sea  there are dunes  and I'm here. So it's a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal. Thank you. One of the biggest enemies are the storms. This is a part of the nose of the Animaris Percipiere. When the nose of the animal is fixed  the whole animal is fixed. So when the storm is coming up  it drives a pin into the ground. Audience member  Wow  The nose is fixed  the whole animal is fixed. The wind may turn  but the animal will always turn its nose into the wind. Now  another couple of years  and these animals will survive on their own. I still have to help them a lot. Thank you very much  ladies and gentlemen. This is a picture of Maurice Druon  the Honorary Perpetual Secretary of L'Academie francaise  the French Academy. He is splendidly attired in his        dollar uniform  befitting the role of the French Academy as legislating the correct usage in French and perpetuating the language. The French Academy has two main tasks  it compiles a dictionary of official French. They're now working on their ninth edition  which they began in       and they've reached the letter P. They also legislate on correct usage  such as the proper term for what the French call  email   which ought to be  courriel.  The World Wide Web  the French are told  ought to be referred to as  la toile d'araignee mondiale     the Global Spider Web    recommendations that the French gaily ignore. Now  this is one model of how language comes to be  namely  it's legislated by an academy. But anyone who looks at language realizes that this is a rather silly conceit  that language  rather  emerges from human minds interacting from one another. And this is visible in the unstoppable change in language    the fact that by the time the Academy finishes their dictionary  it will already be well out of date. We see it in the constant appearance of slang and jargon  of the historical change in languages  in divergence of dialects and the formation of new languages. So language is not so much a creator or shaper of human nature  so much as a window onto human nature. In a book that I'm currently working on  I hope to use language to shed light on a number of aspects of human nature  including the cognitive machinery with which humans conceptualize the world and the relationship types that govern human interaction. And I'm going to say a few words about each one this morning. Let me start off with a technical problem in language that I've worried about for quite some time    and indulge me in my passion for verbs and how they're used. The problem is  which verbs go in which constructions  The verb is the chassis of the sentence. It's the framework onto which the other parts are bolted. Let me give you a quick reminder of something that you've long forgotten. An intransitive verb  such as  dine   for example  can't take a direct object. You have to say   Sam dined   not   Sam dined the pizza.  A transitive verb mandates that there has to be an object there   Sam devoured the pizza.  You can't just say   Sam devoured.  There are dozens or scores of verbs of this type  each of which shapes its sentence. So  a problem in explaining how children learn language  a problem in teaching language to adults so that they don't make grammatical errors  and a problem in programming computers to use language is which verbs go in which constructions. For example  the dative construction in English. You can say   Give a muffin to a mouse   the prepositional dative. Or   Give a mouse a muffin   the double object dative.  Promise anything to her    Promise her anything   and so on. Hundreds of verbs can go both ways. So a tempting generalization for a child  for an adult  for a computer is that any verb that can appear in the construction   subject verb thing to a recipient  can also be expressed as  subject verb recipient thing.  A handy thing to have  because language is infinite  and you can't just parrot back the sentences that you've heard. You've got to extract generalizations so you can produce and understand new sentences. This would be an example of how to do that. Unfortunately  there appear to be idiosyncratic exceptions. You can say   Biff drove the car to Chicago   but not   Biff drove Chicago the car.  You can say   Sal gave Jason a headache   but it's a bit odd to say   Sal gave a headache to Jason.  The solution is that these constructions  despite initial appearance  are not synonymous  that when you crank up the microscope on human cognition  you see that there's a subtle difference in meaning between them. So   give the X to the Y   that construction corresponds to the thought  cause X to go to Y.  Whereas  give the Y the X  corresponds to the thought  cause Y to have X.  Now  many events can be subject to either construal  kind of like the classic figure ground reversal illusions  in which you can either pay attention to the particular object  in which case the space around it recedes from attention  or you can see the faces in the empty space  in which case the object recedes out of consciousness. How are these construals reflected in language  Well  in both cases  the thing that is construed as being affected is expressed as the direct object  the noun after the verb. So  when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere    where you're doing something to the muffin    you say   Give the muffin to the mouse.  When you construe it as  cause the mouse to have something   you're doing something to the mouse  and therefore you express it as   Give the mouse the muffin.  So which verbs go in which construction    the problem with which I began    depends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motion or a kind of possession change. To give something involves both causing something to go and causing someone to have. To drive the car only causes something to go  because Chicago's not the kind of thing that can possess something. Only humans can possess things. And to give someone a headache causes them to have the headache  but it's not as if you're taking the headache out of your head and causing it to go to the other person  and implanting it in them. You may just be loud or obnoxious  or some other way causing them to have the headache. So  that's an example of the kind of thing that I do in my day job. So why should anyone care  Well  there are a number of interesting conclusions  I think  from this and many similar kinds of analyses of hundreds of English verbs. First  there's a level of fine grained conceptual structure  which we automatically and unconsciously compute every time we produce or utter a sentence  that governs our use of language. You can think of this as the language of thought  or  mentalese.  It seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts  which govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs    not only in English  but in all other languages    fundamental concepts such as space  time  causation and human intention  such as  what is the means and what is the ends  These are reminiscent of the kinds of categories that Immanuel Kant argued are the basic framework for human thought  and it's interesting that our unconscious use of language seems to reflect these Kantian categories. Doesn't care about perceptual qualities  such as color  texture  weight and speed  which virtually never differentiate the use of verbs in different constructions. An additional twist is that all of the constructions in English are used not only literally  but in a quasi metaphorical way. For example  this construction  the dative  is used not only to transfer things  but also for the metaphorical transfer of ideas  as when we say   She told a story to me  or  told me a story    Max taught Spanish to the students  or  taught the students Spanish.  It's exactly the same construction  but no muffins  no mice  nothing moving at all. It evokes the container metaphor of communication  in which we conceive of ideas as objects  sentences as containers  and communication as a kind of sending. As when we say we  gather  our ideas  to  put  them  into  words  and if our words aren't  empty  or  hollow   we might get these ideas  across  to a listener  who can  unpack  our words to  extract  their  content.  And indeed  this kind of verbiage is not the exception  but the rule. It's very hard to find any example of abstract language that is not based on some concrete metaphor. For example  you can use the verb  go  and the prepositions  to  and  from  in a literal  spatial sense.  The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul.  You can also say   Biff went from sick to well.  He needn't go anywhere. He could have been in bed the whole time  but it's as if his health is a point in state space that you conceptualize as moving. Or   The meeting went from three to four   in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line. Likewise  we use  force  to indicate not only physical force  as in   Rose forced the door to open   but also interpersonal force  as in   Rose forced Sadie to go   not necessarily by manhandling her  but by issuing a threat. Or   Rose forced herself to go   as if there were two entities inside Rose's head  engaged in a tug of a war. Second conclusion is that the ability to conceive of a given event in two different ways  such as  cause something to go to someone  and  causing someone to have something   I think is a fundamental feature of human thought  and it's the basis for much human argumentation  in which people don't differ so much on the facts as on how they ought to be construed. Just to give you a few examples   ending a pregnancy  versus  killing a fetus    a ball of cells  versus  an unborn child    invading Iraq  versus  liberating Iraq    redistributing wealth  versus  confiscating earnings.  And I think the biggest picture of all would take seriously the fact that so much of our verbiage about abstract events is based on a concrete metaphor and see human intelligence itself as consisting of a repertoire of concepts    such as objects  space  time  causation and intention    which are useful in a social  knowledge intensive species  whose evolution you can well imagine  and a process of metaphorical abstraction that allows us to bleach these concepts of their original conceptual content    space  time and force    and apply them to new abstract domains  therefore allowing a species that evolved to deal with rocks and tools and animals  to conceptualize mathematics  physics  law and other abstract domains. Well  I said I'd talk about two windows on human nature    the cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world  and now I'm going to say a few words about the relationship types that govern human social interaction  again  as reflected in language. And I'll start out with a puzzle  the puzzle of indirect speech acts. Now  I'm sure most of you have seen the movie  Fargo.  And you might remember the scene in which the kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer  is asked to show his driver's license and holds his wallet out with a    dollar bill extending at a slight angle out of the wallet. And he says   I was just thinking that maybe we could take care of it here in Fargo   which everyone  including the audience  interprets as a veiled bribe. This kind of indirect speech is rampant in language. For example  in polite requests  if someone says   If you could pass the guacamole  that would be awesome   we know exactly what he means  even though that's a rather bizarre concept being expressed.  Would you like to come up and see my etchings   I think most people understand the intent behind that. And likewise  if someone says   Nice store you've got there. It would be a real shame if something happened to it     we understand that as a veiled threat  rather than a musing of hypothetical possibilities. So the puzzle is  why are bribes  polite requests  solicitations and threats so often veiled  No one's fooled. Both parties know exactly what the speaker means  and the speaker knows the listener knows that the speaker knows that the listener knows  etc.  etc. So what's going on  I think the key idea is that language is a way of negotiating relationships  and human relationships fall into a number of types. There's an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist Alan Fiske  in which relationships can be categorized  more or less  into communality  which works on the principle  what's mine is thine  what's thine is mine   the kind of mindset that operates within a family  for example  dominance  whose principle is  don't mess with me   reciprocity   you scratch my back  I'll scratch yours   and sexuality  in the immortal words of Cole Porter   Let's do it.  Now  relationship types can be negotiated. Even though there are default situations in which one of these mindsets can be applied  they can be stretched and extended. For example  communality applies most naturally within family or friends  but it can be used to try to transfer the mentality of sharing to groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it. For example  in brotherhoods  fraternal organizations  sororities  locutions like  the family of man   you try to get people who are not related to use the relationship type that would ordinarily be appropriate to close kin. Now  mismatches    when one person assumes one relationship type  and another assumes a different one    can be awkward. If you went over and you helped yourself to a shrimp off your boss' plate  for example  that would be an awkward situation. Or if a dinner guest after the meal pulled out his wallet and offered to pay you for the meal  that would be rather awkward as well. In less blatant cases  there's still a kind of negotiation that often goes on. In the workplace  for example  there's often a tension over whether an employee can socialize with the boss  or refer to him or her on a first name basis. If two friends have a reciprocal transaction  like selling a car  it's well known that this can be a source of tension or awkwardness. In dating  the transition from friendship to sex can lead to  notoriously  various forms of awkwardness  and as can sex in the workplace  in which we call the conflict between a dominant and a sexual relationship  sexual harassment.  Well  what does this have to do with language  Well  language  as a social interaction  has to satisfy two conditions. You have to convey the actual content    here we get back to the container metaphor. You want to express the bribe  the command  the promise  the solicitation and so on  but you also have to negotiate and maintain the kind of relationship you have with the other person. The solution  I think  is that we use language at two levels  the literal form signals the safest relationship with the listener  whereas the implicated content    the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform    allows the listener to derive the interpretation which is most relevant in context  which possibly initiates a changed relationship. The simplest example of this is in the polite request. If you express your request as a conditional     if you could open the window  that would be great     even though the content is an imperative  the fact that you're not using the imperative voice means that you're not acting as if you're in a relationship of dominance  where you could presuppose the compliance of the other person. On the other hand  you want the damn guacamole. By expressing it as an if then statement  you can get the message across without appearing to boss another person around. And in a more subtle way  I think  this works for all of the veiled speech acts involving plausible deniability  the bribes  threats  propositions  solicitations and so on. One way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like if language    where it could only be used literally. And you can think of it in terms of a game theoretic payoff matrix. Put yourself in the position of the kidnapper wanting to bribe the officer. There's a high stakes in the two possibilities of having a dishonest officer or an honest officer. If you don't bribe the officer  then you will get a traffic ticket    or  as is the case of  Fargo   worse    whether the honest officer is honest or dishonest. Nothing ventured  nothing gained. In that case  the consequences are rather severe. On the other hand  if you extend the bribe  if the officer is dishonest  you get a huge payoff of going free. If the officer is honest  you get a huge penalty of being arrested for bribery. So this is a rather fraught situation. On the other hand  with indirect language  if you issue a veiled bribe  then the dishonest officer could interpret it as a bribe  in which case you get the payoff of going free. The honest officer can't hold you to it as being a bribe  and therefore  you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket. So you get the best of both worlds. And a similar analysis  I think  can apply to the potential awkwardness of a sexual solicitation  and other cases where plausible deniability is an asset. I think this affirms something that's long been known by diplomats    namely  that the vagueness of language  far from being a bug or an imperfection  actually might be a feature of language  one that we use to our advantage in social interactions. So to sum up  language is a collective human creation  reflecting human nature  how we conceptualize reality  how we relate to one another. And then by analyzing the various quirks and complexities of language  I think we can get a window onto what makes us tick. Thank you very much. Images like this  from the Auschwitz concentration camp  have been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century and have given us a new understanding of who we are  where we've come from and the times we live in. During the twentieth century  we witnessed the atrocities of Stalin  Hitler  Mao  Pol Pot  Rwanda and other genocides  and even though the twenty first century is only seven years old  we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur and the daily horrors of Iraq. This has led to a common understanding of our situation  namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence  and perhaps that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from  to our peril. Here is an example from an op ed on Thanksgiving  in the Boston Globe a couple of years ago  where the writer wrote   The Indian life was a difficult one  but there were no employment problems  community harmony was strong  substance abuse unknown  crime nearly non existent  what warfare there was between tribes was largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate or wholesale slaughter.  Now  you're all familiar with this treacle. We teach it to our children. We hear it on television and in storybooks. Now  the original title of this session was   Everything You Know Is Wrong   and I'm going to present evidence that this particular part of our common understanding is wrong  that  in fact  our ancestors were far more violent than we are  that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time  and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence. Now  in the decade of Darfur and Iraq  a statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory and obscene. But I'm going to try to convince you that that is the correct picture. The decline of violence is a fractal phenomenon. You can see it over millennia  over centuries  over decades and over years  although there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset of the Age of Reason in the sixteenth century. One sees it all over the world  although not homogeneously. It's especially evident in the West  beginning with England and Holland around the time of the Enlightenment. Let me take you on a journey of several powers of       from the millennium scale to the year scale    to try to persuade you of this. Until        years ago  all humans lived as hunter gatherers  without permanent settlements or government. And this is the state that's commonly thought to be one of primordial harmony. But the archaeologist Lawrence Keeley  looking at casualty rates among contemporary hunter gatherers  which is our best source of evidence about this way of life  has shown a rather different conclusion. Here is a graph that he put together showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare in a number of foraging  or hunting and gathering societies. The red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die at the hands of another man  as opposed to passing away of natural causes  in a variety of foraging societies in the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest. And they range from a rate of almost a    percent chance that a man will die at the hands of another man to  in the case of the Gebusi  only a    percent chance. The tiny  little blue bar in the lower left hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from United States and Europe in the twentieth century  and includes all the deaths of both World Wars. If the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailed during the   th century  there would have been two billion deaths rather than     million. Also at the millennium scale  we can look at the way of life of early civilizations such as the ones described in the Bible. And in this supposed source of our moral values  one can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare  such as the following from Numbers      And they warred against the Midianites as the Lord commanded Moses  and they slew all the males. And Moses said unto them  'Have you saved all the women alive  Now  therefore  kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him  but all the women children that have not know a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves.'  In other words  kill the men  kill the children  if you see any virgins  then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them. You can find four or five passages in the Bible of this ilk. Also in the Bible  one sees that the death penalty was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality  adultery  blasphemy  idolatry  talking back to your parents    Well  let's click the zoom lens down one order of magnitude  and look at the century scale. Although we don't have statistics for warfare throughout the Middle Ages to modern times  we know just from conventional history    the evidence was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction in socially sanctioned forms of violence. For example  any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture were routine forms of criminal punishment. The kind of infraction today that would give you a fine  in those days would result in your tongue being cut out  your ears being cut off  you being blinded  a hand being chopped off and so on. There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment  burning at the stake  disemboweling  breaking on the wheel  being pulled apart by horses and so on. The death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non violent crimes  criticizing the king  stealing a loaf of bread. Slavery  of course  was the preferred labor saving device  and cruelty was a popular form of entertainment. Perhaps the most vivid example was the practice of cat burning  in which a cat was hoisted on a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire  and the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat  howling in pain  was burned to death. What about one on one murder  Well  there  there are good statistics  because many municipalities recorded the cause of death. The criminologist Manuel Eisner scoured all of the historical records across Europe for homicide rates in any village  hamlet  town  county that he could find  and he supplemented them with national data  when nations started keeping statistics. He plotted on a logarithmic scale  going from     deaths per         people per year  which was approximately the rate of homicide in the Middle Ages. And the figure plummets down to less than one homicide per         people per year in seven or eight European countries. Then  there is a slight uptick in the     s. The people who said that rock 'n' roll would lead to the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that. But there was a decline from at least two orders of magnitude in homicide from the Middle Ages to the present  and the elbow occurred in the early sixteenth century. Let's click down now to the decade scale. According to non governmental organizations that keep such statistics  since       in Europe and the Americas  there has been a steep decline in interstate wars  in deadly ethnic riots or pogroms  and in military coups  even in South America. Worldwide  there's been a steep decline in deaths in interstate wars. The yellow bars here show the number of deaths per war per year from      to the present. And  as you can see  the death rate goes down from        deaths per conflict per year in the     s to less than       deaths per conflict per year in this decade  as horrific as it is. Even in the year scale  one can see a decline of violence. Since the end of the Cold War  there have been fewer civil wars  fewer genocides    indeed  a    percent reduction since post World War II highs    and even a reversal of the     s uptick in homicide and violent crime. This is from the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics. You can see that there is a fairly low rate of violence in the '  s and the '  s  then it soared upward for several decades  and began a precipitous decline  starting in the     s  so that it went back to the level that was last enjoyed in     . President Clinton  if you're here  thank you. So the question is  why are so many people so wrong about something so important  I think there are a number of reasons. One of them is we have better reporting. The Associated Press is a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the Earth than sixteenth century monks were. There's a cognitive illusion. We cognitive psychologists know that the easier it is to recall specific instances of something  the higher the probability that you assign to it. Things that we read about in the paper with gory footage burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying in their beds of old age. There are dynamics in the opinion and advocacy markets  no one ever attracted observers  advocates and donors by saying things just seem to be getting better and better. There's guilt about our treatment of native peoples in modern intellectual life  and an unwillingness to acknowledge there could be anything good about Western culture. And of course  our change in standards can outpace the change in behavior. One of the reasons violence went down is that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time. That's a process that seems to be continuing  but if it outstrips behavior by the standards of the day  things always look more barbaric than they would have been by historic standards. So today  we get exercised    and rightly so    if a handful of murderers get executed by lethal injection in Texas after a    year appeal process. We don't consider that a couple of hundred years ago  they may have been burned at the stake for criticizing the king after a trial that lasted    minutes  and indeed  that that would have been repeated over and over again. Today  we look at capital punishment as evidence of how low our behavior can sink  rather than how high our standards have risen. Well  why has violence declined  No one really knows  but I have read four explanations  all of which  I think  have some grain of plausibility. The first is  maybe Thomas Hobbes got it right. He was the one who said that life in a state of nature was  solitary  poor  nasty  brutish and short.  Not because  he argued  humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative  but because of the logic of anarchy. In a state of anarchy  there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively  before they invade you. More recently  Thomas Schelling gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling in the basement. Being a good American  he has a pistol in the nightstand  pulls out his gun  and walks down the stairs. And what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand. Now  each one of them is thinking   I don't really want to kill that guy  but he's about to kill me. Maybe I had better shoot him  before he shoots me  especially since  even if he doesn't want to kill me  he's probably worrying right now that I might kill him before he kills me.  And so on. Hunter gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought  and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first. Now  one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence. You don't strike first  but you have a publicly announced policy that you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded. The only thing is that it's liable to having its bluff called  and therefore can only work if it's credible. To make it credible  you must avenge all insults and settle all scores  which leads to the cycles of bloody vendetta. Life becomes an episode of  The Sopranos.  Hobbes' solution  the  Leviathan   was that if authority for the legitimate use of violence was vested in a single democratic agency    a leviathan    then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack  because any kind of aggression will be punished  leaving its profitability as zero. That would remove the temptation to invade preemptively  out of fear of them attacking you first. It removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation to make your deterrent threat credible. And therefore  it would lead to a state of peace. Eisner    the man who plotted the homicide rates that you failed to see in the earlier slide    argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in Europe coincided with the rise of centralized states. So that's a bit of a support for the leviathan theory. Also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence in zones of anarchy  in failed states  collapsed empires  frontier regions  mafias  street gangs and so on. The second explanation is that in many times and places  there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap. In earlier times  when suffering and early death were common in one's own life  one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them on others. And as technology and economic efficiency make life longer and more pleasant  one puts a higher value on life in general. This was an argument from the political scientist James Payne. A third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero sum game  and was worked out in the book  Nonzero  by the journalist Robert Wright. Wright points out that in certain circumstances  cooperation or non violence can benefit both parties in an interaction  such as gains in trade when two parties trade their surpluses and both come out ahead  or when two parties lay down their arms and split the so called peace dividend that results in them not having to fight the whole time. Wright argues that technology has increased the number of positive sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in  by allowing the trade of goods  services and ideas over longer distances and among larger groups of people. The result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead  and violence declines for selfish reasons. As Wright put it   Among the many reasons that I think that we should not bomb the Japanese is that they built my mini van.  The fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book called  The Expanding Circle   by the philosopher Peter Singer  who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense of empathy  an ability to treat other peoples' interests as comparable to one's own. Unfortunately  by default we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family. People outside that circle are treated as sub human  and can be exploited with impunity. But  over history  the circle has expanded. One can see  in historical record  it expanding from the village  to the clan  to the tribe  to the nation  to other races  to both sexes  and  in Singer's own arguments  something that we should extend to other sentient species. The question is  if this has happened  what has powered that expansion  And there are a number of possibilities  such as increasing circles of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for. The logic of the golden rule    the more you think about and interact with other people  the more you realize that it is untenable to privilege your interests over theirs  at least not if you want them to listen to you. You can't say that my interests are special compared to yours  anymore than you can say that the particular spot that I'm standing on is a unique part of the universe because I happen to be standing on it that very minute. It may also be powered by cosmopolitanism  by histories  and journalism  and memoirs  and realistic fiction  and travel  and literacy  which allows you to project yourself into the lives of other people that formerly you may have treated as sub human  and also to realize the accidental contingency of your own station in life  the sense that  there but for fortune go I.  Whatever its causes  the decline of violence  I think  has profound implications. It should force us to ask not just  why is there war  But also  why is there peace  Not just  what are we doing wrong  But also  what have we been doing right  Because we have been doing something right  and it sure would be good to find out what it is. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  I loved that talk. I think a lot of people here in the room would say that that expansion of    that you were talking about  that Peter Singer talks about  is also driven by  just by technology  by greater visibility of the other  and the sense that the world is therefore getting smaller. I mean  is that also a grain of truth  Steven Pinker  Very much. It would fit both in Wright's theory  that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation over larger and larger circles. But also  I think it helps us imagine what it's like to be someone else. I think when you read these horrific tortures that were common in the Middle Ages  you think  how could they possibly have done it  how could they have not have empathized with the person that they're disemboweling  But clearly  as far as they're concerned  this is just an alien being that does not have feelings akin to their own. Anything  I think  that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person. CA  Well  Steve  I would love every news media owner to hear that talk at some point in the next year. I think it's really important. Thank you so much. SP  My pleasure. Three years ago  I got a phone call  based on an earlier film I had made  with an offer to embed the New Hampshire National Guard. My idea    and literally  I woke up in the middle of the night  and we've all have those moments. You know  you go to sleep    I was excited  with this phone call. I was thinking  I just finished making another film about World War II vets  and I realized I'd gotten to know their stories  and I realized this was a once in a lifetime opportunity to tell a warrior's story as it unfolded. So I went to bed that night pretty excited. Not sure of all the details  but excited. It wasn't at four in the morning  but it was closer to midnight. Woke straight up. Wide awake as could be. And I had this idea  what if I could  in effect  virtually embed  and create a permeable relationship with the soldiers  To tell the story from the inside out  versus the outside in  So  I called back Major Heilshorn  who's the public affairs officer of the New Hampshire National Guard. And he knew me  so I was like   Greg   He's like   Yes  Deborah   Told him my idea  and you know  he is one of the bravest men in the world  as is General Blair  who  in the end  gave me permission to try this experiment. Within    days  I was down at Fort Dix. He gave me my pick of units. I picked one unit    Charlie Company  Third of the    nd  they're mountain infantry    for two reasons. One  they're infantry. Number two  they were going to be based at LSA Anaconda  so I knew they would have Internet access. The caveat for my access was I had to get the soldiers to volunteer. This was a big thing that I think when Major H told me  I wasn't really totally gathering what that would mean. So what that meant was  when I went down to Fort Dix  I had to hop out in front of     guys and tell them of my vision. You can imagine the hailstorm of questions I got. The opening one was   What the fuck do you know about the National Guard   I started with the      Massachusetts Bay Colony Pequot Indian Wars. Gave them about a nine minute response  and there we went. So  I'd like to show the clip of the film. It's our trailer  because I know  obviously you guys are busy  many of you may not have had a chance to see it. So  I want to show the trailer  and then I'm going to take apart one scene in detail. If we could roll  Michael Moriarty  Specialist Michael Moriarty. Zack Bazzi  Do I really want to go  Probably not. Soldier  We're not supposed to talk to the media. SP  I'm not the media  dammit  MM  The day is here. Life will change. Voice  The real deal  man  Narrator  You ready  Soldier  Bring it on  Narrator  You ready  Voice    Iraq  here we come  ZB  Every soldier eventually wants to go in combat. It's natural instinct. SP  If you let fear get to you  then you're not going to be doing your job. MM  Every single time you go out there  there's attacks. It's unbelievable. ZB  Hey  Nestor  your ass crack is right in my face. Soldiers  IV  Are we on fire  IV  Man down  Man down  MM  Keep going  brother.

SP  You don't put         troops in there  and say we're there to create democracy. Soldier  We've got a drive through window at Burger King now. SP  We're here to create money. MM  I support George Bush. We're not there for the oil. Jon Baril  The worst thing in my life. SP  Baril  don't look at it  bud. Michael Moriarty's Wife  He's not the same person anymore. MM  I will not go back. Kevin Shangraw  The Iraqi people are who we are there to help    and we just killed one. Soldiers  Sergeant Smith is down  Sergeant Smith is down  There they are  Right there  Fire  fire  JB  It'll be a better country in    years  'cause we were there. I hope. One of the things I'd like to talk to you about is having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about. And I'd like to relate an experience I had here at TED. I don't know how many of you might imagine it  but there's actually a TEDster who recently got back from Iraq. Paul  Come on  stand up. This is Paul Anthony. He served     Applause     with the Marines  and I want to tell you a little  brief story. We were one of the lucky ones to get in the class with the Sony cameras and the Vista software. Right  And we started talking. People will see my tag  and they'll see  The War Tapes   and then we'll start talking about war. We got in a conversation with some other people in the class  and it went on and on. I mean  we were there for an hour  talking. And it really highlighted something that I would like to ask you guys to think about and hopefully to help with  which is  I think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war  and about politics. And really    because maybe we're going to disagree. Maybe it's going to get uncomfortable. How do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation  And you know  Paul was talking  and he then turned to Constance and said   You know  I wouldn't have this conversation if she weren't here  because I know she has my back.  And I want to say  I was nervous. Because I'm used to doing Q As. I really related to what James was saying yesterday  because I'm behind the camera. You know  I can answer questions about my movie  but for me to come up and talk for    minutes is a really long time. So  I wanted to say  Paul  I'm happy you're here  because I know you have my back. This film was not about the Internet  but it could not have been made without it. The guys' tapes on average took two weeks to get from Iraq to me. In the meantime  the soldiers    we would email and IM. I didn't save all of them  because I didn't realize at the beginning that it would be something that I would want to keep track of. But there were       emails and IMs and text messages that I was able to save. The reason I quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey to really get inside of it. So I wanted to show you a clip  and then I was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together. If we could roll the clip. SP  We like to give these insurgents a fair chance. So  what we do  we ride with the windows down. Because  you know  we obviously have the advantage. I'm just kidding. We don't fucking ride with the goddam windows down. It's not true. Very unsafe. Whoa. Soldier  Right there. SP  All right  let's get over to that site. Be advised  we're leaving Taji right now. We believe that the blast was right outside the gate of Taji  we're heading to that location now. Soldier  That's a fucking car bomb  Soldier  Motherfuckers  Soldiers  Get your vest on  Hey  get over the fucking    yeah  yeah. Any one four elements get to the gate  SP  Sheriff one six  or any one four elements  we need you at the gate of Taji right now  over. Soldier  I'll walk you through it. SP  Stay low. Head over to the right. Get your bag  get your bag  SP  It was mass casualties. Probably    dead  at least    or    wounded Iraqis. SP  It just looked like  you know  someone had thrown a quarter through a guy  and it was just like    there was no blood coming from the shrapnel wounds. Everything was cauterized  and it was just like there was a void going through the body. This is the scene north. They just removed a burnt body  or half a body from here. I don't think there was anything left from his abdominal down. This is blood. And you know  you walk  and you hear the pieces of skin. And that's it  that's all that's left. I remember giving three IVs  bandaging several wounded. Soldiers sitting in the corner of a sandbag wall  shaking and screaming. Medics who were terrified and couldn't perform. I later heard that Iraqi casualties were not to be treated in Taji. They can work on the post for pennies  but can't die there. They've got to die outside. If one of those incompetent medical officers told me to stop treatment  I would've slit his throat right there.       hours  and it's just our squad going through today's events in our heads  whether we want to or not. News Anchor  More violence in Iraq. Twin suicide car bombings killed eight Iraqis and wounded dozens more near a coalition base north of Baghdad. SP  We made the news. I feel exploited and proud at the same time. I've lost all faith in the media    a hapless joke I would much rather laugh at than become a part of. I should really thank God for saving my lucky ass. I'll do that  then I'm gonna jerk off. Because these pages smell like Linds  and there won't be any time for jerking off tomorrow. Another mission at      . DS  Now     Applause     thanks. When I said earlier  to try and tell a story from the inside out  versus the outside in    part of what Chris said so eloquently in his introduction    is this melding. It's a new way of trying to make a documentary. When I met the guys  and    of them agreed to take cameras    in total     ended up filming. Five soldiers filmed the entire time. There are three featured in the film. The way I learned about Taji was Steve Pink sent me an email  and in it  attached a photo of that burned body out at the car. And the tone from the email was  you know  it had been a very bad day  obviously. And I saw in my IM window that Mike Moriarty was at the base. So  I pinged Mike and I said   Mike  can you please go get that interview with Pink   Because the thing that very often is missing is  in the military what they call  hot wash.  It's that immediate interview after something immediately happens  you know. And if you let time go by  it kind of softens and smooths the edges. And for me  I really wanted that. So  in order to get the intimacy  to share that experience with you  the guys    the two most popular mounts    there was a camera on the turret  the gun turret  and then on the dashboard of the Humvee. Most of the Humvees  we ended up mounting two cameras in them. So you get to experience that in real time  right  The interview that you see is the one that Mike went and did within    hours of that episode happening. Steve Pink reading his journal happened five months after he came home. I knew about that journal  but it was very  very private. And you know  you earn someone's trust  especially in doc filmmaking  through your relationship. So  it wasn't until five months after he was home that he would read that journal. Now  the news footage I put in there to try to show    you know  I think mainstream media tries to do the best they can in the format that they have. But the thing that I know you all have heard a lot of times  American soldiers saying   Why don't they talk about the good stuff that we do   OK  this is a perfect example. Pink's squad and another squad spent their entire day outside the wire. They didn't have to go outside the wire. There were not Americans hurt out there. They spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save Iraqi lives    the Iraqis who work on the post. So  when you may hear soldiers complaining  that's what they're talking about  you know  And I think it's such an amazing gift that they would share this as a way of bridging. And when I talk about that polarity I get at so many different Q As  and people are really opinionated. But it seems like people don't want to hear so much  or listen  or try to have an exchange. And I'm as fiery as the next person  but I really think    you know  different speakers have talked about their concern for the world  and my concern is that we have to have these conversations. And we have to be able to go into scary places where we may  you know  we think we know. But we just have to leave that little bit of openness  to know. There's such a disconnect. And for me  it's trying to bridge that disconnect. I'll share one story. I get    I'm often asked  you know  for me  what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film. And at screenings  inevitably    you know  as I'm sure all of you obviously do speaking stuff    usually you have people who hang around and want to ask you more questions. And usually  the first questions are   Oh  what kind of cameras did you use   Or you know  these things. But there's always a few guys  almost always  who are the last ones. And I've learned over time that those are always the soldiers. And they wait until pretty much everybody's gone. And for me  one of the most profound stories someone shared with me  that then became my story  was    for those of you who haven't seen the film  and it's not a spoiler    it's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents  where people get in front of Humvees and they get killed. In this film  there is a scene where an Iraqi woman is killed. A soldier came up to me and stood  you know really  pretty close  a foot away from me. He's a big guy. And he looked at me  and I smiled  and then I saw the tears start welling up in his eyes. And he wasn't going to blink. And he said   My gunner was throwing candy.  And I knew what he was going to say. The gunner was throwing candy. They used to throw candy to the kids. Kids got too close  very often. And he said   I killed a child. And I'm a father. I have children. I haven't been able to tell my wife. I'm afraid she's going to think I'm a monster.  I hugged him  of course  and I said  you know   It's going to be OK.  And he said   I'm going to bring her to see your film. And then I'm going to tell her.  So when I talk about a disconnect  it's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier  which there obviously are. You know  these days  it's not like World War II  where there was a war front and a home front  and everybody seemed involved. You can go for days here and not feel like there's a war going on. And often  I'll hear people say  who maybe know that I did this film  and they say   Oh  you know  I'm against the war  but I support the soldiers.  And I've started to ask them   Well  that's nice. What are you doing  Are you volunteering at a VA  You go and see anybody  Do you  if you find out your neighbor's been  do you spend some time  Not necessarily ask questions  but see if they want to talk  Do you give money to any of the charities   You know  obviously  like Dean Kamen's working on that amazing thing  but there's charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers. I think  I challenge us to say    to operationalize those terms  when we say we support someone  you know  Are you a friend to them  Do you really care  And I would just say it's my hope  and I would ask you guys to please  you know  reach out a hand. And really do give them a hug. Thank you. I have    minutes to tell you what happened over the past six million years. All right. We all have come from a long way  here in Africa  and converged in this region of Africa  which is a place where    percent of our evolutionary process took place. And I say that not because I am African  but it's in Africa that you find the earliest evidence for human ancestors  upright walking traces  even the first technologies in the form of stone tools. So we all are Africans  and welcome home. All right. I'm a paleoanthropologist  and my job is to define man's place in nature and explore what makes us human. And today  I will use Selam  the earliest child ever discovered  to tell you a story of all of us. Selam is our most complete skeleton of a three year old girl who lived and died  .  million years ago. She belongs to the species known as Australopithecus afarensis. You don't need to remember that. That's the Lucy species  and was found by my research team in December of      in an area called Dikika. It's in the northeastern part of Ethiopia. And Selam means peace in many Ethiopian languages. We use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet. And the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines gives you already an idea of her significance  I think. After I was invited by TED  I did some digging  because that's what we do  to know about my host. You don't just jump into an invitation. And I learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools   .  million years ago. First entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are        years old. And evidence for first design comes        years old    beads. And you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time. And DNA analysis of living humans and chimpanzees teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago and that these two species share over    percent of the same genetic material. I think knowing this is a very useful context within which we can think of our ancestry. However  DNA analysis informs us only about the beginning and the end  telling us nothing about what happened in the middle. So  for us  paleoanthropologists  our job is to find the hard evidence  the fossil evidence  to fill in this gap and see the different stages of development. Because it's only when you do that  that you can talk about    it's only when you do that   that  you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times  and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time. That then gives you an access to explore the biological mechanisms and forces that are responsible for this gradual change that made us what we are today. But finding the hard evidence is a very complicated endeavor. It's a systematic and scientific approach  which takes you to places that are remote  hot  hostile and often with no access. Just to give you an example  when I went to Dikika  where Selam was found  in '      and it's about     kilometers from Addis Ababa  the capital of Ethiopia. It took us only seven hours to do the first     kilometers of the      but took four  solid hours to do the last only    kilometers. With the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks  I made my way. I was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot. When you get there  this is what you see  and it's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable. And once you make it there  the big question is where to start. And you find nothing for years and years. When I go to places like this  which are paleontological sites  it's like going to a game park  an extinct game park. But what you find are not the human remains  such as Selam and Lucy  on a day to day basis. You find elephants  rhinos  monkeys  pigs  etc. But you could ask  how could these large mammals live in this desert environment  Of course  they cannot  but I'm telling you already that the environment and the carrying capacity of this region was drastically different from what we have today. A very important environmental lesson could be learned from this. Anyway  once we made it there  then it's a game park  as I said  an extinct game park. And our ancestors lived in that game park  but were just the minorities. They were not as successful and as widespread as the Homo sapiens that we are. To tell you just an example  an anecdote about their rarity  I was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here  and the assistants  of course  helped me do the surveys. They would find a bone and tell me   Here is what you're looking for.  I would say   No  that's an elephant.  Again  another one   That's a monkey.   That's a pig   etc. So one of my assistants  who never went to school  said to me   Listen  Zeray. You either don't know what you're looking for  or you're looking in the wrong place   he said. And I said   Why    Because there were elephants and lions  and the people were scared and went somewhere else. Let's go somewhere else.  Well  he was very tired  and it's really tiring. It was then  after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found Selam  and you see the face here covered by sandstone. And here is actually the spinal column and the whole torso encased in a sandstone block  because she was buried by a river. What you have here seems to be nothing  but contains an incredible amount of scientific information that helps us explore what makes us human. This is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor ever found in the history of paleoanthropology  an amazing piece of our long  long history. There were these three people and me  and I am taking the pictures  that's why I am not in. How would you feel if you were me  You have something extraordinary in your hand  but you are in the middle of nowhere  The feeling I had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement  of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility  of making sure everything is safe. Here is a close up of the fossil  after five years of cleaning  preparation and description  which was very long  as I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block I just showed you in the previous slide. It took five years. In a way  this was like the second birth for the child  after  .  million years  but the labor was very long. And here is full scale    it's a tiny bone. And in the middle is the minister of Ethiopian tourism  who came to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I was working there. And you see me worried and trying to protect my child  because you don't leave anyone with this kind of child  even a minister. So then  once you've done that  the next stage is to know what it is. Once that was done  then it was possible to compare. We were able to tell that she belonged to the human family tree because the legs  the foot  and some features clearly showed that she walked upright  and upright walking is a hallmark in humanity. But in addition  if you compare the skull with a comparably aged chimpanzee and little George Bush here  you see that you have vertical forehead. And you see that in humans  because of the development of the pre frontal cortex  it's called. You don't see that in chimpanzees  and you don't see this very projecting canine. So she belongs to our family tree  but within that  of course  you do detailed analysis  and we know now that she belongs to the Lucy species  known as Australopithecus afarensis. The next exciting question is  girl or boy  And how old was she when she died  You can determine the sex of the individual based on the size of the teeth. How  You know  in primates  there is this phenomenon called sexual dimorphism  which simply means males are larger than females and males have larger teeth than the females. But to do that  you need the permanent dentition  which you don't see here  because what you have here are the baby teeth. But using the CT scanning technology  which is normally used for medical purposes  you can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image showing you both the baby teeth here and the still growing adult teeth here. So when you measure those teeth  it was clear that she turned out to be a girl with very small canine teeth. And to know how old she was when she died  what you do is you do an informed estimate  and you say  how much time would be required to form this amount of teeth  and the answer was three. So  this girl died when she was about three   .  million years ago. So  with all that information  the big question is    what do we actually    what does she tell us  To answer this question  we can phrase another question. What do we actually know about our ancestors  We want to know how they looked like  how they behaved  how they walked around  and how they lived and grew up. And among the answers that you can get from this skeleton are included  first  this skeleton documents  for the first time  how infants looked over three million years ago. And second  she tells us that she walked upright  but had some adaptation for tree climbing. And more interesting  however  is the brain in this child was still growing. At age three  if you have a still growing brain  it's a human behavior. In chimps  by age three  the brain is formed over    percent. That's why they can cope with their environment very easily after birth    faster than us  anyway. But in humans  we continue to grow our brains. That's why we need care from our parents. But that care means also you learn. You spend more time with your parents. And that's very characteristic of humans and it's called childhood  which is this extended dependence of human children on their family or parents. So  the still growing brain in this individual tells us that childhood  which requires an incredible social organization  a very complex social organization  emerged over three million years ago. So  by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history  Selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human. But not everything was human  and I will give you a very exciting example. This is called the hyoid bone. It's a bone which is right here. It supports your tongue from behind. It's  in a way  your voice box. It determines the type of voice you produce. It was not known in the fossil record  and we have it in this skeleton. When we did the analysis of this bone  it was clear that it looked very chimp like  chimpanzee like. So if you were there  .  million years ago  to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother  she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human. Maybe you're wondering   So  you see this ape feature  human feature  ape feature. What does that tell us   You know  that is very exciting for us  because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively  and that evolution is in the making. To summarize the significance of this fossil  we can say the following. Up to now  the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils  the baby fossils  were missing. They don't preserve well  as you know. So the knowledge that we had about our ancestors  on how they looked like  how they behaved  was kind of biased toward adults. Imagine somebody coming from Mars and his job is to report on the type of people occupying our planet Earth  and you hide all the babies  the children  and he goes back and reports. Can you imagine how much biased his report would be  That's what somehow we were doing so far in the absence of the fossil children  so I think the new fossil fixes this problem. So  I think the most important question at the end is  what do we actually learn from specimens like this and from our past in general  Of course  in addition to extracting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human  you know  the many human ancestors that have existed over the past six million years    and there are more than       they did not have the knowledge  the technology and sophistications that we  Homo sapiens  have today. But if this species  ancient species  would travel in time and see us today  they would very much be very proud of their legacy  because they became the ancestors of the most successful species in the universe. And they were probably not aware of this future legacy  but they did great. Now the question is  we Homo sapiens today are in a position to decide about the future of our planet  possibly more. So the question is  are we up to the challenge  And can we really do better than these primitive  small brained ancestors  Among the most pressing challenges that our species is faced with today are the chronic problems of Africa. Needless to list them here  and there are more competent people to talk about this. Still  in my opinion  we have two choices. One is to continue to see a poor  ill  crying Africa  carrying guns  that depends on other people forever  or to promote an Africa which is confident  peaceful  independent  but cognizant of its huge problems and great values at the same time. I am for the second option  and I'm sure many of you are. And the key is to promote a positive African attitude towards Africa. That's because we Africans concentrate    I am from Ethiopia  by the way    we concentrate too much on how we are seen from elsewhere  or from outside. I think it's important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves. That's what I call positive African attitude. So finally  I would like to say  so let's help Africa walk upright and forward  then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species. Thank you. On simplicity. What a great way to start. First of all  I've been watching this trend where we have these books like such and such  For Dummies.  Do you know these books  these such and such  For Dummies   My daughters pointed out that I'm very similar looking  so this is a bit of a problem. But I was looking online at Amazon.com for other books like this. You know  there's also something called the  Complete Idiot's Guide   There's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense. We like to have technology make us feel bad  for some strange reason. But I really like that  so I wrote a book called  The Laws of Simplicity.  I was in Milan last week  for the Italian launch. It's kind of a book about questions  questions about simplicity. Very few answers. I'm also wondering myself  what is simplicity  Is it good  Is it bad  Is complexity better  I'm not sure. After I wrote  The Laws of Simplicity   I was very tired of simplicity  as you can imagine. And so in my life  I've discovered that vacation is the most important skill for any kind of over achiever. Because your companies will always take away your life  but they can never take away your vacation    in theory. So  I went to the Cape last summer to hide from simplicity  and I went to the Gap  because I only have black pants. So I went and bought khaki shorts or whatever  and unfortunately  their branding was all about  Keep It Simple.  I opened up a magazine  and Visa's branding was   Business Takes Simplicity.  I develop photographs  and Kodak said   Keep It Simple.  So  I felt kind of weird that simplicity was sort of following me around. So  I turned on the TV  and I don't watch TV very much  but you know this person  This is Paris Hilton  apparently. And she has this show   The Simple Life.  So I watched this. It's not very simple  a little bit confusing. So  I looked for a different show to watch. So  I opened up this TV Guide thing  and on the E  channel  this  Simple Life  show is very popular. They'll play it over  and over  and over. So it was traumatizing  actually. So  I wanted to escape again  so I went out to my car. And Cape Cod  there are idyllic roads  and all of us can drive in this room. And when you drive  these signs are very important. It's a very simple sign  it says   road  and  road approaching.  So I'm mostly driving along  okay  and then I saw this sign. So  I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly  so I thought   Ah  simplicity. Very important.  But then I thought   Oh  simplicity. What would that be like on a beach  What if the sky was    percent gray  Wouldn't that be the perfect sky   I mean that simplicity sky. But in reality  the sky looked like this. It was a beautiful  complex sky. You know  with the pinks and blues. We can't help but love complexity. We're human beings  we love complex things. We love relationships    very complex. So we love this kind of stuff. I'm at this place called the Media Lab. Maybe some of you guys have heard of this place. It's designed by I. M. Pei  one of the premier modernist architects. Modernism means white box  and it's a perfect white box. And some of you guys are entrepreneurs  etc.  whatever. Last month  I was at Google  and  boy  that cafeteria  man. You guys have things here in Silicon Valley like stock options. See  in academia  we get titles  lots of titles. Last year at TED  these were all my titles. I had a lot of titles. I have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters. This year at TED  I'm happy to report that I have new titles  in addition to my previous titles. Another  Associate Director of Research.  And this also happened  so I have five daughters now. That's my baby Reina.  Applause  Thank you. And so  my life is much more complex because of the baby  actually  but that's okay. We will still stay married  I think. But looking way back  when I was a child    you see  I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle. Many of you may not like tofu because you haven't had good tofu  but tofu's a good food. It's a very simple kind of food. It's very hard work to make tofu. As a child  we used to wake up at   a.m. and work till   p.m.  six days a week. My father was kind of like Andy Grove  paranoid of the competition. So often  seven days a week. Family business equals child labor. We were a great model. So  I loved going to school. School was great  and maybe going to school helped me get to this Media Lab place  I'm not sure. Thank you. But the Media Lab is an interesting place  and it's important to me because as a student  I was a computer science undergrad  and I discovered design later on in my life. And there was this person  Muriel Cooper. Who knows Muriel Cooper  Muriel Cooper  Wasn't she amazing  Muriel Cooper. She was wacky. And she was a TEDster  exactly  and she showed us  she showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again. And she's very important in my life  because she's the one that told me to leave MIT and go to art school. It was the best advice I ever got. So I went to art school  because of her. She passed away in       and I was hired back to MIT to try to fill her shoes  but it's so hard. This amazing person  Muriel Cooper. When I was in Japan    I went to an art school in Japan    I had a nice sort of situation  because somehow I was connected to Paul Rand. Some of you guys know Paul Rand  the greatest graphic designer    I'm sorry    out there. The great graphic designer Paul Rand designed the IBM logo  the Westinghouse logo. He basically said   I've designed everything.  And also Ikko Tanaka was a very important mentor in my life    the Paul Rand of Japan. He designed most of the major icons of Japan  like Issey Miyake's brand and also Muji. When you have mentors    and yesterday  Kareem Abdul Jabbar talked about mentors  these people in your life    the problem with mentors is that they all die. This is a sad thing  but it's actually a happy thing in a way  because you can remember them in their pure form. I think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us. When you get older  and you're all freaked out  whatever  the mentors calm us down. And I'm grateful for my mentors  and I'm sure all of you are too. Because the human thing is very hard when you're at MIT. The T doesn't stand for  human   it stands for  technology.  And because of that  I always wondered about this human thing. So  I've always been Googling this word   human   to find out how many hits I get. And in       I had    million hits  and for  computer   because computers are against humans a bit  I have    million hits. Let me do an Al Gore here. So  if you sort of compare that  like this  you'll see that computer versus human    I've been tracking this for the last year    computer versus human over the last year has changed. It used to be kind of two to one. Now  humans are catching up. Very good  us humans  We're catching up with the computers. In the simplicity realm  it's also interesting. So if you compare complexities to simplicity  it's also catching up in a way  too. So  somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined  I think. I have a confession  I'm not a man of simplicity. I spent my entire early career making complex stuff. Lots of complex stuff. I wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this. I had clients in Japan to make really complex stuff like this. And I've always felt bad about it  in a sense. So  I hid in a time dimension. I built things in a time graphics dimension. I did this series of calendars for Shiseido. This is a floral theme calendar in       and this is a firework calendar. So  you launch the number into space  because the Japanese believe that when you see fireworks  you're cooler for some reason. This is why they have fireworks in the summer. A very extreme culture. Lastly  this is a fall based calendar  because I have so many leaves in my yard. So this is the leaves in my yard  essentially. And so I made a lot of these types of things. I've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things  and so I made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes. I feel kind of bad about that. Tomorrow  Paola Antonelli is speaking. I love Paola. She has this show right now at MoMA  where some of these early works are here on display at MoMA  on the walls. If you're in New York  please go and see that. But I've had a problem  because I make all this flying stuff and people say   Oh  I know your work. You're the guy that makes eye candy.  And when you're told this  you feel kind of weird.  Eye candy     sort of pejorative  don't you think  So  I say   No  I make eye meat   instead. And eye meat is something different  something more fibrous  something more powerful  perhaps. But what could that be  eye meat  I've been interested in computer programs all my life  actually. Computer programs are essentially trees  and when you make art with a computer program  there's kind of a problem. Whenever you make art with a computer program  you're always on the tree  and the paradox is that for excellent art  you want to be off the tree. So  this is sort of a complication I've found. So  to get off the tree  I began to use my old computers. I took these to Tokyo in      to make computer objects. This is a new way to type  on my old  color Classic. You can't type very much on this. I also discovered that an IR mouse responds to CRT emissions and starts to move by itself  so this is a self drawing machine. And also  one year  the G  Bondi Blue thing    that caddy would come out  like  dangerous  like   whack   like that. But I thought   This is very interesting. What if I make like a car crash test   So I have a crash test. And sort of measure the impact. Stuff like this are things I made  just to sort of understand what these things are. Shortly after this       happened  and I was very depressed. I was concerned with contemporary art that was all about piss  and sort of really sad things  and so I wanted to think about something happy. So I focused on food as my area    these sort of clementine peel things. In Japan  it's a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel just in one piece. Who's done that before  One piece clementine  Oh  you guys are missing out  if you haven't done it yet. It was very good  and I discovered I can make sculptures out of this  actually  in different forms. If you dry them quick  you can make  like  elephants and steers and stuff  and my wife didn't like these  because they mold  so I had to stop that. So  I went back to the computer  and I bought five large fries  and scanned them all. And I was looking for some kind of food theme  and I wrote some software to automatically lay out french fry images. And as a child  I'd hear that song  you know   Oh  beautiful  for spacious skies  for amber waves of grain   so I made this amber waves image. It's sort of a Midwest cornfield out of french fries. And also  as a child  I was the fattest kid in class  so I used to love Cheetos. Oh  I love Cheetos  yummy. So  I wanted to play with Cheetos in some way. I wasn't sure where to go with this. I invented Cheeto paint. Cheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with Cheetos. I discovered that Cheetos are good  expressive material. And with these Cheetos  I began to think   What can I make with these Cheetos   And so  I began to crinkle up potato chip flecks  and also pretzels. I was looking for some kind of form  and in the end  I made     butter fries. Do you get it  And each butter fry is composed of different pieces. People ask me how they make the antenna. Sometimes  they find a hair in the food. That's my hair. My hair's clean    it's okay. I'm a tenured professor  which means  basically  I don't have to work anymore. It's a strange business model. I can come into work everyday and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte. End of story. But I realized that life could be very boring  so I've been thinking about life  and I notice that my camera    my digital camera versus my car  a very strange thing. The car is so big  the camera is so small  yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual. It doesn't make any sense. So  I was in the Cape one time  and I typed the word  simplicity   and I discovered  in this weird  M. Night Shyamalan way  that I discovered  the  letters  M  I  T. You know the word  In the words  simplicity  and  complexity   M  I  T occur in perfect sequence. It's a bit eerie  isn't it  So  I thought  maybe I'll do this for the next twenty years or something. And I wrote this book   The Laws of Simplicity.  It's a very short  simple book. There are ten laws and three keys. The ten laws and three keys    I won't go over them because that's why I have a book  and also that's why it's on the Web for free. But the laws are kind of like sushi in a way  there are all kinds. In Japan  they say that sushi is challenging. You know the uni is the most challenging  so number ten is challenging. People hate number ten like they hate uni  actually. The three keys are easy to eat  so this is anago  cooked already  so easy to eat. So enjoy your sushi meal later  with the laws of simplicity. Because I want to simplify them for you. Because that's what this is about. I have to simplify this thing. So  if I simplify the laws of simplicity  I have what's called the cookie versus laundry thing. Anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid a big cookie or a small cookie  which cookie are they going to take  The big cookie. You can say the small cookie has Godiva chocolate bits in it  but it doesn't work. They want the big cookie. But if you offer kids two piles of laundry to fold  the small pile or the big pile  which will they choose  Strangely  not the big pile. So  I think it's as simple as this. You know  when you want more  it's because you want to enjoy it. When you want less  it's because it's about work. And so  to boil it all down  simplicity is about living life with more enjoyment and less pain. I think this is sort of simple more versus less. Basically  it always depends. This book I wrote because I want to figure out life. I love life. I love being alive. I like to see things. And so life is a big question  I think  in simplicity  because you're trying to simplify your life. And I just love to see the world. The world is an amazing place. By being at TED  we see so many things at one time. And I can't help but enjoy looking at everything in the world. Like everything you see  every time you wake up. It's such a joy to sort of experience everything in the world. From everything from a weird hotel lobby  to Saran wrap placed over your window  to this moment where I had my road in front of my house paved dark black  and this white moth was sitting there dying in the sun. And so  this whole thing has struck me as exciting to be here  because life is finite. This was given to me by the chairman of Shiseido. He's an expert in aging. This horizontal axis is how old you are    twelve years old  twenty four years old  seventy four  ninety six years old    and this is some medical data. So  brain strength increases up to     and then after     it sort of goes down. Kind of depressing in a way. Also  if you look at your physical strength. You know  I have a lot of cocky freshmen at MIT  so I tell them   Oh  your bodies are really getting stronger and stronger  but in your late twenties and mid thirties  cells  they die.  OK. It gets them to work harder  sometimes. And if you have your vision  vision is interesting. As you age from infant age  your vision gets better  and maybe in your late teens  early twenties  you're looking for a mate  and your vision goes after that. Your social responsibility is very interesting. So  as you get older  you may  like  have kids  whatever. And then the kids graduate  and you have no responsibility any more    that's very good  too. But if any of you people ask   What actually goes up  Does anything go up  What's the positive part of this  you know   I think wisdom always goes up. I love these eighty year old  ninety year old guys and women. They have so many thoughts  and they have so much wisdom  and I think    you know  this TED thing  I've come here. And this is the fourth time  and I come here for this wisdom  I think. This whole TED effect  it sort of ups your wisdom  somehow. And I'm so glad to be here  and I'm very grateful to be here  Chris. And this is an amazing experience for me as well. The advances that have taken place in astronomy  cosmology and biology  in the last    years  are really extraordinary    to the point where we know more about our universe and how it works than many of you might imagine. But there was something else that I've noticed as those changes were taking place  as people were starting to find out that hmm ... yeah  there really is a black hole at the center of every galaxy. The science writers and editors    I shouldn't say science writers  I should say people who write about science    and editors would sit down over a couple of beers  after a hard day of work  and start talking about some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works. And they would inevitably end up in what I thought was a very bizarre place  which is ways the world could end very suddenly. And that's what I want to talk about today.  Laughter  Ah  you laugh  you fools.  Laughter  Stephen Petranek  At first  it all seemed a little fantastical to me  but after challenging a lot of these ideas  I began to take a lot of them seriously. And then September    happened  and I thought  ah  God  I can't go to the TED conference and talk about how the world is going to end. Nobody wants to hear that. Not after this  And that got me into a discussion with some other people  other scientists  about maybe some other subjects  and one of the guys I talked to  who was a neuroscientist  said   You know  I think there are a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up   and reminds me of Michael's talk yesterday and his mother saying you can't have a solution if you don't have a problem. So  we went out looking for solutions to ways that the world might end tomorrow  and lo and behold  we found them. Which leads me to a videotape of a President Bush press conference from a couple of weeks ago. Can we run that  Andrew  President George W. Bush  Whatever it costs to defend our security  and whatever it costs to defend our freedom  we must pay it. SP  I agree with the president. He wants two trillion dollars to protect us from terrorists next year  a two trillion dollar federal budget  which will land us back into deficit spending real fast. But terrorists aren't the only threat we face. There are really serious calamities staring us in the eye that we're in the same kind of denial about that we were about terrorism  and what could've happened on September   . I would propose  therefore  that if we took    billion dollars from that  .   trillion dollar budget    which is two one hundredths of that budget    and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems I'm going to talk to you about  the vast majority could be solved  and the rest we could deal with. So  I hope you find this both fascinating    I'm fascinated by this kind of stuff  I gotta admit    to me these are Richard's cockroaches. But I also hope  because I think the people in this room can literally change the world  I hope you take some of this stuff away with you  and when you have an opportunity to be influential  that you try to get some heavy duty money spent on some of these ideas. So let's start. Number     we lose the will to survive. We live in an incredible age of modern medicine. We are all much healthier than we were    years ago. People around the world are getting better medicine    but mentally  we're falling apart. The World Health Organization now estimates that one out of five people on the planet is clinically depressed. And the World Health Organization also says that depression is the biggest epidemic that humankind has ever faced. Soon  genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine are going to allow us to think of     as a normal lifespan. A female child born tomorrow  on average    median    will live to age   . Our life longevity is going up almost a year for every year that passes. Now the problem with all of this  getting older  is that people over    are the most likely people to commit suicide. So  what are the solutions  We don't really have mental health insurance in this country  and it's     Applause     it's really a crime. Something like    percent of all people with depression  and I mean really severe depression    I have a friend with stunningly severe depression    this is a curable disease  with present medicine and present technology. But it is often a combination of talk therapy and pills. Pills alone don't do it  especially in clinically depressed people. You ought to be able to go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist  and put down your    dollar copay  and get treated  just like you do when you got a cut on your arm. It's ridiculous. Secondly  drug companies are not going to develop really sophisticated psychoactive drugs. We know that most mental illnesses have a biological component that can be dealt with. And we know just an amazing amount more about the brain now than we did    years ago. We need a pump push from the federal government  through NIH and National Science    NSF    and places like that to start helping the drug companies develop some advanced psychoactive drugs. Moving on. Number nine    don't laugh    aliens invade Earth. Ten years ago  you couldn't have found an astronomer    well  very few astronomers    in the world who would've told you that there are any planets anywhere outside our solar system.       we found three. The count now is up to       we're finding about two or three a month. All of the ones we've found  by the way  are in this little  teeny  tiny corner where we live  in the Milky Way. There must be millions of planets in the Milky Way  and as Carl Sagan insisted for many years  and was laughed at for it  there must be billions and billions in the universe. In a few years  NASA is going to launch four or five telescopes out to Jupiter  where there's less dust  and start looking for Earth like planets  which we cannot see with present technology  nor detect. It's becoming obvious that the chance that life does not exist elsewhere in the universe  and probably fairly close to us  is a fairly remote idea. And the chance that some of it isn't more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea. Remember  we've only been an advanced civilization    an industrial civilization  if you would    for     years. Although every time I go to Pompeii  I'm amazed that they had the equivalent of a McDonald's on every street corner  too. So  I don't know how much civilization really has progressed since AD     but there's a great likelihood. I really believe this  and I don't believe in aliens  and I don't believe there are any aliens on the Earth or anything like that. But there's a likelihood that we will confront a civilization that is more intelligent than our own. Now  what will happen  What if they come to  you know  suck up our oceans for the hydrogen  And swat us away like flies  the way we swat away flies when we go into the rainforest and start logging it. We can look at our own history. The late physicist Gerard O'Neill said   Advanced Western civilization has had a destructive effect on all primitive civilizations it has come in contact with  even in those cases where every attempt was made to protect and guard the primitive civilization.  If the aliens come visiting  we're the primitive civilization. So  what are the solutions to this   Laughter  Thank God you can all read  It may seem ridiculous  but we have a really lousy history of anticipating things like this and actually being prepared for them. How much energy and money does it take to actually have a plan to negotiate with an advanced species  Secondly    and you're going to hear more from me about this    we have to become an outward looking  space faring nation. We have got to develop the idea that the Earth doesn't last forever  our sun doesn't last forever. If we want humanity to last forever  we have to colonize the Milky Way. And that is not something that is beyond comprehension at this point. It'll also help us a lot  if we meet an advanced civilization along the way  if we're trying to be an advanced civilization. Number eight    SP  You've got it  You've got the job. Number eight  the ecosystem collapses. Last July  in Science  the journal Science     oceanographers published a very  very unusual article. It wasn't really a research report  it was a screed. They said  we've been looking at the oceans for a long time now  and we want to tell you they're not in trouble  they're near collapse. Many other ecosystems on Earth are in real  real danger. We're living in a time of mass extinctions that exceeds the fossil record by a factor of       . We have lost    percent of the unique species in Hawaii in the last    years. California is expected to lose    percent of its species in the next    years. Somewhere in the Amazon forest is the marginal tree. You cut down that tree  the rain forest collapses as an ecosystem. There's really a tree like that out there. That's really what it comes to. And when that ecosystem collapses  it could take a major ecosystem with it  like our atmosphere. So  what do we do about this  What are the solutions  There is some modeling of ecosystems going on now. The problem with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly  that we don't know they're really in trouble until it's almost too late. We need to know earlier that they're getting in trouble  and we need to be able to pump possible solutions into models. And with the kind of computing power we have now  there is  as I say  some of this going on  but it needs money. National Science Foundation needs to say    you know  almost all the money that's spent on science in this country comes from the federal government  one way or another. And they get to prioritize  you know  There are people at the National Science Foundation who get to say  this is the most important thing. This is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about. Secondly  we need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet  and start moving them around. There's been an experiment for the last four or five years on the Georges Bank  or the Grand Banks off of Newfoundland. It's a no take fishing zone. They can't fish there for a radius of     miles. And an amazing thing has happened  almost all the fish have come back  and they're reproducing like crazy. We're going to have to start doing this around the globe. We're going to have to have no take zones. We're going to have to say  no more logging in the Amazon for    years. Let it recover  before we start logging again. Number seven  particle accelerator mishap. You all remember Ted Kaczynski  the Unabomber  One of the things he raved about was that a particle accelerator experiment could go haywire and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world. A lot of very sober minded physicists  believe it or not  have had exactly the same thought. This spring    there's a collider at Brookhaven  on Long Island    this spring  it's going to have an experiment in which it creates black holes. They are expecting to create little  tiny black holes. They expect them to evaporate.  Laughter  I hope they're right.  Laughter  Other collider experiments    there's one that's going to take place next summer at CERN    have the possibility of creating something called strangelets  which are kind of like antimatter. Whenever they hit other matter  they destroy it and obliterate it. Most physicists say that the accelerators we have now are not really powerful enough to create black holes and strangelets that we need to worry about  and they're probably right. But  all around the world  in Japan  in Canada  there's talk about this  of reviving this in the United States. We shut one down that was going to be big. But there's talk of building very big accelerators. What can we do about this  What are the solutions  We've got the fox watching the henhouse here. We need to    we need the advice of particle physicists to talk about particle physics and what should be done in particle physics  but we need some outside thinking and watchdogging of what's going on with these experiments. Secondly  we have a natural laboratory surrounding the Earth. We have an electromagnetic field around the Earth  and it's constantly bombarded by high energy particles  like protons. And in my opinion  we don't spend enough time looking at that natural laboratory and figuring out first what's safe to do on Earth. Number six  biotech disaster. It's one of my favorite ones  because we've done several stories on Bt corn. Bt corn is a corn that creates its own pesticide to kill a corn borer. You may of heard of it    heard it called StarLink  especially when all those taco shells were taken out of the supermarkets about a year and a half ago. This stuff was supposed to only be feed for animals in the United States  and it got into the human food supply  and somebody should've figured out that it would get in the human food supply very easily. But the thing that's alarming is a couple of months ago  in Mexico  where Bt corn and all genetically altered corn is totally illegal  they found Bt corn genes in wild corn plants. Now  corn originated  we think  in Mexico. This is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn. This brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently  that superweeds and superpests could spread around the world  from biotechnology  that literally could destroy the world's food supply in very short order. So  what do we do about that  We treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants. It's that simple. This is an amazingly unregulated field. When the StarLink disaster happened  there was a battle between the EPA and the FDA over who really had authority  and over what parts of this  and they didn't get it straightened out for months. That's kind of crazy. Number five  one of my favorites  reversal of the Earth's magnetic field. Believe it or not  this happens every few hundred thousand years  and has happened many times in our history. North Pole goes to the South  South Pole goes to the North  and vice versa. But what happens  as this occurs  is that we lose our magnetic field around the Earth over the period of about     years  and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles that are to come streaming at us from the sun  that this field protects us from  are    well  basically  we're gonna fry.  Laughter  SP  So  what can we do about this  Oh  by the way  we're overdue. It's been         years since this happened. So  it should have happened about         years ago. Oh  and here's one other thing. Scientists think now our magnetic field may be diminished by about five percent. So  maybe we're in the throes of it. One of the problems of trying to figure out how healthy the Earth is  is that we have    you know  we don't have good weather data from    years ago  much less data on things like the ozone layer. So  there's a fairly simple solution to this. There's going to be a lot of cheap rocketry that's going to come online in about six or seven years that gets us into the low atmosphere very cheaply. You know  we can make ozone from car tailpipes. It's not hard  it's just three oxygen atoms. If you brought the entire ozone layer down to the surface of the Earth  it would be the thickness of two pennies  at    pounds per square inch. You don't need that much up there. We need to learn how to repair and replenish the Earth's ozone layer. Number four  giant solar flares. Solar flares are enormous magnetic outbursts from the Sun that bombard the Earth with high speed subatomic particles. So far  our atmosphere has done  and our magnetic field has done pretty well protecting us from this. Occasionally  we get a flare from the Sun that causes havoc with communications and so forth  and electricity. But the alarming thing is that astronomers recently have been studying stars that are similar to our Sun  and they've found that a number of them  when they're about the age of our Sun  brighten by a factor of as much as   . Doesn't last for very long. And they think these are super flares  millions of times more powerful than any flares we've had from our Sun so far. Obviously  we don't want one of those.  Laughter  There's a flip side to it. In studying stars like our Sun  we've found that they go through periods of diminishment  when their total amount of energy that's expelled from them goes down by maybe one percent. One percent doesn't sound like a lot  but it would cause one hell of an ice age here. So  what can we do about this  I wrote a story about this in Life magazine in     . This is rocket science  but it's not hard rocket science. Everything that we need to make an atmosphere on Mars  and to make a livable planet on Mars  is probably there. And you just  literally  have to send little nuclear factories up there that gobble up the iron oxide on the surface of Mars and spit out the oxygen. The problem is it takes     years to terraform Mars  minimum. Really more like     years to do it right. There's no reason why we shouldn't start now.  Laughter  Number three    isn't this stuff cool   Laughter  A new global epidemic. People have been at war with germs ever since there have been people  and from time to time  the germs sure get the upper hand. In       we had a flu epidemic in the United States that killed    million people. That was back when the population was around     million people. The bubonic plague in Europe  in the Middle Ages  killed one out of four Europeans. AIDS is coming back. Ebola seems to be rearing its head with much too much frequency  and old diseases like cholera are becoming resistant to antibiotics. We've all learned what    the kind of panic that can occur when an old disease rears its head  like anthrax. The worst possibility is that a very simple germ  like staph  for which we have one antibiotic that still works  mutates. And we know staph can do amazing things. A staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow genes from it when antibiotics come  and change and mutate. The danger is that some germ like staph will be    will mutate into something that's really virulent  very contagious  and will sweep through populations before we can do anything about it. That's happened before. About        years ago  there was a massive wave of mammal extinctions in the Americas  and that is thought to have been a virulent disease. So  what can we do about it  It is nuts. We give antibiotics     Applause     every cow  every lamb  every chicken  they get antibiotics every day  all. You know  you go to a restaurant  you eat fish  I got news for you  it's all farmed. You know  you gotta ask when you go to a restaurant if it's a wild fish  cause they're not going to tell you. We're giving away the code. This is like being at war and giving somebody your secret code. We're telling the germs out there how to fight us. We gotta fix that. We gotta outlaw that right away. Secondly  our public health system  as we saw with anthrax  is a real disaster. We have a real  major outbreak of disease in the United States  we are not prepared to cope with it. Now  there is money in the federal budget  next year  to build up the public health service. But I don't think to any extent that it really needs to be done. Number two    my favorite    we meet a rogue black hole. You know     years ago  or    years ago  really  you walk into an astronomy convention  and you say   You know  there's probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy   and they're going to hoot you off the stage. And now  if you went into one of those conventions and you said   Well  I don't think black holes are out there   they'd hoot you off the stage. Our comprehension of the way the universe works is really    has just gained unbelievably in recent years. We think that there are about    million dead stars in the Milky Way alone  our galaxy. And these stars have compressed down to maybe something like        miles wide  and they are black holes. And they are gobbling up everything around them  including light  which is why we can't see them. Most of them should be in orbit around something. But galaxies are very violent places  and things can be spun out of orbit. And also  space is incredibly vast. So even if you flung a million of these things out of orbit  the chances that one would actually hit us is fairly remote. But it only has to get close  about a billion miles away  one of these things. About a billion miles away  here's what happens to Earth's orbit  it becomes elliptical instead of circular. And for three months out of the year  the surface temperatures go up to     to    . For three months out of the year  they go to    below zero. That won't work too well. What can we do about this  And this is my scariest.  Laughter  I don't have a good answer for this one. Again  we gotta think about being a colonizing race. And finally  number one  biggest danger to life as we know it  I think  a really big asteroid heads for Earth. The important thing to remember here    this is not a question of if  this is a question of when  and how big. In       just a     foot piece of a comet exploded over Siberia and flattened forests for maybe     miles. It had the effect of about       Hiroshima bombs. Astronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years. In       a large asteroid passed         miles away from Earth. Nothing to worry about  right  It passed directly through Earth's orbit. We were in that that spot six hours earlier. A small asteroid  say a half mile wide  would touch off firestorms followed by severe global cooling from the debris kicked up    Carl Sagan's nuclear winter thing. An asteroid five miles wide causes major extinctions. We think the one that got the dinosaurs was about five miles wide. Where are they  There's something called the Kuiper belt  which    some people think Pluto's not a planet  that's where Pluto is  it's in the Kuiper belt. There's also something a little farther out  called the Oort cloud. There are about         balls of ice and rock    comets  really    out there  that are    miles in diameter or more  and they regularly take a little spin  in towards the Sun and pass reasonably close to us. Of more concern  I think  is the asteroids that exist between Mars and Jupiter. The folks at the Sloan Digital Sky Survey told us last fall    they're making the first map of the universe  three dimensional map of the universe    that there are probably         asteroids between Mars and Jupiter that are a half a mile big or bigger. So you say  yeah  well  what are really the chances of this happening  Andrew  can you put that chart up  This is a chart that Dr. Clark Chapman at the Southwest Research Institute presented to Congress a few years ago. You'll notice that the chance of an asteroid slash comet impact killing you is about one in         according to the work they've done. Now look at the one right below that. Passenger aircraft crash  one in       . We spend an awful lot of money trying to be sure that we don't die in airplane accidents  and we're not spending hardly anything on this. And yet  this is completely preventable. We finally have  just in the last year  the technology to stop this cold. Could we have the solutions  NASA's spending three million dollars a year  three million bucks    that is like pocket change    to search for asteroids. Because we can actually figure out every asteroid that's out there  and if it might hit Earth  and when it might hit Earth. And they're trying to do that. But it's going to take them    years  at spending three million dollars a year  and even then  they claim they'll only have about    percent of them catalogued. Comets are a tougher act. We don't really have the technology to predict comet trajectories  or when one with our name on it might arrive. But we would have lots of time  if we see it coming. We really need a dedicated observatory. You'll notice that a lot of comets are named after people you never heard of  amateur astronomers  That's because nobody's looking for them  except amateurs. We need a dedicated observatory that looks for comets. Part two of the solutions  we need to figure out how to blow up an asteroid  or alter its trajectory. Now  a year ago  we did an amazing thing. We sent a probe out to this asteroid belt  called NEAR  Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous. And these guys orbited a       or no  about a    mile long asteroid called Eros. And then  of course  you know  they pulled one of those sneaky NASA things  where they had extra batteries and extra gas aboard and everything  and then  at the last minute  they landed. When the mission was over  they actually landed on the thing. We have landed a rocket ship on an asteroid. It's not a big deal. Now  the trouble with just sending a bomb out for this thing is that you don't have anything to push against in space  because there's no air. A nuclear explosion is just as hot  but we don't really have anything big enough to melt a    mile long asteroid  or vaporize it  would be more like it. But we can learn to land on these asteroids that have our name on them and put something like a small ion propulsion motor on it  which would gently  slowly  after a period of time  push it into a different trajectory  which  if we've done our math right  would keep it from hitting Earth. This is just a matter of finding 'em  going there  and doing something about it. I know your head is spinning from all this stuff. Yikes  So many big threats  The thing  I think  to remember  is September   . We don't want to get caught flat footed again. We know about this stuff. Science has the power to predict the future in many cases now. Knowledge is power. The worst thing we can do is say  jeez  I got enough to worry about without worrying about an asteroid.  Laughter  That's a mistake that could literally cost us our future. Thank you. I am known best for human powered flight  but that was just one thing that got me going in the sort of things that I'm working in now. As a youngster  I was very interested in model airplanes  ornithopters  autogyros  helicopters  gliders  power planes  indoor models  outdoor models  everything  which I just thought was a lot of fun  and wondered why most other people didn't share my same enthusiasm with them. And then  navy pilot training  and  after college  I got into sailplane flying  power plane flying  and considered the sailplanes as a sort of hobby and fun  but got tangled up with some great professor types  who convinced me and everybody else in the field that this was a good way to get into really deep science. While this was all going on  I was in the field of weather modification  although getting a Ph.D. in aeronautics. The weather modification subject was getting started  and as a graduate student  I could go around to the various talks that were being given  on a hitchhiker ride to the East Coast  and so on. And everybody would talk to me  but all the professionals in the field hated each other  and they wouldn't communicate. And as a result  I got the absolutely unique background in that field  and started a company  which did more research in weather modification than anybody  and there are a lot of things that I just can't go into. But then       started AeroVironment  with no employees    then one or two  three  and sort of fumbled along on trying to get interesting projects. We had AirDynamisis  who  like I  did not want to work for aerospace companies on some big  many year project  and so we did our small projects  and the company slowly grew. The thing that is exciting was  in       I suddenly got interested in the human powered airplane because I'd made a made a loan to a friend of         dollars  or I guaranteed the money at the bank. He needed them    he needed the money for starting a company. The company did not succeed  and he couldn't pay the money back  and I was the guarantor of the note. So  I had a          debt  and I noticed that the Kramer prize for human powered flight  which had then been around for     Laughter        years at the time  was        pounds  which  at the exchange rate  was just about         dollars. So suddenly  I was interested in human powered flight    and did not    the way I approached it  first  thinking about ways to make the planes  was just like they'd been doing in England  and not succeeding  and I gave it up. I figured  nah  there isn't any simple  easy way. But then  got off on a vacation trip  and was studying bird flight  just for the fun of it  and you can watch a bird soaring around in circles  and measure the time  and estimate the bank angle  and immediately  figure out its speed  and the turning radius  and so on  which I could do in the car  as we're driving along on a vacation trip    with my three sons  young sons  helping me  but ridiculing the whole thing very much. But that began thinking about how birds went around  and then how airplanes would  how hang gliders would fly  and then other planes  and the idea of the Gossamer Condor type airplane quickly emerged  was so logical  one should have thought of it in the first place  but one didn't. And it was just  keep the weight down       pounds was all it weighed    but let the size swell up  like a hang glider  but three times the span  three times the cord. You're down to a third of the speed  a third of the power  and a good bicyclist can put out that power  and that worked  and we won the prize a year later. We didn't    a lot of flying  a lot of experiments  a lot of things that didn't work  and ones that did work  and the plane kept getting a little better  a little better. Got a good pilot  Brian Allen  to operate it  and finally  succeeded. But unfortunately  about        dollars was spent on the project. And there was only about    to help retire the debt. But fortunately  Henry Kramer  who put up the prize for    that was a one mile flight    put up a new prize for flying the English Channel     miles. And he thought it would take another    years for somebody to win that. We realized that if you just cleaned up our Gossamer Condor a little bit  the power to fly would be decreased a little bit  and if you decrease the power required a little  the pilot can fly a much longer period of time. And Brian Allen was able  in a miraculous flight  to get the Gossamer Albatross across the English Channel  and we won the         pound          dollar prize for that. And when all expenses were paid  the debt was handled  and everything was fine. It turned out that giving the planes to the museum was worth much more than the debt  so for five years  six years  I only had to pay one third income tax. So  there were good economic reasons for the project  but    that's not  well  the project was done entirely for economic reasons  and we have not been involved in any human powered flight since then    because the prizes are all over. But that sure started me thinking about various things  and immediately  we began making a solar powered plane because we felt solar power was going to be so important for the country and the world  we didn't want the small funding in the government to be decreased  which is what the government was trying to do with it. And we thought a solar powered plane wouldn't really make sense  but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power and maybe help that field. And that project continued  did succeed  and we then got into other projects in aviation and mechanical things and ground devices. But while this was going on  in       I got a prize from the Lindbergh Foundation    their annual prize    and I had to prepare a paper on it  which collected all my varied thoughts and varied interests over the years. This was the one chance that I had to focus on what I  really  was after  and what was important. And to my surprise  I realized the importance of environmental issues  which Charles Lindbergh devoted the last third of his life to  and preparing that paper did me a lot of good. I thought back about if I was a space traveler  and came and visited Earth every       years. And for a few thousand visits  I would see the same thing every time  the little differences in the Earth. But this last time  just coming round  right now  suddenly  there'd be huge changes in the environment  in the concentration of people  and it was just unbelievable  the amount of    all the change in it. I wanted to    well  one of the biggest changes is      years ago  we began using coal from underground  which has a lot of pollution  and     years ago  began getting gasoline from underground  with a lot of pollution. And gasoline consumption  or production  will reach its limit in about ten years  and then go down  and we wonder what's going to happen with transportation. I wanted to show the slide    this slide  I think  is the most important one any of you will see  ever  because    it shows nature versus humans  and goes from      to     . And so  the year       you see there. And this is the weight of all air and land vertebrates. Humans and muskrats and giraffes and birds and so on  are    the red line goes up. That's the humans and livestock and pets portion. The green line goes down. That's the wild nature portion. Humans  livestock and pets are  now     percent of the total world's mass of vertebrates on land and air. And you don't know what the future will hold  but it's not going to get a lower percentage. Ten thousand years ago  the humans and livestock and pets were not even one tenth of one percent and wouldn't even have been visible on such a curve. Now they are    percent  and it  I think  shows human domination of the Earth. I give a talk to some remarkable high school students each summer  and ask them  after they've asked me questions  and I give them a talk and so on. Then I ask them questions. What's the population of the Earth  What's the population of the Earth going to be when you're the age of your parents  Which I'd never  really    they had never  really  thought about but  now  they think about it. And then  what population of the Earth would be an equilibrium that could continue on  and be for                   And they form little groups  all fighting with each other  and when I leave  two hours later  most of them are saying about   billion people  and they don't have any clue about how to get down to   billion  nor do I  but I think they're right and this is a serious problem. Rachel Carson was thinking of these  and came out with  Silent Spring   way back.  Solar Manifesto  by Hermann Scheer  in Germany  claims all energy on Earth can be derived  for every country  from solar energy and water  and so on. You don't need to dig down for these chemicals  and we can do things much more efficiently. Let's have the next slide. So this just summarizes it.  Over billions of years  on a unique sphere  chance has painted a thin covering of life    complex and probable  wonderful and fragile. Suddenly  we humans  a recently arrived species  no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature  have grown in population  technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power. We  now  wield the paintbrush.  We're in charge. It's frightening. And I do a painting every    or    years. This is the last one. And  it  shows the Earth in a time flag  on the right  in trilobites and dinosaurs and so on  and over the triangle  we now get to civilization and TV and traffic jams and so on. I have no idea of what comes next  so I just used robotic and natural cockroaches as the future  as a little warning. And two weeks after this drawing was done  we actually had our first project contract  at AeroVironment  on robotic cockroaches  which was very frightening to me. Well  that'll be all the slides. As time went on  we stopped our environmental programs. We focused more on the really serious energy problems of the future  and we produced products for the company. And we developed the impact car that General Motors made  the EV   out of    and got the Air Resources Board to have the regulations that stimulated the electric cars  but they've since come apart. And we've done a lot of things  small drone airplanes and so on. I have a Helios. We have the first video. Her designers' attention to detail and her construction gives Helios' structure the flexibility and strength to deal with the turbulence encountered in the atmosphere. This enables her to easily ride through the air currents as if she's sliding along on the ocean waves. Paul MacCready  The wings could touch together on top and not break. We think. Narrator  And Helios now begins the process of turning her back to the sun  to maximize the power from her solar array. As the sky gets darker  and the outside air temperatures drop below minus     degrees Fahrenheit  the most environmentally hostile segment of Helios's journey has gone by without notice  except for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems and their associated sensors. Approaching a peak radar altitude of        feet  at      p.m.  Helios is standing on top of    percent of the Earth's atmosphere. This is more than        feet higher than the previous world's altitude record held by the SR    Blackbird. PM  That plane has many purposes  but it's aimed for communications  and it can fly so slowly that it'll just stay up at        feet. Eventually  it will be able to have to stay up day  night  day  night  for six months at a time  acting like the synchronous satellite  but only ten miles above the Earth. Let's have the next video. This shows the other end of the spectrum. In effect a pair of roving eyeglasses  a cutting edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle. It is convenient to carry  assemble  and launch by hand. Battery powered  it is silent and rarely noticed. It sends high resolution video pictures back to the operator. With on board GPS  it can navigate autonomously  and it is rugged enough to self land without damage. PM  Okay  and let's have the next. That plane is widely used by the military  now  in all their operations. Let's have the next video. Alan Alda  He's got it  he's got it  he's got it on his head. We're going to end our visit with Paul MacCready's flying circus by meeting his son  Tyler  who  with his two brothers  helped build the Gossamer Condor     years ago. Tyler MacCready  You can chase it  like this  for hours. AA  When they got bored with their father's project  they invented an extraordinary little plane of their own. TM  And I can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing  or on the other. AA  They called it their Walkalong Glider. I've never seen anything like that. How old were you when you invented that  TM  Oh        .  AA  Oh my God.  TM      something like that.  AA  That's amazing.  PM  And Tyler's here to show you the Walkalong. TM  All right. You all got a couple of these in your gift bags  and one of the first things  the production version seemed to dive a little bit  and so I would just suggest you bend the wing tips up a little bit before you try flying it. I'll give you a demonstration of how it works. The idea is that it soars on the lift over your body  like a seagull soaring on a cliff. As the wind comes up  it has to go over the cliff  so as you walk through the air  it goes around your body  some has to go over you. And so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current. The launch is the difficult part  you've got to hold it high up  over your head  and you start walking forward  and just let go of it  and you can control it like that. And then also  like it said in the video  you can turn it left or right just by putting the lift under one wing or another. So I can do it    oops  that was going to be a right turn. Okay  this one will be a left turn. Here  but    anyway. And that's it  so you can just control it  wherever you want  and it's just hours of fun. And these are no longer in production  so you have real collector's items. And this  we just wanted to show you    if we can get the video running on this  yeah    just an example of a little video surveillance. This was flying around in the party last night  and    you can see how it just can fly around  and you can spy on anybody you want. And that's it. I was going to bring an airplane  but I was worried about hitting people in here  so I thought this would be a little bit more gentle. And that's it  yeah  just a few inventions. All right.
