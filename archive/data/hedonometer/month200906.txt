College presidents are not the first people who come to mind when the subject is the uses of the creative imagination. So I thought I'd start by telling you how I got here. The story begins in the late '  s. I was invited to meet with leading educators from the newly free Eastern Europe and Russia. They were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities. Since education under the Soviet Union was essentially propaganda serving the purposes of a state ideology  they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women. Given this rare opportunity to start fresh  they chose liberal arts as the most compelling model because of its historic commitment to furthering its students' broadest intellectual  and deepest ethical potential. Having made that decision they came to the United States  home of liberal arts education  to talk with some of us most closely identified with that kind of education. They spoke with a passion  an urgency  an intellectual conviction that  for me  was a voice I had not heard in decades  a dream long forgotten. For  in truth  we had moved light years from the passions that animated them. But for me  unlike them  in my world  the slate was not clean  and what was written on it was not encouraging. In truth  liberal arts education no longer exists    at least genuine liberal arts education    in this country. We have professionalized liberal arts to the point where they no longer provide the breadth of application and the enhanced capacity for civic engagement that is their signature. Over the past century the expert has dethroned the educated generalist to become the sole model of intellectual accomplishment.  Applause  Expertise has for sure had its moments. But the price of its dominance is enormous. Subject matters are broken up into smaller and smaller pieces  with increasing emphasis on the technical and the obscure. We have even managed to make the study of literature arcane. You may think you know what is going on in that Jane Austen novel    that is  until your first encounter with postmodern deconstructionism. The progression of today's college student is to jettison every interest except one. And within that one  to continually narrow the focus  learning more and more about less and less  this  despite the evidence all around us of the interconnectedness of things. Lest you think I exaggerate  here are the beginnings of the A B Cs of anthropology. As one moves up the ladder  values other than technical competence are viewed with increasing suspicion. Questions such as   What kind of a world are we making  What kind of a world should we be making  What kind of a world can we be making   are treated with more and more skepticism  and move off the table. In so doing  the guardians of secular democracy in effect yield the connection between education and values to fundamentalists  who  you can be sure  have no compunctions about using education to further their values  the absolutes of a theocracy. Meanwhile  the values and voices of democracy are silent. Either we have lost touch with those values or  no better  believe they need not or cannot be taught. This aversion to social values may seem at odds with the explosion of community service programs. But despite the attention paid to these efforts  they remain emphatically extracurricular. In effect  civic mindedness is treated as outside the realm of what purports to be serious thinking and adult purposes. Simply put  when the impulse is to change the world  the academy is more likely to engender a learned helplessness than to create a sense of empowerment. This brew    oversimplification of civic engagement  idealization of the expert  fragmentation of knowledge  emphasis on technical mastery  neutrality as a condition of academic integrity    is toxic when it comes to pursuing the vital connections between education and the public good  between intellectual integrity and human freedom  which were at the heart    my European colleagues. When the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy and the visionary intensity of this challenge were more than enough  I can assure you  to give one pause  what was happening outside higher education made backing off unthinkable. Whether it was threats to the environment  inequities in the distribution of wealth  lack of a sane policy or a sustainable policy with respect to the continuing uses of energy  we were in desperate straits. And that was only the beginning. The corrupting of our political life had become a living nightmare  nothing was exempt    separation of powers  civil liberties  the rule of law  the relationship of church and state. Accompanied by a squandering of the nation's material wealth that defied credulity. A harrowing predilection for the uses of force had become commonplace  with an equal distaste for the alternative forms of influence. At the same time  all of our firepower was impotent when it came to halting or even stemming the slaughter in Rwanda  Darfur  Myanmar. Our public education  once a model for the world  has become most noteworthy for its failures. Mastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy eludes vast numbers of our students. Despite having a research establishment that is the envy of the world  more than half of the American public don't believe in evolution. And don't press your luck about how much those who do believe in it actually understand it. Incredibly  this nation  with all its material  intellectual and spiritual resources  seems utterly helpless to reverse the freefall in any of these areas. Equally startling  from my point of view  is the fact that no one was drawing any connections between what is happening to the body politic  and what is happening in our leading educational institutions. We may be at the top of the list when it comes to influencing access to personal wealth. We are not even on the list when it comes to our responsibility for the health of this democracy. We are playing with fire. You can be sure Jefferson knew what he was talking about when he said   If a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization  it expects what never was  and never will be.  On a more personal note  this betrayal of our principles  our decency  our hope  made it impossible for me to avoid the question   What will I say  years from now  when people ask  'Where were you '  As president of a leading liberal arts college  famous for its innovative history  there were no excuses. So the conversation began at Bennington. Knowing that if we were to regain the integrity of liberal education  it would take radical rethinking of basic assumptions  beginning with our priorities. Enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective. The accomplishment of civic virtue is tied to the uses of intellect and imagination at their most challenging. Our ways of approaching agency and authority turn inside out to reflect the reality that no one has the answers to the challenges facing citizens in this century  and everyone has the responsibility for trying and participating in finding them. Bennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences as areas of immersion that acknowledge differences in personal and professional objectives. But the balances redressed  our shared purposes assume an equal if not greater importance. When the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straightforward. The idea is to make the political social challenges themselves    from health and education to the uses of force    the organizers of the curriculum. They would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines. But structures designed to connect  rather than divide mutually dependent circles  rather than isolating triangles. And the point is not to treat these topics as topics of study  but as frameworks of action. The challenge  to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant and sustainable difference. Contrary to widely held assumptions  an emphasis on action provides a special urgency to thinking. The importance of coming to grips with values like justice  equity  truth  becomes increasingly evident as students discover that interest alone cannot tell them what they need to know when the issue is rethinking education  our approach to health  or strategies for achieving an economics of equity. The value of the past also comes alive  it provides a lot of company. You are not the first to try to figure this out  just as you are unlikely to be the last. Even more valuable  history provides a laboratory in which we see played out the actual  as well as the intended consequences of ideas. In the language of my students   Deep thought matters when you're contemplating what to do about things that matter.  A new liberal arts that can support this action oriented curriculum has begun to emerge. Rhetoric  the art of organizing the world of words to maximum effect. Design  the art of organizing the world of things. Mediation and improvisation also assume a special place in this new pantheon. Quantitative reasoning attains its proper position at the heart of what it takes to manage change where measurement is crucial. As is a capacity to discriminate systematically between what is at the core and what is at the periphery. And when making connections is of the essence  the power of technology emerges with special intensity. But so does the importance of content. The more powerful our reach  the more important the question  About what   When improvisation  resourcefulness  imagination are key  artists  at long last  take their place at the table  when strategies of action are in the process of being designed. In this dramatically expanded ideal of a liberal arts education where the continuum of thought and action is its life's blood  knowledge honed outside the academy becomes essential. Social activists  business leaders  lawyers  politicians  professionals will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good. Students  in turn  continuously move outside the classroom to engage the world directly. And of course  this new wine needs new bottles if we are to capture the liveliness and dynamism of this idea. The most important discovery we made in our focus on public action was to appreciate that the hard choices are not between good and evil  but between competing goods. This discovery is transforming. It undercuts self righteousness  radically alters the tone and character of controversy  and enriches dramatically the possibilities for finding common ground. Ideology  zealotry  unsubstantiated opinions simply won't do. This is a political education  to be sure. But it is a politics of principle  not of partisanship. So the challenge for Bennington is to do it. On the cover of Bennington's      holiday card is the architect's sketch of a building opening in      that is to be a center for the advancement of public action. The center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment. Think of it as a kind of secular church. The words on the card describe what will happen inside. We intend to turn the intellectual and imaginative power  passion and boldness of our students  faculty and staff to developing strategies for acting on the critical challenges of our time. So we are doing our job. While these past weeks have been a time of national exhilaration in this country  it would be tragic if you thought this meant your job was done. The glacial silence we have experienced in the face of the shredding of the constitution  the unraveling of our public institutions  the deterioration of our infrastructure is not limited to the universities. We the people have become inured to our own irrelevance when it comes to doing anything significant about anything that matters concerning governance  beyond waiting another four years. We persist also in being sidelined by the idea of the expert as the only one capable of coming up with answers  despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The problem is there is no such thing as a viable democracy made up of experts  zealots  politicians and spectators. People will continue and should continue to learn everything there is to know about something or other. We actually do it all the time. And there will be and should be those who spend a lifetime pursuing a very highly defined area of inquiry. But this single mindedness will not yield the flexibilities of mind  the multiplicity of perspectives  the capacities for collaboration and innovation this country needs. That is where you come in. What is certain is that the individual talent exhibited in such abundance here  needs to turn its attention to that collaborative  messy  frustrating  contentious and impossible world of politics and public policy. President Obama and his team simply cannot do it alone. If the question of where to start seems overwhelming you are at the beginning  not the end of this adventure. Being overwhelmed is the first step if you are serious about trying to get at things that really matter  on a scale that makes a difference. So what do you do when you feel overwhelmed  Well  you have two things. You have a mind. And you have other people. Start with those  and change the world. Information technology grows in an exponential manner. It's not linear. And our intuition is linear. When we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago we made linear predictions where that animal would be  and that worked fine. It's hardwired in our brains. But the pace of exponential growth is really what describes information technologies. And it's not just computation. There is a big difference between linear and exponential growth. If I take    steps linearly    one  two  three  four  five    I get to   . If I take    steps exponentially    two  four  eight        I get to a billion. It makes a huge difference. And that really describes information technology. When I was a student at MIT  we all shared one computer that took up a whole building. The computer in your cellphone today is a million times cheaper  a million times smaller  a thousand times more powerful. That's a billion fold increase in capability per dollar that we've actually experienced since I was a student. And we're going to do it again in the next    years. Information technology progresses through a series of S curves where each one is a different paradigm. So people say   What's going to happen when Moore's Law comes to an end   Which will happen around     . We'll then go to the next paradigm. And Moore's Law was not the first paradigm to bring exponential growth to computing. The exponential growth of computing started decades before Gordon Moore was even born. And it doesn't just apply to computation. It's really any technology where we can measure the underlying information properties. Here we have    famous computers. I put them in a logarithmic graph. The logarithmic scale hides the scale of the increase  because this represents trillions fold increase since the      census. In     s they were shrinking vacuum tubes  making them smaller and smaller. They finally hit a wall  they couldn't shrink the vacuum tube any more and keep the vacuum. And that was the end of the shrinking of vacuum tubes  but it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing. We went to the fourth paradigm  transistors  and finally integrated circuits. When that comes to an end we'll go to the sixth paradigm  three dimensional self organizing molecular circuits. But what's even more amazing  really  than this fantastic scale of progress  is that    look at how predictable this is. I mean this went through thick and thin  through war and peace  through boom times and recessions. The Great Depression made not a dent in this exponential progression. We'll see the same thing in the economic recession we're having now. At least the exponential growth of information technology capability will continue unabated. And I just updated these graphs. Because I had them through      in my book   The Singularity is Near.  So we updated them  so I could present it here  to     . And I was asked   Well aren't you nervous  Maybe it kind of didn't stay on this exponential progression.  I was a little nervous because maybe the data wouldn't be right  but I've done this now for    years  and it has stayed on this exponential progression. Look at this graph here.You could buy one transistor for a dollar in     . You can buy half a billion today  and they are actually better  because they are faster. But look at how predictable this is. And I'd say this knowledge is over fitting to past data. I've been making these forward looking predictions for about    years. And the cost of a transistor cycle  which is a measure of the price performance of electronics  comes down about every year. That's a    percent deflation rate. And it's also true of other examples  like DNA data or brain data. But we more than make up for that. We actually ship more than twice as much of every form of information technology. We've had    percent growth in constant dollars in every form of information technology for the last half century  despite the fact that you can get twice as much of it each year. This is a completely different example. This is not Moore's Law. The amount of DNA data we've sequenced has doubled every year. The cost has come down by half every year. And this has been a smooth progression since the beginning of the genome project. And halfway through the project  skeptics said   Well  this is not working out. You're halfway through the genome project and you've finished one percent of the project.  But that was really right on schedule. Because if you double one percent seven more times  which is exactly what happened  you get     percent. And the project was finished on time. Communication technologies     different ways to measure this  the number of bits being moved around  the size of the Internet. But this has progressed at an exponential pace. This is deeply democratizing. I wrote  over    years ago in  The Age of Intelligent Machines   when the Soviet Union was going strong  that it would be swept away by this growth of decentralized communication. And we will have plenty of computation as we go through the   st century to do things like simulate regions of the human brain. But where will we get the software  Some critics say   Oh  well software is stuck in the mud.  But we are learning more and more about the human brain. Spatial resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year. The amount of data we're getting about the brain is doubling every year. And we're showing that we can actually turn this data into working models and simulations of brain regions. There is about    regions of the brain that have been modeled  simulated and tested  the auditory cortex  regions of the visual cortex  cerebellum  where we do our skill formation  slices of the cerebral cortex  where we do our rational thinking. And all of this has fueled an increase  very smooth and predictable  of productivity. We've gone from    dollars to     dollars in constant dollars in the value of an average hour of human labor  fueled by this information technology. And we're all concerned about energy and the environment. Well this is a logarithmic graph. This represents a smooth doubling  every two years  of the amount of solar energy we're creating  particularly as we're now applying nanotechnology  a form of information technology  to solar panels. And we're only eight doublings away from it meeting     percent of our energy needs. And there is    thousand times more sunlight than we need. We ultimately will merge with this technology. It's already very close to us. When I was a student it was across campus  now it's in our pockets. What used to take up a building now fits in our pockets. What now fits in our pockets would fit in a blood cell in    years. And we will begin to actually deeply influence our health and our intelligence  as we get closer and closer to this technology. Based on that we are announcing  here at TED  in true TED tradition  Singularity University. It's a new university that's founded by Peter Diamandis  who is here in the audience  and myself. It's backed by NASA and Google  and other leaders in the high tech and science community. And our goal was to assemble the leaders  both teachers and students  in these exponentially growing information technologies  and their application. But Larry Page made an impassioned speech at our organizing meeting  saying we should devote this study to actually addressing some of the major challenges facing humanity. And if we did that  then Google would back this. And so that's what we've done. The last third of the nine week intensive summer session will be devoted to a group project to address some major challenge of humanity. Like for example  applying the Internet  which is now ubiquitous  in the rural areas of China or in Africa  to bringing health information to developing areas of the world. And these projects will continue past these sessions  using collaborative interactive communication. All the intellectual property that is created and taught will be online and available  and developed online in a collaborative fashion. Here is our founding meeting. But this is being announced today. It will be permanently headquartered in Silicon Valley  at the NASA Ames research center. There are different programs for graduate students  for executives at different companies. The first six tracks here    artificial intelligence  advanced computing technologies  biotechnology  nanotechnology    are the different core areas of information technology. Then we are going to apply them to the other areas  like energy  ecology  policy law and ethics  entrepreneurship  so that people can bring these new technologies to the world. So we're very appreciative of the support we've gotten from both the intellectual leaders  the high tech leaders  particularly Google and NASA. This is an exciting new venture. And we invite you to participate. Thank you very much. I have a big impact on the planet to travel here by plane. I emitted  in the atmosphere  nine tons of CO   that is the weight of two elephants. I came here to speak about ecology  and I emitted as much CO  as a Frenchman in one year. So what do I have to do  I have to kill a Frenchman when I come back at home  I have to do my carbon offset in another way  like I do every time. In fact my work is to show our impact on our planet. I'm going to show you some examples of the last pictures I've done in the last year. Alberta sand oil  a lot of pollution. You know the problem  we don't want to believe what we know. In Alberta people work nonstop     hours by seven to extract as much oil as they can. We know about the end of oil. Oil sand is not a long term solution. But we use three times more oil than we find every year. We don't want to believe what we know. Deny. Coral reef in New Caledonia.     percent of the coral may be wiped out before      because of global warming. And you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature  and are very important for the biodiversity of the sea. North Pole. I've done this picture last summer. It was impossible to do this picture    years ago. Now there is a new way open between Atlantic and Pacific. The thickness of the Arctic decreased more than    percent since     . There is a new face of Kilimanjaro without ice. Sad picture. It lost    percent of its ice. According to scientists  in     years all the mountain glacier will be gone. Glaciers are very important for the life on earth. Like Al Gore told you  two billion people live on the water from the glacier of Himalaya. Return of fish men. One fifth of human kind depend on fish to live. Today now    percent of the fish stock are over exploited. According to FAO  if we don't change our system of fishing the main sea resources will be gone in     . We don't want to believe what we know. The beautiful picture  by  unclear  in Africa. One human of six have not enough to eat in the world. One billion people have not enough to eat. In Africa  corn is one of the main foods in many places. Here in America     percent of the corn cultivated is used to feed animals or to do oil. Palm tree plantation in Borneo. Every year we lose    thousand square miles in deforestation. Refugee camp in Darfur. Today we have    million refugees in the world. According to the U.N.  we speak about     million refugees in     . I always show my pictures in the street. We have done already     exhibitions in the cities. But how to understand the world without the voice of people  Landscape was not enough. It was obvious to me to do another work. I launched a project named Six Billion Others. I sent around the world six cameramen asking the same question  the same crucial question  about life. We have done five thousand interviews. I'm going to show you this. Man  The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life  It's when my dad told me   Here  I give you this girl as your fiance.  Woman  Love  Love is nice if you can have it. Second Man  Romeo and Juliet  Sassi and Panno  Dodi and Diana  Heer and Ranjha  this is love  Third Man  My greatest fear is ... Woman  You're asking me a hard question. Fourth Man  I live happily because what else should I do  Fifth Man  The first thing I remember ...  Sixth Man  That's how I learned  by my mother   Fifth Man  ... from my childhood   Sixth Man  that you should respect humans.  Fifth Man  we were having fun  biking.  Sixth Man  I will never forget those words.  Seventh Man  We invented stories  we flew around the world  while remaining in our attic. Eighth Man  I had a big laugh today. Ninth Man  You see  family is ... it's awful.   th Man  In the word life  you have the life.   th Man  Who am I  Isn't that the biggest question    th Man  If I was to go back to Iraq and speak to the people  I'd have to bow down and kiss their feet. Just as that woman tried to kiss my feet when we were taking her sons. I feel ashamed. And I feel humbled by their strength. And I will forever feel a need to make reparations to Iraq. Second Woman  Dad  Mom  I grew up. You shouldn't worry about me. Dad doesn't need to go to work. My family ... What can I say  At the moment  my family is very poor  my life here in Shenzhen is just about showing myself that I can earn more and to let my parents stay and have something to live on. I don't want them to spend their whole lives in poverty. If someday I can achieve something  I would like to say thank you daddy and mommy. Thank you. Thank you for having fed me and raised me  and for making my life of today. Thank you.   th Man  After seven years now of being in a wheelchair  I've done more in life being in a chair than out of a chair. I still surf. I sail the world. I freedive. After many people said I couldn't do that. And I think that comes from connecting with nature  connecting with the energy of life  because we're all disabled in some way on the planet    spiritually  mentally or physically. I got the easy part.   th Man  Let's say that you and me like each other. You come from elsewhere. You don't know me. I don't know you. We talk without lying. If I do like you  I give you one cow and many other things and we become friends. How can we make it all by ourselves  YAB  You can also go to the website  answer    respond to the questions also. Forty crucial questions. Now I am going to speak to you about my movie. For the last three years  I was shooting the earth for the movie. The name of the movie is  Home      Maison.  It is about the state of the planet. It's a fantastic story of life on the earth. I'm very proud to show you the teaser. Video  This Earth is four and a half billion years old. These plants  several hundred million years old. And we humans have been walking upright for only     thousand years. We've managed to adapt  and have conquered the whole planet. For generations  we've been raising our children  not unlike millions of other species living beside us. For the past    years I've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers from high up in the sky. Our life is tied to the well being of our planet. We depend on water  forests  deserts  oceans. Fishing  breeding  farming are still the world's foremost human occupations. And what binds us together is far greater than what divides us. We all share the same need for the earth's gifts    the same wish to rise above ourselves  and become better. And yet we carry on raising walls to keep us apart. Today our greatest battle is to protect the natural offerings of our planet. In less than    years we've altered it more thoroughly than in the entire history of mankind. Half of the world's forests have vanished. Water resources are running low. Intensive farming is depleting soils. Our energy sources are not sustainable. The climate is changing. We are endangering ourselves. We're only trying to improve our lives. But the wealth gaps are growing wider. We haven't yet understood that we're going at a much faster pace than the planet can sustain. We know that solutions are available today. We all have the power to change this trend for the better. So what are we waiting for  YAB  Luc Besson is the producer of the movie. But it is not a normal movie. The film is going to be distributed free. This film has no copyright. On the five of June  the environment day  everybody can download the movie on Internet. The film is given for free to the distributor for TV and theater to show it the fifth of June. There is no business on this movie. It is also available for school  cities  NGOs and you. We have to believe what we know. Let me tell you something. It's too late to be pessimistic    really too late. We have all a part of the solutions. To finish  I would like to welcome the      th baby born since the beginning of this talk. Merci beaucoup. I love you.  The Better Man.  I was the better at getting and keeping. You were the better at spend and spend  I was the better at grubbing and heaping  But who was the better man in the end  Yes  who was the better man  my friend  You were the better with lords and ladies  I was the better at pillaging Troy  You were the better at kissing the babies  I was the better at search and destroy. But who was the better man  old boy  Who was the better man  I was the better at improvisation  You were the better at spinning the plates  I was the better at procrastination  You were the better at quiet debate. But who was the better man  old mate  Who was the better man  You were the better at rolling a reefer  I was the better at coke and rum  Remember that night on the beach in Ibiza  The Maori twins with the tattooed bum  But who was the better man  old chum  Who was the better man  Now we come down to it  relatives grieving. Out in the hall with their crocodile tears  Now that you're out of it  now that you're leaving  Now that they've sealed your arse and your ears  What I've been meaning to tell you for years  And years  and years  and years  old friend ... Is that you were the better man  in the end  You were the better man  My friend. I wrote this next poem for my mother. Every one of us had a mother  only one    probably the most important person in your life  if you're lucky enough to know them. My mother was certainly the most important in mine. Let me try and describe her to you. She's    years old. She's frail. White  platinum hair. Why do they do that  Why do old ladies go to those hair shops  and make those helmets  Bright as a button. All the ducks in a row. Looks like a much prettier version of Margaret Thatcher  but without any of the soft bits in Margaret's character. I wrote this poem for her. These are not my beliefs. But my mother has lived by this creed all her life.  Never Go Back.  Never go back. Never go back. Never return to the haunts of your youth. Keep to the track  to the beaten track  Memory holds all you need of the truth. Never look back. Never look back. Never succumb to the gorgon's stare. Keep to the track  to the beaten track  No one is waiting and nothing is there. Never go back. Never go back. Never surrender the future you earned. Keep to the track  to the beaten track  Never return to the bridges you've burned. Never look back. Never look back. Never retreat to the 'glorious past.' Keep to the track  to the beaten track  Treat every day of your life as your last. Never go back. Never go back. Never acknowledge the ghost on the stair. Keep to the track  to the beaten track  No one is waiting and nothing is there. Now ladies and gentlemen  I'm up on me hobbyhorse. If every commercially minded cosmetic surgeon were tied end to end along a railroad track  that would be me  stoking the train without a qualm in the world. Ladies  don't do it. Don't do it. You think we want you to do it  but we don't want you to do it. Stop it. Tell them to go to hell. You bodies are wonderful as they are. Just leave them alone.  To a Beautiful Lady of a Certain Age.  Lady lady  do not weep. What is gone is gone. Now sleep. Turn your pillow. Dry your tears. Count thy sheep and not thy years. Nothing good can come of this. Time rules all  my dearest. 'Tis but folly to be waging war On one who never lost before. Lady  this is all in vain. Youth can never come again  We have drunk the summer wine. None can make a stitch in time. Nip and tuck till crack of doom. What is foretold in the womb May not be foresworn with gold. Nor may time be bought or sold. Dearest  do I love thee less  Do I shrink from thy caress  Think you I could cease to care  Never was there one so fair  Lady lady  do not weep    What is gone is gone. Now sleep. Lean against me  calm your fears  Count thy blessings  not thy years. America  ladies and gentlemen  has done more for me financially than Britain ever has  or ever could have done. I was born in Britain  as you have probably guessed. Even when on its worst behavior  I find myself automatically defending the USA from the sneers of green eyed Europhiles playing their Greek card to Roman trumps. America is an empire. I hope you know that now. All empires  by definition  are bumbling  shambolic  bullying  bureaucratic affairs  as certain of the rightness of their cause in infancy  as they are corrupted by power in their dotage. I am no historian  ladies and gentlemen. But it seems to be that the USA's sins  compared to those of many previous empires  are of a more moderate  if more pervasive  kind. Let me put this bluntly. If Americans are so fat  stupid and ignorant  my dear friends from Birmingham  how come they rule the world   Hail to the Gods of America.  Hail to the Gods of America  Hail to the gods of the dream. Invictus E Pluribus Unum. But which of them reigns supreme  Which is America's Jupiter  The Brahmins of Capital Hill  A sorcerer's profit on Wall Street  They eye of a dollar bill  Or is it celebrity status  The worship of those we hate. Or the cult of living forever  If only we'd watch our weight. What of the titans of media  Or Hollywood's siren call  What of the temples of justice  Whose servants enslave us all  What of the Brand and the Label  What of the upstart Sport  And what of the Constitution  That bully of last resort  Hail to the God of America  Whose power the masses extol    Convenience rules America  Convenience owns our soul. Aye  that it does. And if you would like to know why I am not a father    I  who by a miracle have    godchildren    the answer is in this poem  which upsets me every time I read it.  Love Came to Visit Me.  Love came to visit me  shy as a fawn. But finding me busy  she fled  with the dawn. At    the torch of resentment was lit. My rage at injustice waxed hot as the pits. The flux of its lava cleared all in its path. Comrades and enemies fled from its wrath. Yet lovers grew wary  once novelty waned To lie with a bloody man  his terror unfeigned. At    my powers seemed mighty to me. The fruits of my rivals  I shook from the tree. By guile and by bluster  by night and by day  I battered and scattered the fools from my way. And women grew willing to sham and to bluff. Their trinkets and baubles cost little enough. From    to     grown easy and sly  I wined them and dined them  like pigs in a sty. We feasted and reveled and rutted in muck  Forgetting our peril  forgetting to duck  Forgetting times arrows are sharper than knives. Grown sick to our stomachs  and sick of our lives. Love came to visit me  shy as a fawn. But finding me busy  she fled with the dawn. Um  there are    I've got far too much money and I have far too much fun in my businesses. So poetry came as a complete shock to me  ladies and gentlemen. A complete shock. I was a little ill. Okay  I was ill. Okay  I had a life threatening illness  you know. I was in a clinic. I wasn't allowed to make telephone calls. I wasn't allowed to see any of my    you know  whatever. So  in the end I begged a pack of Post it notes off a nurse. And from another nurse  I begged a pencil  pen. And I didn't know what else to do. So I started to write poetry. That was in October of     . I'm not an evil man. But sometimes I try to put myself in an evil man's position. I'm not a glorious and fantastic looking woman  who men fall down  you know  when she walks in a room. But sometimes I try to put myself in that position. Not with much success. But it's interesting to me. I love to write historical verse. I love to think what they thought  what it was like. Because although many of the speakers and many of the people who are in the audience  although you guys can not only go to the moon  you know  you're going to totally transform everything. Cloning will transform everything. Voice navigation will transform everything. I don't know. You can do anything you want. All you guys are so clever  and women  you can do it all  But human nature doesn't change  mate. My friends  human nature is exactly the same as it was when my ancestor    probably it was my ancestor    got his hands around the neck of the last Neanderthal  and battered the bastard to death. You think we didn't do that  Oh  we did. We killed every single one of them. Inch by inch we killed them. We hunted them down wherever they were. Rivals for meat. Rivals for berries. We're still doing it  with all of the genius assembled in this room. Our natures haven't changed a single iota. And they never will. Even when we've got off this little planet  and have put some of our eggs in some other baskets. And I am as bad as you. I spent eight years running one of the most successful publishing businesses in the world. And at seven o'clock every night  I took me some more girls  already corrupted. I never did anything to anyone that wasn't. And I took crack cocaine  every single night for seven years. It was like Dante's  Inferno.  It was unbelievable. One of the offshoots of crack cocaine is that you keep an erection for about four hours. And you stay up for   . It was absolutely unbelievable. Twenty two godchildren I've got. What do I say to them  I only stopped because I thought if I got caught  what would happen to my mother. If you're a woman  remember that. The love of your son can utterly transform anything he does.  Our Lady in White.  Pale she was  listless  And soft to the touch. A generous mistress Whom many loved much. Shoulder to shoulder  Night after night  We hoarded and sold her    Our Lady in White. We breathed but to savor her crystal caress. We craved but to favor the hem of her dress. We dabbled and babbled  Denying our thirsts. But always we scrabbled to lie with her first. Absent  we missed her  grew haggard and limp. Toyed with her sister  or threatened her pimp. Came word out of Babel  the lady returns  And there on the table we took her  in turns. Sensing the power that tyranny craves  There in that hour  she made us her slaves. Many there were  to covet her kiss. My shame as a spur  I fled the abyss. But only just. I used to be a Malthusian. This was my mental model of the world  exploding population  small planet  it's going to lead to ugly things. But I'm moving past Malthus  because I think that we just might be about     years from a kind of new enlightenment. Here's why. This is the U.N.'s population data  you may have seen  for the world. And the world's population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than    billion  late this century. And after that  most likely it's going to begin to decline. So what then  Most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth. So a lot of economists look at declining population and expect to see stagnation  maybe depression. But a declining population is going to have at least two very beneficial economic effects. One  fewer people on a fixed amount of land make investing in property a bad bet. In the cities  a lot of the cost of property is actually wrapped up in its speculative value. Take away land speculation  price of land drops. And that begins to lift a heavy burden off the world's poor. Number two  a declining population means scarce labor. Scarce labor drives wages. As wages increase that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class. Now I'm not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the Black Death. But look what happened in Europe after the plague  rising wages  land reform  technological innovation  birth of the middle class  and after that  forward looking social movements like the Renaissance  and later the Enlightenment. Most of our cultural heritage has tended to look backward  romanticizing the past. All of the Western religions begin with the notion of Eden  and descend through a kind of profligate present to a very ugly future. So human history is viewed as sort of this downhill slide from the good old days. But I think we're in for another change  about two generations after the top of that curve  once the effects of a declining population start to settle in. At that point  we'll start romanticizing the future again  instead of the nasty  brutish past. So why does this matter  Why talk about social economic movements that may be more than a century away  Because transitions are dangerous times. When land owners start to lose money  and labor demands more pay  there are some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future. Fear for the future leads to some rash decisions. If we have a positive view about the future then we may be able to accelerate through that turn  instead of careening off a cliff. If we can make it through the next     years  I think that your great great grandchildren will forget all about Malthus. And instead  they'll be planning for the future and starting to build the   nd Century Enlightenment. Thank you. What's happening to the climate  It is unbelievably bad. This is  obviously  that famous view now of the Arctic  which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years. Very  very  very scary. So we all look at what we can do. And when you look at the worldwide sources of CO      percent are tied to buildings. Only nine percent is passenger cars  interestingly enough. So we ran off to a sushi bar. And at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea. And it was something called EcoRock. And we said we could redesign the     year old gypsum drywall process that generates    billion pounds of CO  a year. So it was a big idea. We wanted to reduce that by    percent  which is exactly what we've done. We started R D in     . Decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing. There is the inside of our lab. We haven't shown this before. But our people had to do some       different mixes to get this right  to hit our targets. And they worked absolutely very  very  very hard. So then we went forward and built our production line in China. We don't build this production equipment any longer in the U.S.  unfortunately. We did the line install over the summer. We started right there  with absolutely nothing. You're seeing for the first time  a brand new drywall production line  not made using gypsum at all. That's the finished production line there. We got our first panel out on December third. That is the slurry being poured onto paper  basically. That's the line running. The exciting thing is  look at the faces of the people. These are people who worked this project for two to three years. And they are so excited. That's the first board off the line. Our Vice President of Operation kissing the board. Obviously very  very excited. But this has a huge  huge impact on the environment. We signed the first panel just a few weeks after that  had a great signing ceremony  leading to people hopefully using these products across the world. And we've got Cradle to Cradle Gold on this thing. We happened to win  just recently  the Green Product of the Year for  The Re Invention of Drywall   from Popular Science. Thank you. Thank you. So here is what we learned        gallons of gas equivalent to build one house. You probably had no idea. It's like driving around the world six times. We must change everything. Look around the room  chairs  wood  everything around us has to change or we're not going to lick this problem. Don't listen to the people who say you can't do this  because anyone can. And these job losses  we can fix them with green collar jobs. We've got four plants. We're building this stuff around the country. We're going as fast as we can. Two and a half million cars worth of gypsum  you know  CO  generated. Right  So what will you do  I'll tell you what I did and why I did it. And I know my time's up. Those are my kids  Natalie and David. When they have their kids        they'd better look back at Grandpa and say   Hey  you gave it a good shot. You did the best you could with the team that you had.  So my hope is that when you leave TED  you will look at reducing your carbon footprint in however you can do it. And if you don't know how  please find me    I will help you. Last but not least  Bill Gates  I know you invented Windows. Wait till you see  maybe next year  what kind of windows we've invented. Thank you so much. This is a world changing invention. The smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives  worldwide. But smoke alarms don't prevent fires. Every year in the USA  over        are killed or injured with         home fires. And one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity. What if we could prevent electrical fires before they start  Well  a couple of friends and I figured out how to do this. So how does electricity ignite residential fires  Well it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring. Our invention had to address all of these issues. So what about circuit breakers  Well  Thomas Edison invented the circuit breaker in     . This is     year old technology  and this is a problem  because over    percent of all home electrical fires start below the safety threshold of circuit breakers. Hmmm ... So we considered all of this. And we realized that electrical appliances must be able to communicate directly with the power receptacle itself. Any electrical device    an appliance  an extension cord  whatever    must be able to tell the power outlet   Hey  power outlet  I'm drawing too much current. Shut me off now  before I start a fire.  And the power outlet needs to be smart enough to do it. So here is what we did. We put a    cent digital transponder  a data tag  in the appliance plug. And we put an inexpensive  wireless data reader inside the receptacle so they could communicate. Now  every home electrical system becomes an intelligent network. The appliance's safe operating parameters are embedded into its plug. If too much current is flowing  the intelligent receptacle turns itself off  and prevents another fire from starting. We call this technology EFCI  Electrical Fault Circuit Interrupter. Okay  two more points. Every year in the USA  roughly       children are admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries related to electrical receptacles. And this is crazy. An intelligent receptacle prevents injuries because the power is always off  until an intelligent plug is detected. Simple. Now  besides saving lives  perhaps the greatest benefit of intelligent power is in its energy savings. This invention will reduce global energy consumption by allowing remote control and automation of every outlet in every home and business. Now you can choose to reduce your home energy bill by automatically cycling heavy loads like air conditioners and heaters. Hotels and businesses can shut down unused rooms from a central location  or even a cell phone. There are    billion electrical outlets in North America alone. The potential energy savings is very  very significant. So far we've applied for     patent claims. Of those      have been granted      are in process. And I'm pleased to announce that just three weeks ago we received our first international recognition  the      CES Innovation Award. So  to conclude  intelligent power can  globally  save thousands of lives  prevent tens of thousands of injuries  and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage every single year  while significantly reducing global energy consumption. In the spirit of this year's TED Conference  we think this is a powerful  world changing invention. And I'd like to thank Chris for this opportunity to unveil our technology with you  and soon the world. Thank you. This is called Hooked on a Feeling  The Pursuit of Happiness and Human Design. I put up a somewhat dour Darwin  but a very happy chimp up there. My first point is that the pursuit of happiness is obligatory. Man wishes to be happy  only wishes to be happy  and cannot wish not to be so. We are wired to pursue happiness  not only to enjoy it  but to want more and more of it. So given that that's true  how good are we at increasing our happiness  Well  we certainly try. If you look on the Amazon site  there are over       titles with advice on the seven habits  the nine choices  the    secrets  the        thoughts that are supposed to bring happiness. Now another way we try to increase our happiness is we medicate ourselves. And so there's over     million prescriptions out there for antidepressants. Prozac was really the first absolute blockbuster drug. It was clean  efficient  there was no high  there was really no danger  it had no street value. In       illegal drugs were a      billion business  representing eight percent of world trade  roughly the same as gas and oil. These routes to happiness haven't really increased happiness very much. One problem that's happening now is  although the rates of happiness are about as flat as the surface of the moon  depression and anxiety are rising. Some people say this is because we have better diagnosis  and more people are being found out. It isn't just that. We're seeing it all over the world. In the United States right now there are more suicides than homicides. There is a rash of suicide in China. And the World Health Organization predicts by the year      that depression will be the second largest cause of disability. Now the good news here is that if you take surveys from around the world  we see that about three quarters of people will say they are at least pretty happy. But this does not follow any of the usual trends. For example  these two show great growth in income  absolutely flat happiness curves. My field  the field of psychology  hasn't done a whole lot to help us move forward in understanding human happiness. In part  we have the legacy of Freud  who was a pessimist  who said that pursuit of happiness is a doomed quest  is propelled by infantile aspects of the individual that can never be met in reality. He said   One feels inclined to say that the intention that man should be happy is not included in the plan of creation.  So the ultimate goal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy was really what Freud called ordinary misery. And Freud in part reflects the anatomy of the human emotion system    which is that we have both a positive and a negative system  and our negative system is extremely sensitive. So for example  we're born loving the taste of something sweet and reacting aversively to the taste of something bitter. We also find that people are more averse to losing than they are happy to gain. The formula for a happy marriage is five positive remarks  or interactions  for every one negative. And that's how powerful the one negative is. Especially expressions of contempt or disgust  well you really need a lot of positives to upset that. I also put in here the stress response. We're wired for dangers that are immediate  that are physical  that are imminent  and so our body goes into an incredible reaction where endogenous opioids come in. We have a system that is really ancient  and really there for physical danger. And so over time  this becomes a stress response  which has enormous effects on the body. Cortisol floods the brain  it destroys hippocampal cells and memory  and can lead to all kinds of health problems. But unfortunately  we need this system in part. If we were only governed by pleasure we would not survive. We really have two command posts. Emotions are short lived intense responses to challenge and to opportunity. And each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves that tune in  turn on  drop out thoughts  perceptions  feelings and memories. We tend to think of emotions as just feelings. But in fact  emotions are an all systems alert that change what we remember  what kind of decisions we make  and how we perceive things. So let me go forward to the new science of happiness. We've come away from the Freudian gloom  and people are now actively studying this. And one of the key points in the science of happiness is that happiness and unhappiness are not endpoints of a single continuum. The Freudian model is really one continuum that  as you get less miserable  you get happier. And that isn't true    when you get less miserable  you get less miserable. And that happiness is a whole other end of the equation. And it's been missing. It's been missing from psychotherapy. So when people's symptoms go away  they tend to recur  because there isn't a sense of the other half    of what pleasure  happiness  compassion  gratitude  what are the positive emotions. And of course we know this intuitively  that happiness is not just the absence of misery. But somehow it was not put forward until very recently  seeing these as two parallel systems. So that the body can both look for opportunity and also protect itself from danger  at the same time. And they're sort of two reciprocal and dynamically interacting systems. People have also wanted to deconstruct. We use this word  happy   and it's this very large umbrella of a term. And then three emotions for which there are no English words  fiero  which is the pride in accomplishment of a challenge  schadenfreude  which is happiness in another's misfortune  a malicious pleasure  and naches  which is a pride and joy in one's children. Absent from this list  and absent from any discussions of happiness  are happiness in another's happiness. We don't seem to have a word for that. We are very sensitive to the negative  but it is in part offset by the fact that we have a positivity. We're also born pleasure seekers. Babies love the taste of sweet and hate the taste of bitter. They love to touch smooth surfaces rather than rough ones. They like to look at beautiful faces rather than plain faces. They like to listen to consonant melodies instead of dissonant melodies. Babies really are born with a lot of innate pleasures. There was once a statement made by a psychologist that said that    percent of the pursuit of happiness is really just about the genes  and it's as difficult to become happier as it is to become taller. That's nonsense. There is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes    about    percent    but there is still that    percent that is unaccounted for. Let's just go into the brain for a moment  and see where does happiness arise from in evolution. We have basically at least two systems here  and they both are very ancient. One is the reward system  and that's fed by the chemical dopamine. And it starts in the ventral tegmental area. It goes to the nucleus accumbens  all the way up to the prefrontal cortex  orbital frontal cortex  where decisions are made  high level. This was originally seen as a system that was the pleasure system of the brain. In the     s  Olds and Milner put electrodes into the brain of a rat. And the rat would just keep pressing that bar thousands and thousands and thousands of times. It wouldn't eat. It wouldn't sleep. It wouldn't have sex. It wouldn't do anything but press this bar. So they assumed this must be  you know  the brain's orgasmatron. It turned out that it wasn't  that it really is a system of motivation  a system of wanting. It gives objects what's called incentive salience. It makes something look so attractive that you just have to go after it. That's something different from the system that is the pleasure system  which simply says   I like this.  The pleasure system  as you see  which is the internal opiates  there is a hormone oxytocin  is widely spread throughout the brain. Dopamine system  the wanting system  is much more centralized. The other thing about positive emotions is that they have a universal signal. And we see here the smile. And the universal signal is not just raising the corner of the lips to the zygomatic major. It's also crinkling the outer corner of the eye  the orbicularis oculi. So you see  even    month old babies  when they see their mother  will show this particular kind of smile. Extroverts use it more than introverts. People who are relieved of depression show it more after than before. So if you want to unmask a true look of happiness  you will look for this expression. Our pleasures are really ancient. And we learn  of course  many  many pleasures  but many of them are base. And one of them  of course  is biophilia    that we have a response to the natural world that's very profound. Very interesting studies done on people recovering from surgery  who found that people who faced a brick wall versus people who looked out on trees and nature  the people who looked out on the brick wall were in the hospital longer  needed more medication  and had more medical complications. There is something very restorative about nature  and it's part of how we are tuned. Humans  particularly so  we're very imitative creatures. And we imitate from almost the second we are born. Here is a three week old baby. And if you stick your tongue out at this baby  the baby will do the same. We are social beings from the beginning. And even studies of cooperation show that cooperation between individuals lights up reward centers of the brain. One problem that psychology has had is instead of looking at this intersubjectivity    or the importance of the social brain to humans who come into the world helpless and need each other tremendously    is that they focus instead on the self and self esteem  and not self other. It's sort of  me   not  we.  And I think this has been a really tremendous problem that goes against our biology and nature  and hasn't made us any happier at all. Because when you think about it  people are happiest when in flow  when they're absorbed in something out in the world  when they're with other people  when they're active  engaged in sports  focusing on a loved one  learning  having sex  whatever. They're not sitting in front of the mirror trying to figure themselves out  or thinking about themselves. These are not the periods when you feel happiest. The other thing is  that a piece of evidence is  is if you look at computerized text analysis of people who commit suicide  what you find there  and it's quite interesting  is use of the first person singular     I    me    my   not  we  and  us     and the letters are less hopeless than they are really alone. And being alone is very unnatural to the human. There is a profound need to belong. But there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up. Because  for example  the genes don't care whether we're happy  they care that we replicate  that we pass our genes on. So for example we have three systems that underlie reproduction  because it's so important. There's lust  which is just wanting to have sex. And that's really mediated by the sex hormones. Romantic attraction  that gets into the desire system. And that's dopamine fed. And that's   I must have this one person.  There's attachment  which is oxytocin  and the opiates  which says   This is a long term bond.  See the problem is that  as humans  these three can separate. So a person can be in a long term attachment  become romantically infatuated with someone else  and want to have sex with a third person. The other way in which our genes can sometimes lead us astray is in social status. We are very acutely aware of our social status and always seek to further and increase it. Now in the animal world  there is only one way to increase status  and that's dominance. I seize command by physical prowess  and I keep it by beating my chest  and you make submissive gestures. Now  the human has a whole other way to rise to the top  and that is a prestige route  which is freely conferred. Someone has expertise and knowledge  and knows how to do things  and we give that person status. And that's clearly the way for us to create many more niches of status so that people don't have to be lower on the status hierarchy as they are in the animal world. The data isn't terribly supportive of money buying happiness. But it's not irrelevant. So if you look at questions like this  life satisfaction  you see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income. You see mental distress going up with lower income. So clearly there is some effect. But the effect is relatively small. And one of the problems with money is materialism. What happens when people pursue money too avidly  is they forget about the real basic pleasures of life. So we have here  this couple.  Do you think the less fortunate are having better sex   And then this kid over here is saying   Leave me alone with my toys.  So one of the things is that it really takes over. That whole dopamine wanting system takes over and derails from any of the pleasure system. Maslow had this idea back in the     s that as people rise above their biological needs  as the world becomes safer and we don't have to worry about basic needs being met    our biological system  whatever motivates us  is being satisfied    we can rise above them  to think beyond ourselves toward self actualization or transcendence  and rise above the materialist. So to just quickly conclude with some brief data that suggests this might be so. One is people who underwent what is called a quantum change  they felt their life and their whole values had changed. And sure enough  if you look at the kinds of values that come in  you see wealth  adventure  achievement  pleasure  fun  be respected  before the change  and much more post materialist values after. Women had a whole different set of value shifts. But very similarly  the only one that survived there was happiness. They went from attractiveness and happiness and wealth and self control to generosity and forgiveness. I end with a few quotes.  There is only one question  How to love this world   And Rilke   If your daily life seems poor  do not blame it  blame yourself. Tell yourself that you are not poet enough to call forth its riches.   First  say to yourself what you would be. Then do what you have to do.  Thank you. Let me share with you today an original discovery. But I want to tell it to you the way it really happened    not the way I present it in a scientific meeting  or the way you'd read it in a scientific paper. It's a story about beyond biomimetics  to something I'm calling biomutualism. I define that as an association between biology and another discipline  where each discipline reciprocally advances the other  but where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field. Now  in terms of biomimetics  as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature  nature becomes a much more useful teacher. Engineering can be inspired by biology by using its principles and analogies when they're advantageous  but then integrating that with the best human engineering  ultimately to make something actually better than nature. Now  being a biologist  I was very curious about this. These are gecko toes. And we wondered how they use these bizarre toes to climb up a wall so quickly. We discovered it. And what we found was that they have leaf like structures on their toes  with millions of tiny hairs that look like a rug  and each of those hairs has the worst case of split ends possible  about     to      split ends that are nano size. And the individual has   billion of these nano size split ends. They don't stick by Velcro or suction or glue. They actually stick by intermolecular forces alone  van der Waals forces. And I'm really pleased to report to you today that the first synthetic self cleaning  dry adhesive has been made. From the simplest version in nature  one branch  my engineering collaborator  Ron Fearing  at Berkeley  had made the first synthetic version. And so has my other incredible collaborator  Mark Cutkosky  at Stanford    he made much larger hairs than the gecko  but used the same general principles. And here is its first test. That's Kellar Autumn  my former Ph.D. student  professor now at Lewis and Clark  literally giving his first born child up for this test. More recently  this happened. Man  This the first time someone has actually climbed with it. Narrator  Lynn Verinsky  a professional climber  who appeared to be brimming with confidence. Lynn Verinsky  Honestly  it's going to be perfectly safe. It will be perfectly safe. Man  How do you know  Lynn Verinsky  Because of liability insurance.  Laughter  Narrator  With a mattress below and attached to a safety rope  Lynn began her    foot ascent. Lynn made it to the top in a perfect pairing of Hollywood and science. Man  So you're the first human being to officially emulate a gecko. Lynn Verinsky  Ha  Wow. And what a privilege that has been. Robert Full  That's what she did on rough surfaces. But she actually used these on smooth surfaces    two of them    to climb up  and pull herself up. And you can try this in the lobby  and look at the gecko inspired material. Now the problem with the robots doing this is that they can't get unstuck  with the material. This is the gecko's solution. They actually peel their toes away from the surface  at high rates  as they run up the wall. Well I'm really excited today to show you the newest version of a robot  Stickybot  using a new hierarchical dry adhesive. Here is the actual robot. And here is what it does. And if you look  you can see that it uses the toe peeling  just like the gecko does. If we can show some of the video  you can see it climbing up the wall. There it is. And now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive that the Stanford group was able to do in designing this incredible robot. Oh. One thing I want to point out is  look at Stickybot. You see something on it. It's not just to look like a gecko. It has a tail. And just when you think you've figured out nature  this kind of thing happens. The engineers told us  for the climbing robots  that  if they don't have a tail  they fall off the wall. So what they did was they asked us an important question. They said   Well  it kind of looks like a tail.  Even though we put a passive bar there.  Do animals use their tails when they climb up walls   What they were doing was returning the favor  by giving us a hypothesis to test  in biology  that we wouldn't have thought of. So of course  in reality  we were then panicked  being the biologists  and we should know this already. We said   Well  what do tails do   Well we know that tails store fat  for example. We know that you can grab onto things with them. And perhaps it is most well known that they provide static balance. It can also act as a counterbalance. So watch this kangaroo. See that tail  That's incredible  Marc Raibert built a Uniroo hopping robot. And it was unstable without its tail. Now mostly tails limit maneuverability  like this human inside this dinosaur suit. My colleagues actually went on to test this limitation  by increasing the moment of inertia of a student  so they had a tail  and running them through and obstacle course  and found a decrement in performance  like you'd predict. But of course  this is a passive tail. And you can also have active tails. And when I went back to research this  I realized that one of the great TED moments in the past  from Nathan  we've talked about an active tail. Video  Myhrvold thinks tail cracking dinosaurs were interested in love  not war. Robert Full  He talked about the tail being a whip for communication. It can also be used in defense. Pretty powerful. So we then went back and looked at the animal. And we ran it up a surface. But this time what we did is we put a slippery patch that you see in yellow there. And watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail when it slips. This is slowed down    times. So here is normal speed. And watch it now slip  and see what it does with its tail. It has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg  and it contributes to stability. If you make it slip a huge amount  this is what we discovered. This is incredible. The engineers had a really good idea. And then of course we wondered  okay  they have an active tail  but let's picture them. They're climbing up a wall  or a tree. And they get to the top and let's say there's some leaves there. And what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf  and there was some wind  or we shook it  And we did that experiment  that you see here. And this is what we discovered. Now that's real time. You can't see anything. But there it is slowed down. What we discovered was the world's fastest air righting response. For those of you who remember your physics  that's a zero angular momentum righting response. But it's like a cat. You know  cats falling. Cats do this. They twist their bodies. But geckos do it better. And they do it with their tail. So they do it with this active tail as they swing around. And then they always land in the sort of superman skydiving posture. Okay  now we wondered  if we were right  we should be able to test this in a physical model  in a robot. So for TED we actually built a robot  over there  a prototype  with the tail. And we're going to attempt the first air righting response in a tail  with a robot. If we could have the lights on it. Okay  there it goes. And show the video. There it is. And it works just like it does in the animal. So all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself. Now  of course  we were normally frightened because the animal has no gliding adaptations  so we thought   Oh that's okay. We'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel. We'll blow the air up  we'll give it a landing target  a tree trunk  just outside the plexi glass enclosure  and see what it does. So we did. And here is what it does. So the wind is coming from the bottom. This is slowed down    times. It does an equilibrium glide. Highly controlled. This is sort of incredible. But actually it's quite beautiful  when you take a picture of it. And it's better than that  it    just in the slide    maneuvers in mid air. And the way it does it  is it takes its tail and it swings it one way to yaw left  and it swings its other way to yaw right. So we can maneuver this way. And then    we had to film this several times to believe this    it also does this. Watch this. It oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin. It can actually swim through the air. But watch its front legs. Can you see what they are doing  What does that mean for the origin of flapping flight  Maybe it's evolved from coming down from trees  and trying to control a glide. Stay tuned for that. So then we wondered   Can they actually maneuver with this   So there is the landing target. Could they steer towards it with these capabilities  Here it is in the wind tunnel. And it certainly looks like it. You can see it even better from down on top. Watch the animal. Definitely moving towards the landing target. Watch the whip of its tail as it does it. Look at that. It's unbelievable. So now we were really confused  because there are no reports of it gliding. So we went   Oh my god  we have to go to the field  and see if it actually does this.  Completely opposite of the way you'd see it on a nature film  of course. We wondered   Do they actually glide in nature   Well we went to the forests of Singapore and Southeast Asia. And the next video you see is the first time we've showed this. This is the actual video    not staged  a real research video    of animal gliding down. There is a red trajectory line. Look at the end to see the animal. But then as it gets closer to the tree  look at the close up. And see if you can see it land. So there it comes down. There is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line. You see it there  There  Watch it come down. Now watch up there and you can see the landing. Did you see it hit  It actually uses its tail too  just like we saw in the lab. So now we can continue this mutualism by suggesting that they can make an active tail. And here is the first active tail  in the robot  made by Boston Dynamics. So to conclude  I think we need to build biomutualisms  like I showed  that will increase the pace of basic discovery in their application. To do this though  we need to redesign education in a major way  to balance depth with interdisciplinary communication  and explicitly train people how to contribute to  and benefit from other disciplines. And of course you need the organisms and the environment to do it. That is  whether you care about security  search and rescue or health  we must preserve nature's designs  otherwise these secrets will be lost forever. And from what I heard from our new president  I'm very optimistic. Thank you. Why do so many people reach success and then fail  One of the big reasons is  we think success is a one way street. So we do everything that leads up to success  but then we get there. We figure we've made it  we sit back in our comfort zone  and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful. And it doesn't take long to go downhill. And I can tell you this happens  because it happened to me. Reaching success  I worked hard  I pushed myself. But then I stopped  because I figured   Oh  you know  I made it. I can just sit back and relax.  Reaching success  I always tried to improve and do good work. But then I stopped because I figured   Hey  I'm good enough. I don't need to improve any more.  Reaching success  I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas. Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas. But then I stopped  because I figured I was this hot shot guy and I shouldn't have to work at ideas  they should just come like magic. And the only thing that came was creative block. I couldn't come up with any ideas. Reaching success  I always focused on clients and projects  and ignored the money. Then all this money started pouring in. And I got distracted by it. And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent  when I should have been talking to my clients. And reaching success  I always did what I loved. But then I got into stuff that I didn't love  like management. I am the world's worst manager  but I figured I should be doing it  because I was  after all  the president of the company. Well  soon a black cloud formed over my head and here I was  outwardly very successful  but inwardly very depressed. But I'm a guy  I knew how to fix it. I bought a fast car. It didn't help. I was faster but just as depressed. So I went to my doctor. I said   Doc  I can buy anything I want. But I'm not happy. I'm depressed. It's true what they say  and I didn't believe it until it happened to me. But money can't buy happiness.  He said   No. But it can buy Prozac.  And he put me on anti depressants. And yeah  the black cloud faded a little bit  but so did all the work  because I was just floating along. I couldn't care less if clients ever called. And clients didn't call. Because they could see I was no longer serving them  I was only serving myself. So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better. Well  it didn't take long for business to drop like a rock. My partner and I  Thom  we had to let all our employees go. It was down to just the two of us  and we were about to go under. And that was great. Because with no employees  there was nobody for me to manage. So I went back to doing the projects I loved. I had fun again  I worked harder and  to cut a long story short  did all the things that took me back up to success. But it wasn't a quick trip. It took seven years. But in the end  business grew bigger than ever. And when I went back to following these eight principles  the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether. And I woke up one day and I said   I don't need Prozac anymore.  And I threw it away and haven't needed it since. I learned that success isn't a one way street. It doesn't look like this  it really looks more like this. It's a continuous journey. And if we want to avoid  success to failure syndrome   we just keep following these eight principles  because that is not only how we achieve success  it's how we sustain it. So here is to your continued success. Thank you very much. I have had the distinct pleasure of living inside two biospheres. Of course we all here in this room live in Biosphere  . I've also lived in Biosphere  . And the wonderful thing about that is that I get to compare biospheres. And hopefully from that I get to learn something. So what did I learn  Well  here I am inside Biosphere    making a pizza. So I am harvesting the wheat  in order to make the dough. And then of course I have to milk the goats and feed the goats in order to make the cheese. It took me four months in Biosphere   to make a pizza. Here in Biosphere    well it takes me about two minutes  because I pick up the phone and I call and say   Hey  can you deliver the pizza   So Biosphere   was essentially a three acre  entirely sealed  miniature world that I lived in for two years and    minutes. Over the top it was sealed with steel and glass  underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel    essentially entirely sealed. So we had our own miniature rainforest  a private beach with a coral reef. We had a savanna  a marsh  a desert. We had our own half acre farm that we had to grow everything. And of course we had our human habitat  where we lived. Back in the mid '  s when we were designing Biosphere    we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions. I mean  what is a biosphere  Back then  yes  I guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth  right  Well  you have to get a little more specific than that if you're going to build one. And so we decided that what it really is is that it is entirely materially closed    that is  nothing goes in or out at all  no material    and energetically open  which is essentially what planet Earth is. This is a chamber that was      th the size of Biosphere   that we called our Test Module. And the very first day that this fellow  John Allen  walked in  to spend a couple of days in there with all the plants and animals and bacteria that we'd put in there to hopefully keep him alive  the doctors were incredibly concerned that he was going to succumb to some dreadful toxin  or that his lungs were going to get choked with bacteria or something  fungus. But of course none of that happened. And over the ensuing few years  there were great sagas about designing Biosphere  . But by      we finally had this thing built. And it was time for us to go in and give it a go. We needed to know  is life this malleable  Can you take this biosphere  that has evolved on a planetary scale  and jam it into a little bottle  and will it survive  Big questions. And we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else in the universe    if we were going to go to Mars  for instance  would we take a biosphere with us  to live in it  We also wanted to know so we can understand more about the Earth that we all live in. Well  in      it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby. Let's take it on a maiden voyage. Will it work  Or will something happen that we can't understand and we can't fix  thereby negating the concept of man made biospheres  So eight of us went in  four men and four women. More on that later. And this is the world that we lived in. So  on the top  we had these beautiful rainforests and an ocean  and underneath we had all this technosphere  we called it  which is where all the pumps and the valves and the water tanks and the air handlers  and all of that. One of the Biospherians called it  garden of Eden on top of an aircraft carrier.  And then also we had the human habitat of course  with the laboratories  and all of that. This is the agriculture. It was essentially an organic farm. The day I walked into Biosphere    I was  for the first time  breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world  except seven other people. At that moment I became part of that biosphere. And I don't mean that in an abstract sense  I mean it rather literally. When I breathed out  my CO  fed the sweet potatoes that I was growing. And we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes. And those sweet potatoes became part of me. In fact  we ate so many sweet potatoes I became orange with sweet potato. I literally was eating the same carbon over and over again. I was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way. When it came to our atmosphere  however  it wasn't that much of a joke over the long term  because it turned out that we were losing oxygen  quite a lot of oxygen. And we knew that we were losing CO . And so we were working to sequester carbon. Good lord    we know that term now. We were growing plants like crazy. We were taking their biomass  storing them in the basement  growing plants  going around  around  around  trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere. We were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere. We stopped irrigating our soil  as much as we could. We stopped tilling  so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air. But our oxygen was going down faster than our CO  was going up  which was quite unexpected  because we had seen them going in tandem in the test module. And it was like playing atomic hide and seek. We had lost seven tons of oxygen. And we had no clue where it was. And I tell you  when you lose a lot of oxygen    and our oxygen went down quite far  it went from    percent down to   .  percent    my goodness  do you feel dreadful. I mean we were dragging ourselves around the Biosphere. And we had sleep apnea at night. So you'd wake up gasping with breath  because your blood chemistry has changed. And that you literally do that. You stop breathing and then you     Gasps     take a breath and it wakes you up. And it's very irritating. And everybody outside thought we were dying. I mean  the media was making it sound like were were dying. And I had to call up my mother every other day saying   No  Mum  it's fine  fine. We're not dead. We're fine. We're fine.  And the doctor was  in fact  checking us to make sure we were  in fact  fine. But in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen. And one day he couldn't add up a line of figures. And it was time for us to put oxygen in. And you might think  well   Boy  your life support system was failing you. Wasn't that dreadful   Yes. In a sense it was terrifying. Except that I knew I could walk out the airlock door at any time  if it really got bad  though who was going to say   I can't take it anymore    Not me  that was for sure. But on the other hand  it was the scientific gold of the project  because we could really crank this baby up  as a scientific tool  and see if we could  in fact  find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone. And we did indeed find it. And we found it in the concrete. Essentially it had done something very simple. We had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost. It broke down  it took oxygen out of the air  it put CO  into the air  and it went into the concrete. Pretty straightforward really. So at the end of the two years when we came out  we were elated  because  in fact  although you might say we had discovered something that was quite  uhh   when your oxygen is going down  stopped working  essentially  in your life support system  that's a very bad failure. Except that we knew what it was. And we knew how to fix it. And nothing else emerged that really was as serious as that. And we proved the concept  more or less. People  on the other hand  was a different subject. We were    yeah I don't know that we were fixable. We all went quite nuts  I will say. And the day I came out of Biosphere    I was thrilled I was going to see all my family and my friends. For two years I'd been seeing people through the glass. And everybody ran up to me. And I recoiled. They stank  People stink  We stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant  and all kinds of stuff. Now we had stuff inside Biosphere to keep ourselves clean  but nothing with perfume. And boy do we stink out here. Not only that  but I lost touch of where my food came from. I had been growing all my own food. I had no idea what was in my food  where it came from. I didn't even recognize half the names in most of the food that I was eating. In fact  I would stand for hours in the aisles of shops  reading all the names on all of the things. People must have thought I was nuts. It was really quite astonishing. And I slowly lost track of where I was in this big biosphere  in this big biosphere that we all live in. In Biosphere   I totally understood that I had a huge impact on my biosphere  everyday  and it had an impact on me  very viscerally  very literally. So I went about my business  Paragon Space Development Corporation  a little firm I started with people while I was in the Biosphere  because I had nothing else to do. And one of the things we did was try to figure out  how small can you make these biospheres  and what can you do with them  And so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station. We had one on the shuttle and one on the International Space Station  for    months  where we managed to produce the first organisms to go through complete multiple life cycles in space    really pushing the envelope of understanding how malleable our life systems are. And I'm also proud to announce that you're getting a sneak preview    on Friday we're going to announce that we're actually forming a team to develop a system to grow plants on the Moon  which is going to be pretty fun. And the legacy of that is a system that we were designing  an entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on Mars. And part of that is that we had to model very rapid circulation of CO  and oxygen and water through this plant system. As a result of that modeling I ended up in all places  in Eritrea  in the Horn of Africa. Eritrea  formerly part of Ethiopia  is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful  incredibly stark  and I have no understanding of how people eke out a living there. It is so dry. This is what I saw. But this is also what I saw. I saw a company that had taken seawater and sand  and they were growing a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it. And it will produce a food crop. In this case it was oilseed. It was astonishing. They were also producing mangroves in a plantation. And the mangroves were providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals  so that they could produce milk and whatnot  like we had in the Biosphere. And all of it was coming from this  shrimp farms. Shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth  frankly  from an environmental point of view. They pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean. They also pollute their next door neighbors. So they're all shitting each other's ponds  quite literally. And what this project was doing was taking the effluent of these  and turning them into all of this food. They were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people. They had created an industrial ecosystem  of a sense. I was there because I was actually modeling the mangrove portion for a carbon credit program  under the U.N. Kyoto Protocol system. And as I was modeling this mangrove swamp  I was thinking to myself   How do you put a box around this   When I'm modeling a plant in a box  literally  I know where to draw the boundary. In a mangrove forest like this I have no idea. Well  of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the Earth. And understand its interactions with the entire Earth. And put your project in that context. Around the world today we're seeing an incredible transformation  from what I would call a biocidal species  one that    whether we intentionally or unintentionally    have designed our systems to kill life  a lot of the time. This is in fact  this beautiful photograph  is in fact over the Amazon. And here the light green are areas of massive deforestation. And those beautiful wispy clouds are  in fact  fires  human made fires. We're in the process of transforming from this  to what I would call a biophilic society  one where we learn to nurture society. Now it may not seem like it  but we are. It is happening all across the world  in every kind of walk of life  and every kind of career and industry that you can think of. And I think often times people get lost in that. They go   But how can I possibly find my way in that  It's such a huge subject.  And I would say that the small stuff counts. It really does. This is the story of a rake in my backyard. This was my backyard  very early on  when I bought my property. And in Arizona  of course  everybody puts gravel down. And they like to keep everything beautifully raked. And they keep all the leaves away. And on Sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out  and I want to throttle them. It's a certain type of aesthetic. We're very uncomfortable with untidiness. And I threw away my rake. And I let all of the leaves fall from the trees that I have on my property. And over time  essentially what have I been doing  I've been building topsoil. And so now all the birds come in. And I have hawks. And I have an oasis. This is what happens every spring. For six weeks  six to eight weeks  I have this flush of green oasis. This is actually in a riparian area. And all of Tucson could be like this if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake. The small stuff counts. The Industrial Revolution    and Prometheus    has given us this  the ability to light up the world. It has also given us this  the ability to look at the world from the outside. Now we may not all have another biosphere that we can run to  and compare it to this biosphere. But we can look at the world  and try to understand where we are in its context  and how we choose to interact with it. And if you lose where you are in your biosphere  or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting with where you are in the biosphere  I would say to you  take a deep breath. The yogis had it right. Breath does  in fact  connect us all in a very literal way. Take a breath now. And as you breathe  think about what is in your breath. There perhaps is the CO  from the person sitting next door to you. Maybe there is a little bit of oxygen from some algae on the beach not far from here. It also connects us in time. There may be some carbon in your breath from the dinosaurs. There could also be carbon that you are exhaling now that will be in the breath of your great great great grandchildren. Thank you.  Applause  I want to talk about the transformed media landscape  and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out to anywhere in the world. And I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories about that transformation. I'll start here. Last November there was a presidential election. You probably read something about it in the papers. And there was some concern that in some parts of the country there might be voter suppression. And so a plan came up to video the vote. And the idea was that individual citizens with phones capable of taking photos or making video would document their polling places  on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques  and would upload this to a central place. And that this would operate as a kind of citizen observation    that citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes  but also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote overall. So this is a pattern that assumes we're all in this together. What matters here isn't technical capital  it's social capital. These tools don't get socially interesting until they get technologically boring. It isn't when the shiny new tools show up that their uses start permeating society. It's when everybody is able to take them for granted. Because now that media is increasingly social  innovation can happen anywhere that people can take for granted the idea that we're all in this together. And so we're starting to see a media landscape in which innovation is happening everywhere  and moving from one spot to another. That is a huge transformation. Not to put too fine a point on it  the moment we're living through    the moment our historical generation is living through    is the largest increase in expressive capability in human history. Now that's a big claim. I'm going to try to back it up. There are only four periods in the last     years where media has changed enough to qualify for the label  revolution.  The first one is the famous one  the printing press  movable type  oil based inks  that whole complex of innovations that made printing possible and turned Europe upside down  starting in the middle of the     s. Then  a couple of hundred years ago  there was innovation in two way communication  conversational media  first the telegraph  then the telephone. Slow  text based conversations  then real time voice based conversations. Then  about     years ago  there was a revolution in recorded media other than print  first photos  then recorded sound  then movies  all encoded onto physical objects. And finally  about     years ago  the harnessing of electromagnetic spectrum to send sound and images through the air    radio and television. This is the media landscape as we knew it in the   th century. This is what those of us of a certain age grew up with  and are used to. But there is a curious asymmetry here. The media that is good at creating conversations is no good at creating groups. And the media that's good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations. If you want to have a conversation in this world  you have it with one other person. If you want to address a group  you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group  whether you're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press. That was the media landscape as we had it in the twentieth century. And this is what changed. This thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen is Bill Cheswick's map of the Internet. He traces the edges of the individual networks and then color codes them. The Internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time. Whereas the phone gave us the one to one pattern  and television  radio  magazines  books  gave us the one to many pattern  the Internet gives us the many to many pattern. For the first time  media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations. That's one of the big changes. The second big change is that  as all media gets digitized  the Internet also becomes the mode of carriage for all other media  meaning that phone calls migrate to the Internet  magazines migrate to the Internet  movies migrate to the Internet. And that means that every medium is right next door to every other medium. Put another way  media is increasingly less just a source of information  and it is increasingly more a site of coordination  because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well. And the third big change is that members of the former audience  as Dan Gilmore calls them  can now also be producers and not consumers. Every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well  because the same equipment    phones  computers    let you consume and produce. It's as if  when you bought a book  they threw in the printing press for free  it's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you pressed the right buttons. That is a huge change in the media landscape we're used to. And it's not just Internet or no Internet. We've had the Internet in its public form for almost    years now  and it's still changing as the media becomes more social. It's still changing patterns even among groups who know how to deal with the Internet well. Second story. Last May  China in the Sichuan province had a terrible earthquake   .  magnitude  massive destruction in a wide area  as the Richter Scale has it. And the earthquake was reported as it was happening. People were texting from their phones. They were taking photos of buildings. They were taking videos of buildings shaking. They were uploading it to QQ  China's largest Internet service. They were Twittering it. And so as the quake was happening the news was reported. And because of the social connections  Chinese students coming elsewhere  and going to school  or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in China    there were people listening all over the world  hearing this news. The BBC got their first wind of the Chinese quake from Twitter. Twitter announced the existence of the quake several minutes before the US Geological Survey had anything up online for anybody to read. The last time China had a quake of that magnitude it took them three months to admit that it had happened. Now they might have liked to have done that here  rather than seeing these pictures go up online. But they weren't given that choice  because their own citizens beat them to the punch. Even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens  rather than from the Xinhua News Agency. And this stuff rippled like wildfire. For a while there the top    most clicked links on Twitter  the global short messaging service    nine of the top    links were about the quake. People collating information  pointing people to news sources  pointing people to the US geological survey. The   th one was kittens on a treadmill  but that's the Internet for you. But nine of the    in those first hours. And within half a day donation sites were up  and donations were pouring in from all around the world. This was an incredible  coordinated global response. And the Chinese then  in one of their periods of media openness  decided that they were going to let it go  that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly. And then this happened. People began to figure out  in the Sichuan Provence  that the reason so many school buildings had collapsed    because tragically the earthquake happened during a school day    the reason so many school buildings collapsed is that corrupt officials had taken bribes to allow those building to be built to less than code. And so they started  the citizen journalists started reporting that as well. And there was an incredible picture. You may have seen in on the front page of the New York Times. A local official literally prostrated himself in the street  in front of these protesters  in order to get them to go away. Essentially to say   We will do anything to placate you  just please stop protesting in public.  But these are people who have been radicalized  because  thanks to the one child policy  they have lost everyone in their next generation. Someone who has seen the death of a single child now has nothing to lose. And so the protest kept going. And finally the Chinese cracked down. That was enough of citizen media. And so they began to arrest the protesters. They began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on. China is probably the most successful manager of Internet censorship in the world  using something that is widely described as the Great Firewall of China. And the Great Firewall of China is a set of observation points that assume that media is produced by professionals  it mostly comes in from the outside world  it comes in relatively sparse chunks  and it comes in relatively slowly. And because of those four characteristics they are able to filter it as it comes into the country. But like the Maginot Line  the great firewall of China was facing in the wrong direction for this challenge  because not one of those four things was true in this environment. The media was produced locally. It was produced by amateurs. It was produced quickly. And it was produced at such an incredible abundance that there was no way to filter it as it appeared. And so now the Chinese government  who for a dozen years  has quite successfully filtered the web  is now in the position of having to decide whether to allow or shut down entire services  because the transformation to amateur media is so enormous that they can't deal with it any other way. And in fact that is happening this week. On the   th anniversary of Tiananmen they just  two days ago  announced that they were simply shutting down access to Twitter  because there was no way to filter it other than that. They had to turn the spigot entirely off. Now these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages. They also affect people who want to send messages  because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole  not just a particular strategy. The classic media problem  from the   th century is  how does an organization have a message that they want to get out to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network. And here is the twentieth century answer. Bundle up the message. Send the same message to everybody. National message. Targeted individuals. Relatively sparse number of producers. Very expensive to do  so there is not a lot of competition. This is how you reach people. All of that is over. We are increasingly in a landscape where media is global  social  ubiquitous and cheap. Now most organizations that are trying to send messages to the outside world  to the distributed collection of the audience  are now used to this change. The audience can talk back. And that's a little freaky. But you can get used to it after a while  as people do. But that's not the really crazy change that we're living in the middle of. The really crazy change is here  it's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other  the fact that former consumers are now producers  the fact that the audience can talk directly to one another  because there is a lot more amateurs than professionals  and because the size of the network  the complexity of the network is actually the square of the number of participants  meaning that the network  when it grows large  grows very  very large. As recently at last decade  most of the media that was available for public consumption was produced by professionals. Those days are over  never to return. It is the green lines now  that are the source of the free content  which brings me to my last story. We saw some of the most imaginative use of social media during the Obama campaign. And I don't mean most imaginative use in politics    I mean most imaginative use ever. And one of the things Obama did  was they famously  the Obama campaign did  was they famously put up MyBarackObama.com  myBO.com And millions of citizens rushed in to participate  and to try and figure out how to help. An incredible conversation sprung up there. And then  this time last year  Obama announced that he was going to change his vote on FISA  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. He had said  in January  that he would not sign a bill that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying on American persons. By the summer  in the middle of the general campaign  He said   I've thought about the issue more. I've changed my mind. I'm going to vote for this bill.  And many of his own supporters on his own site went very publicly berserk. It was Senator Obama when they created it. They changed the name later.  Please get FISA right.  Within days of this group being created it was the fastest growing group on myBO.com  within weeks of its being created it was the largest group. Obama had to issue a press release. He had to issue a reply. And he said essentially   I have considered the issue. I understand where you are coming from. But having considered it all  I'm still going to vote the way I'm going to vote. But I wanted to reach out to you and say  I understand that you disagree with me  and I'm going to take my lumps on this one.  This didn't please anybody. But then a funny thing happened in the conversation. People in that group realized that Obama had never shut them down. Nobody in the Obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group or make it harder to join  to deny its existence  to delete it  to take to off the site. They had understood that their role with myBO.com was to convene their supporters but not to control their supporters. And that is the kind of discipline that it takes to make really mature use of this media. Media  the media landscape that we knew  as familiar as it was  as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs  is increasingly slipping away. In a world where media is global  social  ubiquitous and cheap  in a world of media where the former audience are now increasingly full participants  in that world  media is less and less often about crafting a single message to be consumed by individuals. It is more and more often a way of creating an environment for convening and supporting groups. And the choice we face  I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world  isn't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in. That's the media environment we've got. The question we all face now is   How can we make best use of this media  Even though it means changing the way we've always done it.  Thank you very much. My journey to coming here today started in     . That's me with the funny gloves. I was    and going on a peace walk. What I didn't know though  was most of those people  standing there with me  were Moonies. And within a week I had come to believe that the second coming of Christ had occurred  that it was Sun Myung Moon  and that I had been specially chosen and prepared by God to be his disciple. Now as cool as that sounds  my family was not that thrilled with this. And they tried everything they could to get me out of there. There was an underground railroad of sorts that was going on during those years. Maybe some of you remember it. They were called deprogrammers. And after about five long years my family had me deprogrammed. And I then became a deprogrammer. I started going out on cases. And after about five years of doing this  I was arrested for kidnapping. Most of the cases I went out on were called involuntary. What happened was that the family had to get their loved ones some safe place somehow. And so they took them to some safe place. And we would come in and talk to them  usually for about a week. And so after this happened  I decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work. And about    years went by. There was a burning question though that would not leave me. And that was   How did this happen to me   And in fact  what did happen to my brain  Because something did. And so I decided to write a book  a memoir  about this decade of my life. And toward the end of writing that book there was a documentary that came out. It was on Jonestown. And it had a chilling effect on me. These are the dead in Jonestown. About     people died that day  most of them taking their own lives. Women gave poison to their babies  and watched foam come from their mouths as they died. The top picture is a group of Moonies that have been blessed by their messiah. Their mates were chosen for them. The bottom picture is Hitler youth. This is the leg of a suicide bomber. The thing I had to admit to myself  with great repulsion  was that I get it. I understand how this could happen. I understand how someone's brain  how someone's mind can come to the place where it makes sense    in fact it would be wrong  when your brain is working like that    not to try to save the world through genocide. And so what is this  How does this work  And how I've come to view what happened to me is a viral  memetic infection. For those of you who aren't familiar with memetics  a meme has been defined as an idea that replicates in the human brain and moves from brain to brain like a virus  much like a virus. The way a virus works is    it can infect and do the most damage to someone who has a compromised immune system. In       I was young  I was naive  and I was pretty lost in my world. I was really idealistic. These easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable. What happens is that circular logic takes over.  Moon is one with God. God is going to fix all the problems in the world. All I have to do is humbly follow. Because God is going to stop war and hunger    all these things I wanted to do    all I have to do is humbly follow. Because after all  God is  working through  the messiah. He's going to fix all this.  It becomes impenetrable. And the most dangerous part of this is that is creates  us  and  them    right  and  wrong    good  and  evil.  And it makes anything possible  makes anything rationalizable. And the thing is  though  if you looked at my brain during those years in the Moonies    neuroscience is expanding exponentially  as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday. Science is expanding. We're beginning to look inside the brain. And so if you looked at my brain  or any brain that's infected with a viral memetic infection like this  and compared it to anyone in this room  or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis  I am convinced it would look very  very different. And that  strange as it may sound  gives me hope. And the reason that gives me hope is that the first thing is to admit that we have a problem. But it's a human problem. It's a scientific problem  if you will. It happens in the human brain. There is no evil force out there to get us. And so this is something that  through research and education  I believe that we can solve. And so the first step is to realize that we can do this together  and that there is no  us  and  them.  Thank you very much.  Applause  A talk about surgical robots is also a talk about surgery. And while I've tried to make my images not too graphic  keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood than normal people do  because  after all  what a surgeon does to a patient  if it were done without consent  would be a felony. Surgeons are the tailors  the plumbers  the carpenters    some would say the butchers    of the medical world  cutting  reshaping  reforming  bypassing  fixing. But you need to talk about surgical instruments and the evolution of surgical technology together. So in order to give you some kind of a perspective of where we are right now with surgical robots  and where we're going to be going in the future  I want to give you a little bit of perspective of how we got to this point  how we even came to believe that surgery was OK  that this was something that was possible to do  that this kind of cutting and reforming was OK. So  a little bit of perspective    about        years of perspective. This is a trephinated skull. And trephination is simply just cutting a hole in the skull. And many  many hundreds of skulls like this have been found in archaeological sites all over the world  dating back five to    thousand years. Five to    thousand years  Now imagine this. You are a healer in a Stone Age village. And you have some guy that you're not quite sure what's wrong with him    Oliver Sacks is going to be born way in the future. He's got some seizure disorder. And you don't understand this. But you think to yourself   I'm not quite sure what's wrong with this guy. But maybe if I cut a hole in his head I can fix it.  Now that is surgical thinking. Now we've got the dawn of interventional surgery here. What is astonishing about this is  even though we don't know really how much of this was intended to be religious  or how much of it was intended to be therapeutic  what we can tell is that these patients lived  Judging by the healing on the borders of these holes  they lived days  months  years following trephination. And so what we are seeing is evidence of a refined technique that was being handed down over thousands and thousands of years  all over the world. This arose independently at sites everywhere that had no communication to one another. We really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery. Now we can fast forward many thousands of years into the Bronze Age and beyond. And we see new refined tools coming out. But surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold  trephinating ancestors. These guys confined their surgery to fairly superficial injuries. And surgeons were tradesmen  rather than physicians. This persisted all the way into and through the Renaissance. That may have saved the writers  but it didn't really save the surgeons terribly much. They were still a mistrusted lot. Surgeons still had a bit of a PR problem  because the landscape was dominated by the itinerant barber surgeon. These were folks that traveled from village to village  town to town  doing surgery sort of as a form of performance art. Because we were in the age before anesthesia  the agony of the patient is really as much of the public spectacle as the surgery itself. One of the most famous of these guys  Frere Jacques  shown here doing a lithotomy    which is the removal of the bladder stone  one of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time    had to take less than two minutes. You had to have quite a flair for the dramatic  and be really  really quick. And so here you see him doing a lithotomy. And he is credited with doing over       of these public surgeries  wandering around in Europe  which is an astonishing number  when you think that surgery must have been a last resort. I mean who would put themselves through that  Until anesthesia  the absence of sensation. With the demonstration of the Morton Ether Inhaler at the Mass. General in       a whole new era of surgery was ushered in. Anesthesia gave surgeons the freedom to operate. Anesthesia gave them the freedom to experiment  to start to delve deeper into the body. This was truly a revolution in surgery. But there was a pretty big problem with this. After these very long  painstaking operations  attempting to cure things they'd never been able to touch before  the patients died. They died of massive infection. Surgery didn't hurt anymore  but it killed you pretty quickly. And infection would continue to claim a majority of surgical patients until the next big revolution in surgery  which was aseptic technique. Joseph Lister was aepsis's  or sterility's  biggest advocate  to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons. But eventually they did come around. The Mayo brothers came out to visit Lister in Europe. And they came back to their American clinic and they said they had learned it was as important to wash your hands before doing surgery as it was to wash up afterwards.  Laughter  Something so simple. And yet  operative mortality dropped profoundly. These surgeries were actually now being effective. With the patient insensitive to pain  and a sterile operating field all bets were off  the sky was the limit. You could now start doing surgery everywhere  on the gut  on the liver  on the heart  on the brain. Transplantation  you could take an organ out of one person  you could put it in another person  and it would work. Surgeons didn't have a problem with respectability anymore  they had become gods. The era of the  big surgeon  big incision  had arrived  but at quite a cost  because they are saving lives  but not necessarily quality of life  because healthy people don't usually need surgery  and unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that. The question had to be asked   Well  can we do these same surgeries but through little incisions   Laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery  surgery with long instruments through small incisions. And it really changed the landscape of surgery. Some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years  but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique until the     s  when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that  that allowed this to be done for real operations. So what you see    this is now the first surgical image    as we're coming down the tube  this is a new entry into the body. It looks very different from what you're expecting surgery to look like. We bring instruments in  from two separate cuts in the side  and then you can start manipulating tissue. Within    years of the first gallbladder surgeries being done laparoscopically  a majority of gallbladder surgeries were being done laparoscopically    truly a pretty big revolution. But there were casualties of this revolution. These techniques were a lot harder to learn than people had anticipated. The learning curve was very long. And during that learning curve the complications went quite a bit higher. Surgeons had to give up their  D vision. They had to give up their wrists. They had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments. This surgeon has over       hours of laparoscopic experience. Now this is a particularly frustrating placement of the needle. But this is hard. And one of the reasons why it is so hard is because the external ergonomics are terrible. You've got these long instruments  and you're working off your centerline. And the instruments are essentially working backwards. So what you need to do  to take the capability of your hand  and put it on the other side of that small incision  is you need to put a wrist on that instrument. And so    I get to talk about robots    the da Vinci robot put just that wrist on the other side of that incision. And so here you're seeing the operation of this wrist. And now  in contrast to the laparoscopy  you can precisely place the needle in your instruments  and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory. And the reason why this becomes so much easier is    you can see on the bottom    the hands are making the motions  and the instruments are following those motions exactly. Now  what you put between those instruments and those hands  is a large  fairly complicated robot. The surgeon is sitting at a console  and controlling the robot with these controllers. And the robot is moving these instruments around  and powering them  down inside the body. You have a  D camera  so you get a  D view. And since this was introduced in       a lot of these robots have been out and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy  which is a prostate deep in the pelvis  and it requires fine dissection and delicate manipulation to be able to get a good surgical outcome. You can also sew bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart without cracking the chest. This is all done in between the ribs. And you can go inside the heart itself and repair the valves from the inside. You've got these technologies    thank you    And so you might say   Wow this is really cool  So  smartypants  why isn't all surgery being done this way   And there are some reasons  some good reasons. And cost is one of them. I talked about the large  complicated robot. With all its bells and whistles  one of those robots will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon. More useful than a solid gold surgeon  but  still  it's a fairly big capital investment. But once you've got it  your procedure costs do come down. But there are other barriers. So something like a prostatectomy    the prostate is small  and it's in one spot  and you can set your robot up very precisely to work in that one spot. And so it's perfect for something like that. And in fact if you  or anyone you know  had their prostate taken out in the last couple of years  chances are it was done with one of these systems. But if you need to reach more places than just one  you need to move the robot. And you need to put some new incisions in there. And you need to re set it up. And then you need to add some more ports  and more. And the problem is it gets time consuming  and cumbersome. And for that reason there are many surgeries that just aren't being done with the da Vinci. So we had to ask the question   Well how do we fix that   What if we could change it so that we didn't have to re set up each time we wanted to move somewhere different  What if we could bring all the instruments in together in one place  How would that change the capabilities of the surgeon  And how would that change the experience for the patient  Now  to do that  we need to be able to bring a camera and instruments in together through one small tube  like that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video. Or  not so coincidentally  like a tube like this. So what's going to come out of that tube is the debut of this new technology  this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere. Ready  So here it comes. This is the camera  and three instruments. And as you see it come out  in order to actually be able to do anything useful  it can't all stay clustered up like this. It has to be able to come off of the centerline and then be able to work back toward that centerline. He's a cheeky little devil. But what this lets you do is gives you that all important traction  and counter traction  so that you can dissect  so that you can sew  so that you can do all the things that you need to do  all the surgical tasks. But it's all coming in through one incision. It's not so simple. But it's worth it for the freedom that this gives us as we're going around. For the patient  however  it's transparent. This is all they're going to see. It's very exciting to think where we get to go with this. We get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery. As we take these capabilities  and we get to go to the next places  we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be. And I think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution  we need to not just take our hands in in new ways  we also need to take our eyes in in new ways. We need to see beyond the surface. We need to be able to guide what we're cutting in a much better way. This is a cancer surgery. One of the problems with this  even for surgeons who've been looking at this a lot  is you can't see the cancer  especially when it's hidden below the surface. And so what we're starting to do is we're starting to inject specially designed markers into the bloodstream that will target the cancer. It will go  bind to the cancer. And we can make those markers glow. And we can take special cameras  and we can look at it. Now we know where we need to cut  even when it's below the surface. We can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site. And we can follow where they flow out from that tumor site  so we can see the first places where that cancer might travel. We can inject these dyes into the bloodstream  so that when we do a new vessel and we bypass a blockage on the heart  we can see if we actually made the connection  before we close that patient back up again    something that we haven't been able to do without radiation before. We can light up tumors like this kidney tumor  so that you can exactly see where the boundary is between the kidney tumor and the kidney you want to leave behind  or the liver tumor and the liver you want to leave behind. And we don't even need to confine ourselves to this macro vision. We have flexible microscopic probes that we can bring down into the body. And we can look at cells directly. I'm looking at nerves here. So these are nerves you see  down on the bottom  and the microscope probe that's being held by the robotic hand  up at the top. So this is all very prototypey at this point. But you care about nerves  if you are a surgical patient. Because they let you keep continence  bladder control  and sexual function after surgery  all of which is generally fairly important to the patient. So  with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all  and we can see it all. We can heal the disease. And we can leave the patient whole and intact and functional afterwards. Now  I've talked about the patient as if the patient is  somehow  someone abstract outside this room. And that is not the case. Many of you  all of you maybe  will at some point  or have already  faced a diagnosis of cancer  or heart disease  or some organ dysfunction that's going to buy you a date with a surgeon. And when you get to that point    I mean  these maladies don't care how many books you've written  how many companies you've started  that Nobel Prize you have yet to win  how much time you planned to spend with your children. These maladies come for us all. And the prospect I'm offering you  of an easier surgery ... is that going to make that diagnosis any less terrifying  I'm not sure I really even want it to. Because facing your own mortality causes a re evaluation of priorities  and a realignment of what your goals are in life  unlike anything else. And I would never want to deprive you of that epiphany. What I want instead  is for you to be whole  intact  and functional enough to go out and save the world  after you've decided you need to do it. And that is my vision for your future. Thank you. I want to share with you some ideas about the secret power of time  in a very short time. Video  All right  start the clock please.    seconds studio. Keep it quiet please. Settle down. It's about time. End sequence. Take one.    seconds studio.     nine  eight  seven  six  five  four  three  two ... Philip Zimbardo  Let's tune into the conversation of the principals in Adam's temptation.  Come on Adam  don't be so wishy washy. Take a bite.   I did.   One bite  Adam. Don't abandon Eve.   I don't know  guys. I don't want to get in trouble.   Okay. One bite. What the hell   Life is temptation. It's all about yielding  resisting  yes  no  now  later  impulsive  reflective  present focus and future focus. Promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment. Of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage    thank you George Bush    the majority     percent  yielded to sexual temptations within one year. And most of them did so without using birth control. So much for promises. Now lets tempt four year olds  giving them a treat. They can have one marshmallow now. But if they wait until the experimenter comes back  they can have two. Of course it pays  if you like marshmallows  to wait. What happens is two thirds of the kids give in to temptation. They cannot wait. The others  of course  wait. They resist the temptation. They delay the now for later. Walter Mischel  my colleague at Stanford  went back    years later  to try to discover what was different about those kids. There were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded  in many ways. The kids who resisted scored     points higher on the SAT. That's enormous. That's like a whole set of different IQ points. They didn't get in as much trouble. They were better students. They were self confident and determined. And the key for me today  the key for you  is  they were future focused rather than present focused. So what is time perspective  That's what I'm going to talk about today. Time perspective is the study of how individuals  all of us  divide the flow of your human experience into time zones or time categories. And you do it automatically and non consciously. They vary between cultures  between nations  between individuals  between social classes  between education levels. And the problem is that they can become biased  because you learn to over use some of them and under use the others. What determines any decision you make  You make a decision on which you're going to base an action. For some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation  what other people are doing and what you're feeling. And those people  when they make their decisions in that format    we're going to call them  present oriented   because their focus is what is now. For others  the present is irrelevant. It's always about  What is this situation like that I've experienced in the past   So that their decisions are based on past memories. And we're going to call those people  past oriented   because they focus on what was. For others it's not the past  it's not the present  it's only about the future. Their focus is always about anticipated consequences. Cost benefit analysis. We're going to call them  future oriented.  Their focus is on what will be. So  time paradox  I want to argue  the paradox of time perspective  is something that influences every decision you make  you're totally unaware of. Namely  the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives. Well there is actually six of them. There are two ways to be present oriented. There is two ways to be past oriented  two ways to be future. You can focus on past positive  or past negative. You can be present hedonistic  namely you focus on the joys of life  or present fatalist    it doesn't matter  your life is controlled. You can be future oriented  setting goals. Or you can be transcendental future  namely  life begins after death. Developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly depending on the demands of the situation  that's what you've got to learn to do. So  very quickly  what is the optimal time profile  High on past positive. Moderately high on future. And moderate on present hedonism. And always low on past negative and present fatalism. So the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past    past positive gives you roots. You connect your family  identity and your self. What you get from the future is wings to soar to new destinations  new challenges. What you get from the present hedonism is the energy  the energy to explore yourself  places  people  sensuality. Any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives. What do futures sacrifice for success  They sacrifice family time. They sacrifice friend time. They sacrifice fun time. They sacrifice personal indulgence. They sacrifice hobbies. And they sacrifice sleep. So it affects their health. And they live for work  achievement and control. I'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters. And it resonated for me. I grew up as a poor kid in the South Bronx ghetto  a Sicilian family    everyone lived in the past and present. I'm here as a future oriented person who went over the top  who did all these sacrifices because teachers intervened  and made me future oriented. Told me don't eat that marshmallow  because if you wait you're going to get two of them  until I learned to balance out. I've added present hedonism  I've added a focus on the past positive  so  at    years old  I am more energetic than ever  more productive  and I'm happier than I have ever been. I just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems  changing the drop out rates of school kids  combating addictions  enhancing teen health  curing vets' PTSD with time metaphors    getting miracle cures    promoting sustainability and conservation  reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a    percent drop out rate  altering appeals to suicidal terrorists  and modifying family conflicts as time zone clashes. So I want to end by saying  many of life's puzzles can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others. And the idea is so simple  so obvious  but I think the consequences are really profound. Thank you so much. I'm going to talk about post conflict recovery and how we might do post conflict recovery better. The record on post conflict recovery is not very impressive.    percent of all post conflict situations  historically  have reverted back to conflict within a decade. In fact  they've accounted for half of all civil wars. Why has the record been so poor  Well  the conventional approach to post conflict situations has rested on  on kind of  three principles. The first principle is  it's the politics that matters. So  the first thing that is prioritized is politics. Try and build a political settlement first. And then the second step is to say   The situation is admittedly dangerous  but only for a short time.  So get peacekeepers there  but get them home as soon as possible. So  short term peacekeepers. And thirdly  what is the exit strategy for the peacekeepers  It's an election. That will produce a legitimate and accountable government. So that's the conventional approach. I think that approach denies reality. We see that there is no quick fix. There's certainly no quick security fix. I've tried to look at the risks of reversion to conflict  during our post conflict decade. And the risks stay high throughout the decade. And they stay high regardless of the political innovations. Does an election produce an accountable and legitimate government  What an election produces is a winner and a loser. And the loser is unreconciled. The reality is that we need to reverse the sequence. It's not the politics first  it's actually the politics last. The politics become easier as the decade progresses if you're building on a foundation of security and economic development    the rebuilding of prosperity. Why does the politics get easier  And why is it so difficult initially  Because after years of stagnation and decline  the mentality of politics is that it's a zero sum game. If the reality is stagnation  I can only go up if you go down. And that doesn't produce a productive politics. And so the mentality has to shift from zero sum to positive sum before you can get a productive politics. You can only get positive  that mental shift  if the reality is that prosperity is being built. And in order to build prosperity  we need security in place. So that is what you get when you face reality. But the objective of facing reality is to change reality. And so now let me suggest two complimentary approaches to changing the reality of the situations. The first is to recognize the interdependence of three key actors  who are different actors  and at the moment are uncoordinated. The first actor is the Security Council. The Security Council typically has the responsibility for providing the peacekeepers who build the security. And that needs to be recognized  first of all  that peacekeeping works. It is a cost effective approach. It does increase security. But it needs to be done long term. It needs to be a decade long approach  rather than just a couple of years. That's one actor  the Security Council. The second actor  different cast of guys  is the donors. The donors provide post conflict aid. Typically in the past  the donors have been interested in the first couple of years  and then they got bored. They moved on to some other situation. Post conflict economic recovery is a slow process. There are no quick processes in economics except decline. You can do that quite fast. So the donors have to stick with this situation for at least a decade. And then the third key actor is the post conflict government. And there are two key things it's got to do. One is it's got to do economic reform  not fuss about the political constitution. It's got to reform economic policy. Why  Because during conflict economic policy typically deteriorates. Governments snatch short term opportunities and  by the end of the conflict  the chickens have come home to roost. So this legacy of conflict is really bad economic policy. So there is a reform agenda  and there is an inclusion agenda. The inclusion agenda doesn't come from elections. Elections produce a loser  who is then excluded. So the inclusion agenda means genuinely bringing people inside the tent. So those three actors. And they are interdependent over a long term. If the Security Council doesn't commit to security over the course of a decade  you don't get the reassurance which produces private investment. If you don't get the policy reform and the aid  you don't get the economic recovery  which is the true exit strategy for the peacekeepers. So we should recognize that interdependence  by formal  mutual commitments. The United Nations actually has a language for these mutual commitments  the recognition of mutual commitments  it's called the language of compact. And so we need a post conflict compact. The United Nations even has an agency which could broker these compacts  it's called the Peace Building Commission. It would be ideal to have a standard set of norms where  when we got to a post conflict situation  there was an expectation of these mutual commitments from the three parties. So that's idea one  recognize interdependence. And now let me turn to the second approach  which is complimentary. And that is to focus on a few critical objectives. Typical post conflict situation is a zoo of different actors with different priorities. And indeed  unfortunately  if you navigate by needs you get a very unfocused agenda  because in these situations  needs are everywhere  but the capacity to implement change is very limited. So we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical. And I want to suggest that in the typical post conflict situation three things are critical. One is jobs. One is improvements in basic services    especially health  which is a disaster during conflict. So jobs  health  and clean government. Those are the three critical priorities. So I'm going to talk a little about each of them. Jobs. What is a distinctive approach to generating jobs in post conflict situations  And why are jobs so important  Jobs for whom  Especially jobs for young men. In post conflict situations  the reason that they so often revert to conflict  is not because elderly women get upset. It's because young men get upset. And why are they upset  Because they have nothing to do. And so we need a process of generating jobs  for ordinary young men  fast. Now  that is difficult. Governments in post conflict situation often respond by puffing up the civil service. That is not a good idea. It's not sustainable. In fact  you're building a long term liability by inflating civil service. But getting the private sector to expand is also difficult  because any activity which is open to international trade is basically going to be uncompetitive in a post conflict situation. These are not environments where you can build export manufacturing. There's one sector which isn't exposed to international trade  and which can generate a lot of jobs  and which is  in any case  a sensible sector to expand  post conflict  and that is the construction sector. The construction sector has a vital role  obviously  in reconstruction. But typically that sector has withered away during conflict. During conflict people are doing destruction. There isn't any construction going on. And so the sector shrivels away. And then when you try and expand it  because it's shriveled away  you encounter a lot of bottlenecks. Basically  prices soar and crooked politicians then milk the rents from the sector  but it doesn't generate any jobs. And so the policy priority is to break the bottlenecks in expanding the construction sector. What might the bottlenecks be  Just think what you have to do successfully to build a structure  using a lot of labor. First you need access to land. Often the legal system is broken down so you can't even get access to land. Secondly you need skills  the mundane skills of the construction sector. In post conflict situations we don't just need Doctors Without Borders  we need Bricklayers Without Borders  to rebuild the skill set. We need firms. The firms have gone away. So we need to encourage the growth of local firms. If we do that  we not only get the jobs  we get the improvements in public infrastructure  the restoration of public infrastructure. Let me turn from jobs to the second objective  which is improving basic social services. And to date  there has been a sort of a schizophrenia in the donor community  as to how to build basic services in post conflict sectors. On the one hand it pays lip service to the idea of rebuild an effective state in the image of Scandinavia in the     s. Lets develop line ministries of this  that  and the other  that deliver these services. And it's schizophrenic because in their hearts donors know that's not a realistic agenda  and so what they also do is the total bypass  just fund NGOs. Neither of those approaches is sensible. And so what I'd suggest is what I call Independent Service Authorities. It's to split the functions of a monopoly line ministry up into three. The planning function and policy function stays with the ministry  the delivery of services on the ground  you should use whatever works    churches  NGOs  local communities  whatever works. And in between  there should be a public agency  the Independent Service Authority  which channels public money  and especially donor money  to the retail providers. So the NGOs become part of a public government system  rather than independent of it. One advantage of that is that you can allocate money coherently. Another is  you can make NGOs accountable. You can use yardstick competition  so they have to compete against each other for the resources. The good NGOs  like Oxfam  are very keen on this idea. They want to have the discipline and accountability. So that's a way to get basic services scaled up. And because the government would be funding it  it would be co branding these services. So they wouldn't be provided thanks to the United States government and some NGO. They would be co branded as being done by the post conflict government  in the country. So  jobs  basic services  finally  clean government. Clean means follow their money. The typical post conflict government is so short of money that it needs our money just to be on a life support system. You can't get the basic functions of the state done unless we put money into the core budget of these countries. But  if we put money into the core budget  we know that there aren't the budget systems with integrity that mean that money will be well spent. And if all we do is put money in and close our eyes it's not just that the money is wasted    that's the least of the problems    it's that the money is captured. It's captured by the crooks who are at the heart of the political problem. And so inadvertently we empower the people who are the problem. So building clean government means  yes  provide money to the budget  but also provide a lot of scrutiny  which means a lot of technical assistance that follows the money. Paddy Ashdown  who was the grand high nabob of Bosnia to the United Nations  in his book about his experience  he said   I realize what I needed was accountants without borders  to follow that money.  So that's the    let me wrap up  this is the package. What's the goal  If we follow this  what would we hope to achieve  That after    years  the focus on the construction sector would have produced both jobs and  hence  security    because young people would have jobs    and it would have reconstructed the infrastructure. So that's the focus on the construction sector. The focus on the basic service delivery through these independent service authorities would have rescued basic services from their catastrophic levels  and it would have given ordinary people the sense that the government was doing something useful. The emphasis on clean government would have gradually squeezed out the political crooks  because there wouldn't be any money in taking part in the politics. And so gradually the selection  the composition of politicians  would shift from the crooked to the honest. Where would that leave us  Gradually it would shift from a politics of plunder to a politics of hope. Thank you. I want to help you re perceive what philanthropy is  what it could be  and what your relationship to it is. And in doing that  I want to offer you a vision  an imagined future  if you will  of how  as the poet Seamus Heaney has put it   Once in a lifetime the longed for tidal wave of justice can rise up  and hope and history rhyme.  I want to start with these word pairs here. We all know which side of these we'd like to be on. When philanthropy was reinvented a century ago  when the foundation form was actually invented  they didn't think of themselves on the wrong side of these either. In fact they would never have thought of themselves as closed and set in their ways  as slow to respond to new challenges  as small and risk averse. And in fact they weren't. They were reinventing charity in those times  what Rockefeller called  the business of benevolence.  But by the end of the   th century  a new generation of critics and reformers had come to see philanthropy just this way. The thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about    and that's exactly what is happening    is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions  for philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected  in service of the long term. This entrepreneurial energy is emerging from many quarters. And it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders  like many of the people here  by new tools  like the ones we've seen here  and by new pressures. I've been following this change for quite a while now  and participating in it. This report is our main public report. What it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as     years ago. What I want to do is share some of the coolest things that are going on with you. And as I do that  I'm not going to dwell much on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about    the Gates or the Soros or the Google. Instead  what I want to do is talk about the philanthropy of all of us  the democratization of philanthropy. This is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time. What I'm going to do is look at five categories of experiments  each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy. The first is mass collaboration  represented here by Wikipedia. Now  this may surprise you. But remember  philanthropy is about giving of time and talent  not just money. Clay Shirky  that great chronicler of everything networked  has captured the assumption that this challenges in such a beautiful way. He said   We have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money. Now we have Wikipedia. Suddenly big things can be done for love.  Watch  this spring  for Paul Hawken's new book    Author and entrepreneur many of you may know about. The book is called  Blessed Unrest.  And when it comes out  a series of wiki sites under the label WISER  are going to launch at the same time. WISER stands for World Index for Social and Environmental Responsibility. WISER sets out to document  link and empower what Paul calls the largest movement  and fastest growing movement in human history  humanity's collective immune response to today's threats. Now  all of these big things for love    experiments    aren't going to take off. But the ones that do are going to be the biggest  the most open  the fastest  the most connected form of philanthropy in human history. Second category is online philanthropy marketplaces. This is  of course  to philanthropy what eBay and Amazon are to commerce. Think of it as peer to peer philanthropy. And this challenges yet another assumption  which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy. Take a look  if you haven't  at DonorsChoose. Omidyar Network has made a big investment in DonorsChoose. It's one of the best known of these new marketplaces where a donor can go straight into a classroom and connect with what a teacher says they need. Take a look at Changing the Present  started by a TEDster  next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present. GiveIndia is for a whole country. And it goes on and on. The third category is represented by Warren Buffet  which I call aggregated giving. It's not just that Warren Buffet was so amazingly generous in that historic act last summer. It's that he challenged another assumption  that every giver should have his or her own fund or foundation. There are now  today  so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing  bringing together people around a common goal  to think bigger. One of the best known is Acumen Fund  led by Jacqueline Novogratz  a TEDster who got a big boost here at TED. But there are many others  New Profit in Cambridge  New School's Venture Fund in Silicon Valley  Venture Philanthropy Partners in Washington  Global Fund for Women in San Francisco. Take a look at these. These funds are to philanthropy what venture capital  private equity  and eventually mutual funds are to investing  but with a twist    because often a community forms around these funds  as it has at Acumen and other places. Now  imagine for a second these first three types of experiments  mass collaboration  online marketplaces  aggregated giving. And understand how they help us re perceive what organized philanthropy is. It's not about foundations necessarily  it's about the rest of us. And imagine the mash up  if you will  of these things  in the future  when these things come together in the experiments of the future    imagine that somebody puts up  say      million dollars for an inspiring goal    there were    gifts of     million dollars or more in the US last year  not out of the question    but only puts it up if it's matched by millions of small gifts from around the globe  thereby engaging lots of people  and building visibility and engaging people in the goal that's stated. I'm going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories  which are innovation  competitions and social investing. They're betting a visible competition  a prize  can attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues  and thereby speed the solution. This tackles yet another assumption  that the giver and the organization is at the center  as opposed to putting the problem at the center. You can look to these innovators to help us especially with things that require technological or scientific solution. That leaves the final category  social investing  which is really  anyway  the biggest of them all  represented here by Xigi.net. And this  of course  tackles the biggest assumption of all  that business is business  and philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world. Xigi is a new community site that's built by the community  linking and mapping this new social capital market. It lists already       entities that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise. So we can look to these innovators to help us remember that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital that seeks a return  the good that can be driven could be astonishing. Now  what's really interesting here is that we're not thinking our way into a new way of acting  we're acting our way into a new way of thinking. Philanthropy is reorganizing itself before our very eyes. And even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers don't yet fulfill this aspiration  I think this is the new zeitgeist  open  big  fast  connected  and  let us also hope  long. We have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things. If we don't develop the stamina to stick with things    whatever it is you pick  stick with it    all of this stuff is just going to be  you know  a fad. But I'm really hopeful. And I'm hopeful because it's not only philanthropy that's reorganizing itself  it's also whole other portions of the social sector  and of business  that are busy challenging  business as usual.  And everywhere I go  including here at TED  I feel that there is a new moral hunger that is growing. What we're seeing is people really wrestling to describe what is this new thing that's happening. Words like  philanthrocapitalism   and  natural capitalism   and  philanthroentrepreneur   and  venture philanthropy.  We don't have a language for it yet. Whatever we call it  it's new  it's beginning  and I think it's gong to quite significant. And that's where my imagined future comes in  which I am going to call the social singularity. Many of you will realize that I'm ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer Vernor Vinge's notion of a technological singularity  where a number of trends accelerate and converge and come together to create  really  a shockingly new reality. It may be that the social singularity ahead is the one that we fear the most  a convergence of catastrophes  of environmental degradation  of weapons of mass destruction  of pandemics  of poverty. That's because our ability to confront the problems that we face has not kept pace with our ability to create them. And as we've heard here  it is no exaggeration to say that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands as never before. The question is  is there a positive social singularity  Is there a frontier for us of how we live together  Our future doesn't have to be imagined. We can create a future where hope and history rhyme. But we have a problem. Our experience to date  both individually and collectively  hasn't prepared us for what we're going to need to do  or who we're going to need to be. We are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible. That's why I have one last thing I want to show you. This is a photograph taken about     years ago of my grandfather and great grandfather. This is a newspaper publisher and a banker. And they were great community leaders. And  yes  they were great philanthropists. I keep this photograph close by to me    it's in my office    because I've always felt a mystical connection to these two men  both of whom I never knew. And so  in their honor  I want to offer you this blank slide. And I want you to imagine that this a photograph of you. And I want you to think about the community that you want to be part of creating. Whatever that means to you. And I want you to imagine that it's     years from now  and your grandchild  or great grandchild  or niece or nephew or god child  is looking at this photograph of you. What is the story you most want for them to tell  Thank you very much. A month ago today I stood there     degrees south  the top of the bottom of the world  the Geographic South Pole. And I stood there beside two very good friends of mine  Richard Weber and Kevin Vallely. Together we had just broken the world speed record for a trek to the South Pole. It took us    days     hours and    minutes to get there. We shaved five days off the previous best time. And in the process  I became the first person in history to make the entire     mile journey  from Hercules Inlet to South Pole  solely on feet  without skis. Now  many of you are probably saying   Wait a sec  is this tough to do   Imagine  if you will  dragging a sled  as you just saw in that video clip  with     pounds of gear  in it everything you need to survive on your Antarctic trek. It's going to be    below  every single day. You'll be in a massive headwind. And at some point you're going to have to cross these cracks in the ice  these crevasses. Some of them have a very precarious thin footbridge underneath them that could give way at a moment's notice  taking your sled  you  into the abyss  never to be seen again. The punchline to your journey  Look at the horizon. Yes  it's uphill the entire way  because the South Pole is at        feet  and you're starting at sea level. Our journey did not  in fact  begin at Hercules Inlet  where frozen ocean meets the land of Antarctica. It began a little less than two years ago. A couple of buddies of mine and I had finished a     day run across the entire Sahara desert. And while we were there we learned the seriousness of the water crisis in Northern Africa. We also learned that many of the issues facing the people of Northern Africa affected young people the most. I came home to my wife after     days of running in the sand  and I said   You know  there's no doubt if this bozo can get across the desert  we are capable of doing anything we set our minds to.  But if I'm going to continue doing these adventures  there has to be a reason for me to do them beyond just getting there. Around that time I met an extraordinary human being  Peter Thum  who inspired me with his actions. He's trying to find and solve water issues  the crisis around the world. His dedication inspired me to come up with this expedition  a run to the South Pole where  with an interactive website  I will be able to bring young people  students and teachers from around the world on board the expedition with me  as active members. So we would have a live website  that every single day of the    days  we would be blogging  telling stories of  you know  depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces  or we will burn. Crossing miles and miles of sastrugi    frozen ice snowdrifts that could be hip deep. I'm telling you  crossing these things with     pound sled  that sled may as well have weighed       pounds  because that's what it felt like. We were blogging to this live website daily to these students that were tracking us as well  about    hour trekking days     hour trekking days  sometimes    hours of trekking daily to meet our goal. We'd catch cat naps at    below on our sled  incidentally. In turn  students  people from around the world  would ask us questions. Young people would ask the most amazing questions. One of my favorite  It's    below  you've got to go to the bathroom  where are you going to go and how are you going to do it  I'm not going to answer that. But I will answer some of the more popular questions. Where do you sleep  We slept in a tent that was very low to the ground  because the winds on Antarctica were so extreme  it would blow anything else away. What do you eat  One of my favorite dishes on expedition  butter and bacon. It's about a million calories. We were burning about       a day  so we needed it. How many batteries do you carry for all the equipment that you have  Virtually none. All of our equipment  including film equipment  was charged by the sun. And do you get along  I certainly hope so  because at some point or another on this expedition  one of your teammates is going to have to take a very big needle  and put it in an infected blister  and drain it for you. But seriously  seriously  we did get along  because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people. They were our teammates  They were inspiring us. The stories we were hearing got us to the South Pole. The website worked brilliantly as a two way street of communication. Young people in northern Canada  kids in an elementary school  dragging sleds across the school yard  pretending they were Richard  Ray and Kevin. Amazing. We arrived at the South Pole. We huddled into that tent     below that day  I'll never forget it. We looked at each other with these looks of disbelief at what we had just completed. And I remember looking at the guys thinking   What do I take from this journey   You know  Seriously. That I'm this uber endurance guy  As I stand here today talking to you guys  I've been running for the grand sum of five years. And a year before that I was a pack a day smoker  living a very sedentary lifestyle. What I take from this journey  from my journeys  is that  in fact  within every fiber of my belief standing here  I know that we can make the impossible possible. I'm learning this at   . Can you imagine  Seriously  can you imagine  I'm learning this at    years of age. Imagine being    years old  hearing those words  and believing it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Now  if President Obama invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics  then I would have a suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country. And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive. The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra. And everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject. And at top of that pyramid  it's calculus. And I'm here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ... that the correct summit    that all of our students  every high school graduate should know    should be statistics  probability and statistics. I mean  don't get me wrong. Calculus is an important subject. It's one of the great products of the human mind. The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus. And every student who studies math  science  engineering  economics  they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college. But I'm here to say  as a professor of mathematics  that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious  meaningful way  in their day to day lives. On the other hand  statistics    that's a subject that you could  and should  use on daily basis. Right  It's risk. It's reward. It's randomness. It's understanding data. I think if our students  if our high school students    if all of the American citizens    knew about probability and statistics  we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today.  Laughter   Applause  Not only    thank you    not only that ... but if it's taught properly  it can be a lot of fun. I mean  probability and statistics  it's the mathematics of games and gambling. It's analyzing trends. It's predicting the future. Look  the world has changed from analog to digital. And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital  from the more classical  continuous mathematics  to the more modern  discrete mathematics    the mathematics of uncertainty  of randomness  of data    that being probability and statistics. In summary  instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus  I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means. And I mean it. Thank you very much. This is the exact moment that I started creating something called Tinkering School. Tinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks and hammers and other dangerous objects  and be trusted. Trusted not to hurt themselves  and trusted not to hurt others. Tinkering School doesn't follow a set curriculum  and there are no tests. We're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing. When the kids arrive they're confronted with lots of stuff  wood and nails and rope and wheels  and lots of tools  real tools. It's a six day immersive experience for the kids. And within that context  we can offer the kids time    something that seems in short supply in their over scheduled lives. Our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived  and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around. Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever. And the kids soon learn that all projects go awry    and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success  or gleeful calamity. We start from doodles and sketches. And sometimes we make real plans. And sometimes we just start building. Building is at the heart of the experience  hands on  deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand. Robin and I  acting as collaborators  keep the landscape of the projects tilted towards completion. Success is in the doing  and failures are celebrated and analyzed. Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear. When faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities  a really interesting behavior emerges  decoration. Decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation. From these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before. All materials are available for use. Even those mundane  hateful  plastic grocery bags can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined. And the things that they build amaze even themselves.
