I'll make a TED Talk out of you.     I'll make a TED Talk out of you.     I'll make a TED Talk out of you.     Brought to you by TED staff and friends   If you look deep into the night sky  you see stars  and if you look further  you see more stars  and further  galaxies  and  further  more galaxies. But if you keep looking further and further  eventually you see nothing for a long while  and then finally you see a faint  fading afterglow  and it's the afterglow of the Big Bang. Now  the Big Bang was an era in the early universe when everything we see in the night sky was condensed into an incredibly small  incredibly hot  incredibly roiling mass  and from it sprung everything we see. Now  we've mapped that afterglow with great precision  and when I say we  I mean people who aren't me. We've mapped the afterglow with spectacular precision  and one of the shocks about it is that it's almost completely uniform. Fourteen billion light years that way and    billion light years that way  it's the same temperature. Now it's been    billion years since that Big Bang  and so it's got faint and cold. It's now  .  degrees. But it's not exactly  .  degrees. It's only  .  degrees to about    parts in a million. Over here  it's a little hotter  and over there  it's a little cooler  and that's incredibly important to everyone in this room  because where it was a little hotter  there was a little more stuff  and where there was a little more stuff  we have galaxies and clusters of galaxies and superclusters and all the structure you see in the cosmos. And those small  little  inhomogeneities     parts in a million  those were formed by quantum mechanical wiggles in that early universe that were stretched across the size of the entire cosmos. That is spectacular  and that's not what they found on Monday  what they found on Monday is cooler. So here's what they found on Monday  Imagine you take a bell  and you whack the bell with a hammer. What happens  It rings. But if you wait  that ringing fades and fades and fades until you don't notice it anymore. Now  that early universe was incredibly dense  like a metal  way denser  and if you hit it  it would ring  but the thing ringing would be the structure of space time itself  and the hammer would be quantum mechanics. What they found on Monday was evidence of the ringing of the space time of the early universe  what we call gravitational waves from the fundamental era  and here's how they found it. Those waves have long since faded. If you go for a walk  you don't wiggle. Those gravitational waves in the structure of space are totally invisible for all practical purposes. But early on  when the universe was making that last afterglow  the gravitational waves put little twists in the structure of the light that we see. So by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper    in fact  these guys spent three years on the South Pole looking straight up through the coldest  clearest  cleanest air they possibly could find looking deep into the night sky and studying that glow and looking for the faint twists which are the symbol  the signal  of gravitational waves  the ringing of the early universe. And on Monday  they announced that they had found it. And the thing that's so spectacular about that to me is not just the ringing  though that is awesome. The thing that's totally amazing  the reason I'm on this stage  is because what that tells us is something deep about the early universe. It tells us that we and everything we see around us are basically one large bubble    and this is the idea of inflation  one large bubble surrounded by something else. This isn't conclusive evidence for inflation  but anything that isn't inflation that explains this will look the same. This is a theory  an idea  that has been around for a while  and we never thought we we'd really see it. For good reasons  we thought we'd never see killer evidence  and this is killer evidence. But the really crazy idea is that our bubble is just one bubble in a much larger  roiling pot of universal stuff. We're never going to see the stuff outside  but by going to the South Pole and spending three years looking at the detailed structure of the night sky  we can figure out that we're probably in a universe that looks kind of like that. And that amazes me. Thanks a lot. Chris Anderson  So  this is an interview with a difference. On the basis that a picture is worth a thousand words  what I did was  I asked Bill and Melinda to dig out from their archive some images that would help explain some of what they've done  and do a few things that way. So  we're going to start here. Melinda  when and where was this  and who is that handsome man next to you  Melinda Gates  With those big glasses  huh  This is in Africa  our very first trip  the first time either of us had ever been to Africa  in the fall of     . We were already engaged to be married. We married a few months later  and this was the trip where we really went to see the animals and to see the savanna. It was incredible. Bill had never taken that much time off from work. But what really touched us  actually  were the people  and the extreme poverty. We started asking ourselves questions. Does it have to be like this  And at the end of the trip  we went out to Zanzibar  and took some time to walk on the beach  which is something we had done a lot while we were dating. And we'd already been talking about during that time that the wealth that had come from Microsoft would be given back to society  but it was really on that beach walk that we started to talk about  well  what might we do and how might we go about it  CA  So  given that this vacation led to the creation of the world's biggest private foundation  it's pretty expensive as vacations go.  Laughter  MG  I guess so. We enjoyed it. CA  Which of you was the key instigator here  or was it symmetrical  Bill Gates  Well  I think we were excited that there'd be a phase of our life where we'd get to work together and figure out how to give this money back. At this stage  we were talking about the poorest  and could you have a big impact on them  Were there things that weren't being done  There was a lot we didn't know. Our na vet  is pretty incredible  when we look back on it. But we had a certain enthusiasm that that would be the phase  the post Microsoft phase would be our philanthropy. MG  Which Bill always thought was going to come after he was     so he hasn't quite hit    yet  so some things change along the way. CA  So it started there  but it got accelerated. So that was '    and it was '    really  before the foundation itself started. MA  Yeah  in '    we read an article about diarrheal diseases killing so many kids around the world  and we kept saying to ourselves   Well that can't be. In the U.S.  you just go down to the drug store.  And so we started gathering scientists and started learning about population  learning about vaccines  learning about what had worked and what had failed  and that's really when we got going  was in late           . CA  So  you've got a big pot of money and a world full of so many different issues. How on Earth do you decide what to focus on  BG  Well  we decided that we'd pick two causes  whatever the biggest inequity was globally  and there we looked at children dying  children not having enough nutrition to ever develop  and countries that were really stuck  because with that level of death  and parents would have so many kids that they'd get huge population growth  and that the kids were so sick that they really couldn't be educated and lift themselves up. So that was our global thing  and then in the U.S.  both of us have had amazing educations  and we saw that as the way that the U.S. could live up to its promise of equal opportunity is by having a phenomenal education system  and the more we learned  the more we realized we're not really fulfilling that promise. And so we picked those two things  and everything the foundation does is focused there. CA  So  I asked each of you to pick an image that you like that illustrates your work  and Melinda  this is what you picked. What's this about  MG  So I  one of the things I love to do when I travel is to go out to the rural areas and talk to the women  whether it's Bangladesh  India  lots of countries in Africa  and I go in as a Western woman without a name. I don't tell them who I am. Pair of khakis. And I kept hearing from women  over and over and over  the more I traveled   I want to be able to use this shot.  I would be there to talk to them about childhood vaccines  and they would bring the conversation around to  But what about the shot I get   which is an injection they were getting called Depo Provera  which is a contraceptive. And I would come back and talk to global health experts  and they'd say   Oh no  contraceptives are stocked in in the developing world.  Well  you had to dig deeper into the reports  and this is what the team came to me with  which is  to have the number one thing that women tell you in Africa they want to use stocked out more than     days a year explains why women were saying to me   I walked    kilometers without my husband knowing it  and I got to the clinic  and there was nothing there.  And so condoms were stocked in in Africa because of all the AIDS work that the U.S. and others supported. But women will tell you over and over again   I can't negotiate a condom with my husband. I'm either suggesting he has AIDS or I have AIDS  and I need that tool because then I can space the births of my children  and I can feed them and have a chance of educating them.  CA  Melinda  you're Roman Catholic  and you've often been embroiled in controversy over this issue  and on the abortion question  on both sides  really. How do you navigate that  MG  Yeah  so I think that's a really important point  which is  we had backed away from contraceptives as a global community. We knew that     million women were saying they wanted access to contraceptives  even the contraceptives we have here in the United States  and we weren't providing them because of the political controversy in our country  and to me that was just a crime  and I kept looking around trying to find the person that would get this back on the global stage  and I finally realized I just had to do it. And even though I'm Catholic  I believe in contraceptives just like most of the Catholic women in the United States who report using contraceptives  and I shouldn't let that controversy be the thing that holds us back. We used to have consensus in the United States around contraceptives  and so we got back to that global consensus  and actually raised  .  billion dollars around exactly this issue for women. CA  Bill  this is your graph. What's this about  BG  Well  my graph has numbers on it. I really like this graph. This is the number of children who die before the age of five every year. And what you find is really a phenomenal success story which is not widely known  that we are making incredible progress. We go from    million not long after I was born to now we're down to about six million. So this is a story largely of vaccines. Smallpox was killing a couple million kids a year. That was eradicated  so that got down to zero. Measles was killing a couple million a year. That's down to a few hundred thousand. Anyway  this is a chart where you want to get that number to continue  and it's going to be possible  using the science of new vaccines  getting the vaccines out to kids. We can actually accelerate the progress. The last decade  that number has dropped faster than ever in history  and so I just love the fact that you can say  okay  if we can invent new vaccines  we can get them out there  use the very latest understanding of these things  and get the delivery right  that we can perform a miracle. CA  I mean  you do the math on this  and it works out  I think  literally to thousands of kids' lives saved every day compared to the prior year. It's not reported. An airliner with     plus deaths is a far  far bigger story than that. Does that drive you crazy  BG  Yeah  because it's a silent thing going on. It's a kid  one kid at a time. Ninety eight percent of this has nothing to do with natural disasters  and yet  people's charity  when they see a natural disaster  are wonderful. It's incredible how people think  okay  that could be me  and the money flows. These causes have been a bit invisible. Now that the Millennium Development Goals and various things are getting out there  we are seeing some increased generosity  so the goal is to get this well below a million  which should be possible in our lifetime. CA  Maybe it needed someone who is turned on by numbers and graphs rather than just the big  sad face to get engaged. I mean  you've used it in your letter this year  you used basically this argument to say that aid  contrary to the current meme that aid is kind of worthless and broken  that actually it has been effective. BG  Yeah  well people can take  there is some aid that was well meaning and didn't go well. There's some venture capital investments that were well meaning and didn't go well. You shouldn't just say  okay  because of that  because we don't have a perfect record  this is a bad endeavor. You should look at  what was your goal  How are you trying to uplift nutrition and survival and literacy so these countries can take care of themselves  and say wow  this is going well  and be smarter. We can spend aid smarter. It is not all a panacea. We can do better than venture capital  I think  including big hits like this. CA  Traditional wisdom is that it's pretty hard for married couples to work together. How have you guys managed it  MG  Yeah  I've had a lot of women say to me   I really don't think I could work with my husband. That just wouldn't work out.  You know  we enjoy it  and we don't    this foundation has been a coming to for both of us in its continuous learning journey  and we don't travel together as much for the foundation  actually  as we used to when Bill was working at Microsoft. We have more trips where we're traveling separately  but I always know when I come home  Bill's going to be interested in what I learned  whether it's about women or girls or something new about the vaccine delivery chain  or this person that is a great leader. He's going to listen and be really interested. And he knows when he comes home  even if it's to talk about the speech he did or the data or what he's learned  I'm really interested  and I think we have a really collaborative relationship. But we don't every minute together  that's for sure. CA  But now you are  and we're very happy that you are. Melinda  early on  you were basically largely running the show. Six years ago  I guess  Bill came on full time  so moved from Microsoft and became full time. That must have been hard  adjusting to that. No  MG  Yeah. I think actually  for the foundation employees  there was way more angst for them than there was for me about Bill coming. I was actually really excited. I mean  Bill made this decision even obviously before it got announced in       and it was really his decision  but again  it was a beach vacation where we were walking on the beach and he was starting to think of this idea. And for me  the excitement of Bill putting his brain and his heart against these huge global problems  these inequities  to me that was exciting. Yes  the foundation employees had angst about that. CA  That's cool. MG  But that went away within three months  once he was there. BG  Including some of the employees. MG  That's what I said  the employees  it went away for them three months after you were there. BG  No  I'm kidding. MG  Oh  you mean  the employees didn't go away. BG  A few of them did  but   CA  So what do you guys argue about  Sunday     o'clock  you're away from work  what comes up  What's the argument  BG  Because we built this thing together from the beginning  it's this great partnership. I had that with Paul Allen in the early days of Microsoft. I had it with Steve Ballmer as Microsoft got bigger  and now Melinda  and in even stronger  equal ways  is the partner  so we talk a lot about which things should we give more to  which groups are working well  She's got a lot of insight. She'll sit down with the employees a lot. We'll take the different trips she described. So there's a lot of collaboration. I can't think of anything where one of us had a super strong opinion about one thing or another  CA  How about you  Melinda   though  Can you   Laughter  You never know. MG  Well  here's the thing. We come at things from different angles  and I actually think that's really good. So Bill can look at the big data and say   I want to act based on these global statistics.  For me  I come at it from intuition. I meet with lots of people on the ground and Bill's taught me to take that and read up to the global data and see if they match  and I think what I've taught him is to take that data and meet with people on the ground to understand  can you actually deliver that vaccine  Can you get a woman to accept those polio drops in her child's mouth  Because the delivery piece is every bit as important as the science. So I think it's been more a coming to over time towards each other's point of view  and quite frankly  the work is better because of it. CA  So  in vaccines and polio and so forth  you've had some amazing successes. What about failure  though  Can you talk about a failure and maybe what you've learned from it  BG  Yeah. Fortunately  we can afford a few failures  because we've certainly had them. We do a lot of drug work or vaccine work that you know you're going to have different failures. Like  we put out  one that got a lot of publicity was asking for a better condom. Well  we got hundreds of ideas. Maybe a few of those will work out. We were very na ve  certainly I was  about a drug for a disease in India  visceral leishmaniasis  that I thought  once I got this drug  we can just go wipe out the disease. Well  turns out it took an injection every day for    days. It took three more years to get it than we expected  and then there was no way it was going to get out there. Fortunately  we found out that if you go kill the sand flies  you probably can have success there  but we spent five years  you could say wasted five years  and about    million  on a path that turned out to have very modest benefit when we got there. CA  You're spending  like  a billion dollars a year in education  I think  something like that. Is anything  the story of what's gone right there is quite a long and complex one. Are there any failures that you can talk about  MG  Well  I would say a huge lesson for us out of the early work is we thought that these small schools were the answer  and small schools definitely help. They bring down the dropout rate. They have less violence and crime in those schools. But the thing that we learned from that work  and what turned out to be the fundamental key  is a great teacher in front of the classroom. If you don't have an effective teacher in the front of the classroom  I don't care how big or small the building is  you're not going to change the trajectory of whether that student will be ready for college. CA  So Melinda  this is you and your eldest daughter  Jenn. And just taken about three weeks ago  I think  three or four weeks ago. Where was this  MG  So we went to Tanzania. Jenn's been to Tanzania. All our kids have been to Africa quite a bit  actually. And we did something very different  which is  we decided to go spend two nights and three days with a family. Anna and Sanare are the parents. They invited us to come and stay in their boma. Actually  the goats had been there  I think  living in that particular little hut on their little compound before we got there. And we stayed with their family  and we really  really learned what life is like in rural Tanzania. And the difference between just going and visiting for half a day or three quarters of a day versus staying overnight was profound  and so let me just give you one explanation of that. They had six children  and as I talked to Anna in the kitchen  we cooked for about five hours in the cooking hut that day  and as I talked to her  she had absolutely planned and spaced with her husband the births of their children. It was a very loving relationship. This was a Maasai warrior and his wife  but they had decided to get married  they clearly had respect and love in the relationship. Their children  their six children  the two in the middle were twins      a boy  and a girl named Grace. And when we'd go out to chop wood and do all the things that Grace and her mother would do  Grace was not a child  she was an adolescent  but she wasn't an adult. She was very  very shy. So she kept wanting to talk to me and Jenn. We kept trying to engage her  but she was shy. And at night  though  when all the lights went out in rural Tanzania  and there was no moon that night  the first night  and no stars  and Jenn came out of our hut with her REI little headlamp on  Grace went immediately  and got the translator  came straight up to my Jenn and said   When you go home  can I have your headlamp so I can study at night   CA  Oh  wow. MG  And her dad had told me how afraid he was that unlike the son  who had passed his secondary exams  because of her chores  she'd not done so well and wasn't in the government school yet. He said   I don't know how I'm going to pay for her education. I can't pay for private school  and she may end up on this farm like my wife.  So they know the difference that an education can make in a huge  profound way. CA  I mean  this is another pic of your other two kids  Rory and Phoebe  along with Paul Farmer. Bringing up three children when you're the world's richest family seems like a social experiment without much prior art. How have you managed it  What's been your approach  BG  Well  I'd say overall the kids get a great education  but you've got to make sure they have a sense of their own ability and what they're going to go and do  and our philosophy has been to be very clear with them    most of the money's going to the foundation    and help them find something they're excited about. We want to strike a balance where they have the freedom to do anything but not a lot of money showered on them so they could go out and do nothing. And so far  they're fairly diligent  excited to pick their own direction. CA  You've obviously guarded their  privacy carefully for obvious reasons. I'm curious why you've given me permission to show this picture now here at TED. MG  Well  it's interesting. As they get older  they so know that our family belief is about responsibility  that we are in an unbelievable situation just to live in the United States and have a great education  and we have a responsibility to give back to the world. And so as they get older and we are teaching them    they have been to so many countries around the world   they're saying  we do want people to know that we believe in what you're doing  Mom and Dad  and it is okay to show us more. So we have their permission to show this picture  and I think Paul Farmer is probably going to put it eventually in some of his work. But they really care deeply about the mission of the foundation  too. CA  You've easily got enough money despite your vast contributions to the foundation to make them all billionaires. Is that your plan for them  BG  Nope. No. They won't have anything like that. They need to have a sense that their own work is meaningful and important. We read an article long  actually  before we got married  where Warren Buffett talked about that  and we're quite convinced that it wasn't a favor either to society or to the kids. CA  Well  speaking of Warren Buffett  something really amazing happened in       when somehow your only real rival for richest person in America suddenly turned around and agreed to give    percent of his fortune to your foundation. How on Earth did that happen  I guess there's a long version and a short version of that. We've got time for the short version. BG  All right. Well  Warren was a close friend  and he was going to have his wife Suzie give it all away. Tragically  she passed away before he did  and he's big on delegation  and    Laughter    he said   CA  Tweet that. BG  If he's got somebody who is doing something well  and is willing to do it at no charge  maybe that's okay. But we were stunned. MG  Totally stunned. BG  We had never expected it  and it has been unbelievable. It's allowed us to increase our ambition in what the foundation can do quite dramatically. Half the resources we have come from Warren's mind blowing generosity. CA  And I think you've pledged that by the time you're done  more than  or    percent of your wealth  will be given to the foundation. BG  Yes. CA  And since this relationship  it's amazing  And recently  you and Warren have been going around trying to persuade other billionaires and successful people to pledge to give  what  more than half of their assets for philanthropy. How is that going  BG  Well  we've got about     people who have now taken this giving pledge. The thing that's great is that we get together yearly and talk about  okay  do you hire staff  what do you give to them  We're not trying to homogenize it. I mean  the beauty of philanthropy is this mind blowing diversity. People give to some things. We look and go   Wow.  But that's great. That's the role of philanthropy is to pick different approaches  including even in one space  like education. We need more experimentation. But it's been wonderful  meeting those people  sharing their journey to philanthropy  how they involve their kids  where they're doing it differently  and it's been way more successful than we expected. Now it looks like it'll just keep growing in size in the years ahead. MG  And having people see that other people are making change with philanthropy  I mean  these are people who have created their own businesses  put their own ingenuity behind incredible ideas. If they put their ideas and their brain behind philanthropy  they can change the world. And they start to see others doing it  and saying   Wow  I want to do that with my own money.  To me  that's the piece that's incredible. CA  It seems to me  it's actually really hard for some people to figure out even how to remotely spend that much money on something else. There are probably some billionaires in the room and certainly some successful people. I'm curious  can you make the pitch  What's the pitch  BG  Well  it's the most fulfilling thing we've ever done  and you can't take it with you  and if it's not good for your kids  let's get together and brainstorm about what we can be done. The world is a far better place because of the philanthropists of the past  and the U.S. tradition here  which is the strongest  is the envy of the world. And part of the reason I'm so optimistic is because I do think philanthropy is going to grow and take some of these things government's not just good at working on and discovering and shine some light in the right direction. CA  The world's got this terrible inequality  growing inequality problem that seems structural. It does seem to me that if more of your peers took the approach that you two have made  it would make a dent both in that problem and certainly in the perception of that problem. Is that a fair comment  BG  Oh yeah. If you take from the most wealthy and give to the least wealthy  it's good. It tries to balance out  and that's just. MG  But you change systems. In the U.S.  we're trying to change the education system so it's just for everybody and it works for all students. That  to me  really changes the inequality balance. BG  That's the most important. CA  Well  I really think that most people here and many millions around the world are just in awe of the trajectory your lives have taken and the spectacular degree to which you have shaped the future. Thank you so much for coming to TED and for sharing with us and for all you do. BG  Thank you. MG  Thank you. BG  Thank you. MG  Thank you very much. BG  All right  good job.  Applause  If you remember that first decade of the web  it was really a static place. You could go online  you could look at pages  and they were put up either by organizations who had teams to do it or by individuals who were really tech savvy for the time. And with the rise of social media and social networks in the early     s  the web was completely changed to a place where now the vast majority of content we interact with is put up by average users  either in YouTube videos or blog posts or product reviews or social media postings. And it's also become a much more interactive place  where people are interacting with others  they're commenting  they're sharing  they're not just reading. So Facebook is not the only place you can do this  but it's the biggest  and it serves to illustrate the numbers. Facebook has  .  billion users per month. So half the Earth's Internet population is using Facebook. They are a site  along with others  that has allowed people to create an online persona with very little technical skill  and people responded by putting huge amounts of personal data online. So the result is that we have behavioral  preference  demographic data for hundreds of millions of people  which is unprecedented in history. And as a computer scientist   what this means is that I've been able to build models that can predict all sorts of hidden attributes for all of you that you don't even know you're sharing information about. As scientists  we use that to help the way people interact online  but there's less altruistic applications  and there's a problem in that users don't really understand these techniques and how they work  and even if they did  they don't have a lot of control over it. So what I want to talk to you about today is some of these things that we're able to do  and then give us some ideas of how we might go forward to move some control back into the hands of users. So this is Target  the company. I didn't just put that logo on this poor  pregnant woman's belly. You may have seen this anecdote that was printed in Forbes magazine where Target sent a flyer to this    year old girl with advertisements and coupons for baby bottles and diapers and cribs two weeks before she told her parents that she was pregnant. Yeah  the dad was really upset. He said   How did Target figure out that this high school girl was pregnant before she told her parents   It turns out that they have the purchase history for hundreds of thousands of customers and they compute what they  call a pregnancy score  which is not just whether or  not a woman's pregnant  but what her due date is. And they compute that not by looking at the obvious things  like  she's buying a crib or baby clothes  but things like  she bought more vitamins than she normally had  or she bought a handbag that's big enough to hold diapers. And by themselves  those purchases don't seem like they might reveal a lot  but it's a pattern of behavior that  when you take it in the context  of thousands of other people  starts to actually reveal some insights. So that's the kind of thing that we do when we're predicting stuff about you on social media. We're looking for little patterns of behavior that  when you detect them among millions of people  lets us find out all kinds of things. So in my lab and with colleagues  we've developed mechanisms where we can quite accurately predict things like your political preference  your personality score  gender  sexual orientation  religion  age  intelligence  along with things like how much you trust the people you know and how strong those relationships are. We can do all of this really well. And again  it doesn't come from what you might think of as obvious information. So my favorite example is from this study that was published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academies. If you Google this  you'll find it. It's four pages  easy to read. And they looked at just people's Facebook likes  so just the things you like on Facebook  and used that to predict all these attributes  along with some other ones. And in their paper they listed the five likes that were most indicative of high intelligence. And among those was liking a page for curly fries.  Laughter  Curly fries are delicious  but liking them does not necessarily mean that you're smarter than the average person. So how is it that one of the strongest indicators of your intelligence is liking this page when the content is totally irrelevant to the attribute that's being predicted  And it turns out that we have to look at a whole bunch of underlying theories to see why we're able to do this. One of them is a sociological theory called homophily  which basically says people are friends with people like them. So if you're smart  you tend to be friends with smart people  and if you're young  you tend to be friends with young people  and this is well established for hundreds of years. We also know a lot about how information spreads through networks. It turns out things like viral videos or Facebook likes or other information spreads in exactly the same way that diseases spread through social networks. So this is something we've studied for a long time. We have good models of it. And so you can put those things together and start seeing why things like this happen. So if I were to give you a hypothesis  it would be that a smart guy started this page  or maybe one of the first people who liked it would have scored high on that test. And they liked it  and their friends saw it  and by homophily  we know that he probably had smart friends  and so it spread to them   and some of them liked it  and they had smart friends  and so it spread to them  and so it propagated through the network to a host of smart people  so that by the end  the action of liking the curly fries page is indicative of high intelligence  not because of the content  but because the actual action of liking reflects back the common attributes of other people who have done it. So this is pretty complicated stuff  right  It's a hard thing to sit down and explain to an average user  and even if you do  what can the average user do about it  How do you know that  you've liked something that indicates a trait for you that's totally irrelevant to the content of what you've liked  There's a lot of power that users don't have to control how this data is used. And I see that as a real  problem going forward. So I think there's a couple paths that we want to look at if we want to give users some control over how this data is used  because it's not always going to be used for their benefit. An example I often give is that  if I ever get bored being a professor  I'm going to go start a company that predicts all of these attributes and things like how well you work in teams and if you're a drug user  if you're an alcoholic. We know how to predict all that. And I'm going to sell reports to H.R. companies and big businesses that want to hire you. We totally can do that now. I could start that business tomorrow  and you would have absolutely no control over me using your data like that. That seems to me to be a problem. So one of the paths we can go down is the policy and law path. And in some respects  I think that that would be most effective  but the problem is we'd actually have to do it. Observing our political process in action makes me think it's highly unlikely that we're going to get a bunch of representatives to sit down  learn about this  and then enact sweeping changes to intellectual property law in the U.S. so users control their data. We could go the policy route  where social media companies say  you know what  You own your data. You have total control over how it's used. The problem is that the revenue models for most social media companies rely on sharing or exploiting  users' data in some way. It's sometimes said of Facebook that the users aren't the customer  they're the product. And so how do you get a company to cede control of their main asset back to the users  It's possible  but I don't think it's something that we're going to see change quickly. So I think the other path that we can go down that's going to be more effective is one of more science. It's doing science that allowed us to develop all these mechanisms for computing this personal data in the first place. And it's actually very similar research that we'd have to do if we want to develop mechanisms that can say to a user   Here's the risk of that action you just took.  By liking that Facebook page  or by sharing this piece of personal information  you've now improved my ability to predict whether or not you're using drugs or whether or not you get along well in the workplace. And that  I think  can affect whether or not people want to share something  keep it private  or just keep it offline altogether. We can also look at things like allowing people to encrypt data that they upload  so it's kind of invisible and worthless to sites like Facebook or third party services that access it  but that select users who the person who posted it want to see it have access to see it. This is all super exciting research from an intellectual perspective  and so scientists are going to be willing to do it. So that gives us an advantage over the law side. One of the problems that people bring up when I talk about this is  they say  you know  if people start keeping all this data private  all those methods that you've been developing to predict their traits are going to fail. And I say  absolutely  and for me  that's success  because as a scientist  my goal is not to infer information about users  it's to improve the way people interact online. And sometimes that involves inferring things about them  but if users don't want me to use that data  I think they should have the right to do that. I want users to be informed and consenting users of the tools that we develop. And so I think encouraging this kind of science and supporting researchers who want to cede some of that control back to users and away from the social media companies means that going forward  as these tools evolve and advance  means that we're going to have an educated and empowered user base  and I think all of us can agree that that's a pretty ideal way to go forward. Thank you. So a chip  a poet and a boy. It's just about    years ago  June       when Intel announced that there was a flaw at the core of their Pentium chip. Deep in the code of the SRT algorithm to calculate intermediate quotients necessary for iterative floating points of divisions    I don't know what that means  but  it's what it says on Wikipedia   there was a flaw and an error that meant that there was a certain probability that the result of the calculation would be an error  and the probability was one out of every     billion calculations. So Intel said your average spreadsheet would be flawed once every        years. They didn't think it was significant  but there was an outrage in the community. The community  the techies  said  this flaw has to be addressed. They were not going to stand by quietly as Intel gave them these chips. So there was a revolution across the world. People marched to demand    okay  not really exactly like that   but they rose up and they demanded that Intel fix the flaw. And Intel set aside     million dollars to fund the replacement of millions of chips to fix the flaw. So billions of dollars in our society was spent to address a problem which would come once out of every     billion calculations. Number two  a poet. This is Martin Niem ller. You're familiar with his poetry. Around the height of the Nazi period  he started repeating the verse   First they came for the communists  and I did nothing  did not speak out because I was not a communist. Then they came for the socialists. Then they came for the trade unions. Then they came for the Jews. And then they came for me. But there was no one left to speak for me.  Now  Niem ller is offering a certain kind of insight. This is an insight at the core of intelligence. We could call it cluefulness. It's a certain kind of test  Can you recognize an underlying threat and respond  Can you save yourself or save your kind  Turns out ants are pretty good at this. Cows  not so much. So can you see the pattern  Can you see a pattern and then recognize and do something about it  Number two. Number three  a boy. This is my friend Aaron Swartz. He's Tim's friend. He's friends of many of you in this audience  and seven years ago  Aaron came to me with a question. It was just before I was going to give my first TED Talk. I was so proud. I was telling him about my talk   Laws that choke creativity.  And Aaron looked at me and was a little impatient  and he said   So how are you ever going to solve the problems you're talking about  Copyright policy  Internet policy  how are you ever going to address those problems so long as there's this fundamental corruption in the way our government works   So I was a little put off by this. He wasn't sharing in my celebration. And I said to him   You know  Aaron  it's not my field  not my field.  He said   You mean as an academic  it's not your field   I said   Yeah  as an academic  it's not my field.  He said   What about as a citizen  As a citizen.  Now  this is the way Aaron was. He didn't tell. He asked questions. But his questions spoke as clearly as my four year old's hug. He was saying to me   You've got to get a clue. You have got to get a clue  because there is a flaw at the core of the operating system of this democracy  and it's not a flaw every one out of     billion times our democracy tries to make a decision. It is every time  every single important issue. We've got to end the bovinity of this political society. We've got to adopt  it turns out  the word is fourmi formatic attitude    that's what the Internet tells me the word is    the ant's appreciative attitude that gets us to recognize this flaw  save our kind and save our demos. Now if you know Aaron Swartz  you know that we lost him just over a year ago. It was about six weeks before I gave my TED Talk  and I was so grateful to Chris that he asked me to give this TED Talk  not because I had the chance to talk to you  although that was great  but because it pulled me out of an extraordinary depression. I couldn't begin to describe the sadness. Because I had to focus. I had to focus on  what was I going to say to you  It saved me. But after the buzz  the excitement  the power that comes from this community  I began to yearn for a less sterile  less academic way to address these issues  the issues that I was talking about. We'd begun to focus on New Hampshire as a target for this political movement  because the primary in New Hampshire is so incredibly important. It was a group called the New Hampshire Rebellion that was beginning to talk about  how would we make this issue of this corruption central in       But it was another soul that caught my imagination  a woman named Doris Haddock  aka Granny D. On January             years ago  at the age of     Granny D started a walk. She started in Los Angeles and began to walk to Washington  D.C. with a single sign on her chest that said   campaign finance reform.  Eighteen months later  at the age of     she arrived in Washington with hundreds following her  including many congressmen who had gotten in a car and driven out about a mile outside of the city to walk in with her. Now  I don't have    months to walk across the country. I've got three kids who hate to walk  and a wife who  it turns out  still hates when I'm not there for mysterious reasons  so this was not an option  but the question I asked  could we remix Granny D a bit  What about a walk not of       miles but of     miles across New Hampshire in January  So on January     the anniversary of Aaron's death  we began a walk that ended on January   th  the day that Granny D was born. A total of     people joined us across this walk  as we went from the very top to the very bottom of New Hampshire talking about this issue. And what was astonishing to me  something I completely did not expect to find  was the passion and anger that there was among everyone that we talked to about this issue. We had found in a poll that    percent of Americans believe it important to reduce the influence of money in politics. Now politicians and pundits tell you  there's nothing we can do about this issue  Americans don't care about it  but the reason for that is that    percent of Americans think there's nothing that can be done about this issue. And it's this gap between    and    that explains our politics of resignation. I mean  after all  at least    percent of us wish we could fly like Superman  but because at least    percent of us believe we can't  we don't leap off of tall buildings every time we have that urge. That's because we accept our limits  and so too with this reform. But when you give people the sense of hope  you begin to thaw that absolute sense of impossibility. As Harvey Milk said  if you give 'em hope  you give 'em a chance  a way to think about how this change is possible. Hope. And hope is the one thing that we  Aaron's friends  failed him with  because we let him lose that sense of hope. I loved that boy like I love my son. But we failed him. And I love my country  and I'm not going to fail that. I'm not going to fail that. That sense of hope  we're going to hold  and we're going to fight for  however impossible this battle looks. What's next  Well  we started with this march with     people  and next year  there will be       on different routes that march in the month of January and meet in Concord to celebrate this cause  and then in       before the primary  there will be        who march across that state  meeting in Concord to celebrate this cause. And as we have marched  people around the country have begun to say   Can we do the same thing in our state   So we've started a platform called G.D. Walkers  that is  Granny D walkers  and Granny D walkers across the country will be marching for this reform. Number one. Number two  on this march  one of the founders of Thunderclap  David Cascino  was with us  and he said   Well what can we do   And so they developed a platform  which we are announcing today  that allows us to pull together voters who are committed to this idea of reform. Regardless of where you are  in New Hampshire or outside of New Hampshire  you can sign up and directly be informed where the candidates are on this issue so you can decide who to vote for as a function of which is going to make this possibility real. And then finally number three  the hardest. We're in the age of the Super PAC. Indeed yesterday  Merriam announced that Merriam Webster will have Super PAC as a word. It is now an official word in the dictionary. So on May    aka May Day  we're going to try an experiment. We're going to try a launching of what we can think of as a Super PAC to end all Super PACs. And the basic way this works is this. For the last year  we have been working with analysts and political experts to calculate  how much would it cost to win enough votes in the United States Congress to make fundamental reform possible  What is that number  Half a billion  A billion  What is that number  And then whatever that number is  we are going to kickstart  sort of  because you can't use KickStarter for political work  but anyway  kickstart  sort of  first a bottom up campaign where people will make small dollar commitments contingent on reaching very ambitious goals  and when those goals have been reached  we will turn to the large dollar contributors  to get them to contribute to make it possible for us to run the kind of Super PAC necessary to win this issue  to change the way money influences politics  so that on November    which I discovered yesterday is the day that Aaron would have been    years old  on November    we will celebrate     representatives in the House and    Senators in the United States Senate who have committed to this idea of fundamental reform. So last night  we heard about wishes. Here's my wish. May one. May the ideals of one boy unite one nation behind one critical idea that we are one people  we are the people who were promised a government  a government that was promised to be dependent upon the people alone  the people  who  as Madison told us  meant not the rich more than the poor. May one. And then may you  may you join this movement  not because you're a politician  not because you're an expert  not because this is your field  but because if you are  you are a citizen. Aaron asked me that. Now I've asked you. Thank you very much. When people think about cities  they tend to think of certain things. They think of buildings and streets and skyscrapers  noisy cabs. But when I think about cities  I think about people. Cities are fundamentally about people  and where people go and where people meet are at the core of what makes a city work. So even more important than buildings in a city are the public spaces in between them. And today  some of the most transformative changes in cities are happening in these public spaces. So I believe that lively  enjoyable public spaces are the key to planning a great city. They are what makes it come alive. But what makes a public space work  What attracts people to successful public spaces  and what is it about unsuccessful places that keeps people away  I thought  if I could answer those questions  I could make a huge contribution to my city. But one of the more wonky things about me is that I am an animal behaviorist  and I use those skills not to study animal behavior but to study how people in cities use city public spaces. One of the first spaces that I studied was this little vest pocket park called Paley Park in midtown Manhattan. This little space became a small phenomenon  and because it had such a profound impact on New Yorkers  it made an enormous impression on me. I studied this park very early on in my career because it happened to have been built by my stepfather  so I knew that places like Paley Park didn't happen by accident. I saw firsthand that they required incredible dedication and enormous attention to detail. But what was it about this space that made it special and drew people to it  Well  I would sit in the park and watch very carefully  and first among other things were the comfortable  movable chairs. People would come in  find their own seat  move it a bit  actually  and then stay a while  and then interestingly  people themselves attracted other people  and ironically  I felt more peaceful if there were other people around. And it was green. This little park provided what New Yorkers crave  comfort and greenery. But my question was  why weren't there more places with greenery and places to sit in the middle of the city where you didn't feel alone  or like a trespasser  Unfortunately  that's not how cities were being designed. So here you see a familiar sight. This is how plazas have been designed for generations. They have that stylish  Spartan look that we often associate with modern architecture  but it's not surprising that people avoid spaces like this. They not only look desolate  they feel downright dangerous. I mean  where would you sit here  What would you do here  But architects love them. They are plinths for their creations. They might tolerate a sculpture or two  but that's about it. And for developers  they are ideal. There's nothing to water  nothing to maintain  and no undesirable people to worry about. But don't you think this is a waste  For me  becoming a city planner meant being able to truly change the city that I lived in and loved. I wanted to be able to create places that would give you the feeling that you got in Paley Park  and not allow developers to build bleak plazas like this. But over the many years  I have learned how hard it is to create successful  meaningful  enjoyable public spaces. As I learned from my stepfather  they certainly do not happen by accident  especially in a city like New York  where public space has to be fought for to begin with  and then for them to be successful  somebody has to think very hard about every detail. Now  open spaces in cities are opportunities. Yes  they are opportunities for commercial investment  but they are also opportunities for the common good of the city  and those two goals are often not aligned with one another  and therein lies the conflict. The first opportunity I had to fight for a great public open space was in the early     s  when I was leading a team of planners at a gigantic landfill called Battery Park City in lower Manhattan on the Hudson River. And this sandy wasteland had lain barren for    years  and we were told  unless we found a developer in six months  it would go bankrupt. So we came up with a radical  almost insane idea. Instead of building a park as a complement to future development  why don't we reverse that equation and build a small but very high quality public open space first  and see if that made a difference. So we only could afford to build a two block section of what would become a mile long esplanade  so whatever we built had to be perfect. So just to make sure  I insisted that we build a mock up in wood  at scale  of the railing and the sea wall. And when I sat down on that test bench with sand still swirling all around me  the railing hit exactly at eye level  blocking my view and ruining my experience at the water's edge. So you see  details really do make a difference. But design is not just how something looks  it's how your body feels on that seat in that space  and I believe that successful design always depends on that very individual experience. In this photo  everything looks very finished  but that granite edge  those lights  the back on that bench  the trees in planting  and the many different kinds of places to sit were all little battles that turned this project into a place that people wanted to be. Now  this proved very valuable    years later when Michael Bloomberg asked me to be his planning commissioner and put me in charge of shaping the entire city of New York. And he said to me on that very day  he said that New York was projected to grow from eight to nine million people. And he asked me   So where are you going to put one million additional New Yorkers   Well  I didn't have any idea. Now  you know that New York does place a high value on attracting immigrants  so we were excited about the prospect of growth  but honestly  where were we going to grow in a city that was already built out to its edges and surrounded by water  How were we going to find housing for that many new New Yorkers  And if we couldn't spread out  which was probably a good thing  where could new housing go  And what about cars  Our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars. So what were we going to do  If we couldn't spread out  we had to go up. And if we had to go up  we had to go up in places where you wouldn't need to own a car. So that meant using one of our greatest assets  our transit system. But we had never before thought of how we could make the most of it. So here was the answer to our puzzle. If we were to channel and redirect all new development around transit  we could actually handle that population increase  we thought. And so here was the plan  what we really needed to do  We needed to redo our zoning    and zoning is the city planner's regulatory tool    and basically reshape the entire city  targeting where new development could go and prohibiting any development at all in our car oriented  suburban style neighborhoods. Well  this was an unbelievably ambitious idea  ambitious because communities had to approve those plans. So how was I going to get this done  By listening. So I began listening  in fact  thousands of hours of listening just to establish trust. You know  communities can tell whether or not you understand their neighborhoods. It's not something you can just fake. And so I began walking. I can't tell you how many blocks I walked  in sweltering summers  in freezing winters  year after year  just so I could get to understand the DNA of each neighborhood and know what each street felt like. I became an incredibly geeky zoning expert  finding ways that zoning could address communities' concerns. So little by little  neighborhood by neighborhood  block by block  we began to set height limits so that all new development would be predictable and near transit. Over the course of    years  we were able to rezone     neighborhoods     percent of the city         blocks  so that now     percent of all new development of New York is within a    minute walk of a subway. In other words  nobody in those new buildings needs to own a car. Well  those rezonings were exhausting and enervating and important  but rezoning was never my mission. You can't see zoning and you can't feel zoning. My mission was always to create great public spaces. So in the areas where we zoned for significant development  I was determined to create places that would make a difference in people's lives. Here you see what was two miles of abandoned  degraded waterfront in the neighborhoods of Greenpoint and Williamsburg in Brooklyn  impossible to get to and impossible to use. Now the zoning here was massive  so I felt an obligation to create magnificent parks on these waterfronts  and I spent an incredible amount of time on every square inch of these plans. I wanted to make sure that there were tree lined paths from the upland to the water  that there were trees and plantings everywhere  and  of course  lots and lots of places to sit. Honestly  I had no idea how it would turn out. I had to have faith. But I put everything that I had studied and learned into those plans. And then it opened  and I have to tell you  it was incredible. People came from all over the city to be in these parks. I know they changed the lives of the people who live there  but they also changed New Yorkers' whole image of their city. I often come down and watch people get on this little ferry that now runs between the boroughs  and I can't tell you why  but I'm completely moved by the fact that people are using it as if it had always been there. And here is a new park in lower Manhattan. Now  the water's edge in lower Manhattan was a complete mess before     . Wall Street was essentially landlocked because you couldn't get anywhere near this edge. And after       the city had very little control. But I thought if we went to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and got money to reclaim this two miles of degraded waterfront that it would have an enormous effect on the rebuilding of lower Manhattan. And it did. Lower Manhattan finally has a public waterfront on all three sides. I really love this park. You know  railings have to be higher now  so we put bar seating at the edge  and you can get so close to the water you're practically on it. And see how the railing widens and flattens out so you can lay down your lunch or your laptop. And I love when people come there and look up and they say   Wow  there's Brooklyn  and it's so close.  So what's the trick  How do you turn a park into a place that people want to be  Well  it's up to you  not as a city planner but as a human being. You don't tap into your design expertise. You tap into your humanity. I mean  would you want to go there  Would you want to stay there  Can you see into it and out of it  Are there other people there  Does it seem green and friendly  Can you find your very own seat  Well now  all over New York City  there are places where you can find your very own seat. Where there used to be parking spaces  there are now pop up cafes. Where Broadway traffic used to run  there are now tables and chairs. Where    years ago  sidewalk cafes were not allowed  they are now everywhere. But claiming these spaces for public use was not simple  and it's even harder to keep them that way. So now I'm going to tell you a story about a very unusual park called the High Line. The High Line was an elevated railway. The High Line was an elevated railway that ran through three neighborhoods on Manhattan's West Side  and when the train stopped running  it became a self seeded landscape  a kind of a garden in the sky. And when I saw it the first time  honestly  when I went up on that old viaduct  I fell in love the way you fall in love with a person  honestly. And when I was appointed  saving the first two sections of the High Line from demolition became my first priority and my most important project. I knew if there was a day that I didn't worry about the High Line  it would come down. And the High Line  even though it is widely known now and phenomenally popular  it is the most contested public space in the city. You might see a beautiful park  but not everyone does. You know  it's true  commercial interests will always battle against public space. You might say   How wonderful it is that more than four million people come from all over the world to visit the High Line.  Well  a developer sees just one thing  customers. Hey  why not take out those plantings and have shops all along the High Line  Wouldn't that be terrific and won't it mean a lot more money for the city  Well no  it would not be terrific. It would be a mall  and not a park. And you know what  it might mean more money for the city  but a city has to take the long view  the view for the common good. Most recently  the last section of the High Line  the third section of the High Line  the final section of the High Line  has been pitted against development interests  where some of the city's leading developers are building more than    million square feet at the Hudson Yards. And they came to me and proposed that they  temporarily disassemble  that third and final section. Perhaps the High Line didn't fit in with their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers on a hill. Perhaps it was just in their way. But in any case  it took nine months of nonstop daily negotiation to finally get the signed agreement to prohibit its demolition  and that was only two years ago. So you see  no matter how popular and successful a public space may be  it can never be taken for granted. Public spaces always    this is it saved    public spaces always need vigilant champions  not only to claim them at the outset for public use  but to design them for the people that use them  then to maintain them to ensure that they are for everyone  that they are not violated  invaded  abandoned or ignored. If there is any one lesson that I have learned in my life as a city planner  it is that public spaces have power. It's not just the number of people using them  it's the even greater number of people who feel better about their city just knowing that they are there. Public space can change how you live in a city  how you feel about a city  whether you choose one city over another  and public space is one of the most important reasons why you stay in a city. I believe that a successful city is like a fabulous party. People stay because they are having a great time. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Right now there is an aspiring teacher who is working on a    page paper based on some age old education theory developed by some dead education professor wondering to herself what this task that she's engaging in has to do with what she wants to do with her life  which is be an educator  change lives  and spark magic. Right now there is an aspiring teacher in a graduate school of education who is watching a professor babble on and on about engagement in the most disengaging way possible. Right now there's a first year teacher at home who is pouring through lesson plans trying to make sense of standards  who is trying to make sense of how to grade students appropriately  while at the same time saying to herself over and over again   Don't smile till November   because that's what she was taught in her teacher education program. Right now there's a student who is coming up with a way to convince his mom or dad that he's very  very sick and can't make it to school tomorrow. On the other hand  right now there are amazing educators that are sharing information  information that is shared in such a beautiful way that the students are sitting at the edge of their seats just waiting for a bead of sweat to drop off the face of this person so they can soak up all that knowledge. Right now there is also a person who has an entire audience rapt with attention  a person that is weaving a powerful narrative about a world that the people who are listening have never imagined or seen before  but if they close their eyes tightly enough  they can envision that world because the storytelling is so compelling. Right now there's a person who can tell an audience to put their hands up in the air and they will stay there till he says   Put them down.  Right now. So people will then say   Well  Chris  you describe the guy who is going through some awful training but you're also describing these powerful educators. If you're thinking about the world of education or urban education in particular  these guys will probably cancel each other out  and then we'll be okay.  The reality is  the folks I described as the master teachers  the master narrative builders  the master storytellers are far removed from classrooms. The folks who know the skills about how to teach and engage an audience don't even know what teacher certification means. They may not even have the degrees to be able to have anything to call an education. And that to me is sad. It's sad because the people who I described  they were very disinterested in the learning process  want to be effective teachers  but they have no models. I'm going to paraphrase Mark Twain. Mark Twain says that proper preparation  or teaching  is so powerful that it can turn bad morals to good  it can turn awful practices into powerful ones  it can change men and transform them into angels. The folks who I described earlier got proper preparation in teaching  not in any college or university  but by virtue of just being in the same spaces of those who engage. Guess where those places are  Barber shops  rap concerts  and most importantly  in the black church. And I've been framing this idea called Pentecostal pedagogy. Who here has been to a black church  We got a couple of hands. You go to a black church  their preacher starts off and he realizes that he has to engage the audience  so he starts off with this sort of wordplay in the beginning oftentimes  and then he takes a pause  and he says   Oh my gosh  they're not quite paying attention.  So he says   Can I get an amen   Audience  Amen. Chris Emdin  So I can I get an amen  Audience  Amen. CE  And all of a sudden  everybody's reawoken. That preacher bangs on the pulpit for attention. He drops his voice at a very  very low volume when he wants people to key into him  and those things are the skills that we need for the most engaging teachers. So why does teacher education only give you theory and theory and tell you about standards and tell you about all of these things that have nothing to do with the basic skills  that magic that you need to engage an audience  to engage a student  So I make the argument that we reframe teacher education  that we could focus on content  and that's fine  and we could focus on theories  and that's fine  but content and theories with the absence of the magic of teaching and learning means nothing. Now people oftentimes say   Well  magic is just magic.  There are teachers who  despite all their challenges  who have those skills  get into those schools and are  able to engage an audience  and the administrator walks by and says   Wow  he's so good  I wish all my teachers could be that good.  And when they try to describe what that is  they just say   He has that magic.  But I'm here to tell you that magic can be taught. Magic can be taught. Magic can be taught. Now  how do you teach it  You teach it by allowing people to go into those spaces where the magic is happening. If you want to be an aspiring teacher in urban education  you've got to leave the confines of that university and go into the hood. You've got to go in there and hang out at the barbershop  you've got to attend that black church  and you've got to view those folks that have the power to engage and just take notes on what they do. At our teacher education classes at my university  I've started a project where every single student that comes in there sits and watches rap concerts. They watch the way that the rappers move and talk with their hands. They study the way that he walks proudly across that stage. They listen to his metaphors and analogies  and they start learning these little things that if they practice enough becomes the key to magic. They learn that if you just stare at a student and raise your eyebrow about a quarter of an inch  you don't have to say a word because they know that that means that you want more. And if we could transform teacher education to focus on teaching teachers how to create that magic then poof  we could make dead classes come alive  we could reignite imaginations  and we can change education. Thank you. What is the intersection between technology  art and science  Curiosity and wonder  because it drives us to explore  because we're surrounded by things we can't see. And I love to use film to take us on a journey through portals of time and space  to make the invisible visible  because what that does  it expands our horizons  it transforms our perception  it opens our minds and it touches our heart. So here are some scenes from my  D IMAX film   Mysteries of the Unseen World.  There is movement which is too slow for our eyes to detect  and time lapse makes us discover and broaden our perspective of life. We can see how organisms emerge and grow  how a vine survives by creeping from the forest floor to look at the sunlight. And at the grand scale  time lapse allows us to see our planet in motion. We can view not only the vast sweep of nature  but the restless movement of humanity. Each streaking dot represents a passenger plane  and by turning air traffic data into time lapse imagery  we can see something that's above us constantly but invisible  the vast network of air travel over the United States. We can do the same thing with ships at sea. We can turn data into a time lapse view of a global economy in motion. And decades of data give us the view of our entire planet as a single organism sustained by currents circulating throughout the oceans and by clouds swirling through the atmosphere  pulsing with lightning  crowned by the aurora Borealis. It may be the ultimate time lapse image  the anatomy of Earth brought to life. At the other extreme  there are things that move too fast for our eyes  but we have technology that can look into that world as well. With high speed cameras  we can do the opposite of time lapse. We can shoot images that are thousands of times faster than our vision. And we can see how nature's ingenious devices work  and perhaps we can even imitate them. When a dragonfly flutters by  you may not realize  but it's the greatest flier in nature. It can hover  fly backwards  even upside down. And by tracking markers on an insect's wings  we can visualize the air flow that they produce. Nobody knew the secret  but high speed shows that a dragonfly can move all four wings in different directions at the same time. And what we learn can lead us to new kinds of robotic flyers that can expand our vision of important and remote places. We're giants  and we're unaware of things that are too small for us to see. The electron microscope fires electrons which creates images which can magnify things by as much as a million times. This is the egg of a butterfly. And there are unseen creatures living all over your body  including mites that spend their entire lives dwelling on your eyelashes  crawling over your skin at night. Can you guess what this is  Shark skin. A caterpillar's mouth. The eye of a fruit fly. An eggshell. A flea. A snail's tongue. We think we know most of the animal kingdom  but there may be millions of tiny species waiting to be discovered. A spider also has great secrets  because spiders' silk thread is pound for pound stronger than steel but completely elastic. This journey will take us all the way down to the nano world. The silk is     times thinner than human hair. On there is bacteria  and near that bacteria     times smaller  a virus. Inside of that     times smaller  three strands of DNA. And nearing the limit of our most powerful microscopes  single carbon atoms. With the tip of a powerful microscope  we can actually move atoms and begin to create amazing nano devices. Some could one day patrol our body for all kinds of diseases and clean out clogged arteries along the way. Tiny chemical machines of the future can one day  perhaps  repair DNA. We are on the threshold of extraordinary advances  born of our drive to unveil the mysteries of life. So under an endless rain of cosmic dust  the air is full of pollen  micro diamonds and jewels from other planets and supernova explosions. People go about their lives surrounded by the unseeable. Knowing that there's so much around us we can't see forever changes our understanding of the world  and by looking at unseen worlds  we recognize that we exist in the living universe  and this new perspective creates wonder and inspires us to become explorers in our own backyards. Who knows what awaits to be seen and what new wonders will transform our lives. We'll just have to see. Thank you. I was born and raised in Sierra Leone  a small and very beautiful country in West Africa  a country rich both in physical resources and creative talent. However  Sierra Leone is infamous for a decade long rebel war in the '  s when entire villages were burnt down. An estimated       men  women and children had their arms and legs amputated during this time. As my family and I ran for safety when I was about    from one of those attacks  I resolved that I would do everything I could to ensure that my own children would not go through the  same experiences we had. They would  in fact  be part of a Sierra Leone where war and amputation were no longer a strategy for gaining power. As I watched people who I knew  loved ones  recover from this devastation  one thing that deeply troubled me was that many of the amputees in the country would not use their prostheses. The reason  I would come to find out  was that their prosthetic sockets were painful because they did not fit well. The prosthetic socket is the part in which the amputee inserts their residual limb  and which connects to the prosthetic ankle. Even in the developed world  it takes a period of three weeks to often years for a patient to get a comfortable socket  if ever. Prosthetists still use conventional processes like molding and casting to create single material prosthetic sockets. Such sockets often leave intolerable amounts of pressure on the limbs of the patient  leaving them with pressure sores and blisters. It does not matter how powerful your prosthetic ankle is. If your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable  you will not use your leg  and that is just simply unacceptable in our age. So one day  when I met professor Hugh Herr about two and a half years ago  and he asked me if I knew  how to solve this problem  I said   No  not yet  but I would love to figure it out.  And so  for my Ph.D. at the MIT Media Lab  I designed custom prosthetic sockets quickly and cheaply that are more comfortable than conventional prostheses. I used magnetic resonance imaging to capture the actual shape of the patient's anatomy  then use finite element modeling to better predict the internal stresses and strains on the normal forces  and then create a prosthetic socket for manufacture. We use a  D printer to create a multi material prosthetic socket which relieves pressure where needed on the anatomy of the patient. In short  we're using data to make novel sockets quickly and cheaply. In a recent trial we just wrapped up at the Media Lab  one of our patients  a U.S. veteran who has been an amputee for about    years and worn dozens of legs  said of one of our printed parts   It's so soft  it's like walking on pillows  and it's effing sexy.  Disability in our age should not prevent anyone from living meaningful lives. My hope and desire is that the tools and processes we develop in our research group can be used to bring highly functional prostheses to those who need them. For me  a place to begin healing the souls of those affected by war and disease is by creating comfortable and affordable interfaces for their bodies. Whether it's in Sierra Leone or in Boston  I hope this not only restores but indeed transforms their sense of human potential. Thank you very much. Pat Mitchell  That day  January          began like all others. You were both doing the work that you love. You were meeting with constituents  which is something that you loved doing as a congresswoman  and Mark  you were happily preparing for your next space shuttle. And suddenly  everything  that you had planned or expected in your lives was irrevocably changed forever. Mark Kelly  Yeah  it's amazing  it's amazing how  everything can change for any of us in an instant. People don't realize that. I certainly didn't. Gabby Giffords  Yes. MK  And on that Saturday morning  I got this horrible phone call from Gabby's chief of staff. She didn't have much other information. She just said   Gabby was shot.  A few minutes later  I called her back and I actually thought for a second  well  maybe I just imagined  getting this phone call. I called her back  and  that's when she told me that Gabby had been shot in the head. And from that point on  I knew that our lives were  going to be a lot different. PM  And when you arrived at the hospital  what was the prognosis that they gave you about Gabby's condition  and what recovery  if any  you could expect  MK  Well  for a gunshot wound to the head and a traumatic brain injury  they typically can't tell you much. Every injury is different. It's not predictable like often a stroke might be predictable  which is another TBI kind of injury. So they didn't know how long Gabby would be in a coma  didn't know when that would change and what the prognosis would be. PM  Gabby  has your recovery been an effort to create  a new Gabby Giffords or reclaim the old Gabby Giffords  GG  The new one    better  stronger  tougher. MK  That to say  when you look at the picture behind us  to come back from that kind of injury and come back strong  and stronger than ever is a really tough thing to do. I don't know anybody that's as tough as my  wonderful wife right here. PM  And what were the first signs that recovery was not  only going to be possible but you were going to have some semblance of the life that you and Gabby had planned  MK  Well  the first thing  for me  was Gabby was still kind of almost unconscious  but she did something when she was in the ICU hospital bed that she used to do when we might be out to dinner at a restaurant  in that she pulled my ring off and she flipped it from one finger to the next  and at that point I knew that she was still in there. PM  And there were certain words  too. Didn't she surprise you with  words in the beginning  MK  Well  it was tough in the beginning. GG  What  What  Chicken. Chicken. Chicken. MK  Yeah  that was it. For the first month  that was the extent of Gabby's vocabulary. For some reason  she has aphasia  which is difficulty with communication. She latched on to the word  chicken   which isn't the best but  certainly is not the worst. And we were actually worried it could have been a lot worse than that. PM  Gabby  what's been  the toughest challenge for you during this recovery  GG  Talking. Really hard. Really. MK  Yeah  with aphasia  Gabby knows what she wants to say  she just can't get it out. She understands everything  but the communication is just very difficult because when you look at the picture  the part of your brain where those communication centers are are on the left side of your head  which is where the bullet passed through. PM  So you have to do  a very dangerous thing  speak for your wife. MK  I do. It might be some of the most dangerous things I've ever done. PM  Gabby  are you optimistic about your continuing recovery    walking  talking  being able to move your arm and leg  GG  I'm optimistic. It will be a long  hard haul  but I'm optimistic. PM  That seems to be the number one  characteristic of Gabby Giffords  wouldn't you say   Applause  MK  Gabby's always been really optimistic. She works incredibly hard every day. GG  On the treadmill   walked on my treadmill  Spanish lessons  French horn. MK  It's only my wife who could be    and if you knew her before she was injured  you would kind of understand this    somebody who could be injured and have such a hard time communicating and meets with a speech therapist  and then about a month ago  she says   I want to learn Spanish again.  PM  Well  let's take a little closer look at the wife  and this was even before you met Gabby Giffords. And she's on a motor scooter there  but it's my understanding that's a very tame image of what Gabby Giffords was like growing up. MK  Yeah  Gabby  she  used to race motorcycles. So that's a scooter  but she had    well  she still has a BMW motorcycle. PM  Does she ride it  MK  Well  that's a challenge with not being able to move her right arm  but I think with something I know about  Velcro  we might be able to get her back on the bike  Velcro her right hand up onto the handlebar. PM  I have a feeling we might  see that picture next  Gabby. But you meet  you're already decided that you're going to dedicate  your life to service. You're going into the military and eventually to become an astronaut. So you meet. What attracts you to Gabby  MK  Well  when we met  oddly enough  it was the last time we were in Vancouver  about    years ago. We met in Vancouver  at the airport  on a trip  that we were both taking to China  that I would actually  from my background  I would call it a boondoggle. Gabby would   GG  Fact finding mission. MK  She would call it an important fact finding mission. She was a state senator at the time  and we met here  at the airport  before a trip to China. PM  Would you describe it  as a whirlwind romance  GG  No  no  no. A good friend. MK  Yeah  we were friends for a long time. GG  Yes.  Laughter  MK  And then she invited me on  about a year or so later  she invited me on a date. Where'd we go  Gabby  GG  Death row. MK  Yes. Our first date was to death row at the Florence state prison in Arizona  which was just outside  Gabby's state senate district. They were working on some legislation that had to do with crime and punishment and capital punishment  in the state of Arizona. So she couldn't get anybody  else to go with her  and I'm like   Of course I  want to go to death row.  So that was our first date. We've been together ever since. GG  Yes. PM  Well  that might have contributed to the reason that Gabby decided to marry you. You were willing to go to death row  after all. MK  I guess. PM  Gabby  what did make you want to marry Mark  GG  Um  good friends. Best friends. Best friends. MK  I thought we always had a very special relationship. We've gone through some tough times and it's only made it stronger. GG  Stronger. PM  After you got married  however  you continued very independent lives. Actually  you didn't even live together. MK  We had one of those commuter marriages. In our case  it was Washington  D.C.  Houston  Tucson. Sometimes we'd go clockwise  sometimes counterclockwise  to all those different places  and we didn't really live together until that Saturday morning. Within an hour of Gabby being shot  I was on an airplane to Tucson  and that was the moment where that had changed things. PM  And also  Gabby  you had run for Congress after being a state senator and served in Congress for six years. What did you like best about being in Congress  GG  Fast pace. Fast pace. PM  Well it was the way you did it. GG  Yes  yes. Fast pace. PM  I'm not sure people would describe it entirely that way. MK  Yeah  you know  legislation is often at a colossally slow pace  but my wife  and I have to admit  a lot of other members of Congress that I know  work incredibly hard. I mean  Gabby would run  around like a crazy person  never take a day off  maybe a half a day off a month  and whenever she was awake she was working  and she really  really thrived on that  and still does today. GG  Yes. Yes. PM  Installing solar panels on the top of her house  I have to say. So after the tragic incident  Mark  you decided to resign your position as an astronaut  even though you were supposed to take the next space mission. Everybody  including Gabby  talked you into going back  and you did end up taking. MK  Kind of. The day after Gabby was injured  I called my boss  the chief astronaut  Dr. Peggy Whitson  and I said   Peggy  I know I'm launching in space in three months from now. Gabby's in a coma. I'm in Tucson. You've got to find a replacement for me.  So I didn't actually resign from being an astronaut  but I gave up my job and they found a replacement. Months later  maybe about two months later  I started about getting my job back  which is something  when you become this primary caregiver person  which some people in the audience here have certainly been in that position  it's a challenging role but at some point you've got to figure out when you're going to get your life back  and at the time  I couldn't ask Gabby if she wanted me to go fly in the space shuttle again. But I knew she was  GG  Yes. Yes. Yes. MK  She was the biggest  supporter of my career  and I knew it was the right thing to do. PM  And yet I'm trying to imagine  Mark  what that was like  going off onto a mission  one presumes safely   but it's never a guarantee  and knowing that Gabby is   MK  Well not only was  she still in the hospital  on the third day of that flight  literally while I was rendezvousing with the space station  and you've got two vehicles moving at        miles an hour  I'm actually flying it  looking out the window  a bunch of computers  Gabby was in brain surgery  literally at that time having the final surgery to replace the piece of skull that they took out on the day she was injured with a prosthetic  yeah  which is the whole side of her head. Now if any of you guys would ever come to our house in Tucson for the first time  Gabby would usually go up to the freezer and pull out the piece of Tupperware that has the real skull.  Laughter  GG  The real skull. MK  Which freaks people out  sometimes. PM  Is that for appetizer or dessert  Mark  MK  Well  it just gets the conversation going. PM  But there was a lot  of conversation about something you did  Gabby  after Mark's flight. You had to make another  step of courage too  because here was  Congress deadlocked again  and you got out of the rehabilitation center  got yourself to Washington so that you could walk  on the floor of the House    I can barely talk about this without getting emotional   and cast a vote which could have been the deciding vote. GG  The debt ceiling. The debt ceiling. MK  Yeah  we had that vote  I guess about five months after Gabby was injured  and she made this bold decision to go back. A very controversial vote  but she wanted to be there to have her voice heard one more time. PM  And after that  resigned and began what has been a very slow and challenging recovery. What's life like  day to day  MK  Well  that's Gabby's service dog Nelson. GG  Nelson. MK  New member of our family. GG  Yes  yes. MK  And we got him from a  GG  Prison. Murder. MK  We have a lot of connections with prisons  apparently.  Laughter  Nelson came from a prison  raised by a murderer in Massachusetts. But she did a great job with this dog. He's a fabulous service dog. PM  So Gabby  what have you learned from your experiences the past few years  MK  Yeah  what have you learned  GG  Deeper. Deeper. PM  Your relationship is deeper. It has to be. You're together all the time now. MK  I imagine being grateful  too  right  GG  Grateful. PM  This is a picture of  family and friends gathering  but I love these pictures because they show the Gabby and Mark relationship now. And you describe it  Gabby  over and over  as deeper on so many levels. Yes  MK  I think when something tragic happens in a family  it can pull people together. Here's us watching the space shuttle fly over Tucson  the Space Shuttle Endeavour  the one that I was the  commander on its last flight  on its final flight on top of an airplane on a     on its way to L.A.  NASA was kind enough  to have it fly over Tucson. PM  And of course  the two of you go through these challenges of a slow and difficult recovery  and yet  Gabby  how do you maintain your optimism and positive outlook  GG  I want to make the world a better place. PM  And you're doing that even though your recovery has to remain front and center for both of you. You are people who have done service to your country and you  are continuing to do that with a new initiative  a new purpose. And Gabby  what's on the agenda now  GG  Americans for Responsible Solutions. MK  That's our political action committee  where we are trying to  get members of Congress to take a more serious look at gun violence in this country  and to try to pass some reasonable legislation. GG  Yes. Yes.  Applause  MK  You know  this affected  us very personally  but it wasn't what happened to Gabby that got us involved. It was really the    murdered first graders and kindergartners in Newtown  Connecticut  and the response that we saw afterwards where    well  look what's happened so far. So far the national response has been pretty much to do nothing. We're trying to change that. PM  There have been    mass shootings since Newtown  a school a week in the first  two months of last year. What are you doing that's different than other efforts to balance rights for gun ownership and responsibilities  MK  We're gun owners   we support gun rights. At the same time  we've  got to do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill. It's not too difficult to do that. This issue  like many others  has become very polarizing and political  and we're trying to bring some balance to the debate in Washington. PM  Thank you both for that effort. And not surprisingly for  this woman of courage and of a sense of adventure  you just keep challenging yourself  and the sky seems to be the limit. I have to share this video of your most recent adventure. Take a look at Gabby. MK  This is a couple months ago. Good stuff. Gorgeous. Oh  thank you. Mountains. Gorgeous mountains. MK  Let me just say one of the guys that Gabby jumped with that day was a Navy SEAL who she met in Afghanistan who was injured in combat  had a really rough time. Gabby visited him when he was at Bethesda and went through a really tough period. He started doing better. Months later  Gabby was shot in the head  and then he supported her while she was in the hospital in Houston. So they have a very  very nice connection. GG  Yes. PM  What a wonderful moment. Because this is the TED stage  Gabby  I know you worked very hard to think of the ideas that you wanted to leave with this audience. GG  Thank you. Hello  everyone. Thank you for inviting us here today. It's been a long  hard haul  but I'm getting better. I'm working hard  lots of therapy    speech therapy  physical therapy  and yoga too. But my spirit is strong as ever. I'm still fighting to make  the world a better place  and you can too. Get involved with your community. Be a leader. Set an example. Be passionate. Be courageous. Be your best. Thank you very much. MK  Thank you. GG  Thank you. MK  Thank you everybody. GG  Bye bye.  Applause  So I've been thinking about the difference between the r sum  virtues and  the eulogy virtues. The r sum  virtues are the ones you put on your r sum   which are the skills  you bring to the marketplace. The eulogy virtues are the ones that get mentioned in the eulogy  which are deeper  who are you   in your depth  what is the nature of your relationships  are you bold  loving  dependable  consistency  And most of us  including  me  would say that the eulogy virtues are the more important of the virtues. But at least in my case   are they the ones that I think about the most   And the answer is no. So I've been thinking about that problem  and a thinker who has  helped me think about it is a guy named Joseph Soloveitchik  who was a rabbi who wrote a book called  The Lonely Man Of Faith  in     . Soloveitchik said there are two sides of our natures  which he called Adam I and Adam II. Adam I is the worldly  ambitious  external side of our nature. He wants to build  create  create companies  create innovation. Adam II is the humble side of our nature. Adam II wants not only  to do good but to be good  to live in a way internally that honors God  creation and our possibilities. Adam I wants to conquer the world. Adam II wants to hear  a calling and obey the world. Adam I savors accomplishment. Adam II savors inner  consistency and strength. Adam I asks how things work. Adam II asks why we're here. Adam I's motto is  success.  Adam II's motto is  love  redemption and return.  And Soloveitchik argued  that these two sides of our nature are  at war with each other. We live in perpetual self confrontation between the external success and the internal value. And the tricky thing   I'd say  about these two sides of our nature is they work by different logics. The external logic is  an economic logic  input leads to output   risk leads to reward. The internal side of our nature is a moral logic and  often an inverse logic. You have to give to receive. You have to surrender  to something outside yourself to gain strength within yourself. You have to conquer the desire to get what you want. In order to fulfill yourself  you have to forget yourself. In order to find yourself   you have to lose yourself. We happen to live in a society  that favors Adam I  and often neglects Adam II. And the problem is  that turns you into a shrewd animal who treats life as a game  and you become a cold   calculating creature who slips into a sort of mediocrity where you realize there's a difference between your desired  self and your actual self. You're not earning the sort of eulogy you want  you hope someone will give to you. You don't have the  depth of conviction. You don't have an emotional sonorousness. You don't have  commitment to tasks that would take more than a lifetime to commit. I was reminded of a common response through history of how you build a solid Adam II  how you build a depth of character. Through history  people  have gone back into their own pasts  sometimes to a precious  time in their life  to their childhood  and often  the mind  gravitates in the past to a moment of shame  some sin committed   some act of selfishness  an act of omission  of shallowness  the sin of anger  the sin of self pity  trying to be a people pleaser   a lack of courage. Adam I is built by  building on your strengths. Adam II is built by fighting  your weaknesses. You go into yourself   you find the sin which you've committed over and again through your life  your signature sin out of which the others emerge  and you fight that sin and you wrestle with that sin  and out of that wrestling   that suffering  then a depth of character is constructed. And we're often not taught to recognize the sin in ourselves  in that we're not taught in this culture how to wrestle with it  how to confront it   and how to combat it. We live in a culture  with an Adam I mentality where we're inarticulate  about Adam II. Finally  Reinhold Niebuhr summed up the confrontation  the fully lived Adam I and Adam II life  this way   Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime  therefore we must  be saved by hope. Nothing which is true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history  therefore we must be saved by faith. Nothing we do  however virtuous  can be accomplished alone  therefore we must  be saved by love. No virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as from our own standpoint. Therefore we must be saved  by that final form of love  which is forgiveness.  Thanks. When I was born  there was really only one book about how to raise your children  and it was written by Dr. Spock. Thank you for indulging me. I have always wanted to do that. No  it was Benjamin Spock  and his book was called  The Common Sense Book of Baby And Child Care.  It sold almost    million copies  by the time he died. Today  I  as the mother of a six year old  walk into Barnes and Noble  and see this. And it is amazing the variety that one finds  on those shelves. There are guides to raising  an eco friendly kid  a gluten free kid  a disease proof kid  which  if you ask me  is a little bit creepy. There are guides to raising a bilingual kid even if you only speak one language at home. There are guides to raising a financially savvy kid and a science minded kid and a kid who is a whiz at yoga. Short of teaching your toddler how to defuse a nuclear bomb  there is pretty much a guide to everything. All of these books are well intentioned. I am sure that many of them are great. But taken together  I am sorry  I do not see help when I look at that shelf. I see anxiety. I see a giant candy colored monument to our collective panic  and it makes me want to know  why is it that raising our children is associated with so much anguish and so much confusion  Why is it that we are at sixes and sevens about the one thing human beings have been doing successfully for millennia  long before parenting message boards and peer reviewed studies came along  Why is it that so many mothers and fathers experience parenthood as a kind of crisis  Crisis might seem like a strong word  but there is data suggesting it probably isn't. There was  in fact  a paper of just this very name   Parenthood as Crisis   published in       and in the    plus years since  there has been plenty of scholarship documenting a pretty clear pattern of parental anguish. Parents experience more stress than non parents. Their marital satisfaction is lower. There have been a number of studies looking at how parents feel when they are spending time with their kids  and the answer often is  not so great. Last year  I spoke with a researcher named Matthew Killingsworth who is doing a very  very imaginative project that tracks people's happiness  and here is what he told me he found   Interacting with your friends is better than interacting with your spouse  which is better than interacting with other relatives  which is better than interacting with acquaintances  which is better than interacting with parents  which is better than interacting with children. Who are on par with strangers.  But here's the thing. I have been looking at what underlies these data for three years  and children are not the problem. Something about parenting right now at this moment is the problem. Specifically  I don't think we know what parenting is supposed to be. Parent  as a verb  only entered common usage in     . Our roles as mothers and fathers have changed. The roles of our children have changed. We are all now furiously improvising our way through a situation for which there is no script  and if you're an amazing jazz musician  then improv is great  but for the rest of us  it can kind of feel like a crisis. So how did we get here  How is it that we are all now navigating a child rearing universe without any norms to guide us  Well  for starters  there has been a major historical change. Until fairly recently  kids worked  on our farms primarily  but also in factories  mills  mines. Kids were considered economic assets. Sometime during the Progressive Era  we put an end to this arrangement. We recognized kids had rights  we banned child labor  we focused on education instead  and school became a child's new work. And thank God it did. But that only made a parent's role more confusing in a way. The old arrangement might not have been particularly ethical  but it was reciprocal. We provided food  clothing  shelter  and moral instruction to our kids  and they in return provided income. Once kids stopped working  the economics of parenting changed. Kids became  in the words of one brilliant if totally ruthless sociologist   economically worthless but emotionally priceless.  Rather than them working for us  we began to work for them  because within only a matter of decades it became clear  if we wanted our kids to succeed  school was not enough. Today  extracurricular activities are a kid's new work  but that's work for us too  because we are the ones driving them to soccer practice. Massive piles of homework are a kid's new work  but that's also work for us  because we have to check it. About three years ago  a Texas woman told something to me that totally broke my heart. She said  almost casually   Homework is the new dinner.  The middle class now pours all of its time and energy and resources into its kids  even though the middle class has less and less of those things to give. Mothers now spend more time with their children than they did in       when most women were not even in the workforce. It would probably be easier for parents to do their new roles if they knew what they were preparing their kids for. This is yet another thing that makes modern parenting so very confounding. We have no clue what portion our wisdom  if any  is of use to our kids. The world is changing so rapidly  it's impossible to say. This was true even when I was young. When I was a kid  high school specifically  I was told that I would be at sea in the new global economy if I did not know Japanese. And with all due respect to the Japanese  it didn't turn out that way. Now there is a certain kind of middle class parent that is obsessed with teaching their kids Mandarin  and maybe they're onto something  but we cannot know for sure. So  absent being able to anticipate the future  what we all do  as good parents  is try and prepare our kids for every possible kind of future  hoping that just one of our efforts will pay off. We teach our kids chess  thinking maybe they will need analytical skills. We sign them up for team sports  thinking maybe they will need collaborative skills  you know  for when they go to Harvard Business School. We try and teach them to be financially savvy and science minded and eco friendly and gluten free  though now is probably a good time to tell you that I was not eco friendly and gluten free as a child. I ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef. And you know what  I'm doing okay. I pay my taxes. I hold down a steady job. I was even invited to speak at TED. But the presumption now is that what was good enough for me  or for my folks for that matter  isn't good enough anymore. So we all make a mad dash to that bookshelf  because we feel like if we aren't trying everything  it's as if we're doing nothing and we're defaulting on our obligations to our kids. So it's hard enough to navigate our new roles as mothers and fathers. Now add to this problem something else  we are also navigating new roles as husbands and wives because most women today are in the workforce. This is another reason  I think  that parenthood feels like a crisis. We have no rules  no scripts  no norms for what to do when a child comes along now that both mom and dad are breadwinners. The writer Michael Lewis once put this very  very well. He said that the surest way for a couple to start fighting is for them to go out to dinner with another couple whose division of labor is ever so slightly different from theirs  because the conversation in the car on the way home goes something like this   So  did you catch that Dave is the one who walks them to school every morning   Without scripts telling us who does what in this brave new world  couples fight  and both mothers and fathers each have their legitimate gripes. Mothers are much more likely to be multi tasking when they are at home  and fathers  when they are at home  are much more likely to be mono tasking. Find a guy at home  and odds are he is doing just one thing at a time. In fact  UCLA recently did a study looking at the most common configuration of family members in middle class homes. Guess what it was  Dad in a room by himself. According to the American Time Use Survey  mothers still do twice as much childcare as fathers  which is better than it was in Erma Bombeck's day  but I still think that something she wrote is highly relevant   I have not been alone in the bathroom since October.  But here is the thing  Men are doing plenty. They spend more time with their kids than their fathers ever spent with them. They work more paid hours  on average  than their wives  and they genuinely want to be good  involved dads. Today  it is fathers  not mothers  who report the most work life conflict. Either way  by the way  if you think it's hard for traditional families to sort out these new roles  just imagine what it's like now for non traditional families  families with two dads  families with two moms  single parent households. They are truly improvising as they go. Now  in a more progressive country  and forgive me here for capitulating to clich  and invoking  yes  Sweden  parents could rely on the state for support. There are countries that acknowledge the anxieties and the changing roles of mothers and fathers. Unfortunately  the United States is not one of them  so in case you were wondering what the U.S. has in common with Papua New Guinea and Liberia  it's this  We too have no paid maternity leave policy. We are one of eight known countries that does not. In this age of intense confusion  there is just one goal upon which all parents can agree  and that is whether they are tiger moms or hippie moms  helicopters or drones  our kids' happiness is paramount. That is what it means to raise kids in an age when they are economically worthless but emotionally priceless. We are all the custodians of their self esteem. The one mantra no parent ever questions is   All I want is for my children to be happy.  And don't get me wrong  I think happiness is a wonderful goal for a child. But it is a very elusive one. Happiness and self confidence  teaching children that is not like teaching them how to plow a field. It's not like teaching them how to ride a bike. There's no curriculum for it. Happiness and self confidence can be the byproducts of other things  but they cannot really be goals unto themselves. A child's happiness is a very unfair burden to place on a parent. And happiness is an even more unfair burden to place on a kid. And I have to tell you  I think it leads to some very strange excesses. We are now so anxious to protect our kids from the world's ugliness that we now shield them from  Sesame Street.  I wish I could say I was kidding about this  but if you go out and you buy the first few episodes of  Sesame Street  on DVD  as I did out of nostalgia  you will find a warning at the beginning saying that the content is not suitable for children. Can I just repeat that  The content of the original  Sesame Street  is not suitable for children. When asked about this by The New York Times  a producer for the show gave a variety of explanations. One was that Cookie Monster smoked a pipe in one skit and then swallowed it. Bad modeling. I don't know. But the thing that stuck with me is she said that she didn't know whether Oscar the Grouch could be invented today because he was too depressive. I cannot tell you how much this distresses me. You are looking at a woman who has a periodic table of the Muppets hanging from her cubicle wall. The offending muppet  right there. That's my son the day he was born. I was high as a kite on morphine. I had had an unexpected C section. But even in my opiate haze  I managed to have one very clear thought the first time I held him. I whispered it into his ear. I said   I will try so hard not to hurt you.  It was the Hippocratic Oath  and I didn't even know I was saying it. But it occurs to me now that the Hippocratic Oath is a much more realistic aim than happiness. In fact  as any parent will tell you  it's awfully hard. All of us have said or done hurtful things that we wish to God we could take back. I think in another era we did not expect quite so much from ourselves  and it is important that we all remember that the next time we are staring with our hearts racing at those bookshelves. I'm not really sure how to create new norms for this world  but I do think that in our desperate quest to create happy kids  we may be assuming the wrong moral burden. It strikes me as a better goal  and  dare I say  a more virtuous one  to focus on making productive kids and moral kids  and to simply hope that happiness will come to them by virtue of the good that they do and their accomplishments and the love that they feel from us. That  anyway  is one response to having no script. Absent having new scripts  we just follow the oldest ones in the book    decency  a work ethic  love   and let happiness and self esteem take care of themselves. I think if we all did that  the kids would still be all right  and so would their parents  possibly in both cases even better. Thank you. I want you all to think about the third word that was ever said about you    or  if you were delivering  about the person you were delivering. And you can all mouth it if you want or say it out loud. It was    the first two were   It's a ...  Audience   Mixed reply  Girl. Boy. Well  it shows you that    I also deal with issues where there's not certainty of whether it's a girl or a boy  so the mixed answer was very appropriate. Of course  now the answer often comes not at birth but at the ultrasound  unless the prospective parents choose to be surprised  like we all were. But I want you to think about what it is that leads to that statement on the third word  because the third word is a description of your sex. And by that I mean  made by a description of your genitals. Now  as a pediatric endocrinologist  I used to be very  very involved and still somewhat am  in cases in which there are mismatches in the externals or between the externals and the internals  and we literally have to figure out what is the description of your sex. But there is nothing that is definable at the time of birth that would define you. And when I talk about definition  I'm talking about your sexual orientation. We don't say   It's a ... gay boy    A lesbian girl   Those situations don't really define themselves more until the second decade of life. Nor do they define your gender  which  as different from your anatomic sex  describes your self concept  Do you see yourself as a male or female  or somewhere in the spectrum in between  That sometimes shows up in the first decade of life  but it can be very confusing for parents  because it is quite normative for children to act in a cross gender play and way  and  in fact  there are studies that show that even    percent of children who act in that fashion will not persist in wanting to be the opposite gender at the time when puberty begins. But  at the time that puberty begins    that means between about age    to    in girls     to    in boys    with breast budding  or two to three times' increase in the gonads in the case of genetic males  by that particular point  the child who says they are in the absolute wrong body is almost certain to be transgender and is extremely unlikely to change those feelings  no matter how anybody tries reparative therapy or any other noxious things. Now  this is relatively rare  so I had relatively little personal experience with this. And my experience was more typical  only because I had an adolescent practice. And I saw someone age     genetically female  went through Harvard with three male roommates who knew the whole story  a registrar who always listed his name on course lists as a male name  and came to me after graduating  saying   Help me. I know you know a lot of endocrinology.  And indeed  I've treated a lot of people who were born without gonads. This wasn't rocket science. But I made a deal with him   I'll treat you if you teach me.  And so he did. And what an education I got from taking care of all the members of his support group. And then I got really confused  because I thought it was relatively easy at that age to just give people the hormones of the gender in which they were affirming. But then my patient married  and he married a woman who had been born as a male  had married as a male  had two children  then went through a transition into female. And now this delightful female was attached to my male patient    in fact  got legally married  because they showed up as a man and a woman  and who knew  right  And I was confused     Does this make so and so gay  Does this make so and so straight   I was getting sexual orientation confused with gender identity. And my patient said to me   Look  look  look. If you just think of the following  you'll get it right  Sexual orientation is who you go to bed with. Gender identity is who you go to bed as.  And I subsequently learned from the many adults    I took care of about     adults    I learned from them that if I didn't peek as to who their partner was in the waiting room  I would never be able to guess better than chance  whether they were gay  straight  bi or asexual in their affirmed gender. In other words  one thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other. And the data show it. Now  as I took care of the     adults  I found it extremely painful. These people    many of them    had to give up so much of their lives. Sometimes their parents would reject them  siblings  their own children  and then their divorcing spouse would forbid them from seeing their children. It was so awful  but why did they do it at    and     Because they felt they had to affirm themselves before they would kill themselves. And indeed  the rate of suicide among untreated transgendered people is among the highest in the world. So  what to do  I was intrigued  in going to a conference in Holland  where they are experts in this  and saw the most remarkable thing. They were treating young adolescents after giving them the most intense psychometric testing of gender  and they were treating them by blocking the puberty that they didn't want. Because basically  kids look about the same  each sex  until they go through puberty  at which point  if you feel you're in the wrong sex  you feel like Pinocchio becoming a donkey. The fantasy that you had that your body will change to be who you want it to be  with puberty  actually is nullified by the puberty you get. And they fall apart. So that's why putting the puberty on hold    why on hold  You can't just give them the opposite hormones that young. They'll end up stunted in growth  and you think you can have a meaningful conversation about the fertility effects of such treatment with a    year old girl  a    year old boy  So this buys time in the diagnostic process for four or five years  so that they can work it out. They can have more and more testing  they can live without feeling their bodies are running away from them. And then  in a program they call           around age    is when they give the blocking hormones  and then at age     with retesting  they re qualify to receive    now remember  the blocking hormones are reversible  but when you give the hormones of the opposite sex  you now start spouting breasts and facial hair and voice change  depending on what you're using  and those effects are permanent  or require surgery to remove  or electrolysis  and you can never really affect the voice. So this is serious  and this is         year old stuff. And then at     they're eligible for surgery. And while there's no good surgery for females to males genitally  the male to female surgery has fooled gynecologists. That's how good it can be. So I looked at how the patients were doing  and I looked at patients who just looked like everybody else  except they were pubertally delayed. But once they gave them the hormones consistent with the gender they affirm  they look beautiful. They look normal. They had normal heights. You would never be able to pick them out in a crowd. So at that point  I decided I'm going to do this. This is really where the pediatric endocrine realm comes in  because  in fact  if you're going to deal with it in kids aged    to     that's pediatric endocrinology. So I brought some kids in  and this now became the standard of care  and the  Boston  Children's Hospital was behind it. By my showing them the kids before and after  people who never got treated and people who wished to be treated  and pictures of the Dutch    they came to me and said   You've got to do something for these kids.  Well  where were these kids before  They were out there suffering  is where they were. So we started a program in     . It became the first program of its kind    but it's really of the Dutch kind    in North America. And since then  we have     patients. Did they come from Afghanistan  No.    percent of them came from within     miles of Boston. And some came from England. Jackie had been abused in the Midlands  in England. She's    years old there  she was living as a girl  but she was being beaten up. It was a horror show  they had to homeschool her. And the reason the British were coming was because they would not treat anybody with anything under age     which means they were consigning them to an adult body no matter what happened  even if they tested them well. Jackie  on top of it  was  by virtue of skeletal markings  destined to be six feet five. And yet  she had just begun a male puberty. Well  I did something a little bit innovative  because I do know hormones  and that estrogen is much more potent in closing epiphyses  the growth plates  and stopping growth  than testosterone is. So we blocked her testosterone with a blocking hormone  but we added estrogen  not at     but at   . And so here she is at     on the left. And on her   th birthday  she went to Thailand  where they would do a genital plastic surgery. They will do it at    now. And she ended up  '   . But more than that  she has normal breast size  because by blocking testosterone  every one of our patients has normal breast size if they get to us at the appropriate age  not too late. And on the far right  there she is. She went public    semifinalist in the Miss England competition. The judges debated as to  can they do this  And one of them quipped  I'm told   But she has more natural self than half the other contestants.  And some of them have been rearranged a little bit  but it's all her DNA. And she's become a remarkable spokeswoman. And she was offered contracts as a model  at which point she teased me  when she said   You know  I might have had a better chance as a model if you'd made me six feet one.  Go figure. So this picture  I think  says it all. It really says it all. These are Nicole and brother Jonas  identical twin boys  and proven to be identical. Nicole had affirmed herself as a girl as early as age three. At age seven  they changed her name  and came to me at the very beginnings of a male puberty. Now you can imagine looking at Jonas at only     that male puberty is early in this family  because he looks more like a    year old. But it makes the point all the more  of why you have to be conscious of where the patient is. Nicole is on pubertal blockade in here  and Jonas is just going    biologic control. This is what Nicole would look like if we weren't doing what we were doing. He's got a prominent Adam's apple. He's got angular bones to the face  a mustache  and you can see there's a height difference  because he's gone through a growth spurt that she won't get. Now Nicole is on estrogen. She has a bit of a form to her. This family went to the White House last spring  because of their work in overturning an anti discrimination    there was a bill that would block the right of transgender people in Maine to use public bathrooms  and it looked like the bill was going to pass  and that would have been a problem  but Nicole went personally to every legislator in Maine and said   I can do this. If they see me  they'll understand why I'm no threat in the ladies' room  but I can be threatened in the men's room.  And then they finally got it. So where do we go from here  Well  we still have a ways to go in terms of anti discrimination. There are only    states that have an anti discrimination law against discrimination in housing  employment  public accommodation    only    states  and five of them are in New England. We need less expensive drugs. They cost a fortune. And we need to get this condition out of the DSM. It is as much a psychiatric disease as being gay and lesbian  and that went out the window in       and the whole world changed. And this isn't going to break anybody's budget. This is not that common. But the risks of not doing anything for them not only puts all of them at risk of losing their lives to suicide  but it also says something about whether we are a truly inclusive society. Thank you. The universe is teeming with planets. I want us  in the next decade  to build a space telescope that'll be able to image an Earth about another star and figure out whether it can harbor life. My colleagues at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Princeton and I are working on technology that will be able to do just that in the coming years. Astronomers now believe that every star in the galaxy has a planet  and they speculate that up to one fifth of them have an Earth like planet that might be able to harbor life  but we haven't seen any of them. We've only detected them indirectly. This is NASA's famous picture of the pale blue dot. It was taken by the Voyager spacecraft in       when they turned it around as it was exiting the solar system to take a picture of the Earth from six billion kilometers away. I want to take that of an Earth like planet about another star. Why haven't we done that  Why is that hard  Well to see  let's imagine we take the Hubble Space Telescope and we turn it around and we move it out to the orbit of Mars. We'll see something like that  a slightly blurry picture of the Earth  because we're a fairly small telescope out at the orbit of Mars. Now let's move ten times further away. Here we are at the orbit of Uranus. It's gotten smaller  it's got less detail  less resolve. We can still see the little moon  but let's go ten times further away again. Here we are at the edge of the solar system  out at the Kuiper Belt. Now it's not resolved at all. It's that pale blue dot of Carl Sagan's. But let's move yet again ten times further away. Here we are out at the Oort Cloud  outside the solar system  and we're starting to see the sun move into the field of view and get into where the planet is. One more time  ten times further away. Now we're at Alpha Centauri  our nearest neighbor star  and the planet is gone. All we're seeing is the big beaming image of the star that's ten billion times brighter than the planet  which should be in that little red circle. That's what we want to see. That's why it's hard. The light from the star is diffracting. It's scattering inside the telescope  creating that very bright image that washes out the planet. So to see the planet  we have to do something about all of that light. We have to get rid of it. I have a lot of colleagues working on really amazing technologies to do that  but I want to tell you about one today that I think is the coolest  and probably the most likely to get us an Earth in the next decade. It was first suggested by Lyman Spitzer  the father of the space telescope  in       and he took his inspiration from an eclipse. You've all seen that. That's a solar eclipse. The moon has moved in front of the sun. It blocks out most of the light so we can see that dim corona around it. It would be the same thing if I put my thumb up and blocked that spotlight that's getting right in my eye  I can see you in the back row. Well  what's going on  Well the moon is casting a shadow down on the Earth. We put a telescope or a camera in that shadow  we look back at the sun  and most of the light's been removed and we can see that dim  fine structure in the corona. Spitzer's suggestion was we do this in space. We build a big screen  we fly it in space  we put it up in front of the star  we block out most of the light  we fly a space telescope in that shadow that's created  and boom  we get to see planets. Well that would look something like this. So there's that big screen  and there's no planets  because unfortunately it doesn't actually work very well  because the light waves of the light and waves diffracts around that screen the same way it did in the telescope. It's like water bending around a rock in a stream  and all that light just destroys the shadow. It's a terrible shadow. And we can't see planets. But Spitzer actually knew the answer. If we can feather the edges  soften those edges so we can control diffraction  well then we can see a planet  and in the last    years or so we've come up with optimal solutions for doing that. It looks something like that. We call that our flower petal starshade. If we make the edges of those petals exactly right  if we control their shape  we can control diffraction  and now we have a great shadow. It's about    billion times dimmer than it was before  and we can see the planets beam out just like that. That  of course  has to be bigger than my thumb. That starshade is about the size of half a football field and it has to fly        kilometers away from the telescope that has to be held right in its shadow  and then we can see those planets. This sounds formidable  but brilliant engineers  colleagues of mine at JPL  came up with a fabulous design for how to do that and it looks like this. It starts wrapped around a hub. It separates from the telescope. The petals unfurl  they open up  the telescope turns around. Then you'll see it flip and fly out that        kilometers away from the telescope. It's going to move in front of the star just like that  creates a wonderful shadow. Boom  we get planets orbiting about it. Thank you. That's not science fiction. We've been working on this for the last five or six years. Last summer  we did a really cool test out in California at Northrop Grumman. So those are four petals. This is a sub scale star shade. It's about half the size of the one you just saw. You'll see the petals unfurl. Those four petals were built by four undergraduates doing a summer internship at JPL. Now you're seeing it deploy. Those petals have to rotate into place. The base of those petals has to go to the same place every time to within a tenth of a millimeter. We ran this test    times  and    times it went into the exact same place to a tenth of a millimeter. This has to be done very precisely  but if we can do this  if we can build this technology  if we can get it into space  you might see something like this. That's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. If we can take a similar space telescope  slightly larger  put it out there  fly an occulter in front of it  what we might see is something like that    that's a family portrait of our solar system    but not ours. We're hoping it'll be someone else's solar system as seen through an occulter  through a starshade like that. You can see Jupiter  you can see Saturn  Uranus  Neptune  and right there in the center  next to the residual light is that pale blue dot. That's Earth. We want to see that  see if there's water  oxygen  ozone  the things that might tell us that it could harbor life. I think this is the coolest possible science. That's why I got into doing this  because I think that will change the world. That will change everything when we see that. Thank you. Type is something we consume in enormous quantities. In much of the world  it's completely inescapable. But few consumers are concerned to know where a particular typeface came from or when or who designed it  if  indeed  there was any human agency involved in its creation  if it didn't just sort of materialize out of the software ether. But I do have to be concerned with those things. It's my job. I'm one of the tiny handful of people who gets badly bent out of shape by the bad spacing of the T and the E that you see there. I've got to take that slide off. I can't stand it. Nor can Chris. There. Good. So my talk is about the connection between technology and design of type. The technology has changed a number of times since I started work  photo  digital  desktop  screen  web. I've had to survive those changes and try to understand their implications for what I do for design. This slide is about the effect of tools on form. The two letters  the two K's  the one on your left  my right  is modern  made on a computer. All straight lines are dead straight. The curves have that kind of mathematical smoothness that the B zier formula imposes. On the right  ancient Gothic  cut in the resistant material of steel by hand. None of the straight lines are actually straight. The curves are kind of subtle. It has that spark of life from the human hand that the machine or the program can never capture. What a contrast. Well  I tell a lie. A lie at TED. I'm really sorry. Both of these were made on a computer  same software  same B zier curves  same font format. The one on your left was made by Zuzana Licko at Emigre  and I did the other one. The tool is the same  yet the letters are different. The letters are different because the designers are different. That's all. Zuzana wanted hers to look like that. I wanted mine to look like that. End of story. Type is very adaptable. Unlike a fine art  such as sculpture or architecture  type hides its methods. I think of myself as an industrial designer. The thing I design is manufactured  and it has a function  to be read  to convey meaning. But there is a bit more to it than that. There's the sort of aesthetic element. What makes these two letters different from different interpretations by different designers  What gives the work of some designers sort of characteristic personal style  as you might find in the work of a fashion designer  an automobile designer  whatever  There have been some cases  I admit  where I as a designer did feel the influence of technology. This is from the mid '  s  the change from metal type to photo  hot to cold. This brought some benefits but also one particular drawback  a spacing system that only provided    discrete units for letters to be accommodated on. I was asked at this time to design a series of condensed sans serif types with as many different variants as possible within this    unit box. Quickly looking at the arithmetic  I realized I could only actually make three of related design. Here you see them. In Helvetica Compressed  Extra Compressed  and Ultra Compressed  this rigid    unit system really boxed me in. It kind of determined the proportions of the design. Here are the typefaces  at least the lower cases. So do you look at these and say   Poor Matthew  he had to submit to a problem  and by God it shows in the results.  I hope not. If I were doing this same job today  instead of having    spacing units  I would have      . Clearly I could make more variants  but would these three members of the family be better  It's hard to say without actually doing it  but they would not be better in the proportion of       to     I can tell you that. My instinct tells you that any improvement would be rather slight  because they were designed as functions of the system they were designed to fit  and as I said  type is very adaptable. It does hide its methods. All industrial designers work within constraints. This is not fine art. The question is  does a constraint force a compromise  By accepting a constraint  are you working to a lower standard  I don't believe so  and I've always been encouraged by something that Charles Eames said. He said he was conscious of working within constraints  but not of making compromises. The distinction between a constraint and a compromise is obviously very subtle  but it's very central to my attitude to work. Remember this reading experience  The phone book. I'll hold the slide so you can enjoy the nostalgia. This is from the mid '  s early trials of Bell Centennial typeface I designed for the U.S. phone books  and it was my first experience of digital type  and quite a baptism. Designed for the phone books  as I said  to be printed at tiny size on newsprint on very high speed rotary presses with ink that was kerosene and lampblack. This is not a hospitable environment for a typographic designer. So the challenge for me was to design type that performed as well as possible in these very adverse production conditions. As I say  we were in the infancy of digital type. I had to draw every character by hand on quadrille graph paper    there were four weights of Bell Centennial   pixel by pixel  then encode them raster line by raster line for the keyboard. It took two years  but I learned a lot. These letters look as though they've been chewed by the dog or something or other  but the missing pixels at the intersections of strokes or in the crotches are the result of my studying the effects of ink spread on cheap paper and reacting  revising the font accordingly. These strange artifacts are designed to compensate for the undesirable effects of scale and production process. At the outset  AT T had wanted to set the phone books in Helvetica  but as my friend Erik Spiekermann said in the Helvetica movie  if you've seen that  the letters in Helvetica were designed to be as similar to one another as possible. This is not the recipe for legibility at small size. It looks very elegant up on a slide. I had to disambiguate these forms of the figures as much as possible in Bell Centennial by sort of opening the shapes up  as you can see in the bottom part of that slide. So now we're on to the mid '  s  the early days of digital outline fonts  vector technology. There was an issue at that time with the size of the fonts  the amount of data that was required to find and store a font in computer memory. It limited the number of fonts you could get on your typesetting system at any one time. I did an analysis of the data  and found that a typical serif face you see on the left needed nearly twice as much data as a sans serif in the middle because of all the points required to define the elegantly curved serif brackets. The numbers at the bottom of the slide  by the way  they represent the amount of data needed to store each of the fonts. So the sans serif  in the middle  sans the serifs  was much more economical     to    .  Aha   I thought.  The engineers have a problem. Designer to the rescue.  I made a serif type  you can see it on the right  without curved serifs. I made them polygonal  out of straight line segments  chamfered brackets. And look  as economical in data as a sans serif. We call it Charter  on the right. So I went to the head of engineering with my numbers  and I said proudly   I have solved your problem.   Oh   he said.  What problem   And I said   Well  you know  the problem of the huge data you require for serif fonts and so on.   Oh   he said.  We solved that problem last week. We wrote a compaction routine that reduces the size of all fonts by an order of magnitude. You can have as many fonts on your system as you like.   Well  thank you for letting me know   I said. Foiled again. I was left with a design solution for a nonexistent technical problem. But here is where the story sort of gets interesting for me. I didn't just throw my design away in a fit of pique. I persevered. What had started as a technical exercise became an aesthetic exercise  really. In other words  I had come to like this typeface. Forget its origins. Screw that. I liked the design for its own sake. The simplified forms of Charter gave it a sort of plain spoken quality and unfussy spareness that sort of pleased me. You know  at times of technical innovation  designers want to be influenced by what's in the air. We want to respond. We want to be pushed into exploring something new. So Charter is a sort of parable for me  really. In the end  there was no hard and fast causal link between the technology and the design of Charter. I had really misunderstood the technology. The technology did suggest something to me  but it did not force my hand  and I think this happens very often. You know  engineers are very smart  and despite occasional frustrations because I'm less smart  I've always enjoyed working with them and learning from them. Apropos  in the mid '  s  I started talking to Microsoft about screen fonts. Up to that point  all the fonts on screen had been adapted from previously existing printing fonts  of course. But Microsoft foresaw correctly the movement  the stampede towards electronic communication  to reading and writing onscreen with the printed output as being sort of secondary in importance. So the priorities were just tipping at that point. They wanted a small core set of fonts that were not adapted but designed for the screen to face up to the problems of screen  which were their coarse resolution displays. I said to Microsoft  a typeface designed for a particular technology is a self obsoleting typeface. I've designed too many faces in the past that were intended to mitigate technical problems. Thanks to the engineers  the technical problems went away. So did my typeface. It was only a stopgap. Microsoft came back to say that affordable computer monitors with better resolutions were at least a decade away. So I thought  well  a decade  that's not bad  that's more than a stopgap. So I was persuaded  I was convinced  and we went to work on what became Verdana and Georgia  for the first time working not on paper but directly onto the screen from the pixel up. At that time  screens were binary. The pixel was either on or it was off. Here you see the outline of a letter  the cap H  which is the thin black line  the contour  which is how it is stored in memory  superimposed on the bitmap  which is the grey area  which is how it's displayed on the screen. The bitmap is rasterized from the outline. Here in a cap H  which is all straight lines  the two are in almost perfect sync on the Cartesian grid. Not so with an O. This looks more like bricklaying than type design  but believe me  this is a good bitmap O  for the simple reason that it's symmetrical in both x and y axes. In a binary bitmap  you actually can't ask for more than that. I would sometimes make  I don't know  three or four different versions of a difficult letter like a lowercase A  and then stand back to choose which was the best. Well  there was no best  so the designer's judgment comes in in trying to decide which is the least bad. Is that a compromise  Not to me  if you are working at the highest standard the technology will allow  although that standard may be well short of the ideal. You may be able to see on this slide two different bitmap fonts there. The  a  in the upper one  I think  is better than the  a  in the lower one  but it still ain't great. You can maybe see the effect better if it's reduced. Well  maybe not. So I'm a pragmatist  not an idealist  out of necessity. For a certain kind of temperament  there is a certain kind of satisfaction in doing something that cannot be perfect but can still be done to the best of your ability. Here's the lowercase H from Georgia Italic. The bitmap looks jagged and rough. It is jagged and rough. But I discovered  by experiment  that there is an optimum slant for an italic on a screen so the strokes break well at the pixel boundaries. Look in this example how  rough as it is  how the left and right legs actually break at the same level. That's a victory. That's good  right there. And of course  at the lower depths  you don't get much choice. This is an S  in case you were wondering. Well  it's been    years now since Verdana and Georgia were released. Microsoft were absolutely right  it took a good    years  but screen displays now do have improved spatial resolution  and very much improved photometric resolution thanks to anti aliasing and so on. So now that their mission is accomplished  has that meant the demise of the screen fonts that I designed for coarser displays back then  Will they outlive the now obsolete screens and the flood of new web fonts coming on to the market  Or have they established their own sort of evolutionary niche that is independent of technology  In other words  have they been absorbed into the typographic mainstream  I'm not sure  but they've had a good run so far. Hey     is a good age for anything with present day rates of attrition  so I'm not complaining. Thank you. I feel so fortunate that my first job was working at the Museum of Modern Art on a retrospective of painter Elizabeth Murray. I learned so much from her. After the curator Robert Storr selected all the paintings from her lifetime body of work  I loved looking at the paintings from the     s. There were some motifs and elements that would come up again later in her life. I remember asking her what she thought of those early works. If you didn't know they were hers  you might not have been able to guess. She told me that a few didn't quite meet her own mark for what she wanted them to be. One of the works  in fact  so didn't meet her mark  she had set it out in the trash in her studio  and her neighbor had taken it because she saw its value. In that moment  my view of success and creativity changed. I realized that success is a moment  but what we're always celebrating is creativity and mastery. But this is the thing  What gets us to convert success into mastery  This is a question I've long asked myself. I think it comes when we start to value the gift of a near win. I started to understand this when I went on one cold May day to watch a set of varsity archers  all women as fate would have it  at the northern tip of Manhattan at Columbia's Baker Athletics Complex. I wanted to see what's called archer's paradox  the idea that in order to actually hit your target  you have to aim at something slightly skew from it. I stood and watched as the coach drove up these women in this gray van  and they exited with this kind of relaxed focus. One held a half eaten ice cream cone in one hand and arrows in the left with yellow fletching. And they passed me and smiled  but they sized me up as they made their way to the turf  and spoke to each other not with words but with numbers  degrees  I thought  positions for how they might plan to hit their target. I stood behind one archer as her coach stood in between us to maybe assess who might need support  and watched her  and I didn't understand how even one was going to hit the ten ring. The ten ring from the standard    yard distance  it looks as small as a matchstick tip held out at arm's length. And this is while holding    pounds of draw weight on each shot. She first hit a seven  I remember  and then a nine  and then two tens  and then the next arrow didn't even hit the target. And I saw that gave her more tenacity  and she went after it again and again. For three hours this went on. At the end of the practice  one of the archers was so taxed that she lied out on the ground just star fished  her head looking up at the sky  trying to find what T.S. Eliot might call that still point of the turning world. It's so rare in American culture  there's so little that's vocational about it anymore  to look at what doggedness looks like with this level of exactitude  what it means to align your body posture for three hours in order to hit a target  pursuing a kind of excellence in obscurity. But I stayed because I realized I was witnessing what's so rare to glimpse  that difference between success and mastery. So success is hitting that ten ring  but mastery is knowing that it means nothing if you can't do it again and again. Mastery is not just the same as excellence  though. It's not the same as success  which I see as an event  a moment in time  and a label that the world confers upon you. Mastery is not a commitment to a goal but to a constant pursuit. What gets us to do this  what get us to forward thrust more is to value the near win. How many times have we designated something a classic  a masterpiece even  while its creator considers it hopelessly unfinished  riddled with difficulties and flaws  in other words  a near win  Elizabeth Murray surprised me with her admission about her earlier paintings. Painter Paul C zanne so often thought his works were incomplete that he would deliberately leave them aside with the intention of picking them back up again  but at the end of his life  the result was that he had only signed    percent of his paintings. His favorite novel was  The  Unknown  Masterpiece  by Honor  de Balzac  and he felt the protagonist was the painter himself. Franz Kafka saw incompletion when others would find only works to praise  so much so that he wanted all of his diaries  manuscripts  letters and even sketches burned upon his death. His friend refused to honor the request  and because of that  we now have all the works we now do by Kafka   America    The Trial  and  The Castle   a work so incomplete it even stops mid sentence. The pursuit of mastery  in other words  is an ever onward almost.  Lord  grant that I desire more than I can accomplish   Michelangelo implored  as if to that Old Testament God on the Sistine Chapel  and he himself was that Adam with his finger outstretched and not quite touching that God's hand. Mastery is in the reaching  not the arriving. It's in constantly wanting to close that gap between where you are and where you want to be. Mastery is about sacrificing for your craft and not for the sake of crafting your career. How many inventors and untold entrepreneurs live out this phenomenon  We see it even in the life of the indomitable Arctic explorer Ben Saunders  who tells me that his triumphs are not merely the result of a grand achievement  but of the propulsion of a lineage of near wins. We thrive when we stay at our own leading edge. It's a wisdom understood by Duke Ellington  who said that his favorite song out of his repertoire was always the next one  always the one he had yet to compose. Part of the reason that the near win is inbuilt to mastery is because the greater our proficiency  the more clearly we might see that we don't know all that we thought we did. It's called the Dunning Kruger effect. The Paris Review got it out of James Baldwin when they asked him   What do you think increases with knowledge   and he said   You learn how little you know.  Success motivates us  but a near win can propel us in an ongoing quest. One of the most vivid examples of this comes when we look at the difference between Olympic silver medalists and bronze medalists after a competition. Thomas Gilovich and his team from Cornell studied this difference and found that the frustration silver medalists feel compared to bronze  who are typically a bit more happy to have just not received fourth place and not medaled at all  gives silver medalists a focus on follow up competition. We see it even in the gambling industry that once picked up on this phenomenon of the near win and created these scratch off tickets that had a higher than average rate of near wins and so compelled people to buy more tickets that they were called heart stoppers  and were set on a gambling industry set of abuses in Britain in the     s. The reason the near win has a propulsion is because it changes our view of the landscape and puts our goals  which we tend to put at a distance  into more proximate vicinity to where we stand. If I ask you to envision what a great day looks like next week  you might describe it in more general terms. But if I ask you to describe a great day at TED tomorrow  you might describe it with granular  practical clarity. And this is what a near win does. It gets us to focus on what  right now  we plan to do to address that mountain in our sights. It's Jackie Joyner Kersee  who in      missed taking the gold in the heptathlon by one third of a second  and her husband predicted that would give her the tenacity she needed in follow up competition. In       she won the gold in the heptathlon and set a record of       points  a score that no athlete has come very close to since. We thrive not when we've done it all  but when we still have more to do. I stand here thinking and wondering about all the different ways that we might even manufacture a near win in this room  how your lives might play this out  because I think on some gut level we do know this. We know that we thrive when we stay at our own leading edge  and it's why the deliberate incomplete is inbuilt into creation myths. In Navajo culture  some craftsmen and women would deliberately put an imperfection in textiles and ceramics. It's what's called a spirit line  a deliberate flaw in the pattern to give the weaver or maker a way out  but also a reason to continue making work. Masters are not experts because they take a subject to its conceptual end. They're masters because they realize that there isn't one. Now it occurred to me  as I thought about this  why the archery coach told me at the end of that practice  out of earshot of his archers  that he and his colleagues never feel they can do enough for their team  never feel there are enough visualization techniques and posture drills to help them overcome those constant near wins. It didn't sound like a complaint  exactly  but just a way to let me know  a kind of tender admission  to remind me that he knew he was giving himself over to a voracious  unfinished path that always required more. We build out of the unfinished idea  even if that idea is our former self. This is the dynamic of mastery. Coming close to what you thought you wanted can help you attain more than you ever dreamed you could. It's what I have to imagine Elizabeth Murray was thinking when I saw her smiling at those early paintings one day in the galleries. Even if we created utopias  I believe we would still have the incomplete. Completion is a goal  but we hope it is never the end. Thank you. Wow  this is bright. It must use a lot of power. Well  flying you all in here must have cost a bit of energy too. So the whole planet needs a lot of energy  and so far we've been running mostly on fossil fuel. We've been burning gas. It's been a good run. It got us to where we are  but we have to stop. We can't do that anymore. So we are trying different types of energy now  alternative energy  but it proved quite difficult to find something that's as convenient and as cost effective as oil  gas and coal. My personal favorite is nuclear energy. Now  it's very energy dense  it produces solid  reliable power  and it doesn't make any CO . Now we know of two ways of making nuclear energy  fission and fusion. Now in fission  you take a big nucleus  you break it in part  in two  and it makes lots of energy  and this is how the nuclear reactor today works. It works pretty good. And then there's fusion. Now  I like fusion. Fusion's much better. So you take two small nuclei  you put it together  and you make helium  and that's very nice. It makes lots of energy. This is nature's way of producing energy. The sun and all the stars in the universe run on fusion. Now  a fusion plant would actually be quite cost effective and it also would be quite safe. It only produces short term radioactive waste  and it cannot melt down. Now  the fuel from fusion comes from the ocean. In the ocean  you can extract the fuel for about one thousandth of a cent per kilowatt hour  so that's very  very cheap. And if the whole planet would run on fusion  we could extract the fuel from the ocean. It would run for billions and billions of years. Now  if fusion is so great  why don't we have it  Where is it  Well  there's always a bit of a catch. Fusion is really  really hard to do. So the problem is  those two nuclei  they are both positively charged  so they don't want to fuse. They go like this. They go like that. So in order to make them fuse  you have to throw them at each other with great speed  and if they have enough speed  they will go against the repulsion  they will touch  and they will make energy. Now  the particle speed is a measure of the temperature. So the temperature required for fusion is     billion degrees C. This is rather warm  and this is why fusion is so hard to do. Now  I caught my little fusion bug when I did my Ph.D. here at the University of British Columbia  and then I got a big job in a laser printer place making printing for the printing industry. I worked there for    years  and I got a little bit bored  and then I was     and I got a mid life crisis  you know  the usual thing  Who am I  What should I do  What should I do  What can I do  And then I was looking at my good work  and what I was doing is I was cutting the forests around here in B.C. and burying you  all of you  in millions of tons of junk mail. Now  that was not very satisfactory. So some people buy a Porsche. Others get a mistress. But I've decided to get my bit to solve global warming and make fusion happen. Now  so the first thing I did is I looked into the literature and I see  how does fusion work  So the physicists have been working on fusion for a while  and one of the ways they do it is with something called a tokamak. It's a big ring of magnetic coil  superconducting coil  and it makes a magnetic field in a ring like this  and the hot gas in the middle  which is called a plasma  is trapped. The particles go round and round and round the circle at the wall. Then they throw a huge amount of heat in there to try to cook that to fusion temperature. So this is the inside of one of those donuts  and on the right side you can see the fusion plasma in there. Now  a second way of doing this is by using laser fusion. Now in laser fusion  you have a little ping pong ball  you put the fusion fuel in the center  and you zap that with a whole bunch of laser around it. The lasers are very strong  and it squashes the ping pong ball really  really quick. And if you squeeze something hard enough  it gets hotter  and if it gets really  really fast  and they do that in one billionth of a second  it makes enough energy and enough heat to make fusion. So this is the inside of one such machine. You see the laser beam and the pellet in the center. Now  most people think that fusion is going nowhere. They always think that the physicists are in their lab and they're working hard  but nothing is happening. That's actually not quite true. This is a curve of the gain in fusion over the last    years or so  and you can see that we're making now about        times more fusion than we used to when we started. That's a pretty good gain. As a matter of fact  it's as fast as the fabled Moore's Law that defined the amount of transistors they can put on a chip. Now  this dot here is called JET  the Joint European Torus. It's a big tokamak donut in Europe  and this machine in      produced    megawatts of fusion power with    megawatts of heat. Now  you say  that's not much use  but it's actually pretty close  considering we can get about        times more than we started. The second dot here is the NIF. It's the National Ignition Facility. It's a big laser machine in the U.S.  and last month they announced with quite a bit of noise that they had managed to make more fusion energy from the fusion than the energy that they put in  the center of the ping pong ball. Now  that's not quite good enough  because the laser to put that energy in was more energy than that  but it was pretty good. Now this is ITER  pronounced in French  EE tairh. So this is a big collaboration of different countries that are building a huge magnetic donut in the south of France  and this machine  when it's finished  will produce     megawatts of fusion power with only    megawatts to make it. So this one is the real one. It's going to work. That's the kind of machine that makes energy. Now if you look at the graph  you will notice that those two dots are a little bit on the right of the curve. We kind of have fallen off the progress. Actually  the science to make those machines was really in time to produce fusion during that curve. However  there has been a bit of politics going on  and the will to do it was not there  so it drifted to the right. ITER  for example  could have been built in      or       but because it's a big international collaboration  the politics got in and it delayed it a bit. For example  it took them about three years to decide where to put it. Now  fusion is often criticized for being a little too expensive. Yes  it did cost a billion dollars or two billion dollars a year to make this progress. But you have to compare that to the cost of making Moore's Law. That cost way more than that. The result of Moore's Law is this cell phone here in my pocket. This cell phone  and the Internet behind it  cost about one trillion dollars  just so I can take a selfie and put it on Facebook. Then when my dad sees that  he'll be very proud. We also spend about     billion dollars a year in subsidies for oil and gas and renewable energy. Now  we spend one half of a percent of that on fusion. So me  personally  I don't think it's too expensive. I think it's actually been shortchanged  considering it can solve all our energy problems cleanly for the next couple of billions of years. Now I can say that  but I'm a little bit biased  because I started a fusion company and I don't even have a Facebook account. So when I started this fusion company in       I knew I couldn't fight with the big lads. They had much more resources than me. So I decided I would need to find a solution that is cheaper and faster. Now magnetic and laser fusion are pretty good machines. They are awesome pieces of technology  wonderful machines  and they have shown that fusion can be done. However  as a power plant  I don't think they're very good. They're way too big  way too complicated  way too expensive  and also  they don't deal very much with the fusion energy. When you make fusion  the energy comes out as neutrons  fast neutrons comes out of the plasma. Those neutrons hit the wall of the machine. It damages it. And also  you have to catch the heat from those neutrons and run some steam to spin a turbine somewhere  and on those machines  it was all a bit of an afterthought. So I decided that surely there is a better way of doing that. So back to the literature  and I read about the fusion everywhere. One way in particular attracted my attention  and it's called magnetized target fusion  or MTF for short. Now  in MTF  what you want to do is you take a big vat and you fill that with liquid metal  and you spin the liquid metal to open a vortex in the center  a bit like your sink. When you pull the plug on a sink  it makes a vortex. And then you have some pistons driven by pressure that goes on the outside  and this compresses the liquid metal around the plasma  and it compresses it  it gets hotter  like a laser  and then it makes fusion. So it's a bit of a mix between a magnetized fusion and the laser fusion. So those have a couple of very good advantages. The liquid metal absorbs all the neutrons and no neutrons hit the wall  and therefore there's no damage to the machine. The liquid metal gets hot  so you can pump that in a heat exchanger  make some steam  spin a turbine. So that's a very convenient way of doing this part of the process. And finally  all the energy to make the fusion happen comes from steam powered pistons  which is way cheaper than lasers or superconducting coils. Now  this was all very good except for the problem that it didn't quite work. There's always a catch. So when you compress that  the plasma cools down faster than the compression speed  so you're trying to compress it  but the plasma cooled down and cooled down and cooled down and then it did absolutely nothing. So when I saw that  I said  well  this is such a shame  because it's a very  very good idea. So hopefully I can improve on that. So I thought about it for a minute  and I said  okay  how can we make that work better  So then I thought about impact. What about if we use a big hammer and we swing it and we hit the nail like this  in the place of putting the hammer on the nail and pushing and try to put it in  That won't work. So what the idea is is to use the idea of an impact. So we accelerate the pistons with steam  that takes a little bit of time  but then  bang  you hit the piston  and  baff   all the energy is done instantly  down instantly to the liquid  and that compresses the plasma much faster. So I decided  okay  this is good  let's make that. So we built this machine in this garage here. We made a small machine that we managed to squeeze a little bit of neutrons out of that  and those are my marketing neutrons  and with those marketing neutrons  then I raised about    million dollars  and I hired    people. That's my team here. And this is what we want to build. So it's going to be a big machine  about three meters in diameter  liquid lead spinning around  big vortex in the center  put the plasma on the top and on the bottom  piston hits on the side  bang   it compresses it  and it will make some energy  and the neutron will come out in the liquid metal  going to go in a steam engine and make the turbine  and some of the steam will go back to fire the piston. We're going to run that about one time per second  and it will produce     megawatts of electricity. Okay  we also built this injector  so this injector makes the plasma to start with. It makes the plasma at about a lukewarm temperature of three million degrees C. Unfortunately  it doesn't last quite long enough  so we need to extend the life of the plasma a little bit  but last month it got a lot better  so I think we have the plasma compressing now. Then we built a small sphere  about this big     pistons around it  and this will compress the liquid. However  plasma is difficult to compress. When you compress it  it tends to go a little bit crooked like that  so you need the timing of the piston to be very good  and for that we use several control systems  which was not possible in       but we now can do that with nice  new electronics. So finally  most people think that fusion is in the future and will never happen  but as a matter of fact  fusion is getting very close. We are almost there. The big labs have shown that fusion is doable  and now there are small companies that are thinking about that  and they say  it's not that it cannot be done  but it's how to make it cost effectively. General Fusion is one of those small companies  and hopefully  very soon  somebody  someone  will crack that nut  and perhaps it will be General Fusion. Thank you very much. Scientific breakthrough  the kind that can potentially save lives  can sometimes be lying right out in the open for us to discover  in the evolved  accumulated body of human anecdote  for example  or in the time tested adaptations that we observe in the natural world around us. Science starts with observation  but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures that we might otherwise dismiss as myth or coincidence  isolate them  and test them with scientific rigor. And when we do  the results will often surprise. Western Australia has had a particular problem with shark attacks over the last three years  unfortunately and tragically culminating in five fatal shark attacks in a    month period during that time. But Western Australia is not alone in this. The incident of shark engagements on humans is escalating worldwide. And so it's not surprising  perhaps  that in July of this year  Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration with the University of Western Australia Oceans Institute made an announcement which captured the attention of the worldwide media and of ocean users worldwide  and that was around the development of technology to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack based on the science of what sharks can see. And I have for you today the story of that journey  but also the notion that science can be as powerful as a translator as it can be for invention. When we began this process  we were looking  it was about three years ago  and we'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks in Western Australia  and by chance  in a previous role  I happened to be having dinner with Harry Butler. Now Harry Butler  who most Australians would know is a famous naturalist  had spent a lot of time in the marine environment. Harry Butler is a precursor  if you like  to the late Steve Irwin. When I asked him about what the solution to the problem might be  the answer was quite surprising. He said   Take a black wetsuit  band it in yellow stripes like a bumblebee  and you'll be mimicking the warning systems of most marine species.  I didn't think about that much at the time  and it wasn't until the next three fatal shark attacks happened  and it caused me to think  maybe there's some merit to this idea. And I turned to the web to see if there might be some clues. And it turns out the web is awash with this sort of evidence that supports this sort of thinking. So biologically  there are plenty of species that display banding or patterns  warning patterns  to either be cryptical in the water or warn against being attacked  not the least of which is the pilot fish which spends a big slab of its life around the business end of a shark. On the human side  Walter Starck  an oceanographer  has been painting his wetsuit since the     s  and anthropologically  Pacific island tribes painted themselves in bands in a sea snake ceremony to ward off the shark god. So what's going on here  Is this an idea lying wide out in the open for us to consider and define  We know that sharks use a range of sensors when they engage  particularly for attack  but the sight sensor is the one that they use to identify the target  and particularly in the last number of meters before the attack. It makes sense to pay attention to the biological anecdote because that's time tested evolution over many millennia. But isn't human anecdote also an evolution of sorts  the idea that there's a kernel of truth thought to be important  passed down from generation to generation  so that it actually ends up shaping human behavior  I wanted to test this idea. I wanted to put some science to this anecdotal evidence  because if science could support this concept  then we might have at least part of the solution to shark attack right under our very nose. To do that  I needed some experts in shark vision and shark neurology  and a worldwide search  again  led to the University of W.A. on the doorstep here  with the Oceans Institute. And professor Nathan Hart and his team had just written a paper which tells us  confirms that predatory sharks see in black and white  or grayscale. So I called up Nathan  a little bit sheepishly  actually  about this idea that maybe we could use these patterns and shapes to produce a wetsuit to try and mitigate the risk of shark attack  and fortunately  he thought that was a good idea. So what ensued is a collaborative bit of research supported by the West Australian State Government. And we did three key things. The first is that we mapped the characteristics  the physical characteristics of the eyes of the three main predatory sharks  so the great white  tiger and bull shark. We did that genetically and we did that anatomically. The next thing we did was to understand  using complex computer modeling  what that eye can see at different depths  distances  light conditions  and water clarity in the ocean. And from there  we were able to pinpoint two key characteristics  what patterns and shapes would present the wearer as hidden or hard to make out in the water  cryptic  and what patterns and shapes might provide the greatest contrast but provide the greatest breakup of profile so that that person wasn't confused for shark prey or shark food. The next thing we needed to do was to convert this into wetsuits that people might actually wear  and to that end  I invited Ray Smith  a surfer  industrial designer  wetsuit designer  and in fact the guy that designed the original Quiksilver logo  to come over and sit with the science team and interpret that science into aesthetic wetsuits that people might actually wear. And here's an example of one of the first drawings. So this is what I call a  don't eat me  wetsuit. So this takes that banding idea  takes that banding idea  it's highly visible  provides a highly disruptive profile  and is intended to prevent the shark from considering that you would be ordinary food  and potentially even create confusion for the shark. And this one's configured to go with a surfboard. You can see that dark  opaque panel on the front  and it's particularly better for the surface  where being backlit and providing a silhouette is problematic. Second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit  or the one which attempts to hide the wearer in the water column. There are three panels on this suit  and in any given conditions  one or more of those panels will match the reflective spectra of the water so as to disappear fully or partially  leaving the last panel or panels to create a disruptive profile in the water column. And this one's particularly well suited to the dive configuration  so when you're deeper under the water. So we knew that we had some really solid science here. We knew  if you wanted to stand out  you needed to look stripy  and we knew if you wanted to be cryptic  you needed to look like this. But the acid test is always going to be  how would sharks really behave in the context of these patterns and shapes. And testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit in the water with a predatory shark in a natural environment is actually a lot harder than you might think. So we have to bait the rig  because we need to get the statistical number of samples through to get the scientific evidence  and by baiting the rig  we're obviously changing shark behavior. We can't put humans in the water. We're ethically precluded from even using humanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water. But nevertheless  we started the testing process in January of this year  initially with tiger sharks and subsequently with great white sharks. The way we did that was to get a perforated drum which is full of bait  wrap it in a neoprene skin  and then run two stereo underwater cameras to watch how the shark actually engages with that rig. And because we use stereo  we can capture all the statistics on how big the shark is  what angle it comes in at  how quickly it leaves  and what its behavior is in an empirical rather than a subjective way. Because we needed to preserve the scientific method  we ran a control rig which was a black neoprene rig just like a normal black wetsuit against the  what we call  SAMS technology rig. And the results were not just exciting  but very encouraging  and today I would like to just give you a snapshot of two of those engagements. So here we've got a four meter tiger shark engaging the black control rig  which it had encountered about a minute and a half before. Now that exact same shark had engaged  or encountered this SAMS rig  which is the Elude SAMS rig  about eight minutes before  and spent six minutes circling it  hunting for it  looking for what it could smell and sense but not see  and this was the final engagement. Great white sharks are more confident than the tigers  and here you see great white shark engaging a control rig  so a black neoprene wetsuit  and going straight to the bottom  coming up and engaging. In contrast to the SAMS technology rig  this is the banded one  where it's more tactile  it's more investigative  it's more apprehensive  and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go. So  it's important for us that all  the testing is done independently  and the University of W.A. is doing the testing. It'll be an ongoing process. It's subject to peer review and subject to publication. It's so important that this concept is led with the science. From the perspective of Shark  Attack Mitigation Systems  we're a biotechnology licensing company  so we don't make wetsuits ourselves. We'll license others to do that. But I thought you might be interested in seeing what SAMS technology looks like embedded in a wetsuit  and to that end  for the first time  live  worldwide    I can show you what biological adaptation  science and design looks like in real life. So I can welcome Sam  the surfer  from this side. Where are you  Sam  And Eduardo. Cheers  mate. Cheers. Thanks  gentlemen.  Applause  So what have we done here  Well  to my mind  rather than take a blank sheet and use science as a tool for invention  we've paid attention to the biological evidence  we've put importance to the human anecdotal evidence  and we've used science as a tool for translation  translation of something that was already there into something that we can  use for the benefit of mankind. And it strikes me that this idea of science as a tool for translation rather than invention is one that we can apply much more widely than this in the pursuit of innovation. After all  did the Wright brothers discover manned flight  or did they observe the biological fact of flight and translate that mechanically  replicate it in a way that humans could use  As for the humble wetsuit  who knows what oceanwear will look like in two years' time  in five years' time or in    years' time  but with this new thinking  I'm guessing there's a fair chance it won't be pure black. Thank you. A computer is an incredibly powerful means of creative expression  but for the most part  that expression is confined to the screens of our laptops and mobile phones. And I'd like to tell you a story about bringing this power of the computer to move things around and interact with us off of the screen and into the physical world in which we live. A few years ago  I got a call from a luxury fashion store called Barneys New York  and the next thing I knew  I was designing storefront kinetic sculptures for their window displays. This one's called  The Chase.  There are two pairs of shoes  a man's pair and a woman's pair  and they play out this slow  tense chase around the window in which the man scoots up behind the woman and gets in her personal space  and then she moves away. Each of the shoes has magnets in it  and there are magnets underneath the table that move the shoes around. My friend Andy Cavatorta was building a robotic harp for Bjork's Biophilia tour and I wound up building the electronics and motion control software to make the harps move and play music. The harp has four separate pendulums  and each pendulum has    strings  so the harp swings on its axis and also rotates in order to play different musical notes  and the harps are all networked together so that they can play the right notes at the right time in the music. I built an interactive chemistry exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago  and this exhibit lets people use physical objects to grab chemical elements off of the periodic table and bring them together to cause chemical reactions to happen. And the museum noticed that people were spending a lot of time with this exhibit  and a researcher from a science education center in Australia decided to study this exhibit and try to figure out what was going on. And she found that the physical objects that people were using were helping people understand how to use the exhibit  and were helping people learn in a social way. And when you think about it  this makes a lot of sense  that using specialized physical objects would help people use an interface more easily. I mean  our hands and our minds are optimized to think about and interact with tangible objects. Think about which you find easier to use  a physical keyboard or an onscreen keyboard like on a phone  But the thing that struck me about all of these different projects is that they really had to be built from scratch  down to the level of the electronics and the printed circuit boards and all the mechanisms all the way up to the software. I wanted to create something where we could move objects under computer control and create interactions around that idea without having to go through this process of building something from scratch every single time. So my first attempt at this was at the MIT Media Lab with Professor Hiroshi Ishii  and we built this array of     different electromagnets  and together they were able to move objects around on top of their surface. But the problem with this was that these magnets cost over        dollars. Although each one was pretty small  altogether they weighed so much that the table that they were on started to sag. So I wanted to build something where you could have this kind of interaction on any tabletop surface. So to explore this idea  I built an army of small robots  and each of these robots has what are called omni wheels. They're these special wheels that can move equally easily in all directions  and when you couple these robots with a video projector  you have these physical tools for interacting with digital information. So here's an example of what I mean. This is a video editing application where all of the controls for manipulating the video are physical. So if we want to tweak the color  we just enter the color mode  and then we get three different dials for tweaking the color  or if we want to adjust the audio  then we get two different dials for that  these physical objects. So here the left and right channel stay in sync  but if we want to  we can override that by grabbing both of them at the same time. So the idea is that we get the speed and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility and versatility of a system that's designed in software. And this is a mapping application for disaster response. So you have these physical objects that represent police  fire and rescue  and a dispatcher can grab them and place them on the map to tell those units where to go  and then the position of the units on the map gets synced up with the position of those units in the real world. This is a video chat application. It's amazing how much emotion you can convey with just a few simple movements of a physical object. With this interface  we open up a huge array of possibilities in between traditional board games and arcade games  where the physical possibilities of interaction make so many different styles of play possible. But one of the areas that I'm most excited about using this platform for is applying it to problems that are difficult for computers or people to solve alone. One example of those is protein folding. So here we have an interface where we have physical handles onto a protein  and we can grab those handles and try to move the protein and try to fold it in different ways. And if we move it in a way that doesn't really make sense with the underlying molecular simulation  we get this physical feedback where we can actually feel these physical handles pulling back against us. So feeling what's going on inside a molecular simulation is a whole different level of interaction. So we're just beginning to explore what's possible when we use software to control the movement of objects in our environment. Maybe this is the computer of the future. There's no touchscreen. There's no technology visible at all. But when we want to have a video chat or play a game or lay out the slides to our next TED Talk  the objects on the table come alive. Thank you. So  a few years ago I was at JFK Airport about to get on a flight  when I was approached by two women who I do not think would be insulted to hear themselves described as tiny old tough talking Italian American broads. The taller one  who is like up here  she comes marching up to me  and she goes   Honey  I gotta ask you something. You got something to do with that whole 'Eat  Pray  Love' thing that's been going on lately   And I said   Yes  I did.  And she smacks her friend and she goes   See  I told you  I said  that's that girl. That's that girl who wrote that book based on that movie.  So that's who I am. And believe me  I'm extremely grateful to be that person  because that whole  Eat  Pray  Love  thing was a huge break for me. But it also left me in a really tricky position moving forward as an author trying to figure out how in the world I was ever going to write a book again that would ever please anybody  because I knew well in advance that all of those people who had adored  Eat  Pray  Love  were going to be incredibly disappointed in whatever I wrote next because it wasn't going to be  Eat  Pray  Love   and all of those people who had hated  Eat  Pray  Love  were going to be incredibly disappointed in whatever I wrote next because it would provide evidence that I still lived. So I knew that I had no way to win  and knowing that I had no way to win made me seriously consider for a while just quitting the game and moving to the country to raise corgis. But if I had done that  if I had given up writing  I would have lost my beloved vocation  so I knew that the task was that I had to find some way to gin up the inspiration to write the next book regardless of its inevitable negative outcome. In other words  I had to find a way to make sure that my creativity survived its own success. And I did  in the end  find that inspiration  but I found it in the most unlikely and unexpected place. I found it in lessons that I had learned earlier in life about how creativity can survive its own failure. So just to back up and explain  the only thing I have ever wanted to be for my whole life was a writer. I wrote all through childhood  all through adolescence  by the time I was a teenager I was sending my very bad stories to The New Yorker  hoping to be discovered. After college  I got a job as a diner waitress  kept working  kept writing  kept trying really hard to get published  and failing at it. I failed at getting published for almost six years. So for almost six years  every single day  I had nothing but rejection letters waiting for me in my mailbox. And it was devastating every single time  and every single time  I had to ask myself if I should just quit while I was behind and give up and spare myself this pain. But then I would find my resolve  and always in the same way  by saying   I'm not going to quit  I'm going home.  And you have to understand that for me  going home did not mean returning to my family's farm. For me  going home meant returning to the work of writing because writing was my home  because I loved writing more than I hated failing at writing  which is to say that I loved writing more than I loved my own ego  which is ultimately to say that I loved writing more than I loved myself. And that's how I pushed through it. But the weird thing is that    years later  during the crazy ride of  Eat  Pray  Love   I found myself identifying all over again with that unpublished young diner waitress who I used to be  thinking about her constantly  and feeling like I was her again  which made no rational sense whatsoever because our lives could not have been more different. She had failed constantly. I had succeeded beyond my wildest expectation. We had nothing in common. Why did I suddenly feel like I was her all over again  And it was only when I was trying to unthread that that I finally began to comprehend the strange and unlikely psychological connection in our lives between the way we experience great failure and the way we experience great success. So think of it like this  For most of your life  you live out your existence here in the middle of the chain of human experience where everything is normal and reassuring and regular  but failure catapults you abruptly way out over here into the blinding darkness of disappointment. Success catapults you just as abruptly but just as far way out over here into the equally blinding glare of fame and recognition and praise. And one of these fates is objectively seen by the world as bad  and the other one is objectively seen by the world as good  but your subconscious is completely incapable of discerning the difference between bad and good. The only thing that it is capable of feeling is the absolute value of this emotional equation  the exact distance that you have been flung from yourself. And there's a real equal danger in both cases of getting lost out there in the hinterlands of the psyche. But in both cases  it turns out that there is also the same remedy for self restoration  and that is that you have got to find your way back home again as swiftly and smoothly as you can  and if you're wondering what your home is  here's a hint  Your home is whatever in this world you love more than you love yourself. So that might be creativity  it might be family  it might be invention  adventure  faith  service  it might be raising corgis  I don't know  your home is that thing to which you can dedicate your energies with such singular devotion that the ultimate results become inconsequential. For me  that home has always been writing. So after the weird  disorienting success that I went through with  Eat  Pray  Love   I realized that all I had to do was exactly the same thing that I used to have to do all the time when I was an equally disoriented failure. I had to get my ass back to work  and that's what I did  and that's how  in       I was able to publish the dreaded follow up to  Eat  Pray  Love.  And you know what happened with that book  It bombed  and I was fine. Actually  I kind of felt bulletproof  because I knew that I had broken the spell and I had found my way back home to writing for the sheer devotion of it. And I stayed in my home of writing after that  and I wrote another book that just came out last year and that one was really beautifully received  which is very nice  but not my point. My point is that I'm writing another one now  and I'll write another book after that and another and another and another and many of them will fail  and some of them might succeed  but I will always be safe from the random hurricanes of outcome as long as I never forget where I rightfully live. Look  I don't know where you rightfully live  but I know that there's something in this world that you love more than you love yourself. Something worthy  by the way  so addiction and infatuation don't count  because we all know that those are not safe places to live. Right  The only trick is that you've got to identify the best  worthiest thing that you love most  and then build your house right on top of it and don't budge from it. And if you should someday  somehow get vaulted out of your home by either great failure or great success  then your job is to fight your way back to that home the only way that it has ever been done  by putting your head down and performing with diligence and devotion and respect and reverence whatever the task is that love is calling forth from you next. You just do that  and keep doing that again and again and again  and I can absolutely promise you  from long personal experience in every direction  I can assure you that it's all going to be okay. Thank you.  Why    Why   is a question that parents ask me all the time.  Why did my child develop autism   As a pediatrician  as a geneticist  as a researcher  we try and address that question. But autism is not a single condition. It's actually a spectrum of disorders  a spectrum that ranges  for instance  from Justin  a    year old boy who's not verbal  who can't speak  who communicates by using an iPad to touch pictures to communicate his thoughts and his concerns  a little boy who  when he gets upset  will start rocking  and eventually  when he's disturbed enough  will bang his head to the point that he can actually cut it open and require stitches. That same diagnosis of autism  though  also applies to Gabriel  another    year old boy who has quite a different set of challenges. He's actually quite remarkably gifted in mathematics. He can multiple three numbers by three numbers in his head with ease  yet when it comes to trying to have a conversation  he has great difficulty. He doesn't make eye contact. He has difficulty starting a conversation  feels awkward  and when he gets nervous  he actually shuts down. Yet both of these boys have the same diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. One of the things that concerns us is whether or not there really is an epidemic of autism. These days  one in    children will be diagnosed with autism  and the question is  why does this graph look this way  Has that number been increasing dramatically over time  Or is it because we have now started labeling individuals with autism  simply giving them a diagnosis when they were still present there before yet simply didn't have that label  And in fact  in the late     s  the early     s  legislation was passed that actually provided individuals with autism with resources  with access to educational materials that would help them. With that increased awareness  more parents  more pediatricians  more educators learned to recognize the features of autism. As a result of that  more individuals were diagnosed and got access to the resources they needed. In addition  we've changed our definition over time  so in fact we've widened the definition of autism  and that accounts for some of the increased prevalence that we see. The next question everyone wonders is  what caused autism  And a common misconception is that vaccines cause autism. But let me be very clear  Vaccines do not cause autism. In fact  the original research study that suggested that was the case was completely fraudulent. It was actually retracted from the journal Lancet  in which it was published  and that author  a physician  had his medical license taken away from him. The Institute of Medicine  The Centers for Disease Control  have repeatedly investigated this and there is no credible evidence that vaccines cause autism. Furthermore  one of the ingredients in vaccines  something called thimerosal  was thought to be what the cause of autism was. That was actually removed from vaccines in the year       and you can see that it really did not have an effect in what happened with the prevalence of autism. So again  there is no evidence that this is the answer. So the question remains  what does cause autism  In fact  there's probably not one single answer. Just as autism is a spectrum  there's a spectrum of etiologies  a spectrum of causes. Based on epidemiological data  we know that one of the causes  or one of the associations  I should say  is advanced paternal age  that is  increasing age of the father at the time of conception. In addition  another vulnerable and critical period in terms of development is when the mother is pregnant. During that period  while the fetal brain is developing  we know that exposure to certain agents can actually increase the risk of autism. In particular  there's a medication  valproic acid  which mothers with epilepsy sometimes take  we know can increase that risk of autism. In addition  there can be some infectious agents that can also cause autism. And one of the things I'm going to spend a lot of time focusing on are the genes that can cause autism. I'm focusing on this not because genes are the only cause of autism  but it's a cause of autism that we can readily define and be able to better understand the biology and understand better how the brain works so that we can come up with strategies to be able to intervene. One of the genetic factors that we don't understand  however  is the difference that we see in terms of males and females. Males are affected four to one compared to females with autism  and we really don't understand what that cause is. One of the ways that we can understand that genetics is a factor is by looking at something called the concordance rate. In other words  if one sibling has autism  what's the probability that another sibling in that family will have autism  And we can look in particular at three types of siblings  identical twins  twins that actually share     percent of their genetic information and shared the same intrauterine environment  versus fraternal twins  twins that actually share    percent of their genetic information  versus regular siblings  brother sister  sister sister  also sharing    percent of their genetic information  yet not sharing the same intrauterine environment. And when you look at those concordance ratios  one of the striking things that you will see is that in identical twins  that concordance rate is    percent. Remarkably  though  it's not     percent. It is not that genes account for all of the risk for autism  but yet they account for a lot of that risk  because when you look at fraternal twins  that concordance rate is only    percent. On the other hand  there is a difference between those fraternal twins and the siblings  suggesting that there are common exposures for those fraternal twins that may not be shared as commonly with siblings alone. So this provides some of the data that autism is genetic. Well  how genetic is it  When we compare it to other conditions that we're familiar with  things like cancer  heart disease  diabetes  in fact  genetics plays a much larger role in autism than it does in any of these other conditions. But with this  that doesn't tell us what the genes are. It doesn't even tell us in any one child  is it one gene or potentially a combination of genes  And so in fact  in some individuals with autism  it is genetic  That is  that it is one single  powerful  deterministic gene that causes the autism. However  in other individuals  it's genetic  that is  that it's actually a combination of genes in part with the developmental process that ultimately determines that risk for autism. We don't know in any one person  necessarily  which of those two answers it is until we start digging deeper. So the question becomes  how can we start to identify what exactly those genes are. And let me pose something that might not be intuitive. In certain individuals  they can have autism for a reason that is genetic but yet not because of autism running in the family. And the reason is because in certain individuals  they can actually have genetic changes or mutations that are not passed down from the mother or from the father  but actually start brand new in them  mutations that are present in the egg or the sperm at the time of conception but have not been passed down generation through generation within the family. And we can actually use that strategy to now understand and to identify those genes causing autism in those individuals. So in fact  at the Simons Foundation  we took       individuals that had no family history of autism  and we took that child and their mother and father and used them to try and understand what were those genes causing autism in those cases  To do that  we actually had to comprehensively be able to look at all that genetic information and determine what those differences were between the mother  the father and the child. In doing so  I apologize  I'm going to use an outdated analogy of encyclopedias rather than Wikipedia  but I'm going to do so to try and help make the point that as we did this inventory  we needed to be able to look at massive amounts of information. Our genetic information is organized into a set of    volumes  and when we did that  we had to be able to account for each of those    volumes  because in some cases with autism  there's actually a single volume that's missing. We had to get more granular than that  though  and so we had to start opening those books  and in some cases  the genetic change was more subtle. It might have been a single paragraph that was missing  or yet  even more subtle than that  a single letter  one out of three billion letters that was changed  that was altered  yet had profound effects in terms of how the brain functions and affects behavior. In doing this within these families  we were able to account for approximately    percent of the individuals and determine that there was a single powerful genetic factor that caused autism within those families. On the other hand  there's    percent that we still haven't figured out. As we did this  though  it was really quite humbling  because we realized that there was not simply one gene for autism. In fact  the current estimates are that there are     to     different genes that can cause autism. And that explains  in part  why we see such a broad spectrum in terms of its effects. Although there are that many genes  there is some method to the madness. It's not simply random          different genes  but in fact they fit together. They fit together in a pathway. They fit together in a network that's starting to make sense now in terms of how the brain functions. We're starting to have a bottom up approach where we're identifying those genes  those proteins  those molecules  understanding how they interact together to make that neuron work  understanding how those neurons interact together to make circuits work  and understand how those circuits work to now control behavior  and understand that both in individuals with autism as well as individuals who have normal cognition. But early diagnosis is a key for us. Being able to make that diagnosis of someone who's susceptible at a time in a window where we have the ability to transform  to be able to impact that growing  developing brain is critical. And so folks like Ami Klin have developed methods to be able to take infants  small babies  and be able to use biomarkers  in this case eye contact and eye tracking  to identify an infant at risk. This particular infant  you can see  making very good eye contact with this woman as she's singing  Itsy  Bitsy Spider   in fact is not going to develop autism. This baby we know is going to be in the clear. On the other hand  this other baby is going to go on to develop autism. In this particular child  you can see  it's not making good eye contact. Instead of the eyes focusing in and having that social connection  looking at the mouth  looking at the nose  looking off in another direction  but not again socially connecting  and being able to do this on a very large scale  screen infants  screen children for autism  through something very robust  very reliable  is going to be very helpful to us in terms of being able to intervene at an early stage when we can have the greatest impact. How are we going to intervene  It's probably going to be a combination of factors. In part  in some individuals  we're going to try and use medications. And so in fact  identifying the genes for autism is important for us to identify drug targets  to identify things that we might be able to impact and can be certain that that's really what we need to do in autism. But that's not going to be the only answer. Beyond just drugs  we're going to use educational strategies. Individuals with autism  some of them are wired a little bit differently. They learn in a different way. They absorb their surroundings in a different way  and we need to be able to educate them in a way that serves them best. Beyond that  there are a lot of individuals in this room who have great ideas in terms of new technologies we can use  everything from devices we can use to train the brain to be able to make it more efficient and to compensate for areas in which it has a little bit of trouble  to even things like Google Glass. You could imagine  for instance  Gabriel  with his social awkwardness  might be able to wear Google Glass with an earpiece in his ear  and have a coach be able to help him  be able to help think about conversations  conversation starters  being able to even perhaps one day invite a girl out on a date. All of these new technologies just offer tremendous opportunities for us to be able to impact the individuals with autism  but yet we have a long way to go. As much as we know  there is so much more that we don't know  and so I invite all of you to be able to help us think about how to do this better  to use as a community our collective wisdom to be able to make a difference  and in particular  for the individuals in families with autism  I invite you to join the interactive autism network  to be part of the solution to this  because it's going to take really a lot of us to think about what's important  what's going to be a meaningful difference. As we think about something that's potentially a solution  how well does it work  Is it something that's really going to make a difference in your lives  as an individual  as a family with autism  We're going to need individuals of all ages  from the young to the old  and with all different shapes and sizes of the autism spectrum disorder to make sure that we can have an impact. So I invite all of you to join the mission and to help to be able to make the lives of individuals with autism so much better and so much richer. Thank you. The Olympic motto is  Citius  Altius  Fortius.  Faster  Higher  Stronger. And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly. The winner of the      Olympic marathon ran two hours and eight minutes. Had he been racing against the winner of the      Olympic marathon  he would have won by nearly an hour and a half. Now we all have this feeling that we're somehow just getting better as a human race  inexorably progressing  but it's not like we've evolved into a new species in a century. So what's going on here  I want to take a look at what's really behind this march of athletic progress. In       Jesse Owens held the world record in the     meters. Had Jesse Owens been racing last year in the world championships of the     meters  when Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished  Owens would have still had    feet to go. That's a lot in sprinter land. To give you a sense of how much it is  I want to share with you a demonstration conceived by sports scientist Ross Tucker. Now picture the stadium last year at the world championships of the     meters  thousands of fans waiting with baited breath to see Usain Bolt  the fastest man in history  flashbulbs popping as the nine fastest men in the world coil themselves into their blocks. And I want you to pretend that Jesse Owens is in that race. Now close your eyes for a second and picture the race. Bang  The gun goes off. An American sprinter jumps out to the front. Usain Bolt starts to catch him. Usain Bolt passes him  and as the runners come to the finish  you'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line. That's the entire finish of the race. You can open your eyes now. That first beep was Usain Bolt. That last beep was Jesse Owens. Listen to it again. When you think of it like that  it's not that big a difference  is it  And then consider that Usain Bolt started by propelling himself out of blocks down a specially fabricated carpet designed to allow him to travel as fast as humanly possible. Jesse Owens  on the other hand  ran on cinders  the ash from burnt wood  and that soft surface stole far more energy from his legs as he ran. Rather than blocks  Jesse Owens had a gardening trowel that he had to use to dig holes in the cinders to start from. Biomechanical analysis of the speed of Owens' joints shows that had been running on the same surface as Bolt  he wouldn't have been    feet behind  he would have been within one stride. Rather than the last beep  Owens would have been the second beep. Listen to it again. That's the difference track surface technology has made  and it's done it throughout the running world. Consider a longer event. In       Sir Roger Bannister became the first man to run under four minutes in the mile. Nowadays  college kids do that every year. On rare occasions  a high school kid does it. As of the end of last year        men had run under four minutes in the mile  but like Jesse Owens  Sir Roger Bannister ran on soft cinders that stole far more energy from his legs than the synthetic tracks of today. So I consulted biomechanics experts to find out how much slower it is to run on cinders than synthetic tracks  and their consensus that it's one and a half percent slower. So if you apply a one and a half percent slowdown conversion to every man who ran his sub four mile on a synthetic track  this is what happens. Only     are left. If you look at it from that perspective  fewer than ten new men per  year  have joined the sub four mile club since Sir Roger Bannister. Now      is a lot more than one  and that's partly because there are many more people training today and they're training more intelligently. Even college kids are professional in their training compared to Sir Roger Bannister  who trained for    minutes at a time while he ditched gynecology lectures in med school. And that guy who won the      Olympic marathon in three in a half hours  that guy was drinking rat poison and brandy while he ran along the course. That was his idea of a performance enhancing drug. Clearly  athletes have gotten more savvy about performance enhancing drugs as well  and that's made a difference in some sports at some times  but technology has made a difference in all sports  from faster skis to lighter shoes. Take a look at the record for the     meter freestyle swim. The record is always trending downward  but it's punctuated by these steep cliffs. This first cliff  in       is the introduction of the flip turn. Rather than stopping and turning around  athletes could somersault under the water and get going right away in the opposite direction. This second cliff  the introduction of gutters on the side of the pool that allows water to splash off  rather than becoming turbulence that impedes the swimmers as they race. This final cliff  the introduction of full body and low friction swimsuits. Throughout sports  technology has changed the face of performance. In       Eddy Merckx set the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour at    miles        feet. Now that record improved and improved as bicycles improved and became more aerodynamic all the way until       when it was set at    miles        feet  nearly five miles farther than Eddy Merckx cycled in     . But then in       the International Cycling Union decreed that anyone who wanted to hold that record had to do so with essentially the same equipment that Eddy Merckx used in     . Where does the record stand today     miles        feet  a grand total of     feet farther than Eddy Merckx cycled more than four decades ago. Essentially the entire improvement in this record was due to technology. Still  technology isn't the only thing pushing athletes forward. While indeed we haven't evolved into a new species in a century  the gene pool within competitive sports most certainly has changed. In the early half of the   th century  physical education instructors and coaches had the idea that the average body type was the best for all athletic endeavors  medium height  medium weight  no matter the sport. And this showed in athletes' bodies. In the     s  the average elite high jumper and average elite shot putter were the same exact size. But as that idea started to fade away  as sports scientists and coaches realized that rather than the average body type  you want highly specialized bodies that fit into certain athletic niches  a form of artificial selection took place  a self sorting for bodies that fit certain sports  and athletes' bodies became more different from one another. Today  rather than the same size as the average elite high jumper  the average elite shot putter is two and a half inches taller and     pounds heavier. And this happened throughout the sports world. In fact  if you plot on a height versus mass graph one data point for each of two dozen sports in the first half of the   th century  it looks like this. There's some dispersal  but it's kind of grouped around that average body type. Then that idea started to go away  and at the same time  digital technology    first radio  then television and the Internet    gave millions  or in some cases billions  of people a ticket to consume elite sports performance. The financial incentives and fame and glory afforded elite athletes skyrocketed  and it tipped toward the tiny upper echelon of performance. It accelerated the artificial selection for specialized bodies. And if you plot a data point for these same two dozen sports today  it looks like this. The athletes' bodies have gotten much more different from one another. And because this chart looks like the charts that show the expanding universe  with the galaxies flying away from one another  the scientists who discovered it call it  The Big Bang of Body Types.  In sports where height is prized  like basketball  the tall athletes got taller. In       the National Basketball Association signed a groundbreaking agreement making players partners in the league  entitled to shares of ticket revenues and television contracts. Suddenly  anybody who could be an NBA player wanted to be  and teams started scouring the globe for the bodies that could help them win championships. Almost overnight  the proportion of men in the NBA who are at least seven feet tall doubled to    percent. Today  one in    men in the NBA is at least seven feet tall  but a seven foot tall man is incredibly rare in the general population    so rare that if you know an American man between the ages of    and    who is at least seven feet tall  there's a    percent chance he's in the NBA right now. That is  find six honest seven footers  one is in the NBA right now. And that's not the only way that NBA players' bodies are unique. This is Leonardo da Vinci's  Vitruvian Man   the ideal proportions  with arm span equal to height. My arm span is exactly equal to my height. Yours is probably very nearly so. But not the average NBA player. The average NBA player is a shade under  '    with arms that are seven feet long. Not only are NBA players ridiculously tall  they are ludicrously long. Had Leonardo wanted to draw the Vitruvian NBA Player  he would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse  not a circle and a square. So in sports where large size is prized  the large athletes have gotten larger. Conversely  in sports where diminutive stature is an advantage  the small athletes got smaller. The average elite female gymnast shrunk from  '   to  '   on average over the last    years  all the better for their power to weight ratio and for spinning in the air. And while the large got larger and the small got smaller  the weird got weirder. The average length of the forearm of a water polo player in relation to their total arm got longer  all the better for a forceful throwing whip. And as the large got larger  small got smaller  and the weird weirder. In swimming  the ideal body type is a long torso and short legs. It's like the long hull of a canoe for speed over the water. And the opposite is advantageous in running. You want long legs and a short torso. And this shows in athletes' bodies today. Here you see Michael Phelps  the greatest swimmer in history  standing next to Hicham El Guerrouj  the world record holder in the mile. These men are seven inches different in height  but because of the body types advantaged in their sports  they wear the same length pants. Seven inches difference in height  these men have the same length legs. Now in some cases  the search for bodies that could push athletic performance forward ended up introducing into the competitive world populations of people that weren't previously competing at all  like Kenyan distance runners. We think of Kenyans as being great marathoners. Kenyans think of the Kalenjin tribe as being great marathoners. The Kalenjin make up just    percent of the Kenyan population but the vast majority of elite runners. And they happen  on average  to have a certain unique physiology  legs that are very long and very thin at their extremity  and this is because they have their ancestry at very low latitude in a very hot and dry climate  and an evolutionary adaptation to that is limbs that are very long and very thin at the extremity for cooling purposes. It's the same reason that a radiator has long coils  to increase surface area compared to volume to let heat out  and because the leg is like a pendulum  the longer and thinner it is at the extremity  the more energy efficient it is to swing. To put Kalenjin running success in perspective  consider that    American men in history have run faster than two hours and    minutes in the marathon. That's a four minute and    second per mile pace. Thirty two Kalenjin men did that last October. That's from a source population the size of metropolitan Atlanta. Still  even changing technology and the changing gene pool in sports don't account for all of the changes in performance. Athletes have a different mindset than they once did. Have you ever seen in a movie when someone gets an electrical shock and they're thrown across a room  There's no explosion there. What's happening when that happens is that the electrical impulse is causing all their muscle fibers to twitch at once  and they're throwing themselves across the room. They're essentially jumping. That's the power that's contained in the human body. But normally we can't access nearly all of it. Our brain acts as a limiter  preventing us from accessing all of our physical resources  because we might hurt ourselves  tearing tendons or ligaments. But the more we learn about how that limiter functions  the more we learn how we can push it back just a bit  in some cases by convincing the brain that the body won't be in mortal danger by pushing harder. Endurance and ultra endurance sports serve as a great example. Ultra endurance was once thought to be harmful to human health  but now we realize that we have all these traits that are perfect for ultra endurance  no body fur and a glut of sweat glands that keep us cool while running  narrow waists and long legs compared to our frames  large surface area of joints for shock absorption. We have an arch in our foot that acts like a spring  short toes that are better for pushing off than for grasping tree limbs  and when we run  we can turn our torso and our shoulders like this while keeping our heads straight. Our primate cousins can't do that. They have to run like this. And we have big old butt muscles that keep us upright while running. Have you ever looked at an ape's butt  They have no buns because they don't run upright. And as athletes have realized that we're perfectly suited for ultra endurance  they've taken on feats that would have been unthinkable before  athletes like Spanish endurance racer K lian Jornet. Here's K lian running up the Matterhorn. With a sweatshirt there tied around his waist. It's so steep he can't even run here. He's pulling up on a rope. This is a vertical ascent of more than       feet  and K lian went up and down in under three hours. Amazing. And talented though he is  K lian is not a physiological freak. Now that he has done this  other athletes will follow  just as other athletes followed after Sir Roger Bannister ran under four minutes in the mile. Changing technology  changing genes  and a changing mindset. Innovation in sports  whether that's new track surfaces or new swimming techniques  the democratization of sport  the spread to new bodies and to new populations around the world  and imagination in sport  an understanding of what the human body is truly capable of  have conspired to make athletes stronger  faster  bolder  and better than ever. Thank you very much. There are    million people in the world who are blind. Eighty percent of them are living in low income countries such as Kenya  and the absolute majority do not need to be blind. They are blind from diseases that are either completely curable or preventable. Knowing this  with my young family  we moved to Kenya. We secured equipment  funds  vehicles  we trained a team  we set up a hundred clinics throughout the Great Rift Valley to try and understand a single question  why are people going blind  and what can we do  The challenges were great. When we got to where we were going  we set up our high tech equipment. Power was rarely available. We'd have to run our equipment from petrol power generators. And then something occurred to me  There has to be an easier way  because it's the patients who are the most in need of access to eye care who are the least likely to get it. More people in Kenya  and in sub Saharan Africa  have access to a mobile phone than they do clean running water. So we said  could we harness the power of mobile technology to deliver eye care in a new way  And so we developed Peek  a smartphone  system  that enables community healthcare workers and empowers them to deliver eye care everywhere. We set about replacing traditional hospital equipment  which is bulky  expensive and fragile  with smartphone apps and hardware that make it possible to test anyone in any language and of any age. Here we have a demonstration of a three month old having their vision accurately tested using an app and an eye tracker. We've got many trials going on in the community and in schools  and through the lessons that we've learned in the field  we've realized it's extremely important to share the data in non medical jargon so that people understand what we're examining and what that means to them. So here  for example  we use our sight sim application  once your vision has been measured  to show carers and teachers what the visual world is like for that person  so they can empathize with them and help them. Once we've discovered somebody has low vision  the next big challenge is to work out why  and to be able to do that  we need to have access to the inside of the eye. Traditionally  this requires expensive equipment to examine an area called the retina. The retina is the single part of the eye that has huge amounts of information about the body and its health. We've developed  D printed  low cost hardware that comes in at less than five dollars to produce  which can then be clipped onto a smartphone and makes it possible to get views of the back of the eye of a very high quality. And the beauty is  anybody can do it. In our trials on over two and half thousand people  the smartphone with the add on clip is comparable to a camera that is hugely more expensive and hugely more difficult to transport. When we first moved to Kenya  we went with         dollars of equipment  a team of    people  and that was what was needed to deliver health care. Now  all that's needed is a single person on a bike with a smartphone. And it costs just     dollars. The issue of power supply is overcome by harnessing the power of solar. Our healthcare workers travel with a solar powered rucksack which keeps the phone charged and backed up. Now we go to the patient rather than waiting for the patient never to come. We go to them in their homes and we give them the most comprehensive  high tech  accurate examination  which can be delivered by anyone with minimal training. We can link global experts with people in the most rural  difficult to reach places that are beyond the end of the road  effectively putting those experts in their homes  allowing us to make diagnoses and make plans for treatment. Project managers  hospital directors  are able to search on our interface by any parameter they may be interested in. Here in Nakuru  where I've been living  we can search for people by whatever condition. Here are people who are blind from a curable condition cataract. Each red pin depicts somebody who is blind from a disease that is curable and treatable  and they're locatable. We can use bulk text messaging services to explain that we're coming to arrange a treatment. What's more  we've learned that this is something that we haven't built just for the community but with the community. Those blue pins that drop represent elders  or local leaders  that are connected to those people who can ensure that we can find them and arrange treatment. So for patients like Mama Wangari  who have been blind for over    years and never seen her grandchildren  for less than    dollars  we can restore her eyesight. This is something that has to happen. It's only in statistics that people go blind by the millions. The reality is everyone goes blind on their own. But now  they might just be a text message away from help. And now because live demos are always a bad idea  we're going to try a live demo. So here we have the Peek Vision app. Okay  and what we're looking at here  this is Sam's optic nerve  which is a direct extension of her brain  so I'm actually looking at her brain as we look there. We can see all parts of the retina. It makes it possible to pick up diseases of the eye and of the body that would not be possible without access to the eye  and that clip on device can be manufactured for just a few dollars  and people can be cured of blindness  and I think it says a lot about us as a human race if we've developed cures and we don't deliver them. But now we can. Thank you.
