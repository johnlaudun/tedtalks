Code is the next universal language. In the seventies  it was punk music that drove the whole generation. In the eighties  it was probably money. But for my generation of people  software is the interface to our imagination and our world. And that means that we need a radically  radically more diverse set of people to build those products  to not see computers as mechanical and lonely and boring and magic  to see them as things that they can tinker and turn around and twist  and so forth. My personal journey into the world of programming and technology started at the tender age of   . I had this mad teenage crush on an older man  and the older man in question just happened to be the then Vice President of the United States  Mr. Al Gore. And I did what every single teenage girl would want to do. I wanted to somehow express all of this love  so I built him a website  it's over here. And in       there was no Tumblr  there was no Facebook  there was no Pinterest. So I needed to learn to code in order to express all of this longing and loving. And that is how programming started for me. It started as a means of self expression. Just like when I was smaller  I would use crayons and legos. And when I was older  I would use guitar lessons and theater plays. But then  there were other things to get excited about  like poetry and knitting socks and conjugating French irregular verbs and coming up with make believe worlds and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy. And I started to be one of those people who felt that computers are boring and technical and lonely. Here's what I think today. Little girls don't know that they are not supposed to like computers. Little girls are amazing. They are really  really good at concentrating on things and being exact and they ask amazing questions like   What   and  Why   and  How   and  What if   And they don't know that they are not supposed to like computers. It's the parents who do. It's us parents who feel like computer science is this esoteric  weird science discipline that only belongs to the mystery makers. That it's almost as far removed from everyday life as  say  nuclear physics. And they are partly right about that. There's a lot of syntax and controls and data structures and algorithms and practices  protocols and paradigms in programming. And we as a community  we've made computers smaller and smaller. We've built layers and layers of abstraction on top of each other between the man and the machine to the point that we no longer have any idea how computers work or how to talk to them. And we do teach our kids how the human body works  we teach them how the combustion engine functions and we even tell them that if you want to really be an astronaut you can become one. But when the kid comes to us and asks   So  what is a bubble sort algorithm   Or   How does the computer know what happens when I press 'play ' how does it know which video to show   Or   Linda  is Internet a place   We adults  we grow oddly silent.  It's magic   some of us say.  It's too complicated   the others say. Well  it's neither. It's not magic and it's not complicated. It all just happened really  really  really fast. Computer scientists built these amazing  beautiful machines  but they made them very  very foreign to us  and also the language we speak to the computers so that we don't know how to speak to the computers anymore without our fancy user interfaces. And that's why no one recognized that when I was conjugating French irregular verbs  I was actually practicing my pattern recognition skills. And when I was excited about knitting  I actually was following a sequence of symbolic commands that included loops inside of them. And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest to find an exact language between English and mathematics found its home inside of a computer. I was a programmer  but no one knew it. The kids of today  they tap  swipe and pinch their way through the world. But unless we give them tools to build with computers  we are raising only consumers instead of creators. This whole quest led me to this little girl. Her name is Ruby  she is six years old. She is completely fearless  imaginative and a little bit bossy. And every time I would run into a problem in trying to teach myself programming like   What is object oriented design or what is garbage collection    I would try to imagine how a six year old little girl would explain the problem. And I wrote a book about her and I illustrated it and the things Ruby taught me go like this. Ruby taught me that you're not supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed. And even the biggest of the problems are a group of tiny problems stuck together. And Ruby also introduced me to her friends  the colorful side of the Internet culture. She has friends like the Snow Leopard  who is beautiful but doesn't want to play with the other kids. And she has friends like the green robots that are really friendly but super messy. And she has friends like Linux the penguin who's really ruthlessly efficient  but somewhat hard to understand. And idealistic foxes  and so on. In Ruby's world  you learn technology through play. And  for instance  computers are really good at repeating stuff  so the way Ruby would teach loops goes like this. This is Ruby's favorite dance move  it goes   Clap  clap  stomp  stomp clap  clap and jump.  And you learn counter loops by repeating that four times. And you learn while loops by repeating that sequence while I'm standing on one leg. And you learn until loops by repeating that sequence until mom gets really mad. And most of all  you learn that there are no ready answers. When coming up with the curriculum for Ruby's world  I needed to really ask the kids how they see the world and what kind of questions they have and I would organize play testing sessions. I would start by showing the kids these four pictures. I would show them a picture of a car  a grocery store  a dog and a toilet. And I would ask   Which one of these do you think is a computer   And the kids would be very conservative and go   None of these is a computer. I know what a computer is  it's that glowing box in front of which mom or dad spends way too much time.  But then we would talk and we would discover that actually  a car is a computer  it has a navigation system inside of it. And a dog    a dog might not be a computer  but it has a collar and the collar might have a computer inside of it. And grocery stores  they have so many different kinds of computers  like the cashier system and the burglar alarms. And kids  you know what  In Japan  toilets are computers and there's even hackers who hack them. And we go further and I give them these little stickers with an on off button on them. And I tell the kids   Today you have this magic ability to make anything in this room into a computer.  And again  the kids go   Sounds really hard  I don't know the right answer for this.  But I tell them   Don't worry  your parents don't know the right answer  either. They've just started to hear about this thing called The Internet of Things. But you kids  you are going to be the ones who are really going to live up in a world where everything is a computer.  And then I had this little girl who came to me and took a bicycle lamp and she said   This bicycle lamp  if it were a computer  it would change colors.  And I said   That's a really good idea  what else could it do   And she thinks and she thinks  and she goes   If this bicycle lamp were a computer  we could go on a biking trip with my father and we would sleep in a tent and this biking lamp could also be a movie projector.  And that's the moment I'm looking for  the moment when the kid realizes that the world is definitely not ready yet  that a really awesome way of making the world more ready is by building technology and that each one of us can be a part of that change. Final story  we also built a computer. And we got to know the bossy CPU and the helpful RAM and ROM that help it remember things. And after we've assembled our computer together  we also design an application for it. And my favorite story is this little boy  he's six years old and his favorite thing in the world is to be an astronaut. And the boy  he has these huge headphones on and he's completely immersed in his tiny paper computer because you see  he's built his own intergalactic planetary navigation application. And his father  the lone astronaut in the Martian orbit  is on the other side of the room and the boy's important mission is to bring the father safely back to earth. And these kids are going to have a profoundly different view of the world and the way we build it with technology. Finally  the more approachable  the more inclusive  and the more diverse we make the world of technology  the more colorful and better the world will look like. So  imagine with me  for a moment  a world where the stories we tell about how things get made don't only include the twentysomething year old Silicon Valley boys  but also Kenyan schoolgirls and Norwegian librarians. Imagine a world where the little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow  who live in a permanent reality of  s and  s  they grow up to be very optimistic and brave about technology. They embrace the powers and the opportunities and the limitations of the world. A world of technology that is wonderful  whimsical and a tiny bit weird. When I was a girl  I wanted to be a storyteller. I loved make believe worlds and my favorite thing to do was to wake up in the mornings in Moominvalley. In the afternoons  I would roam around the Tatooines. And in the evenings  I would go to sleep in Narnia. And programming turned out to be the perfect profession for me. I still create worlds. Instead of stories  I do them with code. Programming gives me this amazing power to build my whole little universe with its own rules and paradigms and practices. Create something out of nothing with the pure power of logic. Thank you. As a boy in Lima  my grandfather told me a legend of the Spanish conquest of Peru. Atahualpa  emperor of the Inca  had been captured and killed. Pizarro and his conquistadors had grown rich  and tales of their conquest and glory had reached Spain and was bringing new waves of Spaniards  hungry for gold and glory. They would go into towns and ask the Inca   Where's another civilization we can conquer  Where's more gold   And the Inca  out of vengeance  told them   Go to the Amazon. You'll find all the gold you want there. In fact  there is a city called Paititi    El Dorado in Spanish    made entirely of gold.  The Spanish set off into the jungle  but the few that return come back with stories  stories of powerful shamans  of warriors with poisoned arrows  of trees so tall they blotted out the sun  spiders that ate birds  snakes that swallowed men whole and a river that boiled. All this became a childhood memory. And years passed. I'm working on my PhD at SMU  trying to understand Peru's geothermal energy potential  when I remember this legend  and I began asking that question. Could the boiling river exist  I asked colleagues from universities  the government  oil  gas and mining companies  and the answer was a unanimous no. And this makes sense. You see  boiling rivers do exist in the world  but they're generally associated with volcanoes. You need a powerful heat source to produce such a large geothermal manifestation. And as you can see from the red dots here  which are volcanoes  we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon  nor in most of Peru. So it follows  We should not expect to see a boiling river. Telling this same story at a family dinner  my aunt tells me   But no  Andr s  I've been there. I've swum in that river.  Then my uncle jumps in.  No  Andr s  she's not kidding. You see  you can only swim in it after a very heavy rain  and it's protected by a powerful shaman. Your aunt  she's friends with his wife.    C mo     Huh    You know  despite all my scientific skepticism  I found myself hiking into the jungle  guided by my aunt  over     kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center  and well  honestly  mentally preparing myself to behold the legendary  warm stream of the Amazon.  But then ... I heard something  a low surge that got louder and louder as we came closer. It sounded like ocean waves constantly crashing  and as we got closer  I saw smoke  vapor  coming up through the trees. And then  I saw this. I immediately grabbed for my thermometer  and the average temperatures in the river were    degrees C. This is not quite the     degree C boiling but definitely close enough. The river flowed hot and fast. I followed it upriver and was led by  actually  the shaman's apprentice to the most sacred site on the river. And this is what's bizarre    It starts off as a cold stream. And here  at this site  is the home of the Yacumama  mother of the waters  a giant serpent spirit who births hot and cold water. And here we find a hot spring  mixing with cold stream water underneath her protective motherly jaws and thus bringing their legends to life. The next morning  I woke up and    I asked for tea. I was handed a mug  a tea bag and  well  pointed towards the river. To my surprise  the water was clean and had a pleasant taste  which is a little weird for geothermal systems. What was amazing is that the locals had always known about this place  and that I was by no means the first outsider to see it. It was just part of their everyday life. They drink its water. They take in its vapor. They cook with it  clean with it  even make their medicines with it. I met the shaman  and he seemed like an extension of the river and his jungle. He asked for my intentions and listened carefully. Then  to my tremendous relief    I was freaking out  to be honest with you    a smile began to snake across his face  and he just laughed. I had received the shaman's blessing to study the river  on the condition that after I take the water samples and analyze them in my lab  wherever I was in the world  that I pour the waters back into the ground so that  as the shaman said  the waters could find their way back home. I've been back every year since that first visit in       and the fieldwork has been exhilarating  demanding and at times dangerous. One story was even featured in National Geographic Magazine. I was trapped on a small rock about the size of a sheet of paper in sandals and board shorts  in between an    degree C river and a hot spring that  well  looked like this  close to boiling. And on top of that  it was Amazon rain forest. Pshh  pouring rain  couldn't see a thing. The temperature differential made it all white. It was a whiteout. Intense. Now  after years of work  I'll soon be submitting my geophysical and geochemical studies for publication. And I'd like to share  today  with all of you here  on the TED stage  for the first time  some of these discoveries. Well  first off  it's not a legend. Surprise  When I first started the research  the satellite imagery was too low resolution to be meaningful. There were just no good maps. Thanks to the support of the Google Earth team  I now have this. Not only that  the indigenous name of the river  Shanay timpishka   boiled with the heat of the sun   indicating that I'm not the first to wonder why the river boils  and showing that humanity has always sought to explain the world around us. So why does the river boil  It actually took me three years to get that footage. Fault fed hot springs. As we have hot blood running through our veins and arteries  so  too  the earth has hot water running through its cracks and faults. Where these arteries come to the surface  these earth arteries  we'll get geothermal manifestations  fumaroles  hot springs and in our case  the boiling river. What's truly incredible  though  is the scale of this place. Next time you cross the road  think about this. The river flows wider than a two lane road along most of its path. It flows hot for  .   kilometers. Truly impressive. There are thermal pools larger than this TED stage  and that waterfall that you see there is six meters tall    and all with near boiling water. We mapped the temperatures along the river  and this was by far the most demanding part of the fieldwork. And the results were just awesome. Sorry    the geoscientist in me coming out. And it showed this amazing trend. You see  the river starts off cold. It then heats up  cools back down  heats up  cools back down  heats up again  and then has this beautiful decay curve until it smashes into this cold river. Now  I understand not all of you are geothermal scientists  so to put it in more everyday terms  Everyone loves coffee. Yes  Good. Your regular cup of coffee     degrees C  an extra hot one  well    . So  put in coffee shop terms  the boiling river plots like this. There you have your hot coffee. Here you have your extra hot coffee  and you can see that there's a bit point there where the river is still hotter than even the extra hot coffee. And these are average water temperatures. We took these in the dry season to ensure the purest geothermal temperatures. But there's a magic number here that's not being shown  and that number is    degrees C  because that's where things start to hurt  and I know this from very personal experience. Above that temperature  you don't want to get in that water. You need to be careful. It can be deadly. I've seen all sorts of animals fall in  and what's shocking to me  is the process is pretty much the same. So they fall in and the first thing to go are the eyes. Eyes  apparently  cook very quickly. They turn this milky white color. The stream is carrying them. They're trying to swim out  but their meat is cooking on the bone because it's so hot. So they're losing power  losing power  until finally they get to a point where hot water goes into their mouths and they cook from the inside out. A bit sadistic  aren't we  Jeez. Leave them marinating for a little longer. What's  again  amazing are these temperatures. They're similar to things that I've seen on volcanoes all over the world and even super volcanoes like Yellowstone. But here's the thing  the data is showing that the boiling river exists independent of volcanism. It's neither magmatic or volcanic in origin  and again  over     kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center. How can a boiling river exist like this  I've asked geothermal experts and volcanologists for years  and I'm still unable to find another non volcanic geothermal system of this magnitude. It's unique. It's special on a global scale. So  still    how does it work  Where do we get this heat  There's still more research to be done to better constrain the problem and better understand the system  but from what the data is telling us now  it looks to be the result of a large hydrothermal system. Basically  it works like this  So  the deeper you go into the earth  the hotter it gets. We refer to this as the geothermal gradient. The waters could be coming from as far away as glaciers in the Andes  then seeping down deep into the earth and coming out to form the boiling river after getting heated up from the geothermal gradient  all due to this unique geologic setting. Now  we found that in and around the river    this is working with colleagues from National Geographic  Dr. Spencer Wells  and Dr. Jon Eisen from UC Davis    we genetically sequenced the extremophile lifeforms living in and around the river  and have found new lifeforms  unique species living in the boiling river. But again  despite all of these studies  all of these discoveries and the legends  a question remains  What is the significance of the boiling river  What is the significance of this stationary cloud that always hovers over this patch of jungle  And what is the significance of a detail in a childhood legend  To the shaman and his community  it's a sacred site. To me  as a geoscientist  it's a unique geothermal phenomenon. But to the illegal loggers and cattle farmers  it's just another resource to exploit. And to the Peruvian government  it's just another stretch of unprotected land ready for development. My goal is to ensure that whoever controls this land understands the boiling river's uniqueness and significance. Because that's the question  one of significance. And the thing there is  we define significance. It's us. We have that power. We are the ones who draw that line between the sacred and the trivial. And in this age  where everything seems mapped  measured and studied  in this age of information  I remind you all that discoveries are not just made in the black void of the unknown but in the white noise of overwhelming data. There remains so much to explore. We live in an incredible world. So go out. Be curious. Because we do live in a world where shamans still sing to the spirits of the jungle  where rivers do boil and where legends do come to life. Thank you very much. When I was first learning to meditate  the instruction was to simply pay attention to my breath  and when my mind wandered  to bring it back. Sounded simple enough. Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats  sweating through T shirts in the middle of winter. I'd take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work. Actually  it was exhausting. The instruction was simple enough but I was missing something really important. So why is it so hard to pay attention  Well  studies show that even when we're really trying to pay attention to something    like maybe this talk    at some point  about half of us will drift off into a daydream  or have this urge to check our Twitter feed. So what's going on here  It turns out that we're fighting one of the most evolutionarily conserved learning processes currently known in science  one that's conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known to man. This reward based learning process is called positive and negative reinforcement  and basically goes like this. We see some food that looks good  our brain says   Calories  ... Survival   We eat the food  we taste it    it tastes good. And especially with sugar  our bodies send a signal to our brain that says   Remember what you're eating and where you found it.  We lay down this context dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time. See food  eat food  feel good  repeat. Trigger  behavior  reward. Simple  right  Well  after a while  our creative brains say   You know what  You can use this for more than just remembering where food is. You know  next time you feel bad  why don't you try eating something good so you'll feel better   We thank our brains for the great idea  try this and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream when we're mad or sad  we feel better. Same process  just a different trigger. Instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach  this emotional signal    feeling sad    triggers that urge to eat. Maybe in our teenage years  we were a nerd at school  and we see those rebel kids outside smoking and we think   Hey  I want to be cool.  So we start smoking. The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork  and that was no accident. See cool  smoke to be cool  feel good. Repeat. Trigger  behavior  reward. And each time we do this  we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit. So later  feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet. Now  with these same brain processes  we've gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves with these habits. Obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. So back to my breath. What if instead of fighting our brains  or trying to force ourselves to pay attention  we instead tapped into this natural  reward based learning process ... but added a twist  What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience  I'll give you an example. In my lab  we studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking. Now  just like trying to force myself to pay attention to my breath  they could try to force themselves to quit smoking. And the majority of them had tried this before and failed    on average  six times. Now  with mindfulness training  we dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious. In fact  we even told them to smoke. What  Yeah  we said   Go ahead and smoke  just be really curious about what it's like when you do.  And what did they notice  Well here's an example from one of our smokers. She said   Mindful smoking  smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals  YUCK   Now  she knew  cognitively that smoking was bad for her  that's why she joined our program. What she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes like shit. Now  she moved from knowledge to wisdom. She moved from knowing in her head that smoking was bad for her to knowing it in her bones  and the spell of smoking was broken. She started to become disenchanted with her behavior. Now  the prefrontal cortex  that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective  it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke. And it tries it's hardest to help us change our behavior  to help us stop smoking  to help us stop eating that second  that third  that fourth cookie. We call this cognitive control. We're using cognition to control our behavior. Unfortunately  this is also the first part of our brain that goes offline when we get stressed out  which isn't that helpful. Now  we can all relate to this in our own experience. We're much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids when we're stressed out or tired  even though we know it's not going to be helpful. We just can't help ourselves. When the prefrontal cortex goes offline  we fall back into our old habits  which is why this disenchantment is so important. Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them at a deeper level    to know it in our bones so we don't have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior. We're just less interested in doing it in the first place. And this is what mindfulness is all about  Seeing really clearly what we get when we get caught up in our behaviors  becoming disenchanted on a visceral level and from this disenchanted stance  naturally letting go. This isn't to say that  poof  magically we quit smoking. But over time  as we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our actions  we let go of old habits and form new ones. The paradox here is that mindfulness is just about being really interested in getting close and personal with what's actually happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment. This willingness to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant cravings go away as quickly as possible. And this willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity  which is naturally rewarding. What does curiosity feel like  It feels good. And what happens when we get curious  We start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations    oh  there's tightness  there's tension  there's restlessness    and that these body sensations come and go. These are bite size pieces of experiences that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered by this huge  scary craving that we choke on. In other words  when we get curious  we step out of our old  fear based  reactive habit patterns  and we step into being. We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting that next data point. Now  this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior. But in one study  we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking. So it actually works. And when we studied the brains of experienced meditators  we found that parts of a neural network of self referential processing called the default mode network were at play. Now  one current hypothesis is that a region of this network  called the posterior cingulate cortex  is activated not necessarily by craving itself but when we get caught up in it  when we get sucked in  and it takes us for a ride. In contrast  when we let go    step out of the process just by being curiously aware of what's happening    this same brain region quiets down. Now we're testing app and online based mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms and  ironically  use the same technology that's driving us to distraction to help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking  of stress eating and other addictive behaviors. Now  remember that bit about context dependent memory  We can deliver these tools to peoples' fingertips in the contexts that matter most. So we can help them tap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware right when that urge to smoke or stress eat or whatever arises. So if you don't smoke or stress eat  maybe the next time you feel this urge to check your email when you're bored  or you're trying to distract yourself from work  or maybe to compulsively respond to that text message when you're driving  see if you can tap into this natural capacity  just be curiously aware of what's happening in your body and mind in that moment. It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops ... or step out of it. Instead of see text message  compulsively text back  feel a little bit better    notice the urge  get curious  feel the joy of letting go and repeat. Thank you. You may never have heard of Kenema  Sierra Leone or Arua  Nigeria. But I know them as two of the most extraordinary places on earth. In hospitals there  there's a community of nurses  physicians and scientists that have been quietly battling one of the deadliest threats to humanity for years  Lassa virus. Lassa virus is a lot like Ebola. It can cause a severe fever and can often be fatal. But these individuals  they risk their lives every day to protect the individuals in their communities  and by doing so  protect us all. But one of the most extraordinary things I learned about them on one of my first visits out there many years ago was that they start each morning    these challenging  extraordinary days on the front lines    by singing. They gather together  and they show their joy. They show their spirit. And over the years  from year after year as I've visited them and they've visited me  I get to gather with them and I sing and we write and we love it  because it reminds us that we're not just there to pursue science together  we're bonded through a shared humanity. And that of course  as you can imagine  becomes extremely important  even essential  as things begin to change. And that changed a great deal in March of       when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea. This is the first outbreak in West Africa  near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia. And it was frightening  frightening for us all. We had actually suspected for some time that Lassa and Ebola were more widespread than thought  and we thought it could one day come to Kenema. And so members of my team immediately went out and joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team there  and we set up diagnostics to be able to have sensitive molecular tests to pick up Ebola if it came across the border and into Sierra Leone. We'd already set up this kind of capacity for Lassa virus  we knew how to do it  the team is outstanding. We just had to give them the tools and place to survey for Ebola. And unfortunately  that day came. On May           a woman checked into the maternity ward at the hospital  and the team ran those important molecular tests and they identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone. This was an exceptional work that was done. They were able to diagnose the case immediately  to safely treat the patient and to begin to do contact tracing to follow what was going on. It could've stopped something. But by the time that day came  the outbreak had already been breeding for months. With hundreds of cases  it had already eclipsed all previous outbreaks. And it came into Sierra Leone not as that singular case  but as a tidal wave. We had to work with the international community  with the Ministry of Health  with Kenema  to begin to deal with the cases  as the next week brought     then     then     cases    all coming to Kenema  one of the only places in Sierra Leone that could deal with this. And we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could  trying to help the individuals  trying to get attention  but we also did one other simple thing. From that specimen that we take from a patient's blood to detect Ebola  we can discard it  obviously. The other thing we can do is  actually  put in a chemical and deactivate it  so just place it into a box and ship it across the ocean  and that's what we did. We sent it to Boston  where my team works. And we also worked around the clock doing shift work  day after day  and we quickly generated    genomes of the Ebola virus. This is the blueprint    the genome of a virus is the blueprint. We all have one. It says everything that makes up us  and it tells us so much information. The results of this kind of work are simple and they're powerful. We could actually take these    different viruses  look at them and compare them  and we could see  actually  compared to three genomes that had been previously published from Guinea  we could show that the outbreak emerged in Guinea months before  once into the human population  and from there had been transmitting from human to human. Now  that's incredibly important when you're trying to figure out how to intervene  but the important thing is contact tracing. We also could see that as the virus was moving between humans  it was mutating. And each of those mutations are so important  because the diagnostics  the vaccines  the therapies that we're using  are all based on that genome sequence  fundamentally    that's what drives it. And so global health experts would need to respond  would have to develop  to recalibrate everything that they were doing. But the way that science works  the position I was in at that point is  I had the data  and I could have worked in a silo for many  many months  analyzed the data carefully  slowly  submitted the paper for publication  gone through a few back and forths  and then finally when the paper came out  might release that data. That's the way the status quo works. Well  that was not going to work at this point  right  We had friends on the front lines and to us it was just obvious that what we needed is help  lots of help. So the first thing we did is  as soon as the sequences came off the machines  we published it to the web. We just released it to the whole world and said   Help us.  And help came. Before we knew it  we were being contacted from people all over  surprised to see the data out there and released. Some of the greatest viral trackers in the world were suddenly part of our community. We were working together in this virtual way  sharing  regular calls  communications  trying to follow the virus minute by minute  to see ways that we could stop it. And there are so many ways that we can form communities like that. Everybody  particularly when the outbreak started to expand globally  was reaching out to learn  to participate  to engage. Everybody wants to play a part. The amount of human capacity out there is just amazing  and the Internet connects us all. And could you imagine that instead of being frightened of each other  that we all just said   Let's do this. Let's work together  and let's make this happen.  But the problem is that the data that all of us are using  Googling on the web  is just too limited to do what we need to do. And so many opportunities get missed when that happens. So in the early part of the epidemic from Kenema  we'd had     clinical records from patients  and we once again made that publicly available to the world. And in our own lab  we could show that you could take those     records  we could train computers to predict the prognosis for Ebola patients to near     percent accuracy. And we made an app that could release that  to make that available to health care workers in the field. But     is just not enough to make it powerful  to validate it. So we were waiting for more data to release that. and the data has still not come. We are still waiting  tweaking away  in silos rather than working together. And this just    we can't accept that. Right  You  all of you  cannot accept that. It's our lives on the line. And in fact  actually  many lives were lost  many health care workers  including beloved colleagues of mine  five colleagues  Mbalu Fonnie  Alex Moigboi  Dr. Humarr Khan  Alice Kovoma and Mohamed Fullah. These are just five of many health care workers at Kenema and beyond that died while the world waited and while we all worked  quietly and separately. See  Ebola  like all threats to humanity  it's fueled by mistrust and distraction and division. When we build barriers amongst ourselves and we fight amongst ourselves  the virus thrives. But unlike all threats to humanity  Ebola is one where we're actually all the same. We're all in this fight together. Ebola on one person's doorstep could soon be on ours. And so in this place with the same vulnerabilities  the same strengths  the same fears  the same hopes  I hope that we work together with joy. A graduate student of mine was reading a book about Sierra Leone  and she discovered that the word  Kenema   the hospital that we work at and the city where we work in Sierra Leone  is named after the Mende word for  clear like a river  translucent and open to the public gaze.  That was really profound for us  because without knowing it  we'd always felt that in order to honor the individuals in Kenema where we worked  we had to work openly  we had to share and we had to work together. And we have to do that. We all have to demand that of ourselves and others    to be open to each other when an outbreak happens  to fight in this fight together. Because this is not the first outbreak of Ebola  it will not be the last  and there are many other microbes out there that are lying in wait  like Lassa virus and others. And the next time this happens  it could happen in a city of millions  it could start there. It could be something that's transmitted through the air. It could even be disseminated intentionally. And I know that that is frightening  I understand that  but I know also  and this experience shows us  that we have the technology and we have the capacity to win this thing  to win this and have the upper hand over viruses. But we can only do it if we do it together and we do it with joy. So for Dr. Khan and for all of those who sacrificed their lives on the front lines in this fight with us always  let us be in this fight with them always. And let us not let the world be defined by the destruction wrought by one virus  but illuminated by billions of hearts and minds working in unity. Thank you. Hello. My name is Matthew Williams  and I am a champion. I have won medals in three different sports and national games in Canada  competed at the international level in basketball and was proud to represent Canada on the world stage. I train five days a week for basketball and speed skating  work with top quality coaches and mental performance consultants to be at my best in my sport. By the way  all that is through Special Olympics. Does that change the way you think of me and my accomplishments  The world does not see all people like me as champions. Not long ago  people like me were shunned and hidden away. There has been lots of change since Special Olympics began in       but in too many cases  people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the wider population. People use the r word in front of me  and they think it doesn't matter. That's the word  retard  or  retarded  used in a derogatory manner. They're not thinking about how much it hurts me and my friends. I don't want you to think I'm here because I'm a charity case. I am here because there is still a big problem with the way many people see individuals with intellectual disabilities  or  too often  how they don't see them at all. Did you know the World Games happened this year  I was one of over       athletes with intellectual disabilities from     countries who competed in LA. There was over        spectators watching opening ceremonies  and there was live coverage on TSN and ESPN. Did you even know that happened  What do you think of when you see someone like me  I am here today to challenge you to look at us as equals. Special Olympics transforms the self identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perceptions of everyone watching. For those of you who aren't familiar  Special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities. Special Olympics is separate from the Paralympics and Olympics. We offer high quality  year round sports programs for people with intellectual disabilities that changes lives and perceptions. This movement has changed my life and those of so many others. And it has changed the way the world sees people with intellectual disabilities. I was born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability. Growing up  I played hockey until I was    years old. The older I got  the more I felt it was harder to keep up with everyone else  and I was angry and frustrated. For a while  I did not play any sports  didn't have many friends and felt left out and sad. There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden away from society. No one thought they could participate in sports  let alone be a valued member of society. In the     s  Dr. Frank Hayden  a scientist at the University of Toronto  was studying the effects of regular exercise on the fitness levels of children with intellectual disabilities. Using rigorous scientific research  Dr. Hayden and other researchers came to the conclusion that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that caused their fitness levels to suffer. Lots of people doubted that people with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sports competition opportunities. But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver  the founder of Special Olympics  persevered  and Special Olympics athletes have proved them right four and a half million times over. Before I joined Special Olympics  I was nervous because I was young  shy  not confident and didn't have many friends. When I got there  though  everyone was very encouraging  supportive  and let me be myself without being judged. Now  I am a basketball player and speed skater who has competed at provincial  national games  and this year made it all the way to the World Summer Games in LA  where I was part of the first ever Canadian basketball team to compete at World Games. I am one of more than four and a half million athletes around the globe  and I've heard so many similar stories. Being Special Olympics athletes restores our pride and dignity. Special Olympics also addresses critical health needs. Studies have shown that  on average  men with intellectual disabilities die    years younger than men without  and women with intellectual disabilities die    years younger than women without. Special Olympics keeps us healthy by getting us active and participating in sport. Also  our coaches teach us about nutrition and health. Special Olympics also provides free health screening for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor or accessing health care. At the      World Summer Games  my Team Canada teammates and I played the Nigerian basketball team. The day before our game  the Nigerian basketball team went to the World Games Healthy Athlete screening  where seven of    members were given hearing aids for free and got to hear clearly for the first time. The change in them was amazing. They were more excited  happy and confident  because their coach could vocally communicate with them. And they were emotional because they could hear the sounds of the basketball  the sounds of the whistle and the cheering fans in the stands    sounds that we take for granted. Special Olympics is transforming more than just the athlete in their sport. Special Olympics is transforming their lives off the field. This year  research findings showed that nearly half of the adults in the US don't know a single person with an intellectual disability  and the    percent of Americans who don't have personal contact with intellectual disabilities are significantly less accepting and positive. Then there's the r word  proving that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people. People use it as a casual term or an insult. It was tweeted more than nine million times last year  and it is deeply hurtful to me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the planet. People don't think it's insulting  but it is. As my fellow athlete and global messenger John Franklin Stephens wrote in an open letter to a political pundit who used the r word as an insult   Come join us someday at Special Olympics. See if you walk away with your heart unchanged.  This year  at the      World Summer Games  people lined up for hours to get into the final night of powerlifting competition. So it was standing room only when my teammate Jackie Barrett  the Newfoundland Moose  deadlifted     pounds and lifted     pounds in the squat    setting huge new records for Special Olympics. Jackie is a record holder among all powerlifters in Newfoundland    not just Special Olympics  all powerlifters. Jackie was a huge star in LA  and ESPN live tweeted his record breaking lifts and were wowed by his performance. Fifty years ago  few imagined individuals with intellectual disabilities could do anything like that. This year         spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of World Games and cheer athletes from     countries around the world. Far from being hidden away  we were cheered and celebrated. Special Olympics teaches athletes to be confident and proud of themselves. Special Olympics teaches the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and inclusion. Now  I have dreams and achievements in my sport  great coaches  respect and dignity  better health  and I am pursuing a career as a personal trainer. I am no longer hidden  bullied and I am here doing a TED Talk. The world is a different place because of Special Olympics  but there is still farther to go. So the next time you see someone with an intellectual disability  I hope you will see their ability. The next time someone uses the r word near you  I hope you will tell them how much it hurts. I hope you will think about getting involved with Special Olympics. I would like to leave you with one final thought. Nelson Mandela said   Sports has the power to change the world.  Special Olympics is changing the world by transforming four and a half million athletes and giving us a place to be confident  meet friends  not be judged and get to feel like and be champions. Thank you very much. Our ability to create and sustain economic growth is the defining challenge of our time. Of course there are other challenges    health care  disease burdens and pandemics  environmental challenges and  of course  radicalized terrorism. However  to the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge  it will take us a long way to solving the challenges that I've just elucidated. More importantly  unless and until we solve economic growth and create sustainable  long term economic growth  we'll be unable to address the seemingly intractable challenges that continue to pervade the globe today  whether it's health care  education or economic development. The fundamental question is this  How are we going to create economic growth in advanced and developed economies like the United States and across Europe at a time when they continue to struggle to create economic growth after the financial crisis  They continue to underperform and to see an erosion in the three key drivers of economic growth  capital  labor and productivity. In particular  these developed economies continue to see debts and deficits  the decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor and they also see productivity stalling. In a similar vein  how are we going to create economic growth in the emerging markets  where    percent of the world's population lives and where  on average     percent of the population is under the age of     In these countries  it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year in order to put a dent in poverty and to double per capita incomes in one generation. And yet today  the largest emerging economies    countries with at least    million people    continue to struggle to reach that seven percent magic mark. Worse than that  countries like India  Russia  South Africa  Brazil and even China are falling below that seven percent number and  in many cases  actually regressing. Economic growth matters. With economic growth  countries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle of upward mobility  opportunity and improved living standards. Without growth  countries contract and atrophy  not just in the annals of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived. Economic growth matters powerfully for the individual. If growth wanes  the risk to human progress and the risk of political and social instability rises  and societies become dimmer  coarser and smaller. The context matters. And countries in emerging markets do not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries. Now  I know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition. There are some people here who will turn around and be quite disillusioned by what's happened around the world and basically ascribe that to economic growth. You worry about the overpopulation of the planet. And looking at the UN's recent statistics and projections that the world will have    billion people on the planet before it plateaus in       you're concerned about what that does to natural resources    arable land  potable water  energy and minerals. You are also concerned about the degradation of the environment. And you worry about how man  embodied in the corporate globalist  has become greedy and corrupt. But I'm here to tell you today that economic growth has been the backbone of changes in living standards of millions of people around the world. And more importantly  it's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism. The definition of capitalism  very simply put  is that the factors of production  such as trade and industry  capital and labor  are left in the hands of the private sector and not the state. It's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se but what has happened to capitalism. And to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term  we're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance. Economic growth needs capitalism  but it needs it to work properly. And as I mentioned a moment ago  the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors. And even this  however  is a very simplistic dichotomy. Capitalism  good  non capitalism  bad. When in practical experience  capitalism is much more of a spectrum. And we have countries such as China  which have practiced more state capitalism  and we have countries like the Unites States which are more market capitalist. Our efforts to critique the capitalist system  however  have tended to focus on countries like China that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism. However  there is a real reason and real concern for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism  particularly those embodied by the United States. This is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption and  worse still  it's increasing income inequality    the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many. The two really critical questions that we need to address is how can we fix capitalism so that it can help create economic growth but at the same time can help to address social ills. In order to think about that framing  we have to ask ourselves  how does capitalism work today  Very simplistically  capitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility maximizer    a selfish individual who goes after what he or she wants. And only after they've maximized their utility do they then decide it's important to provide support to other social contracts. Of course  in this system governments do tax  and they use part of their revenues to fund social programs  recognizing that government's role is not just regulation but also to be arbiter of social goods. But nevertheless  this framework    this two stage framework    is the basis from which we must now start to think about how we can improve the capitalist model. I would argue that there are two sides to this challenge. First of all  we can draw on the right wing policies to see what could be beneficial for us to think about how we can improve capitalism. In particular  right leaning policies have tended to focus on things like conditional transfers  where we pay and reward people for doing the things that we actually think can help enhance economic growth. For example  sending children to school  parents could earn money for that  or getting their children inoculated or immunized  parents could get paid for doing that. Now  quite apart from the debate on whether or not we should be paying people to do what we think they should do anyway  the fact of the matter is that pay for performance has actually yielded some positive results in places like Mexico  in Brazil and also in pilot programs in New York. But there are also benefits and significant changes underway on left leaning policies. Arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility so that it's not so narrowly defined and that government should be much more of an arbiter of the factors of production have become commonplace with the success of China. But also we've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs. Things like the corporate social responsibility programs  albeit small in scale  are moving in that right direction. Of course  left leaning policies have also tended to blur the lines between government  NGOs and private sector. Two very good examples of this are the   th century United States  when the infrastructure rollout was really about public private partnerships. More recently  of course  the advent of the Internet has also proven to the world that public and private can work together for the betterment of society. My fundamental message to you is this  We cannot continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges by being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological. In order to create sustainable  long term economic growth and solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today  we're going to have to be more broad minded about what might work. Ultimately  we have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  I want to ask a couple of questions  Dambisa  because one could react to your last sentence by saying growth is also an ideology  it's possibly the dominant ideology of our times. What do you say to those who react that way  DM  Well  I think that that's completely legitimate  and I think that we're already having that discussion. There's a lot of work going on around happiness and other metrics being used for measuring people's success and improvements in living standards. And so I think that we should be open to what could deliver improvements in people's living standards and continue to reduce poverty around the world. BG  So you're basically pleading for rehabilitating growth  but the only way for that happen without compromising the capacity of the earth  to take us on a long journey  is for economic growth somehow to decouple from the underlying use of resources. Do you see that happening  DM  Well  I think that I'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity. I think if we start to constrain ourselves using the finite  scarce and depleting resources that we know today  we could get quite negative and quite concerned about the way the world is. However  we've seen the Club of Rome  we've seen previous claims that the world would be running out of resources  and it's not to argue that those things are not valid. But I think  with ingenuity we could see desalination  I think we could reinvest in energy  so that we can actually get better outcomes. And so in that sense  I'm much more optimistic about what humans can do. BG  The thing that strikes me about your proposals for rehabilitating growth and taking a different direction is that you're kind of suggesting to fix capitalism with more capitalism    with putting a price tag on good behavior as incentive or developing a bigger role for business in social issues. Is that what you're suggesting  DM  I'm suggesting we have to be open minded. I think it is absolutely the case that traditional models of economic growth are not working the way we would like them to. And I think it's no accident that today the largest economy in the world  the United States  has democracy  liberal democracy  as it's core political stance and it has free market capitalism    to the extent that it is free    free market capitalism as its economic stance. The second largest economy is China. It has deprioritized democracy and it has state capitalism  which is a completely different model. These two countries  completely different political models and completely different economic models  and yet they have the same income inequality number measured as a Gini coefficient. I think those are the debates we should have  because it's not clear at all what model we should be adopting  and I think there needs to be much more discourse and much more humility about what we know and what we don't know. BG  One last question. The COP   is going on in Paris. If you could send a tweet to all the heads of state and heads of delegations there  what would you say  DM  Again  I would be very much about being open minded. As you're aware  the issues around the environmental concerns have been on the agenda many times now    in Copenhagen  '   in Stockholm    and we keep revisiting these issues partly because there is not a fundamental agreement  in fact there's a schism between what the developed countries believe and want and what emerging market countries want. Emerging market countries need to continue to create economic growth so that we don't have political uncertainty in the those countries. Developed countries recognize that they have a real  important responsibility not only just to manage their CO  emissions and some of the degradation that they're contributing to the world  but also as trendsetters in R D. And so they have to come to the table as well. But in essence  it cannot be a situation where we start ascribing policies to the emerging markets without developed countries themselves also taking quite a swipe at what they're doing both in demand and supply in developed markets. BG  Dambisa  thank you for coming to TED. DM  Thank you very much. We've evolved with tools  and tools have evolved with us. Our ancestors created these hand axes  .  million years ago  shaping them to not only fit the task at hand but also their hand. However  over the years  tools have become more and more specialized. These sculpting tools have evolved through their use  and each one has a different form which matches its function. And they leverage the dexterity of our hands in order to manipulate things with much more precision. But as tools have become more and more complex  we need more complex controls to control them. And so designers have become very adept at creating interfaces that allow you to manipulate parameters while you're attending to other things  such as taking a photograph and changing the focus or the aperture. But the computer has fundamentally changed the way we think about tools because computation is dynamic. So it can do a million different things and run a million different applications. However  computers have the same static physical form for all of these different applications and the same static interface elements as well. And I believe that this is fundamentally a problem  because it doesn't really allow us to interact with our hands and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies. And my belief is that  then  we must need new types of interfaces that can capture these rich abilities that we have and that can physically adapt to us and allow us to interact in new ways. And so that's what I've been doing at the MIT Media Lab and now at Stanford. So with my colleagues  Daniel Leithinger and Hiroshi Ishii  we created inFORM  where the interface can actually come off the screen and you can physically manipulate it. Or you can visualize  D information physically and touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways. Or you can interact through gestures and direct deformations to sculpt digital clay. Or interface elements can arise out of the surface and change on demand. And the idea is that for each individual application  the physical form can be matched to the application. And I believe this represents a new way that we can interact with information  by making it physical. So the question is  how can we use this  Traditionally  urban planners and architects build physical models of cities and buildings to better understand them. So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab  we created an interface built on inFORM to allow urban planners to design and view entire cities. And now you can walk around it  but it's dynamic  it's physical  and you can also interact directly. Or you can look at different views  such as population or traffic information  but it's made physical. We also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change the ways that we remotely collaborate with people. So when we're working together in person  I'm not only looking at your face but I'm also gesturing and manipulating objects  and that's really hard to do when you're using tools like Skype. And so using inFORM  you can reach out from the screen and manipulate things at a distance. So we used the pins of the display to represent people's hands  allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance. And you can also manipulate and collaborate on  D data sets as well  so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them. And that allows people to collaborate on these new types of  D information in a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools. And so you can also bring in existing objects  and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other. Or you can have an object that's linked between two places  so as I move a ball on one side  the ball moves on the other as well. And so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect. Now  you might be wondering how does this all work  and essentially  what it is  is     linear actuators that are connected to these mechanical linkages that allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above. So it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN  but it did take a long time for us to build it. And so we started with a single motor  a single linear actuator  and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them. And then we had to make a lot of them. And so the problem with having     of something is that you have to do every step     times. And so that meant that we had a lot of work to do. So we sort of set up a mini sweatshop in the Media Lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do  research     and had late nights watching movies  eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws. You know    research. But anyway  I think that we were really excited by the things that inFORM allowed us to do. Increasingly  we're using mobile devices  and we interact on the go. But mobile devices  just like computers  are used for so many different applications. So you use them to talk on the phone  to surf the web  to play games  to take pictures or even a million different things. But again  they have the same static physical form for each of these applications. And so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions that we developed for inFORM and bring them to mobile devices. So at Stanford  we created this haptic edge display  which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape  so you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book. Or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration. Or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact where you want them to be. Or you can play games and have actual buttons. And so we were able to do this by embedding    small  tiny linear actuators inside the device  and that allow you not only to touch them but also back drive them as well. But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change. So we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ... to a wristband on the go. And so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab  we created this new high resolution version that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch input device to a phone. And we're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use. So you can make something like a game controller  and then the system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode. So  where does this point  How do we move forward from here  I think  really  where we are today is in this new age of the Internet of Things  where we have computers everywhere    they're in our pockets  they're in our walls  they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years. But what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments  And so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically  and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks  So for the Milan Design Week  we created TRANSFORM  which is an interactive table scale version of these shape displays  which can move physical objects on the surface  for example  reminding you to take your keys. But it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting. So if you want to work  then it can change to sort of set up your work system. And so as you bring a device over  it creates all the affordances you need and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals. So  in conclusion  I really think that we need to think about a new  fundamentally different way of interacting with computers. We need computers that can physically adapt to us and adapt to the ways that we want to use them and really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands  and our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical. But looking forward  I think we need to go beyond this  beyond devices  to really think about new ways that we can bring people together  and bring our information into the world  and think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically. So with that  I will leave you. Thank you very much. On January           a band of al Qaeda militants entered the ancient city of Timbuktu on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. There  they set fire to a medieval library of        manuscripts written in Arabic and several African languages and ranging in subject from astronomy to geography  history to medicine  including one book which records perhaps the first treatment for male erectile dysfunction. Unknown in the West  this was the collected wisdom of an entire continent  the voice of Africa at a time when Africa was thought not to have a voice at all. The mayor of Bamako  who witnessed the event  called the burning of the manuscripts  a crime against world cultural heritage.  And he was right    or he would have been  if it weren't for the fact that he was also lying. In fact  just before  African scholars had collected a random assortment of old books and left them out for the terrorists to burn. Today  the collection lies hidden in Bamako  the capital of Mali  moldering in the high humidity. What was rescued by ruse is now once again in jeopardy  this time by climate. But Africa  and the far flung corners of the world  are not the only places  or even the main places in which manuscripts that could change the history of world culture are in jeopardy. Several years ago  I conducted a survey of European research libraries and discovered that  at the barest minimum  there are        manuscripts pre      that are illegible because of water damage  fading  mold and chemical reagents. The real number is likely double that  and that doesn't even count Renaissance manuscripts and modern manuscripts and cultural heritage objects such as maps. What if there were a technology that could recover these lost and unknown works  Imagine worldwide how a trove of hundreds of thousands of previously unknown texts could radically transform our knowledge of the past. Imagine what unknown classics we would discover which would rewrite the canons of literature  history  philosophy  music    or  more provocatively  that could rewrite our cultural identities  building new bridges between people and culture. These are the questions that transformed me from a medieval scholar  a reader of texts  into a textual scientist. What an unsatisfying word  reader  is. For me  it conjures up images of passivity  of someone sitting idly in an armchair waiting for knowledge to come to him in a neat little parcel. How much better to be a participant in the past  an adventurer in an undiscovered country  searching for the hidden text. As an academic  I was a mere reader. I read and taught the same classics that people had been reading and teaching for hundreds of years    Virgil  Ovid  Chaucer  Petrarch    and with every scholarly article that I published I added to human knowledge in ever diminishing slivers of insight. What I wanted to be was an archaeologist of the past  a discoverer of literature  an Indiana Jones without the whip    or  actually  with the whip. And I wanted it not just for myself but I wanted it for my students as well. And so six years ago  I changed the direction of my career. At the time  I was working on  The Chess of Love   the last important long poem of the European Middle Ages never to have been edited. And it wasn't edited because it existed in only one manuscript which was so badly damaged during the firebombing of Dresden in World War II that generations of scholars had pronounced it lost. For five years  I had been working with an ultraviolet lamp trying to recover traces of the writing and I'd gone about as far as technology at the time could actually take me. And so I did what many people do. I went online  and there I learned about how multispectral imaging had been used to recover two lost treatises of the famed Greek mathematician Archimedes from a   th century palimpsest. A palimpsest is a manuscript which has been erased and overwritten. And so  out of the blue  I decided to write to the lead imaging scientist on the Archimedes palimpsest project  Professor Roger Easton  with a plan and a plea. And to my surprise  he actually wrote back. With his help  I was able to win a grant from the US government to build a transportable  multispectral imaging lab  And with this lab  I transformed what was a charred and faded mess into a new medieval classic. So how does multispectral imaging actually work  Well  the idea behind multispectral imaging is something that anyone who is familiar with infrared night vision goggles will immediately appreciate  that what we can see in the visible spectrum of light is only a tiny fraction of what's actually there. The same is true with invisible writing. Our system uses    wavelengths of light between the ultraviolet and the infrared  and these are shown down onto the manuscript from above from banks of LEDs  and another multispectral light source which comes up through the individual leaves of the manuscript. Up to    images per sequence per leaf are imaged this way using a high powered digital camera equipped with a lens which is made out of quartz. There are about five of these in the world. And once we capture these images  we feed them through statistical algorithms to further enhance and clarify them  using software which was originally designed for satellite images and used by people like geospatial scientists and the CIA. The results can be spectacular. You may already have heard of what's been done for the Dead Sea Scrolls  which are slowly gelatinizing. Using infrared  we've been able to read even the darkest corners of the Dead Sea Scrolls. You may not be aware  however  of other Biblical texts that are in jeopardy. Here  for example  is a leaf from a manuscript that we imaged  which is perhaps the most valuable Christian Bible in the world. The Codex Vercellensis is the oldest translation of the Gospels into Latin  and it dates from the first half of the fourth century. This is the closest we can come to the Bible at the time of the foundation of Christendom under Emperor Constantine  and at the time also of the Council of Nicaea  when the basic creed of Christianity was being agreed upon. This manuscript  unfortunately  has been very badly damaged  and it's damaged because for centuries it had been used and handled in swearing in ceremonies in the church. In fact  that purple splotch that you see in the upper left hand corner is Aspergillus  which is a fungus which originates in the unwashed hands of a person with tuberculosis. Our imaging has enabled me to make the first transcription of this manuscript in     years. Having a lab that can travel to collections where it's needed  however  is only part of the solution. The technology is expensive and very rare  and the imaging and image processing skills are esoteric. That means that mounting recoveries is beyond the reach of most researchers and all but the wealthiest institutions. That's why I founded the Lazarus Project  a not for profit initiative to bring multispectral imaging to individual researchers and smaller institutions at little or no cost whatsoever. Over the past five years  our team of imaging scientists  scholars and students has travelled to seven different countries and have recovered some of the world's most valuable damaged manuscripts  included the Vercelli Book  which is the oldest book of English  the Black Book of Carmarthen  the oldest book of Welsh  and some of the most valuable earliest Gospels located in what is now the former Soviet Georgia. So  spectral imaging can recover lost texts. More subtly  though  it can recover a second story behind every object  the story of how  when and by whom a text was created  and  sometimes  what the author was thinking at the time he wrote. Take  for example  a draft of the Declaration of Independence written in Thomas Jefferson's own hand  which some colleagues of mine imaged a few years ago at the Library of Congress. Curators had noticed that one word throughout had been scratched out and overwritten. The word overwritten was  citizens.  Perhaps you can guess what the word underneath was.  Subjects.  There  ladies and gentlemen  is American democracy evolving under the hand of Thomas Jefferson. Or consider the      Martellus Map  which we imaged at Yale's Beinecke Library. This was the map that Columbus likely consulted before he traveled to the New World and which gave him his idea of what Asia looked like and where Japan was located. The problem with this map is that its inks and pigments had so degraded over time that this large  nearly seven foot map  made the world look like a giant desert. Until now  we had very little idea  detailed idea  that is  of what Columbus knew of the world and how world cultures were represented. The main legend of the map was entirely illegible under normal light. Ultraviolet did very little for it. Multispectral gave us everything. In Asia  we learned of monsters with ears so long that they could cover the creature's entire body. In Africa  about a snake who could cause the ground to smoke. Like starlight  which can convey images of the way the Universe looked in the distant past  so multispectral light can take us back to the first stuttering moments of an object's creation. Through this lens  we witness the mistakes  the changes of mind  the na vet s  the uncensored thoughts  the imperfections of the human imagination that allow these hallowed objects and their authors to become more real  that make history closer to us. What about the future  There's so much of the past  and so few people with the skills to rescue it before these objects disappear forever. That's why I have begun to teach this new hybrid discipline that I call  textual science.  Textual science is a marriage of the traditional skills of a literary scholar    the ability to read old languages and old handwriting  the knowledge of how texts are made in order to be able to place and date them    with new techniques like imaging science  the chemistry of inks and pigments  computer aided optical character recognition. Last year  a student in my class  a freshman  with a background in Latin and Greek  was image processing a palimpsest that we had photographed at a famous library in Rome. As he worked  tiny Greek writing began to appear from behind the text. Everyone gathered around  and he read a line from a lost work of the Greek comic dramatist Menander. This was the first time in well over a thousand years that those words had been pronounced aloud. In that moment  he became a scholar. Ladies and gentlemen  that is the future of the past. Thank you very much. So I come from the tallest people on the planet    the Dutch. It hasn't always been this way. In fact  all across the globe  people have been gaining height. In the last     years  in developed countries  on average  we have gotten    centimeters taller. And scientists have a lot of theories about why this is  but almost all of them involve nutrition  namely the increase of dairy and meat. In the last    years  global meat consumption has more than quadrupled  from    million tons to     million tons. Something similar has been going on with milk and eggs. In every society where incomes have risen  so has protein consumption. And we know that globally  we are getting richer. And as the middle class is on the rise  so is our global population  from   billion of us today to  .  billion by       which means that by       we are going to need at least    percent more protein than what is available to humankind today. And the latest prediction of the UN puts that population number  by the end of this century  at    billion  which means that we are going to need a lot more protein. This challenge is staggering    so much so  that recently  a team at Anglia Ruskin Global Sustainability Institute suggested that if we don't change our global policies and food production systems  our societies might actually collapse in the next    years. Currently  our ocean serves as the main source of animal protein. Over  .  billion people depend on it every single day. At the same time  our global fisheries are two and a half times larger than what our oceans can sustainably support  meaning that humans take far more fish from the ocean than the oceans can naturally replace. WWF recently published a report showing that just in the last    years  our global marine life has been slashed in half. And another recent report suggests that of our largest predatory species  such as swordfish and bluefin tuna  over    percent has disappeared since the     s. And there are a lot of great  sustainable fishing initiatives across the planet working towards better practices and better managed fisheries. But ultimately  all of these initiatives are working towards keeping current catch constant. It's unlikely  even with the best managed fisheries  that we are going to be able to take much more from the ocean than we do today. We have to stop plundering our oceans the way we have. We need to alleviate the pressure on it. And we are at a point where if we push much harder for more produce  we might face total collapse. Our current systems are not going to feed a growing global population. So how do we fix this  What's the world going to look like in just    short years when there's  .  billion more of us sharing the same resources  We could all become vegan. Sounds like a great idea  but it's not realistic and it's impossibly hard to mandate globally. People are eating animal protein whether we like it or not. And suppose we fail to change our ways and continue on the current path  failing to meet demands. The World Health Organization recently reported that     million people are suffering from malnutrition and food shortage  which is due to that same growing  global population and the declining access to resources like water  energy and land. It takes very little imagination to picture a world of global unrest  riots and further malnutrition. People are hungry  and we are running dangerously low on natural resources. For so  so many reasons  we need to change our global food production systems. We must do better and there is a solution. And that solution lies in aquaculture    the farming of fish  plants like seaweed  shellfish and crustaceans. As the great ocean hero Jacques Cousteau once said   We must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters. That's what civilization is all about    farming instead of hunting.  Fish is the last food that we hunt. And why is it that we keep hearing phrases like   Life's too short for farmed fish   or   Wild caught  of course   over fish that we know virtually nothing about  We don't know what it ate during its lifetime  and we don't know what pollution it encounters. And if it was a large predatory species  it might have gone through the coast of Fukushima yesterday. We don't know. Very few people realize the traceability in fisheries never goes beyond the hunter that caught the wild animal. But let's back up for a second and talk about why fish is the best food choice. It's healthy  it prevents heart disease  it provides key amino acids and key fatty acids like Omega  s  which is very different from almost any other type of meat. And aside from being healthy  it's also a lot more exciting and diverse. Think about it    most animal farming is pretty monotonous. Cow is cow  sheep is sheep  pig's pig  and poultry    turkey  duck  chicken    pretty much sums it up. And then there's     species of fish being farmed currently. not that Western supermarkets reflect that on their shelves  but that's beside that point. And you can farm fish in a very healthy manner that's good for us  good for the planet and good for the fish. I know I sound fish obsessed    Let me explain  My brilliant partner and wife  Amy Novograntz  and I got involved in aquaculture a couple of years ago. We were inspired by Sylvia Earle  who won the TED Prize in     . We actually met on Mission Blue I in the Galapagos. Amy was there as the TED Prize Director  me  an entrepreneur from the Netherlands and concerned citizen  love to dive  passion for the oceans. Mission Blue truly changed our lives. We fell in love  got married and we came away really inspired  thinking we really want to do something about ocean conservation    something that was meant to last  that could make a real difference and something that we could do together. Little did we expect that that would lead us to fish farming. But a few months after we got off the boat  we got to a meeting at Conservation International  where the Director General of WorldFish was talking about aquaculture  asking a room full of environmentalists to stop turning from it  realize what was going on and to really get involved because aquaculture has the potential to be just what our oceans and populations need. We were stunned when we heard the stats that we didn't know more about this industry already and excited about the chance to help get it right. And to talk about stats    right now  the amount of fish consumed globally  wild catch and farmed combined  is twice the tonnage of the total amount of beef produced on planet earth last year. Every single fishing vessel combined  small and large  across the globe  together produce about    million tons of wild caught seafood for human consumption. Aquaculture this year  for the first time in history  actually produces more than what we catch from the wild. But now this  Demand is going to go up. In the next    years  we are going to need an additional    million tons to meet demand  which is one and a half times as much  almost  as what we catch globally out of our oceans. An enormous number. It's safe to assume that that's not going to come from the ocean. It needs to come from farming. And talk about farming    for farming you need resources. As a human needs to eat to grow and stay alive  so does an animal. A cow needs to eat eight to nine pounds of feed and drink almost       liters of water to create just one pound of meat. Experts agree that it's impossible to farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet. We just don't have enough feed or water. And we can't keep cutting down rain forests for it. And fresh water    planet earth has a very limited supply. We need something more efficient to keep humankind alive on this planet. And now let's compare that with fish farming. You can farm one pound of fish with just one pound of feed  and depending on species  even less. And why is that  Well  that's because fish  first of all  float. They don't need to stand around all day resisting gravity like we do. And most fish are cold blooded    they don't need to heat themselves. Fish chills. And it needs very little water  which is counterintuitive  but as we say  it swims in it but it hardly drinks it. Fish are the most resource efficient animal protein available to humankind  aside from insects. How much we've learned since. For example  on top of that    million tons that's annually caught for human consumption  there's an additional    million tons caught for animal feed  mostly sardines and anchovies for the aquaculture industry that's turned into fish meal and fish oil. This is madness. Sixty five percent of these fisheries  globally  are badly managed. Some of the worst issues of our time are connected to it. It's destroying our oceans. The worst slavery issues imaginable are connected to it. Recently  an article came out of Stanford saying that if    percent of the world's aquaculture industry would stop using fish meal  our oceans would be saved. Now think about that for a minute. Now  we know that the oceans have far more problems    they have pollution  there's acidification  coral reef destruction and so on. But it underlines the impact of our fisheries  and it underlines how interconnected everything is. Fisheries  aquaculture  deforestation  climate change  food security and so on. In the search for alternatives  the industry  on a massive scale  has reverted to plant based alternatives like soy  industrial chicken waste  blood meal from slaughterhouses and so on. And we understand where these choices come from  but this is not the right approach. It's not sustainable  it's not healthy. Have you ever seen a chicken at the bottom of the ocean  Of course not. If you feed salmon soy with nothing else  it literally explodes. Salmon is a carnivore  it has no way to digest soy. Now  fish farming is by far the best animal farming available to humankind. But it's had a really bad reputation. There's been excessive use of chemicals  there's been virus and disease transfered to wild populations  ecosystem destruction and pollution  escaped fish breeding with wild populations  altering the overall genetic pool  and then of course  as just mentioned  the unsustainable feed ingredients. How blessed were the days when we could just enjoy food that was on our plate  whatever it was. Once you know  you know. You can't go back. It's not fun. We really need a transparent food system that we can trust  that produces healthy food. But the good news is that decades of development and research have led to a lot of new technologies and knowledge that allow us to do a lot better. We can now farm fish without any of these issues. I think of agriculture before the green revolution    we are at aquaculture and the blue revolution. New technologies means that we can now produce a feed that's perfectly natural  with a minimal footprint that consists of microbes  insects  seaweeds and micro algae. Healthy for the people  healthy for the fish  healthy for the planet. Microbes  for example  can be a perfect alternative for high grade fish meal    at scale. Insects are the    well  first of all  the perfect recycling because they're grown on food waste  but second  think of fly fishing  and you know how logical it actually is to use it as fish feed. You don't need large tracts of land for it and you don't need to cut down rain forests for it. And microbes and insects are actually net water producers. This revolution is starting as we speak  it just needs scale. We can now farm far more species than ever before in controlled  natural conditions  creating happy fish. I imagine  for example  a closed system that's performing more efficiently than insect farming  where you can produce healthy  happy  delicious fish with little or no effluent  almost no energy and almost no water and a natural feed with a minimal footprint. Or a system where you grow up to    species next to each other    off of each other  mimicking nature. You need very little feed  very little footprint. I think of seaweed growing off the effluent of fish  for example. There's great technologies popping up all over the globe. From alternatives to battle disease so we don't need antibiotics and chemicals anymore  to automated feeders that feel when the fish are hungry  so we can save on feed and create less pollution. Software systems that gather data across farms  so we can improve farm practices. There's really cool stuff happening all over the globe. And make no mistake    all of these things are possible at a cost that's competitive to what a farmer spends today. Tomorrow  there will be no excuse for anyone to not do the right thing. So somebody needs to connect the dots and give these developments a big kick in the butt. And that's what we've been working on the last couple of years  and that's what we need to be working on together    rethinking everything from the ground up  with a holistic view across the value chain  connecting all these things across the globe  alongside great entrepreneurs that are willing to share a collective vision. Now is the time to create change in this industry and to push it into a sustainable direction. This industry is still young  much of its growth is still ahead. It's a big task  but not as far fetched as you might think. It's possible. So we need to take pressure off the ocean. We want to eat good and healthy. And if we eat an animal  it needs to be one that had a happy and healthy life. We need to have a meal that we can trust  live long lives. And this is not just for people in San Francisco or Northern Europe    this is for all of us. Even in the poorest countries  it's not just about money. People prefer something fresh and healthy that they can trust over something that comes from far away that they know nothing about. We're all the same. The day will come where people will realize    no  demand    farmed fish on their plate that's farmed well and that's farmed healthy    and refuse anything less. You can help speed this up. Ask questions when you order seafood. Where does my fish come from  Who raised it  and what did it eat  Information about where your fish comes from and how it was produced needs to be much more readily available. And consumers need to put pressure on the aquaculture industry to do the right thing. So every time you order  ask for detail and show that you really care about what you eat and what's been given to you. And eventually  they will listen. And all of us will benefit. Thank you.    years ago  I volunteered to participate in a research study that involved a genetic test. When I arrived at the clinic to be tested  I was handed a questionnaire. One of the very first questions asked me to check a box for my race  White  black  Asian  or Native American. I wasn't quite sure how to answer the question. Was it aimed at measuring the diversity of research participants' social backgrounds  In that case  I would answer with my social identity  and check the box for  black.  But what if the researchers were interested in investigating some association between ancestry and the risk for certain genetic traits  In that case  wouldn't they want to know something about my ancestry  which is just as much European as African  And how could they make scientific findings about my genes if I put down my social identity as a black woman  After all  I consider myself a black woman with a white father rather than a white woman with a black mother entirely for social reasons. Which racial identity I check has nothing to do with my genes. Well  despite the obvious importance of this question to the study's scientific validity  I was told   Don't worry about it  just put down however you identify yourself.  So I check  black   but I had no confidence in the results of a study that treated a critical variable so unscientifically. That personal experience with the use of race in genetic testing got me thinking  Where else in medicine is race used to make false biological predictions  Well  I found out that race runs deeply throughout all of medical practice. It shapes physicians' diagnoses  measurements  treatments  prescriptions  even the very definition of diseases. And the more I found out  the more disturbed I became. Sociologists like me have long explained that race is a social construction. When we identify people as black  white  Asian  Native American  Latina  we're referring to social groupings with made up demarcations that have changed over time and vary around the world. As a legal scholar  I've also studied how lawmakers  not biologists  have invented the legal definitions of races. And it's not just the view of social scientists. You remember when the map of the human genome was unveiled at a White House ceremony in June       President Bill Clinton famously declared   I believe one of the great truths to emerge from this triumphant expedition inside the human genome is that in genetic terms  human beings  regardless of race  are more than   .  percent the same.  And he might have added that that less than one percent of genetic difference doesn't fall into racial boxes. Francis Collins  who led the Human Genome Project and now heads NIH  echoed President Clinton.  I am happy that today  the only race we're talking about is the human race.  Doctors are supposed to practice evidence based medicine  and they're increasingly called to join the genomic revolution. But their habit of treating patients by race lags far behind. Take the estimate of glomerular filtration rate  or GFR. Doctors routinely interpret GFR  this important indicator of kidney function  by race. As you can see in this lab test  the exact same creatinine level  the concentration in the blood of the patient  automatically produces a different GFR estimate depending on whether or not the patient is African American. Why  I've been told it's based on an assumption that African Americans have more muscle mass than people of other races. But what sense does it make for a doctor to automatically assume I have more muscle mass than that female bodybuilder  Wouldn't it be far more accurate and evidence based to determine the muscle mass of individual patients just by looking at them  Well  doctors tell me they're using race as a shortcut. It's a crude but convenient proxy for more important factors  like muscle mass  enzyme level  genetic traits they just don't have time to look for. But race is a bad proxy. In many cases  race adds no relevant information at all. It's just a distraction. But race also tends to overwhelm the clinical measures. It blinds doctors to patients' symptoms  family illnesses  their history  their own illnesses they might have    all more evidence based than the patient's race. Race can't substitute for these important clinical measures without sacrificing patient well being. Doctors also tell me race is just one of many factors they take into account  but there are numerous medical tests  like the GFR  that use race categorically to treat black  white  Asian patients differently just because of their race. Race medicine also leaves patients of color especially vulnerable to harmful biases and stereotypes. Black and Latino patients are twice as likely to receive no pain medication as whites for the same painful long bone fractures because of stereotypes that black and brown people feel less pain  exaggerate their pain  and are predisposed to drug addiction. The Food and Drug Administration has even approved a race specific medicine. It's a pill called BiDil to treat heart failure in self identified African American patients. A cardiologist developed this drug without regard to race or genetics  but it became convenient for commercial reasons to market the drug to black patients. The FDA then allowed the company  the drug company  to test the efficacy in a clinical trial that only included African American subjects. It speculated that race stood in as a proxy for some unknown genetic factor that affects heart disease or response to drugs. But think about the dangerous message it sent  that black people's bodies are so substandard  a drug tested in them is not guaranteed to work in other patients. In the end  the drug company's marketing scheme failed. For one thing  black patients were understandably wary of using a drug just for black people. One elderly black woman stood up in a community meeting and shouted   Give me what the white people are taking   And if you find race specific medicine surprising  wait until you learn that many doctors in the United States still use an updated version of a diagnostic tool that was developed by a physician during the slavery era  a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked to justifications for slavery. Dr. Samuel Cartwright graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. He practiced in the Deep South before the Civil War  and he was a well known expert on what was then called  Negro medicine.  He promoted the racial concept of disease  that people of different races suffer from different diseases and experience common diseases differently. Cartwright argued in the     s that slavery was beneficial for black people for medical reasons. He claimed that because black people have lower lung capacity than whites  forced labor was good for them. He wrote in a medical journal   It is the red vital blood sent to the brain that liberates their minds when under the white man's control  and it is the want of sufficiency of red vital blood that chains their minds to ignorance and barbarism when in freedom.  To support this theory  Cartwright helped to perfect a medical device for measuring breathing called the spirometer to show the presumed deficiency in black people's lungs. Today  doctors still uphold Cartwright's claim the black people as a race have lower lung capacity than white people. Some even use a modern day spirometer that actually has a button labeled  race  so the machine adjusts the measurement for each patient according to his or her race. It's a well known function called  correcting for race.  The problem with race medicine extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients. Its focus on innate racial differences in disease diverts attention and resources from the social determinants that cause appalling racial gaps in health  lack of access to high quality medical care  food deserts in poor neighborhoods  exposure to environmental toxins  high rates of incarceration  and experiencing the stress of racial discrimination. You see  race is not a biological category that naturally produces these health disparities because of genetic difference. Race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences  but because of the impact of social inequality on people's health. Yet race medicine pretends the answer to these gaps in health can be found in a race specific pill. It's much easier and more lucrative to market a technological fix for these gaps in health than to deal with the structural inequities that produce them. The reason I'm so passionate about ending race medicine isn't just because it's bad medicine. I'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to promote a false and toxic view of humanity. Despite the many visionary breakthroughs in medicine we've been learning about  there's a failure of imagination when it comes to race. Would you imagine with me  just a moment  What would happen if doctors stopped treating patients by race  Suppose they rejected an   th century classification system and incorporated instead the most advanced knowledge of human genetic diversity and unity  that human beings cannot be categorized into biological races  What if  instead of using race as a crude proxy for some more important factor  doctors actually investigated and addressed that more important factor  What if doctors joined the forefront of a movement to end the structural inequities caused by racism  not by genetic difference  Race medicine is bad medicine  it's poor science and it's a false interpretation of humanity. It is more urgent than ever to finally abandon this backward legacy and to affirm our common humanity by ending the social inequalities that truly divide us. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. So I'm a neurosurgeon. And like most of my colleagues  I have to deal  every day  with human tragedies. I realize how your life can change from one second to the other after a major stroke or after a car accident. And what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons is to realize that unlike other organs of the body  the brain has very little ability for self repair. And after a major injury of your central nervous system  the patients often remain with a severe handicap. And that's probably the reason why I've chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon. What is a functional neurosurgeon  It's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function through different surgical strategies. You've certainly heard of one of the famous ones called deep brain stimulation  where you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain in order to modulate a circuit of neurons to improve a neurological function. It's really an amazing technology in that it has improved the destiny of patients with Parkinson's disease  with severe tremor  with severe pain. However  neuromodulation does not mean neuro repair. And the dream of functional neurosurgeons is to repair the brain. I think that we are approaching this dream. And I would like to show you that we are very close to this. And that with a little bit of help  the brain is able to help itself. So the story started    years ago. At that time  I was a chief resident working days and nights in the emergency room. I often had to take care of patients with head trauma. You have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma  his brain is swelling and he's increasing his intracranial pressure. And in order to save his life  you have to decrease this intracranial pressure. And to do that  you sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain. So instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain  we decided with Jean Fran ois Brunet  who is a colleague of mine  a biologist  to study them. What do I mean by that  We wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue. It's not an easy task. Growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family. So you need to find the right nutrients  the warmth  the humidity and all the nice environments to make them thrive. So that's exactly what we had to do with these cells. And after many attempts  Jean Fran ois did it. And that's what he saw under his microscope. And that was  for us  a major surprise. Why  Because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture  with large green cells surrounding small  immature cells. And you may remember from biology class that stem cells are immature cells  able to turn into any type of cell of the body. The adult brain has stem cells  but they're very rare and they're located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain. So it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture from the superficial part of swollen brain we had in the operating theater. And there was another intriguing observation  Regular stem cells are very active cells    cells that divide  divide  divide very quickly. And they never die  they're immortal cells. But these cells behave differently. They divide slowly  and after a few weeks of culture  they even died. So we were in front of a strange new cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently. And it took us a long time to understand where they came from. They come from these cells. These blue and red cells are called doublecortin positive cells. All of you have them in your brain. They represent four percent of your cortical brain cells. They have a very important role during the development stage. When you were fetuses  they helped your brain to fold itself. But why do they stay in your head  This  we don't know. We think that they may participate in brain repair because we find them in higher concentration close to brain lesions. But it's not so sure. But there is one clear thing    that from these cells  we got our stem cell culture. And we were in front of a potential new source of cells to repair the brain. And we had to prove this. So to prove it  we decided to design an experimental paradigm. The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain in a non eloquent area of the brain  and then to culture the cells exactly the way Jean Fran ois did it in his lab. And then label them  to put color in them in order to be able to track them in the brain. And the last step was to re implant them in the same individual. We call these autologous grafts    autografts. So the first question we had   What will happen if we re implant these cells in a normal brain  and what will happen if we re implant the same cells in a lesioned brain   Thanks to the help of professor Eric Rouiller  we worked with monkeys. So in the first case scenario  we re implanted the cells in the normal brain and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks  as if they were taken from the brain  they go back home  the space is already busy  they are not needed there  so they disappear. In the second case scenario  we performed the lesion  we re implanted exactly the same cells  and in this case  the cells remained    and they became mature neurons. And that's the image of what we could observe under the microscope. Those are the cells that were re implanted. And the proof they carry  these little spots  those are the cells that we've labeled in vitro  when they were in culture. But we could not stop here  of course. Do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion  So for that  we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task. They had to retrieve food pellets from a tray. They were very good at it. And when they had reached a plateau of performance  we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion. So the monkeys were plegic  they could not move their hand anymore. And exactly the same as humans would do  they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent  exactly the same as after a stroke. Patients are completely plegic  and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism  they recover to a certain extent  exactly the same for the monkey. So when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau of spontaneous recovery  we implanted his own cells. So on the left side  you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered. He's at about    to    percent of his previous performance before the lesion. He's not so accurate  not so quick. And look now  when we re impant the cells  Two months after re implantation  the same individual. It was also very exciting results for us  I tell you. Since that time  we've understood much more about these cells. We know that we can cryopreserve them  we can use them later on. We know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models  like Parkinson's disease  for example. But our dream is still to implant them in humans. And I really hope that I'll be able to show you soon that the human brain is giving us the tools to repair itself. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Jocelyne  this is amazing  and I'm sure that right now  there are several dozen people in the audience  possibly even a majority  who are thinking   I know somebody who can use this.  I do  in any case. And of course the question is  what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into human clinical trials  Jocelyne Bloch  The biggest obstacles are regulations.  Laughs  So  from these exciting results  you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to be able to go through these kind of trials. BG  Which is understandable  the brain is delicate  etc. JB  Yes  it is  but it takes a long time and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it  you know  BG  If you project yourself    having done the research and having tried to get permission to start the trials  if you project yourself out in time  how many years before somebody gets into a hospital and this therapy is available  JB  So  it's very difficult to say. It depends  first  on the approval of the trial. Will the regulation allow us to do it soon  And then  you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients. So it takes  already  a long time to select the patients  do the treatment and evaluate if it's useful to do this kind of treatment. And then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial. You have to really prove first that it's useful before offering this treatment up for everybody. BG  And safe  of course. JB  Of course. BG  Jocelyne  thank you for coming to TED and sharing this. BG  Thank you. All right  I want to see a show of hands  how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something offensive about politics or religion  childcare  food  And how many of you know at least one person that you avoid because you just don't want to talk to them  You know  it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation  we just had to follow the advice of Henry Higgins in  My Fair Lady   Stick to the weather and your health. But these days  with climate change and anti vaxxing  those subjects    are not safe either. So this world that we live in  this world in which every conversation has the potential to devolve into an argument  where our politicians can't speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it  it's not normal. Pew Research did a study of        American adults  and they found that at this moment  we are more polarized  we are more divided  than we ever have been in history. We're less likely to compromise  which means we're not listening to each other. And we make decisions about where to live  who to marry and even who our friends are going to be  based on what we already believe. Again  that means we're not listening to each other. A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening  and somewhere along the way  we lost that balance. Now  part of that is due to technology. The smartphones that you all either have in your hands or close enough that you could grab them really quickly. According to Pew Research  about a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day. And many of them  almost most of them  are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face. There's this great piece in The Atlantic. It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell. And he gave his kids a communication project. He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes. And he said this   I came to realize...   I came to realize that conversational competence might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach. Kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens  but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal communications skills. It might sound like a funny question  but we have to ask ourselves  Is there any   st century skill more important than being able to sustain coherent  confident conversation   Now  I make my living talking to people  Nobel Prize winners  truck drivers  billionaires  kindergarten teachers  heads of state  plumbers. I talk to people that I like. I talk to people that I don't like. I talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level. But I still have a great conversation with them. So I'd like to spend the next    minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen. Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this  things like look the person in the eye  think of interesting topics to discuss in advance  look  nod and smile to show that you're paying attention  repeat back what you just heard or summarize it. So I want you to forget all of that. It is crap. There is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention. Now  I actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer that I do in regular life. So  I'm going to teach you how to interview people  and that's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists. Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time  without getting bored  and  please God  without offending anybody. We've all had really great conversations. We've had them before. We know what it's like. The kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired  or where you feel like you've made a real connection or you've been perfectly understood. There is no reason why most of your interactions can't be like that. So I have    basic rules. I'm going to walk you through all of them  but honestly  if you just choose one of them and master it  you'll already enjoy better conversations. Number one  Don't multitask. And I don't mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand. I mean  be present. Be in that moment. Don't think about your argument you had with your boss. Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner. If you want to get out of the conversation  get out of the conversation  but don't be half in it and half out of it. Number two  Don't pontificate. If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth  write a blog. Now  there's a really good reason why I don't allow pundits on my show  Because they're really boring. If they're conservative  they're going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion. If they're liberal  they're going to hate big banks and oil corporations and Dick Cheney. Totally predictable. And you don't want to be like that. You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn. The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself. And sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion. He said that sensing this acceptance  the speaker will become less and less vulnerable and more and more likely to open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener. Again  assume that you have something to learn. Bill Nye   Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't.  I put it this way  Everybody is an expert in something. Number three  Use open ended questions. In this case  take a cue from journalists. Start your questions with who  what  when  where  why or how. If you put in a complicated question  you're going to get a simple answer out. If I ask you   Were you terrified   you're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence  which is  terrified   and the answer is  Yes  I was  or  No  I wasn't.   Were you angry    Yes  I was very angry.  Let them describe it. They're the ones that know. Try asking them things like   What was that like    How did that feel   Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it  and you're going to get a much more interesting response. Number four  Go with the flow. That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind. We've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere  or it's already been answered. That means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question  and he was just bound and determined to say that. And we do the exact same thing. We're sitting there having a conversation with someone  and then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop. And we stop listening. Stories and ideas are going to come to you. You need to let them come and let them go. Number five  If you don't know  say that you don't know. Now  people on the radio  especially on NPR  are much more aware that they're going on the record  and so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure. Do that. Err on the side of caution. Talk should not be cheap. Number six  Don't equate your experience with theirs. If they're talking about having lost a family member  don't start talking about the time you lost a family member. If they're talking about the trouble they're having at work  don't tell them about how much you hate your job. It's not the same. It is never the same. All experiences are individual. And  more importantly  it is not about you. You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you've suffered. Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was  and he said   I have no idea. People who brag about their IQs are losers.  Conversations are not a promotional opportunity. Number seven  Try not to repeat yourself. It's condescending  and it's really boring  and we tend to do it a lot. Especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids  we have a point to make  so we just keep rephrasing it over and over. Don't do that. Number eight  Stay out of the weeds. Frankly  people don't care about the years  the names  the dates  all those details that you're struggling to come up with in your mind. They don't care. What they care about is you. They care about what you're like  what you have in common. So forget the details. Leave them out. Number nine  This is not the last one  but it is the most important one. Listen. I cannot tell you how many really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most  the number one most important skill that you could develop. Buddha said  and I'm paraphrasing   If your mouth is open  you're not learning.  And Calvin Coolidge said   No man ever listened his way out of a job.  Why do we not listen to each other  Number one  we'd rather talk. When I'm talking  I'm in control. I don't have to hear anything I'm not interested in. I'm the center of attention. I can bolster my own identity. But there's another reason  We get distracted. The average person talks at about     word per minute  but we can listen at up to     words per minute. So our minds are filling in those other     words. And look  I know  it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone  but if you can't do that  you're not in a conversation. You're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place. You have to listen to one another. Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. He said   Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand. We listen with the intent to reply.  One more rule  number     and it's this one  Be brief.  A good conversation is like a miniskirt  short enough to retain interest  but long enough to cover the subject.    My Sister  All of this boils down to the same basic concept  and it is this one  Be interested in other people. You know  I grew up with a very famous grandfather  and there was kind of a ritual in my home. People would come over to talk to my grandparents  and after they would leave  my mother would come over to us  and she'd say   Do you know who that was  She was the runner up to Miss America. He was the mayor of Sacramento. She won a Pulitzer Prize. He's a Russian ballet dancer.  And I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden  amazing thing about them. And honestly  I think it's what makes me a better host. I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can  I keep my mind open  and I'm always prepared to be amazed  and I'm never disappointed. You do the same thing. Go out  talk to people  listen to people  and  most importantly  be prepared to be amazed. Thanks. So a while ago  I tried an experiment. For one year  I would say yes to all the things that scared me. Anything that made me nervous  took me out of my comfort zone  I forced myself to say yes to. Did I want to speak in public  No  but yes. Did I want to be on live TV  No  but yes. Did I want to try acting  No  no  no  but yes  yes  yes. And a crazy thing happened  the very act of doing the thing that scared me undid the fear  made it not scary. My fear of public speaking  my social anxiety  poof  gone. It's amazing  the power of one word.  Yes  changed my life.  Yes  changed me. But there was one particular yes that affected my life in the most profound way  in a way I never imagined  and it started with a question from my toddler. I have these three amazing daughters  Harper  Beckett and Emerson  and Emerson is a toddler who inexplicably refers to everyone as  honey.  as though she's a Southern waitress.  Honey  I'm gonna need some milk for my sippy cup.  The Southern waitress asked me to play with her one evening when I was on my way somewhere  and I said   Yes.  And that yes was the beginning of a new way of life for my family. I made a vow that from now on  every time one of my children asks me to play  no matter what I'm doing or where I'm going  I say yes  every single time. Almost. I'm not perfect at it  but I try hard to practice it. And it's had a magical effect on me  on my children  on our family. But it's also had a stunning side effect  and it wasn't until recently that I fully understood it  that I understood that saying yes to playing with my children likely saved my career. See  I have what most people would call a dream job. I'm a writer. I imagine. I make stuff up for a living. Dream job. No. I'm a titan. Dream job. I create television. I executive produce television. I make television  a great deal of television. In one way or another  this TV season  I'm responsible for bringing about    hours of programming to the world. Four television programs     hours of TV    Three shows in production at a time  sometimes four. Each show creates hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before. The budget for one episode of network television can be anywhere from three to six million dollars. Let's just say five. A new episode made every nine days times four shows  so every nine days that's    million dollars worth of television  four television programs     hours of TV  three shows in production at a time  sometimes four     episodes going on at all times     episodes of  Grey's      episodes of  Scandal      episodes of  How To Get Away With Murder      episodes of  The Catch   that's    hours of TV  that's     million dollars for a season. In America  my television shows are back to back to back on Thursday night. Around the world  my shows air in     territories in    languages for an audience of    million people. My brain is global  and    hours of that    hours of TV are shows I personally created and not just produced  so on top of everything else  I need to find time  real quiet  creative time  to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories. Four television programs     hours of TV  three shows in production at a time  sometimes four      million dollars  campfires burning all over the world. You know who else is doing that  Nobody  so like I said  I'm a titan. Dream job. Now  I don't tell you this to impress you. I tell you this because I know what you think of when you hear the word  writer.  I tell you this so that all of you out there who work so hard  whether you run a company or a country or a classroom or a store or a home  take me seriously when I talk about working  so you'll get that I don't peck at a computer and imagine all day  so you'll hear me when I say that I understand that a dream job is not about dreaming. It's all job  all work  all reality  all blood  all sweat  no tears. I work a lot  very hard  and I love it. When I'm hard at work  when I'm deep in it  there is no other feeling. For me  my work is at all times building a nation out of thin air. It is manning the troops. It is painting a canvas. It is hitting every high note. It is running a marathon. It is being Beyonc . And it is all of those things at the same time. I love working. It is creative and mechanical and exhausting and exhilarating and hilarious and disturbing and clinical and maternal and cruel and judicious  and what makes it all so good is the hum. There is some kind of shift inside me when the work gets good. A hum begins in my brain  and it grows and it grows and that hum sounds like the open road  and I could drive it forever. And a lot of people  when I try to explain the hum  they assume that I'm talking about the writing  that my writing brings me joy. And don't get me wrong  it does. But the hum    it wasn't until I started making television that I started working  working and making and building and creating and collaborating  that I discovered this thing  this buzz  this rush  this hum. The hum is more than writing. The hum is action and activity. The hum is a drug. The hum is music. The hum is light and air. The hum is God's whisper right in my ear. And when you have a hum like that  you can't help but strive for greatness. That feeling  you can't help but strive for greatness at any cost. That's called the hum. Or  maybe it's called being a workaholic. Maybe it's called genius. Maybe it's called ego. Maybe it's just fear of failure. I don't know. I just know that I'm not built for failure  and I just know that I love the hum. I just know that I want to tell you I'm a titan  and I know that I don't want to question it. But here's the thing  the more successful I become  the more shows  the more episodes  the more barriers broken  the more work there is to do  the more balls in the air  the more eyes on me  the more history stares  the more expectations there are. The more I work to be successful  the more I need to work. And what did I say about work  I love working  right  The nation I'm building  the marathon I'm running  the troops  the canvas  the high note  the hum  the hum  the hum. I like that hum. I love that hum. I need that hum. I am that hum. Am I nothing but that hum  And then the hum stopped. Overworked  overused  overdone  burned out. The hum stopped. Now  my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single working titan. Harper tells people   My mom won't be there  but you can text my nanny.  And Emerson says   Honey  I'm wanting to go to ShondaLand.  They're children of a titan. They're baby titans. They were        and   when the hum stopped. The hum of the engine died. I stopped loving work. I couldn't restart the engine. The hum would not come back. My hum was broken. I was doing the same things I always did  all the same titan work     hour days  working straight through the weekends  no regrets  never surrender  a titan never sleeps  a titan never quits  full hearts  clear eyes  yada  whatever. But there was no hum. Inside me was silence. Four television programs     hours of TV  three shows in production at a time  sometimes four. Four television programs     hours of TV  three shows in production at a time ... I was the perfect titan. I was a titan you could take home to your mother. All the colors were the same  and I was no longer having any fun. And it was my life. It was all I did. I was the hum  and the hum was me. So what do you do when the thing you do  the work you love  starts to taste like dust  Now  I know somebody's out there thinking   Cry me a river  stupid writer titan lady.  But you know  you do  if you make  if you work  if you love what you do  being a teacher  being a banker  being a mother  being a painter  being Bill Gates  if you simply love another person and that gives you the hum  if you know the hum  if you know what the hum feels like  if you have been to the hum  when the hum stops  who are you  What are you  What am I  Am I still a titan  If the song of my heart ceases to play  can I survive in the silence  And then my Southern waitress toddler asks me a question. I'm on my way out the door  I'm late  and she says   Momma  wanna play   And I'm just about to say no  when I realize two things. One  I'm supposed to say yes to everything  and two  my Southern waitress didn't call me  honey.  She's not calling everyone  honey  anymore. When did that happen  I'm missing it  being a titan and mourning my hum  and here she is changing right before my eyes. And so she says   Momma  wanna play   And I say   Yes.  There's nothing special about it. We play  and we're joined by her sisters  and there's a lot of laughing  and I give a dramatic reading from the book Everybody Poops. Nothing out of the ordinary. And yet  it is extraordinary  because in my pain and my panic  in the homelessness of my humlessness  I have nothing to do but pay attention. I focus. I am still. The nation I'm building  the marathon I'm running  the troops  the canvas  the high note does not exist. All that exists are sticky fingers and gooey kisses and tiny voices and crayons and that song about letting go of whatever it is that Frozen girl needs to let go of. It's all peace and simplicity. The air is so rare in this place for me that I can barely breathe. I can barely believe I'm breathing. Play is the opposite of work. And I am happy. Something in me loosens. A door in my brain swings open  and a rush of energy comes. And it's not instantaneous  but it happens  it does happen. I feel it. A hum creeps back. Not at full volume  barely there  it's quiet  and I have to stay very still to hear it  but it is there. Not the hum  but a hum. And now I feel like I know a very magical secret. Well  let's not get carried away. It's just love. That's all it is. No magic. No secret. It's just love. It's just something we forgot. The hum  the work hum  the hum of the titan  that's just a replacement. If I have to ask you who I am  if I have to tell you who I am  if I describe myself in terms of shows and hours of television and how globally badass my brain is  I have forgotten what the real hum is. The hum is not power and the hum is not work specific. The hum is joy specific. The real hum is love specific. The hum is the electricity that comes from being excited by life. The real hum is confidence and peace. The real hum ignores the stare of history  and the balls in the air  and the expectation  and the pressure. The real hum is singular and original. The real hum is God's whisper in my ear  but maybe God was whispering the wrong words  because which one of the gods was telling me I was the titan  It's just love. We could all use a little more love  a lot more love. Any time my child asks me to play  I will say yes. I make it a firm rule for one reason  to give myself permission  to free me from all of my workaholic guilt. It's a law  so I don't have a choice  and I don't have a choice  not if I want to feel the hum. I wish it were that easy  but I'm not good at playing. I don't like it. I'm not interested in doing it the way I'm interested in doing work. The truth is incredibly humbling and humiliating to face. I don't like playing. I work all the time because I like working. I like working more than I like being at home. Facing that fact is incredibly difficult to handle  because what kind of person likes working more than being at home  Well  me. I mean  let's be honest  I call myself a titan. I've got issues. And one of those issues isn't that I am too relaxed. We run around the yard  up and back and up and back. We have    second dance parties. We sing show tunes. We play with balls. I blow bubbles and they pop them. And I feel stiff and delirious and confused most of the time. I itch for my cell phone always. But it is OK. My tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up. I play and I play until I begin to wonder why we ever stop playing in the first place. You can do it too  say yes every time your child asks you to play. Are you thinking that maybe I'm an idiot in diamond shoes  You're right  but you can still do this. You have time. You know why  Because you're not Rihanna and you're not a Muppet. Your child does not think you're that interesting. You only need    minutes. My two  and four year old only ever want to play with me for about    minutes or so before they think to themselves they want to do something else. It's an amazing    minutes  but it's    minutes. If I'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy  I'm invisible after    minutes. And my    year old  if I can get a    year old to talk to me for    minutes I'm Parent of the Year.    minutes is all you need. I can totally pull off    minutes of uninterrupted time on my worst day. Uninterrupted is the key. No cell phone  no laundry  no anything. You have a busy life. You have to get dinner on the table. You have to force them to bathe. But you can do    minutes. My kids are my happy place  they're my world  but it doesn't have to be your kids  the fuel that feeds your hum  the place where life feels more good than not good. It's not about playing with your kids  it's about joy. It's about playing in general. Give yourself the    minutes. Find what makes you feel good. Just figure it out and play in that arena. I'm not perfect at it. In fact  I fail as often as I succeed  seeing friends  reading books  staring into space.  Wanna play   starts to become shorthand for indulging myself in ways I'd given up on right around the time I got my first TV show  right around the time I became a titan in training  right around the time I started competing with myself for ways unknown.    minutes  What could be wrong with giving myself my full attention for    minutes  Turns out  nothing. The very act of not working has made it possible for the hum to return  as if the hum's engine could only refuel while I was away. Work doesn't work without play. It takes a little time  but after a few months  one day the floodgates open and there's a rush  and I find myself standing in my office filled with an unfamiliar melody  full on groove inside me  and around me  and it sends me spinning with ideas  and the humming road is open  and I can drive it and drive it  and I love working again. But now  I like that hum  but I don't love that hum. I don't need that hum. I am not that hum. That hum is not me  not anymore. I am bubbles and sticky fingers and dinners with friends. I am that hum. Life's hum. Love's hum. Work's hum is still a piece of me  it is just no longer all of me  and I am so grateful. And I don't give a crap about being a titan  because I have never once seen a titan play Red Rover  Red Rover. I said yes to less work and more play  and somehow I still run my world. My brain is still global. My campfires still burn. The more I play  the happier I am  and the happier my kids are. The more I play  the more I feel like a good mother. The more I play  the freer my mind becomes. The more I play  the better I work. The more I play  the more I feel the hum  the nation I'm building  the marathon I'm running  the troops  the canvas  the high note  the hum  the hum  the other hum  the real hum  life's hum. The more I feel that hum  the more this strange  quivering  uncocooned  awkward  brand new  alive non titan feels like me. The more I feel that hum  the more I know who I am. I'm a writer  I make stuff up  I imagine. That part of the job  that's living the dream. That's the dream of the job. Because a dream job should be a little bit dreamy. I said yes to less work and more play. Titans need not apply. Wanna play  Thank you.  .  billion years ago  in a distant  distant galaxy  two black holes locked into a spiral  falling inexorably towards each other and collided  converting three Suns' worth of stuff into pure energy in a tenth of a second. For that brief moment in time  the glow was brighter than all the stars in all the galaxies in all of the known Universe. It was a very big bang. But they didn't release their energy in light. I mean  you know  they're black holes. All that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself  making the Universe explode in gravitational waves. Let me give you a sense of the timescale at work here.  .  billion years ago  Earth had just managed to evolve multicellular life. Since then  Earth has made and evolved corals  fish  plants  dinosaurs  people and even    God save us    the Internet. And about    years ago  a particularly audacious set of people    Rai Weiss at MIT  Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever at Caltech    decided that it would be really neat to build a giant laser detector with which to search for the gravitational waves from things like colliding black holes. Now  most people thought they were nuts. But enough people realized that they were brilliant nuts that the US National Science Foundation decided to fund their crazy idea. So after decades of development  construction and imagination and a breathtaking amount of hard work  they built their detector  called LIGO  The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory. For the last several years  LIGO's been undergoing a huge expansion in its accuracy  a tremendous improvement in its detection ability. It's now called Advanced LIGO as a result. In early September of       LIGO turned on for a final test run while they sorted out a few lingering details. And on September    of       just days after the detector had gone live  the gravitational waves from those colliding black holes passed through the Earth. And they passed through you and me. And they passed through the detector. more emotionally intense than that. One is the birth of my daughter. The other is when I had to say goodbye to my father when he was terminally ill. You know  it was the payoff of my career  basically. Everything I'd been working on    it's no longer science fiction   Laughs  Allan Adams  So that's my very good friend and collaborator  Scott Hughes  a theoretical physicist at MIT  who has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and the signals that they could impart on observatories like LIGO  for the past    years. So let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gravitational wave. A gravitational wave is a ripple in the shape of space and time. As the wave passes by  it stretches space and everything in it in one direction  and compresses it in the other. This has led to countless instructors of general relativity doing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity.  It stretches and expands  it stretches and expands.  So the trouble with gravitational waves is that they're very weak  they're preposterously weak. For example  the waves that hit us on September       and yes  every single one of you stretched and compressed under the action of that wave    when the waves hit  they stretched the average person by one part in    to the   . That's a decimal place     zeroes  and a one. That's why everyone thought the LIGO people were nuts. Even with a laser detector five kilometers long    and that's already crazy    they would have to measure the length of those detectors to less than one thousandth of the radius of the nucleus of an atom. And that's preposterous. So towards the end of his classic text on gravity  LIGO co founder Kip Thorne described the hunt for gravitational waves as follows  He said   The technical difficulties to be surmounted in constructing such detectors are enormous. But physicists are ingenious  and with the support of a broad lay public  all obstacles will surely be overcome.  Thorne published that in          years before he succeeded. Now  coming back to LIGO  Scott likes to say that LIGO acts like an ear more than it does like an eye. I want to explain what that means. Visible light has a wavelength  a size  that's much smaller than the things around you  the features on people's faces  the size of your cell phone. And that's really useful  because it lets you make an image or a map of the things around you  by looking at the light coming from different spots in the scene about you. Sound is different. Audible sound has a wavelength that can be up to    feet long. And that makes it really difficult    in fact  in practical purposes  impossible    to make an image of something you really care about. Your child's face. Instead  we use sound to listen for features like pitch and tone and rhythm and volume to infer a story behind the sounds. That's Alice talking. That's Bob interrupting. Silly Bob. So  the same is true of gravitational waves. We can't use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe. But by listening to changes in the amplitude and frequency of those waves  we can hear the story that those waves are telling. And at least for LIGO  the frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band. So if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air  into sound  we can literally hear the Universe speaking to us. For example  listening to gravity  just in this way  can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes  something my colleague Scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about. you get a very simple chirp  whoop  If the two bodies are spinning very rapidly  I have that same chirp  but with a modulation on top of it  so it kind of goes  whir  whir  whir  It's sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform. AA  So on September           a date that's definitely going to live in my memory  LIGO heard this   Whirring sound  So if you know how to listen  that is the sound of    that were whirling around at a rate comparable to what goes on in your blender. AA  It's worth pausing here to think about what that means. Two black holes  the densest thing in the Universe  one with a mass of    Suns and one with a mass of    Suns  whirling around each other     times per second before they collide. Just imagine the power of that. It's fantastic. And we know it because we heard it. That's the lasting importance of LIGO. It's an entirely new way to observe the Universe that we've never had before. It's a way that lets us hear the Universe and hear the invisible. And there's a lot out there that we can't see    in practice or even in principle. So supernova  for example  I would love to know why very massive stars explode in supernovae. They're very useful  we've learned a lot about the Universe from them. The problem is  all the interesting physics happens in the core  and the core is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron and carbon and silicon. We'll never see through it  it's opaque to light. Gravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass    totally transparent. The Big Bang  I would love to be able to explore the first few moments of the Universe  but we'll never see them  because the Big Bang itself is obscured by its own afterglow. With gravitational waves  we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning. Perhaps most importantly  I'm positive that there are things out there that we've never seen that we may never be able to see and that we haven't even imagined    things that we'll only discover by listening. And in fact  even in that very first event  LIGO found things that we didn't expect. Here's my colleague and one of the key members of the LIGO collaboration  Matt Evans  my colleague at MIT  addressing exactly that  that we observed here are the dinosaurs of the Universe. They're these massive things that are old  from prehistoric times  and the black holes are kind of like the dinosaur bones with which we do this archeology. So it lets us really get a whole nother angle on what's out there in the Universe and how the stars came to be  and in the end  of course  how we came to be out of this whole mess. AA  Our challenge now is to be as audacious as possible. Thanks to LIGO  we know how to build exquisite detectors that can listen to the Universe  to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos. Our job is to dream up and build new observatories    a whole new generation of observatories    on the ground  in space. I mean  what could be more glorious than listening to the Big Bang itself  Our job now is to dream big. Dream with us. Thank you. What started as a platform for hobbyists is poised to become a multibillion dollar industry. Inspection  environmental monitoring  photography and film and journalism  these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones  and their enablers are the capabilities being developed at research facilities around the world. For example  before aerial package delivery entered our social consciousness  an autonomous fleet of flying machines built a six meter tall tower composed of       bricks in front of a live audience at the FRAC Centre in France  and several years ago  they started to fly with ropes. By tethering flying machines  they can achieve high speeds and accelerations in very tight spaces. They can also autonomously build tensile structures. Skills learned include how to carry loads  how to cope with disturbances  and in general  how to interact with the physical world. Today we want to show you some new projects that we've been working on. Their aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved with autonomous flight. Now  for a system to function autonomously  it must collectively know the location of its mobile objects in space. Back at our lab at ETH Zurich  we often use external cameras to locate objects  which then allows us to focus our efforts on the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks. For the demos you will see today  however  we will use new localization technology developed by Verity Studios  a spin off from our lab. There are no external cameras. Each flying machine uses onboard sensors to determine its location in space and onboard computation to determine what its actions should be. The only external commands are high level ones such as  take off  and  land.  This is a so called tail sitter. It's an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it. Like other fixed wing aircraft  it is efficient in forward flight  much more so than helicopters and variations thereof. Unlike most other fixed wing aircraft  however  it is capable of hovering  which has huge advantages for takeoff  landing and general versatility. There is no free lunch  unfortunately. One of the limitations with tail sitters is that they're susceptible to disturbances such as wind gusts. We're developing new control architectures and algorithms that address this limitation. The idea is for the aircraft to recover no matter what state it finds itself in  and through practice  improve its performance over time. OK. When doing research  we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that try to get at the heart of a matter. For example  one such question would be  what is the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight  Now  there are practical reasons why you may want to know the answer to such a question. Helicopters  for example  are affectionately known as machines with a thousand moving parts all conspiring to do you bodily harm. It turns out that decades ago  skilled pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts  a propeller and a tail rudder. We recently discovered that it could be done with just one. This is the monospinner  the world's mechanically simplest controllable flying machine  invented just a few months ago. It has only one moving part  a propeller. It has no flaps  no hinges  no ailerons  no other actuators  no other control surfaces  just a simple propeller. Even though it's mechanically simple  there's a lot going on in its little electronic brain to allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space. Even so  it doesn't yet have the sophisticated algorithms of the tail sitter  which means that in order to get it to fly  I have to throw it just right. And because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low  given everybody watching me  what we're going to do instead is show you a video that we shot last night. If the monospinner is an exercise in frugality  this machine here  the omnicopter  with its eight propellers  is an exercise in excess. What can you do with all this surplus  The thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric. As a result  it is ambivalent to orientation. This gives it an extraordinary capability. It can move anywhere it wants in space irrespective of where it is facing and even of how it is rotating. It has its own complexities  mainly having to do with the interacting flows from its eight propellers. Some of this can be modeled  while the rest can be learned on the fly. Let's take a look. If flying machines are going to enter part of our daily lives  they will need to become extremely safe and reliable. This machine over here is actually two separate two propeller flying machines. This one wants to spin clockwise. This other one wants to spin counterclockwise. When you put them together  they behave like one high performance quadrocopter. If anything goes wrong  however    a motor fails  a propeller fails  electronics  even a battery pack    the machine can still fly  albeit in a degraded fashion. We're going to demonstrate this to you now by disabling one of its halves. This last demonstration is an exploration of synthetic swarms. The large number of autonomous  coordinated entities offers a new palette for aesthetic expression. We've taken commercially available micro quadcopters  each weighing less than a slice of bread  by the way  and outfitted them with our localization technology and custom algorithms. Because each unit knows where it is in space and is self controlled  there is really no limit to their number. Hopefully  these demonstrations will motivate you to dream up new revolutionary roles for flying machines. That ultrasafe one over there for example has aspirations to become a flying lampshade on Broadway. The reality is that it is difficult to predict the impact of nascent technology. And for folks like us  the real reward is the journey and the act of creation. It's a continual reminder of how wonderful and magical the universe we live in is  that it allows creative  clever creatures to sculpt it in such spectacular ways. The fact that this technology has such huge commercial and economic potential is just icing on the cake. Thank you. I was excited to be a part of the  Dream  theme  and then I found out I'm leading off the  Nightmare   section of it. And certainly there are things about the climate crisis that qualify. And I have some bad news  but I have a lot more good news. I'm going to propose three questions and the answer to the first one necessarily involves a little bad news. But    hang on  because the answers to the second and third questions really are very positive. So the first question is   Do we really have to change   And of course  the Apollo Mission  among other things changed the environmental movement  really launched the modern environmental movement.    months after this Earthrise picture was first seen on earth  the first Earth Day was organized. And we learned a lot about ourselves looking back at our planet from space. And one of the things that we learned confirmed what the scientists have long told us. One of the most essential facts about the climate crisis has to do with the sky. As this picture illustrates  the sky is not the vast and limitless expanse that appears when we look up from the ground. It is a very thin shell of atmosphere surrounding the planet. That right now is the open sewer for our industrial civilization as it's currently organized. We are spewing     million tons of heat trapping global warming pollution into it every    hours  free of charge  go ahead. And there are many sources of the greenhouse gases  I'm certainly not going to go through them all. I'm going to focus on the main one  but agriculture is involved  diet is involved  population is involved. Management of forests  transportation  the oceans  the melting of the permafrost. But I'm going to focus on the heart of the problem  which is the fact that we still rely on dirty  carbon based fuels for    percent of all the energy that our world burns every year. And you can see from this image that after World War II  the emission rates started really accelerating. And the accumulated amount of man made  global warming pollution that is up in the atmosphere now traps as much extra heat energy as would be released by         Hiroshima class atomic bombs exploding every    hours      days a year. Fact checked over and over again  conservative  it's the truth. Now it's a big planet  but    that is a lot of energy  particularly when you multiply it         times per day. And all that extra heat energy is heating up the atmosphere  the whole earth system. Let's look at the atmosphere. This is a depiction of what we used to think of as the normal distribution of temperatures. The white represents normal temperature days            are arbitrarily chosen. The blue are cooler than average days  the red are warmer than average days. But the entire curve has moved to the right in the     s. And you'll see in the lower right hand corner the appearance of statistically significant numbers of extremely hot days. In the   s  the curve shifted further. And in the last    years  you see the extremely hot days are now more numerous than the cooler than average days. In fact  they are     times more common on the surface of the earth than they were just    years ago. So we're having record breaking temperatures. Fourteen of the    of the hottest years ever measured with instruments have been in this young century. The hottest of all was last year. Last month was the    st month in a row warmer than the   th century average. And for the first time  not only the warmest January  but for the first time  it was more than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the average. These higher temperatures are having an effect on animals  plants  people  ecosystems. But on a global basis     percent of all the extra heat energy is trapped in the oceans. And the scientists can measure the heat buildup much more precisely now at all depths  deep  mid ocean  the first few hundred meters. And this  too  is accelerating. It goes back more than a century. And more than half of the increase has been in the last    years. This has consequences. The first order of consequence  the ocean based storms get stronger. Super Typhoon Haiyan went over areas of the Pacific five and a half degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal before it slammed into Tacloban  as the most destructive storm ever to make landfall. Pope Francis  who has made such a difference to this whole issue  visited Tacloban right after that. Superstorm Sandy went over areas of the Atlantic nine degrees warmer than normal before slamming into New York and New Jersey. The second order of consequences are affecting all of us right now. The warmer oceans are evaporating much more water vapor into the skies. Average humidity worldwide has gone up four percent. And it creates these atmospheric rivers. The Brazilian scientists call them  flying rivers.  And they funnel all of that extra water vapor over the land where storm conditions trigger these massive record breaking downpours. This is from Montana. Take a look at this storm last August. As it moves over Tucson  Arizona. It literally splashes off the city. These downpours are really unusual. Last July in Houston  Texas  it rained for two days      billion gallons. That represents more than two days of the full flow of Niagara Falls in the middle of the city  which was  of course  paralyzed. These record downpours are creating historic floods and mudslides. This one is from Chile last year. And you'll see that warehouse going by. There are oil tankers cars going by. This is from Spain last September  you could call this the running of the cars and trucks  I guess. Every night on the TV news now is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation. I mean  really. The insurance industry has certainly noticed  the losses have been mounting up. They're not under any illusions about what's happening. And the causality requires a moment of discussion. We're used to thinking of linear cause and linear effect    one cause  one effect. This is systemic causation. As the great Kevin Trenberth says   All storms are different now. There's so much extra energy in the atmosphere  there's so much extra water vapor. Every storm is different now.  So  the same extra heat pulls the soil moisture out of the ground and causes these deeper  longer  more pervasive droughts and many of them are underway right now. It dries out the vegetation and causes more fires in the western part of North America. There's certainly been evidence of that  a lot of them. More lightning  as the heat energy builds up  there's a considerable amount of additional lightning also. These climate related disasters also have geopolitical consequences and create instability. The climate related historic drought that started in Syria in      destroyed    percent of the farms in Syria  killed    percent of the livestock  and drove  .  million climate refugees into the cities of Syria  where they collided with another  .  million refugees from the Iraq War. And along with other factors  that opened the gates of Hell that people are trying to close now. The US Defense Department has long warned of consequences from the climate crisis  including refugees  food and water shortages and pandemic disease. Right now we're seeing microbial diseases from the tropics spread to the higher latitudes  the transportation revolution has had a lot to do with this. But the changing conditions change the latitudes and the areas where these microbial diseases can become endemic and change the range of the vectors  like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them. The Zika epidemic now    we're better positioned in North America because it's still a little too cool and we have a better public health system. But when women in some regions of South and Central America are advised not to get pregnant for two years    that's something new  that ought to get our attention. The Lancet  one of the two greatest medical journals in the world  last summer labeled this a medical emergency now. And there are many factors because of it. This is also connected to the extinction crisis. We're in danger of losing    percent of all the living species on earth by the end of this century. And already  land based plants and animals are now moving towards the poles at an average rate of    feet per day. Speaking of the North Pole  last December     the same storm that caused historic flooding in the American Midwest  raised temperatures at the North Pole    degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal  causing the thawing of the North Pole in the middle of the long  dark  winter  polar night. And when the land based ice of the Arctic melts  it raises sea level. Paul Nicklen's beautiful photograph from Svalbard illustrates this. It's more dangerous coming off Greenland and particularly  Antarctica. The    largest risk cities for sea level rise by population are mostly in South and Southeast Asia. When you measure it by assets at risk  number one is Miami  three and a half trillion dollars at risk. Number three  New York and Newark. I was in Miami last fall during the supermoon  one of the highest high tide days. And there were fish from the ocean swimming in some of the streets of Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale and Del Rey. And this happens regularly during the highest tide tides now. Not with rain    they call it  sunny day flooding.  It comes up through the storm sewers. And the Mayor of Miami speaks for many when he says it is long past time this can be viewed through a partisan lens. This is a crisis that's getting worse day by day. We have to move beyond partisanship. And I want to take a moment to honor these House Republicans    who had the courage last fall to step out and take a political risk  by telling the truth about the climate crisis. So the cost of the climate crisis is mounting up  there are many of these aspects I haven't even mentioned. It's an enormous burden. I'll mention just one more  because the World Economic Forum last month in Davos  after their annual survey of     economists  said the climate crisis is now the number one risk to the global economy. So you get central bankers like Mark Carney  the head of the UK Central Bank  saying the vast majority of the carbon reserves are unburnable. Subprime carbon. I'm not going to remind you what happened with subprime mortgages  but it's the same thing. If you look at all of the carbon fuels that were burned since the beginning of the industrial revolution  this is the quantity burned in the last    years. Here are all the ones that are proven and left on the books     trillion dollars. The International Energy Agency says only this amount can be burned. So the rest     trillion dollars    unburnable. Risk to the global economy. That's why divestment movement makes practical sense and is not just a moral imperative. So the answer to the first question   Must we change   is yes  we have to change. Second question   Can we change   This is the exciting news  The best projections in the world    years ago were that by       the world would be able to install    gigawatts of wind capacity. We beat that mark by    and a half times over. We see an exponential curve for wind installations now. We see the cost coming down dramatically. Some countries    take Germany  an industrial powerhouse with a climate not that different from Vancouver's  by the way    one day last December  got    percent of all its energy from renewable resources  mainly solar and wind. A lot of countries are getting more than half on an average basis. More good news  energy storage  from batteries particularly  is now beginning to take off because the cost has been coming down very dramatically to solve the intermittency problem. With solar  the news is even more exciting  The best projections    years ago were that we would install one gigawatt per year by     . When      came around  we beat that mark by    times over. Last year  we beat it by    times over. This year  we're on track to beat it    times over. We're going to win this. We are going to prevail. The exponential curve on solar is even steeper and more dramatic. When I came to this stage    years ago  this is where it was. We have seen a revolutionary breakthrough in the emergence of these exponential curves. And the cost has come down    percent per year for    years. And it's continuing to come down. Now  the business community has certainly noticed this  because it's crossing the grid parity point. Cheaper solar penetration rates are beginning to rise. Grid parity is understood as that line  that threshold  below which renewable electricity is cheaper than electricity from burning fossil fuels. That threshold is a little bit like the difference between    degrees Fahrenheit and    degrees Fahrenheit  or zero and one Celsius. It's a difference of more than one degree  it's the difference between ice and water. And it's the difference between markets that are frozen up  and liquid flows of capital into new opportunities for investment. This is the biggest new business opportunity in the history of the world  and two thirds of it is in the private sector. We are seeing an explosion of new investment. Starting in       investments globally in renewable electricity generation surpassed fossils. The gap has been growing ever since. The projections for the future are even more dramatic  even though fossil energy is now still subsidized at a rate    times larger than renewables. And by the way  if you add the projections for nuclear on here  particularly if you assume that the work many are doing to try to break through to safer and more acceptable  more affordable forms of nuclear  this could change even more dramatically. So is there any precedent for such a rapid adoption of a new technology  Well  there are many  but let's look at cell phones. In       AT T  then Ma Bell  commissioned McKinsey to do a global market survey of those clunky new mobile phones that appeared then.  How many can we sell by the year        they asked. McKinsey came back and said          .  And sure enough  when the year      arrived  they did sell            in the first three days. And for the balance of the year  they sold     times more. And now there are more cell connections than there are people in the world. So  why were they not only wrong  but way wrong  I've asked that question myself   Why   And I think the answer is in three parts. First  the cost came down much faster than anybody expected  even as the quality went up. And low income countries  places that did not have a landline grid    they leap frogged to the new technology. The big expansion has been in the developing counties. So what about the electricity grids in the developing world  Well  not so hot. And in many areas  they don't exist. There are more people without any electricity at all in India than the entire population of the United States of America. So now we're getting this  solar panels on grass huts and new business models that make it affordable. Muhammad Yunus financed this one in Bangladesh with micro credit. This is a village market. Bangladesh is now the fastest deploying country in the world  two systems per minute on average  night and day. And we have all we need  enough energy from the Sun comes to the earth every hour to supply the full world's energy needs for an entire year. It's actually a little bit less than an hour. So the answer to the second question   Can we change   is clearly  Yes.  And it's an ever firmer  yes.  Last question   Will we change   Paris really was a breakthrough  some of the provisions are binding and the regular reviews will matter a lot. But nations aren't waiting  they're going ahead. China has already announced that starting next year  they're adopting a nationwide cap and trade system. They will likely link up with the European Union. The United States has already been changing. All of these coal plants were proposed in the next    years and canceled. All of these existing coal plants were retired. All of these coal plants have had their retirement announced. All of them    canceled. We are moving forward. Last year    if you look at all of the investment in new electricity generation in the United States  almost three quarters was from renewable energy  mostly wind and solar. We are solving this crisis. The only question is  how long will it take to get there  So  it matters that a lot of people are organizing to insist on this change. Almost         people marched in New York City before the UN special session on this. Many thousands  tens of thousands  marched in cities around the world. And so  I am extremely optimistic. As I said before  we are going to win this. I'll finish with this story. When I was    years old  I heard that proposal by President Kennedy to land a person on the Moon and bring him back safely in    years. And I heard adults of that day and time say   That's reckless  expensive  may well fail.  But eight years and two months later  in the moment that Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon  there was great cheer that went up in NASA's mission control in Houston. Here's a little known fact about that  the average age of the systems engineers  the controllers in the room that day  was     which means  among other things  their age  when they heard that challenge  was   . We now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have faced. One of the greatest poets of the last century in the US  Wallace Stevens  wrote a line that has stayed with me   After the final 'no ' there comes a 'yes ' and on that 'yes'  the future world depends.  When the abolitionists started their movement  they met with no after no after no. And then came a yes. The Women's Suffrage and Women's Rights Movement met endless no's  until finally  there was a yes. The Civil Rights Movement  the movement against apartheid  and more recently  the movement for gay and lesbian rights here in the United States and elsewhere. After the final  no  comes a  yes.  When any great moral challenge is ultimately resolved into a binary choice between what is right and what is wrong  the outcome is fore ordained because of who we are as human beings. Ninety nine percent of us  that is where we are now and it is why we're going to win this. We have everything we need. Some still doubt that we have the will to act  but I say the will to act is itself a renewable resource. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  You've got this incredible combination of skills. You've got this scientist mind that can understand the full range of issues  and the ability to turn it into the most vivid language. No one else can do that  that's why you led this thing. It was amazing to see it    years ago  it was amazing to see it now. Al Gore  Well  you're nice to say that  Chris. But honestly  I have a lot of really good friends in the scientific community who are incredibly patient and who will sit there and explain this stuff to me over and over and over again until I can get it into simple enough language that I can understand it. And that's the key to trying to communicate. CA  So  your talk. First part  terrifying  second part  incredibly hopeful. How do we know that all those graphs  all that progress  is enough to solve what you showed in the first part  AG  I think that the crossing    you know  I've only been in the business world for    years. But one of the things I've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is more expensive than the incumbent  or cheaper than. Turns out  it makes a difference if it's cheaper than. And when it crosses that line  then a lot of things really change. We are regularly surprised by these developments. The late Rudi Dornbusch  the great economist said   Things take longer to happen then you think they will  and then they happen much faster than you thought they could.  I really think that's where we are. Some people are using the phrase  The Solar Singularity  now  meaning when it gets below the grid parity  unsubsidized in most places  then it's the default choice. Now  in one of the presentations yesterday  the jitney thing  there is an effort to use regulations to slow this down. And I just don't think it's going to work. There's a woman in Atlanta  Debbie Dooley  who's the Chairman of the Atlanta Tea Party. They enlisted her in this effort to put a tax on solar panels and regulations. And she had just put solar panels on her roof and she didn't understand the request. And so she went and formed an alliance with the Sierra Club and they formed a new organization called the Green Tea Party. And they defeated the proposal. So  finally  the answer to your question is  this sounds a little corny and maybe it's a clich   but    years ago    and Christiana referred to this    there are people in this audience who played an incredibly significant role in generating those exponential curves. And it didn't work out economically for some of them  but it kick started this global revolution. And what people in this audience do now with the knowledge that we are going to win this. But it matters a lot how fast we win it. CA  Al Gore  that was incredibly powerful. If this turns out to be the year  that the partisan thing changes  as you said  it's no longer a partisan issue  but you bring along people from the other side together  backed by science  backed by these kinds of investment opportunities  backed by reason that you win the day    boy  that's really exciting. Thank you so much. AG  Thank you so much for bringing me back to TED. Thank you  What do you think when you look at me  A woman of faith  An expert  Maybe even a sister. Or oppressed  brainwashed  a terrorist. Or just an airport security line delay. That one's actually true. If some of your perceptions were negative  I don't really blame you. That's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that    percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show that Americans say that most don't know a Muslim. I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers. Well  for those of you who have never met a Muslim  it's great to meet you. Let me tell you who I am. I'm a mom  a coffee lover    double espresso  cream on the side. I'm an introvert. I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic. And I'm a practicing  spiritual Muslim. But not like Lady Gaga says  because baby  I wasn't born this way. It was a choice. When I was     I decided to come out. No  not as a gay person like some of my friends  but as a Muslim  and decided to start wearing the hijab  my head covering. My feminist friends were aghast   Why are you oppressing yourself   The funny thing was  it was actually at that time a feminist declaration of independence from the pressure I felt as a    year old  to conform to a perfect and unattainable standard of beauty. I didn't just passively accept the faith of my parents. I wrestled with the Quran. I read and reflected and questioned and doubted and  ultimately  believed. My relationship with God    it was not love at first sight. It was a trust and a slow surrender that deepened with every reading of the Quran. Its rhythmic beauty sometimes moves me to tears. I see myself in it. I feel that God knows me. Have you ever felt like someone sees you  completely understands you and yet loves you anyway  That's how it feels. And so later  I got married  and like all good Egyptians  started my career as an engineer. I later had a child  after getting married  and I was living essentially the Egyptian American dream. And then that terrible morning of September      . I think a lot of you probably remember exactly where you were that morning. I was sitting in my kitchen finishing breakfast  and I look up on the screen and see the words  Breaking News.  There was smoke  airplanes flying into buildings  people jumping out of buildings. What was this  An accident  A malfunction  My shock quickly turned to outrage. Who would do this  And I switch the channel and I hear   ... Muslim terrorist ...    ... in the name of Islam ...    ... Middle Eastern descent ...    ... jihad ...    ... we should bomb Mecca.  Oh my God. Not only had my country been attacked  but in a flash  somebody else's actions had turned me from a citizen to a suspect. That same day  we had to drive across Middle America to move to a new city to start grad school. And I remember sitting in the passenger seat as we drove in silence  crouched as low as I could go in my seat  for the first time in my life  afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim. We moved into our apartment that night in a new town in what felt like a completely different world. And then I was hearing and seeing and reading warnings from national Muslim organizations saying things like   Be alert    Be aware    Stay in well lit areas    Don't congregate.  I stayed inside all week. And then it was Friday that same week  the day that Muslims congregate for worship. And again the warnings were   Don't go that first Friday  it could be a target.  And I was watching the news  wall to wall coverage. Emotions were so raw  understandably  and I was also hearing about attacks on Muslims  or people who were perceived to be Muslim  being pulled out and beaten in the street. Mosques were actually firebombed. And I thought  we should just stay home. And yet  something didn't feel right. Because those people who attacked our country attacked our country. I get it that people were angry at the terrorists. Guess what  So was I. And so to have to explain yourself all the time isn't easy. I don't mind questions. I love questions. It's the accusations that are tough. Today we hear people actually saying things like   There's a problem in this country  and it's called Muslims. When are we going to get rid of them   So  some people want to ban Muslims and close down mosques. They talk about my community kind of like we're a tumor in the body of America. And the only question is  are we malignant or benign  You know  a malignant tumor you extract altogether  and a benign tumor you just keep under surveillance. The choices don't make sense  because it's the wrong question. Muslims  like all other Americans  aren't a tumor in the body of America  we're a vital organ. Thank you. Muslims are inventors and teachers  first responders and Olympic athletes. Now  is closing down mosques going to make America safer  It might free up some parking spots  but it will not end terrorism. Going to a mosque regularly is actually linked to having more tolerant views of people of other faiths and greater civic engagement. And as one police chief in the Washington  DC area recently told me  people don't actually get radicalized at mosques. They get radicalized in their basement or bedroom  in front of a computer. And what you find about the radicalization process is it starts online  but the first thing that happens is the person gets cut off from their community  from even their family  so that the extremist group can brainwash them into believing that they  the terrorists  are the true Muslims  and everyone else who abhors their behavior and ideology are sellouts or apostates. So if we want to prevent radicalization  we have to keep people going to the mosque. Now  some will still argue Islam is a violent religion. After all  a group like ISIS bases its brutality on the Quran. Now  as a Muslim  as a mother  as a human being  I think we need to do everything we can to stop a group like ISIS. But we would be giving in to their narrative if we cast them as representatives of a faith of  .  billion people. Thank you. ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has to do with Christianity. Both groups claim to base their ideology on their holy book. But when you look at them  they're not motivated by what they read in their holy book. It's their brutality that makes them read these things into the scripture. Recently  a prominent imam told me a story that really took me aback. He said that a girl came to him because she was thinking of going to join ISIS. And I was really surprised and asked him  had she been in contact with a radical religious leader  And he said the problem was quite the opposite  that every cleric that she had talked to had shut her down and said that her rage  her sense of injustice in the world  was just going to get her in trouble. And so with nowhere to channel and make sense of this anger  she was a prime target to be exploited by extremists promising her a solution. What this imam did was to connect her back to God and to her community. He didn't shame her for her rage    instead  he gave her constructive ways to make real change in the world. What she learned at that mosque prevented her from going to join ISIS. I've told you a little bit about how Islamophobia affects me and my family. But how does it impact ordinary Americans  How does it impact everyone else  How does consuming fear    hours a day affect the health of our democracy  the health of our free thought  Well  one study    actually  several studies in neuroscience    show that when we're afraid  at least three things happen. We become more accepting of authoritarianism  conformity and prejudice. One study showed that when subjects were exposed to news stories that were negative about Muslims  they became more accepting of military attacks on Muslim countries and policies that curtail the rights of American Muslims. Now  this isn't just academic. When you look at when anti Muslim sentiment spiked between      and       it happened three times  but it wasn't around terrorist attacks. It was in the run up to the Iraq War and during two election cycles. So Islamophobia isn't just the natural response to Muslim terrorism as I would have expected. It can actually be a tool of public manipulation  eroding the very foundation of a free society  which is rational and well informed citizens. Muslims are like canaries in the coal mine. We might be the first to feel it  but the toxic air of fear is harming us all. And assigning collective guilt isn't just about having to explain yourself all the time. Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill  North Carolina  where they both went to school. Deah was an athlete. He was in dental school  talented  promising ... And his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest  most generous human being she knew. She was visiting him there and he showed her his resume  and she was amazed. She said   When did my baby brother become such an accomplished young man   Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and his new wife  their neighbor  Craig Stephen Hicks  murdered them  as well as Yusor's sister  Razan  who was visiting for the afternoon  in their apartment  execution style  after posting anti Muslim statements on his Facebook page. He shot Deah eight times. So bigotry isn't just immoral  it can even be lethal. So  back to my story. What happened after       Did we go to the mosque or did we play it safe and stay home  Well  we talked it over  and it might seem like a small decision  but to us  it was about what kind of America we wanted to leave for our kids  one that would control us by fear or one where we were practicing our religion freely. So we decided to go to the mosque. And we put my son in his car seat  buckled him in  and we drove silently  intensely  to the mosque. I took him out  I took off my shoes  I walked into the prayer hall and what I saw made me stop. The place was completely full. And then the imam made an announcement  thanking and welcoming our guests  because half the congregation were Christians  Jews  Buddhists  atheists  people of faith and no faith  who had come not to attack us  but to stand in solidarity with us. I just break down at this time. These people were there because they chose courage and compassion over panic and prejudice. What will you choose  What will you choose at this time of fear and bigotry  Will you play it safe  Or will you join those who say we are better than that  Thank you. Thank you so much. Helen Walters  So Dalia  you seem to have struck a chord. But I wonder  what would you say to those who might argue that you're giving a TED Talk  you're clearly a deep thinker  you work at a fancy think tank  you're an exception  you're not the rule. What would you say to those people  Dalia Mogahed  I would say  don't let this stage distract you  I'm completely ordinary. I'm not an exception. My story is not unusual. I am as ordinary as they come. When you look at Muslims around the world    and I've done this  I've done the largest study ever done on Muslims around the world    people want ordinary things. They want prosperity for their family  they want jobs and they want to live in peace. So I am not in any way an exception. When you meet people who seem like an exception to the rule  oftentimes it's that the rule is broken  not that they're an exception to it. HW  Thank you so much. Dalia Mogahed. I believe big institutions have unique potential to create change  and I believe that we as individuals have unique power to influence the direction that those institutions take. Now  these beliefs did not come naturally to me  because trusting big institutions  not really part of my family legacy. My mother escaped North Korea when she was    years old. To do so  she had to elude every big institution in her life  repressive governments  occupying armies and even armed border patrols. Later  when she decided she wanted to emigrate to the United States  she had to defy an entire culture that said the girls would never be the best and brightest. Only because her name happens to sound like a boy's was she able to finagle her way into the government immigration exam to come to the United States. Because of her bravery and passion  I've had all the opportunities that she never did  and that has made my story so different. Instead of running away from big institutions  I've actually run toward them. I've had the chance over the course of my career to work for The Wall Street Journal  the White House and now one of the largest financial institutions in the world  where I lead sustainable investing. Now  these institutions are like tankers  and working inside of them  I've come to appreciate what large wakes they can leave  and I've become convinced that the institution of the global capital markets  the nearly     trillion dollars of stocks and bonds in the world  that that may be one of our most powerful forces for positive social change at our disposal  if we ask it to be. Now  I know some of you are thinking  global capital markets  positive social change  not usually in the same sentence or even the same paragraph. I think many people think of the capital markets kind of like an ocean. It's a vast  impersonal  uncaring force of nature that is not affected by our wishes or desires. So the best that our little savings accounts or retirement accounts can do is to try to catch some waves in the good cycles and hope that we don't get inundated in the turbulent ones  but certainly our decisions on how to steer our little retirement accounts don't affect the tides  don't change the shape or size or direction of the waves. But why is that  Because actually  one third of this ocean of capital actually belongs to individuals like us  and most of the rest of the capital markets is controlled by the institutions that get their power and authority and their capital from us  as members  participants  beneficiaries  shareholders or citizens. So if we are the ultimate owners of the capital markets  why aren't we able to make our voices heard  Why can't we make some waves  So let me ask you a different question  did any of you buy fair trade coffee the last time you were at a supermarket or at Starbucks  OK. Do any of you go to the restaurant and order the sustainably farmed trout instead of the miso glazed Chilean sea bass that you really wish you could have  Do any of you drive hybrid cars or even electric cars  So why do we do these things  Right  One electric car doesn't amount to much in a fleet of  .  billion combustion engine vehicles. One fish is just one fish in the sea. And one cup of coffee doesn't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. But we do these things because we believe they matter  that our actions add up  that our choices might influence others and collectively  what an impact we can have. So  in my bag I have a coffee mug that I bought a couple of years ago. It's a reusable mug. It has all these things printed on it. Look at some of the things that are on it  that it says.  This one cup can be used again and again.   This one cup may inspire others to use one too.   This one cup helps save the planet.  I had no idea this plastic cup was so powerful. So why do we think that our choice of a four dollar shade grown fair trade artisanal cup of coffee in a reusable mug matters  but what we do with       dollars in our investment account for our IRA doesn't  Why can't we tell the supermarket and the capital markets that we care  that we care about fair labor standards  that we care about sustainable production methods and about healthy communities  Why aren't we voting with our investment dollars  but we would vote with our lattes  So I think it has something to do with the myths  the fables that we all carry around in our collective consciousness. Do you remember the Grimm's fairy tale about the magic porridge pot  If you said to the pot   Boil  little pot  boil   it would fill up with sweet porridge. And if you said   Stop  little pot  stop   it would stop. But if you got the words wrong  it wouldn't listen  and things could go terribly awry. So I think when it comes to markets  we have a little bit of a similar fable in our heads. We believe that the markets is this magic pot that obeys only one command  make more money. Only those words said exactly that way will make the pot fill up with gold. Add in some extra words like  protect the environment   the spell might not work. Put in the wrong words like  promote social justice   and you might see your gold coins shrink or even vanish entirely  according to this fable. So we asked people  what do you really think  And we actually went out and polled a thousand individual investors  and we found something fascinating. Overwhelmingly  people wanted to add those extra words into the formula.    percent of people said yes  they were interested in sustainable investing  which we define as taking the best in class investment process that you already have traditionally and adding in the extra information you get when you think about the environment and society and good governance.    percent wanted that.    percent said that they believe that companies who did that would actually do better financially. So people really do believe that you can do well by doing good. But here was the weird thing     percent of the people still said if they put their money in those kinds of stocks  they thought that they would make less money. So is it true  Do you get less sweet porridge if you invest in shade grown coffee instead of drinking it  Well  you know  the investors in companies like Burt's Bees or Ben   Jerry's wouldn't say so. Right  Both of those started out as small  socially conscious companies that ended up becoming so popular with consumers that the giants Unilever and Clorox bought them for hundreds of millions of dollars each. But here's the important thing. Those corporations realized that if they wanted to protect the value of their investments  they had to preserve that socially conscious mission. If they didn't keep adding in those extra words of environmentally friendly and socially conscious  those brands wouldn't make more money. But maybe this is just the exception the proves the rule  right  The serious companies that fund our economy and that fund our retirements and that really make the world go round  they need to stick to making more money. So  Harvard Business School actually researched this  and they found something fascinating. If you had invested a dollar    years ago in a portfolio of companies that focused narrowly on making more money quarter by quarter  that one dollar would have grown to    dollars and    cents. That's not bad until you consider that if instead you'd invested that same dollar in a portfolio of companies that focused on growing their business and on the most important environmental and social issues  that one dollar would have grown to    dollars and    cents. almost twice as much sweet porridge. Now  let's be clear  they didn't make that outperformance by giving away money to seem like a nice corporate citizen. They did it by focusing on the things that matter to their business  like wasting less energy and water in their manufacturing processes  like making sure the CEO contracts had the CEOs incentivized for the long term results of the company and the communities they served  not just quarterly results  or building a first class culture that would have higher employee loyalty  retention and productivity. Now  Harvard's not alone. Oxford also did a research study where they examined     different studies looking at the effect of sustainability and economic results  and they found time and time and time again that the companies that cared about these kinds of important things actually had better operational efficiency  lower cost of capital and better performance in their stock price. And then there's Al Gore. So    years ago  when I worked for Al Gore in the White House  he was one of the early pioneers pleading with businesses and governments to pay attention to the challenges of climate change. Post White House  he opened an investment firm called Generation  where he baked environmental sustainability and other things right into the core investment process. And at the time there was a good bit of skepticism about his views. Ten years later  his track record is one more proof point that sustainable investing done right can be sound investing. Far from making less sweet porridge because he added sustainability into the mix  he actually significantly outperformed the benchmark. Now  sustainable investing  the good news is it doesn't require a magic spell and it doesn't require some investment secret  and it's not just for the elite. It is not just about private equity for billionaires. It's not just groovy sounding investments like clean technology or microfinance in emerging markets or artisanal bakeries in Brooklyn. It's about stocks and bonds and Fortune     companies. It's about mutual funds. It's about all the things we already see in the market today. So here's why I'm convinced that we collectively have the power to make sustainable investing the new normal. First  the proof points are coming out all the time that sustainable investing done right  preserving all the same good principles of investing  the traditional sphere  can pay. It makes sense. Secondly  the biggest obstacle standing in our way may actually just be in our heads. We just need to let go of that myth that if you add your values into your investment thinking  that you get less sweet porridge. And once you get rid of the fable  you can actually start appreciating those facts we've been talking about. And third  the future is already here. Sustainable investment today is a    trillion dollar market and it's the fastest growing segment of the investment industry. In the United States  it has grown enormously  as you can see. It now represents one out of every six dollars under professional management in the United States. So what are we waiting for  For me  it goes back to the inspiration that I received from my mother. She knew that she wanted a life where she would have the freedom to make her own choices and to have her voice heard and write her own story. She was passionate about that goal and she was clear that she would let no army  no obstacle  no big institution stand in her way. She made it to the States  and she became a teacher  an award winning author and a mother  and ended up sending her daughters to Harvard. And these days  you can tell that she is amply comfortable holding court in the most powerful institutions in the world. It seems almost too prophetic that her name in Korean means  passionate clarity.  Passionate clarity  that's what I think we need to drive change. Passion about the change we want to see in the world  and clarity that we are able to help chart the course. We have more opportunity today than ever before to make choices. We have more power than ever before to make our voices heard. So change your perspective. Vote with your small change. Invest in the change you want to see in the world. Change the fables and change the markets. Thank you. When I moved to Harare in       social justice was at the core of Zimbabwe's national health policy. The new government emerged from a long war of independence and immediately proclaimed a socialist agenda  health care services  primary education became essentially free. A massive expansion of rural health centers placed roughly    percent of the population less than a two hour walk from these facilities  a truly remarkable accomplishment. In       the year of independence     percent of Zimbabwean children were fully immunized. By       a mere decade later  this proportion stood at    percent. I felt tremendously privileged to be part of this transformation  a revolution. The excitement  the camaraderie  was palpable. Working side by side with brilliant Zimbabweans    scientists  doctors  activists    I felt connected not only to an African independence movement  but to a global progressive public health movement. But there were daunting challenges. Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS case in       the year I arrived. I had taken care of a few patients with AIDS in the early     s  when I did my medical training at Harlem Hospital  but    we had no idea what lay in store for Africa. Infection rate stood at about two percent in my early days there. These would soar to one out of every four adults by the time I left Harare    years later. By the mid     s  I'd told hundreds of people in the prime of life that they were HIV positive. I saw colleagues and friends die  my students  hospital patients  die. In response  my colleagues and I set up a clinic. We did condom demonstrations. We launched school education and workplace interventions. We did research. We counseled the partners of infected men about how to protect themselves. We worked hard  and at the time  I believed that I was doing my best. I was providing excellent treatment  such as it was. But I was not talking about structural change. Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan has spoken candidly about his personal failure leading to the Rwandan genocide. In       he was head of the UN peacekeeping department. At a    year memorial for the genocide  he reflected   I believed at the time I was doing my best  but I realized after the genocide that there was more I could and should have done to sound the alarm and rally support.  The AIDS epidemic caught the health community unprepared  and today  when the World Health Organization estimates that    million people have lost their lives to this disease  I'm not alone in feeling remorse and regret at not having done more earlier. But while living in Zimbabwe  I didn't see my role as an advocacy or a political one. I was there for my technical skills  both my clinical and my research epidemiology skills. And in my mind  my job was to take care of patients and to do research to better understand the population patterns of transmission  and I hoped that we'd slow the spread of the virus. I was aware that socially marginalized populations were at disproportionate risk of getting and dying of AIDS. And on the sugar plantations  which really more closely resembled feudal fiefdoms than any modern enterprise     percent of pregnant women tested HIV positive. I worked to show how getting infected was not a moral failure but instead related to a culture of male superiority  to forced migrant labor and to colonialism. Whites were largely unscathed. As health professionals  our tools were pitifully weak  imploring people to change their individual behaviors  use condoms  reduce number of partners. Infection rates climbed  and when treatment became available in the West  treatment that remains our most potent weapon against this virus  it was unaffordable to the public sector across Africa. I didn't speak out about the unequal access to these life saving drugs or about the underlying economic and political systems that were driving infection rates in such huge swaths of the population. I rationalized my silence by reminding myself that I was a guest in the country  that sounding the alarm could even get me kicked out  keep me from doing good work  taking care of my patients  doing much needed research. So I didn't speak out about the government's early stance on AIDS. I didn't voice my concerns loudly enough. Many doctors  health professionals  may think I did nothing wrong. Our pact with our patients  the Hippocratic Oath and its variants  is about the sanctity of the patient doctor relationship. And I did everything I could for each and every patient of mine. But I knew that epidemics emerge along the fissures of our society  reflecting not only biology  but more importantly patterns of marginalization  exclusion  discrimination related to race  gender  sexuality  class and more. It was true of AIDS. It was true just recently of Ebola. Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer  who worked on AIDS in Haiti  call this structural violence  structural because inequities are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world  often in ways that are invisible to those with privilege and power  and violence because its impact    premature deaths  suffering  illness    is violent. We do little for our patients if we fail to recognize these social injustices. Sounding the alarm is the first step towards doing public health right  and it's how we may rally support to break through and create real change together. So these days  I'm not staying quiet. I'm speaking up about a lot of things  even when it makes listeners uncomfortable  even when it makes me uncomfortable. And a lot of this is about racial disparities and institutionalized racism  things that we're not supposed to have in this country anymore  certainly not in the practice of medicine or public health. But we have them  and we pay for them in lives cut short. That's why sounding the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the United States  the ongoing institutional and interpersonal violence that people of color face  compounded by our tragic legacy of     years of slavery     years of Jim Crow and    years of imperfect equality  sounding the alarm about this is central to doing my job right as New York City's Health Commissioner. In New York City  premature mortality    that's death before the age of       is    percent higher for black men than white ones. A black woman in      faced more than    times the risk of dying related to childbirth as a white woman. And though we've made enormous strides in reducing infant mortality rates  a black baby still faces nearly three times the risk of death in its first year of life as compared to a white baby. New York City's not exceptional. These statistics are paralleled by statistics found across the United States. A recent New York Times analysis reported that there are  .  million missing black men across the country. They noted that more than one out of every six black men who today should be between the ages of    and    years have disappeared from daily life  lost either to prison or premature death. There is great injustice in the daily and disproportionate violence faced by young black men  the focus of recent protests under the banner  BlackLivesMatter. But we have to remember that enduring and disparate rates and the occurrence and outcome of common medical conditions    heart disease  cancer  diabetes  HIV    diseases that may kill slowly and quietly and take even more black lives prematurely. As the  BlackLivesMatter movement unfolded  I felt frustrated and angry that the medical community has been reluctant to even use the word  racism  in our research and our work. You've probably felt something every time I've said it. Our medical students held die ins in their white coats  but the medical community has largely stood by passively as ongoing discrimination continues to affect the disease profile and mortality. And I worry that the trend towards personalized and precision medicine  looking for biological or genetic targets to better tailor treatment  may inadvertently cause us to lose sight of the big picture  that it is the daily context  where a person lives  grows  works  loves  that most importantly determines population health  and for too many of us  poor health. As health professionals in our daily work  whether in the clinic or doing research  we are witness to great injustice  the homeless person who is unable to follow medical advice because he has more pressing priorities  the transgender youth who is contemplating suicide because our society is just so harsh  the single mother who has been made to feel that she is responsible for the poor health of her child. Our role as health professionals is not just to treat our patients but to sound the alarm and advocate for change. Rightfully or not  our societal position gives our voices great credibility  and we shouldn't waste that. I regret not speaking up in Zimbabwe  and I've promised myself that as New York City's Health Commissioner  I will use every opportunity I have to sound the alarm and rally support for health equity. I will speak out against racism  and I hope you will join me  and I will join you when you speak out against sexism or any other form of inequality. It's time for us to rise up and collectively speak up about structural inequality. We don't have to have all the answers to call for change. We just need courage. The health of our patients  the health of us all  depends on it. There are a few things that all of us need. We all need air to breathe. We need clean water to drink. We need food to eat. We need shelter and love. You know. Love is great  too. And we all need a safe place to pee. As a trans person who doesn't fit neatly into the gender binary  if I could change the world tomorrow to make it easier for me to navigate  the very first thing I would do is blink and create single stall  gender neutral bathrooms in all public places. Trans people and trans issues  they've been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately. And this is a great and necessary thing  but most of that attention has been focused on a very few individuals  most of whom are kinda rich and pretty famous  and probably don't have to worry that much anymore about where they're going to pee in between classes at their community college  or where they're going to get changed into their gym strip at their public high school. Fame and money insulates these television star trans people from most of the everyday challenges that the rest of us have to tackle on a daily basis. Public bathrooms. They've been a problem for me since as far back as I can remember  first when I was just a little baby tomboy and then later as a masculine appearing  predominantly estrogen based organism. Now  today as a trans person  public bathrooms and change rooms are where I am most likely to be questioned or harassed. I've often been verbally attacked behind their doors. I've been hauled out by security guards with my pants still halfway pulled up. I've been stared at  screamed at  whispered about  and one time I got smacked in the face by a little old lady's purse that from the looks of the shiner I took home that day I am pretty certain contained at least    dollars of rolled up small change and a large hard candy collection. And I know what some of you are thinking  and you're mostly right. I can and do just use the men's room most of the time these days. But that doesn't solve my change room dilemmas  does it  And I shouldn't have to use the men's room because I'm not a man. I'm a trans person. And now we've got these fearmongering politicians that keep trying to pass these bathroom bills. Have you heard about these  They try to legislate to try and force people like myself to use the bathroom that they deem most appropriate according to the gender I was assigned at birth. And if these politicians ever get their way  in Arizona or California or Florida or just last week in Houston  Texas  or Ottawa  well then  using the men's room will not be a legal option for me either. And every time one of these politicians brings one of these bills to the table  I can't help but wonder  you know  just who will and exactly how would we go about enforcing laws like these. Right  Panty checks  Really. Genital inspections outside of bath change rooms at public pools  There's no legal or ethical or plausible way to enforce laws like these anyway. They exist only to foster fear and promote transphobia. They don't make anyone safer. But they do for sure make the world more dangerous for some of us. And meanwhile  our trans children suffer. They drop out of school  or they opt out of life altogether. Trans people  especially trans and gender nonconforming youth face additional challenges when accessing pools and gyms  but also universities  hospitals  libraries. Don't even get me started on how they treat us in airports. If we don't move now to make sure that these places are truly open and accessible to everyone  then we just need to get honest and quit calling them public places. We need to just admit that they are really only open for people who fit neatly into one of two gender boxes  which I do not. I never have. And this starts very early. I know a little girl. She's the daughter of a friend of mine. She's a self identified tomboy. I'm talking about cowboy boots and Caterpillar yellow toy trucks and bug jars  the whole nine yards. One time I asked her what her favorite color was. She told me   Camouflage.  So that awesome little kid  she came home from school last October from her half day of preschool with soggy pants on because the other kids at school were harassing her when she tried to use the girls' bathroom. And the teacher had already instructed her to stay out of the boys' bathroom. And she had drank two glasses of that red juice at the Halloween party  and I mean  who can resist that red juice  right  It's so good. And she couldn't hold her pee any longer. Her and her classmates were four years old. They already felt empowered enough to police her use of the so called public bathrooms. She was four years old. She had already been taught the brutal lesson that there was no bathroom door at preschool with a sign on it that welcomed people like her. She'd already learned that bathrooms were going to be a problem  and that problem started with her and was hers alone. So my friend asked me to talk to her little daughter  and I did. I wanted to tell her that me and her mom were going to march on down and talk to that school  and the problem was going to go away  but I knew that wasn't true. I wanted to tell her that it was all going to get better when she got older  but I couldn't. So I asked her to tell me the story of what had happened  asked her to tell me how it made her feel.  Mad and sad   she told me. So I told her that she wasn't alone and that it wasn't right what had happened to her  and then she asked me if I had ever peed in my pants before. I said yes  I had  but not for a really long time. Which of course was a lie  because you know how you hit  like     or     and sometimes you just  I don't know  you pee a little bit when you cough or sneeze  when you're running upstairs  or you're stretching. Don't lie. It happens. Right  She doesn't need to know that  I figure. I told her  when you get older  your bladder is going to grow bigger  too. When you get old like me  you're going to be able to hold your pee for way longer  I promised her.  Until you can get home   she asked me. I said   Yes  until you can get home.  She seemed to take some comfort in that. So let's just build some single stall  gender neutral bathrooms with a little bench for getting changed into your gym clothes. We can't change the world overnight for our children  but we can give them a safe and private place to escape that world  if only for just a minute. This we can do. So let's just do it. And if you are one of those people who is sitting out there right now already coming up with a list of reasons in your head why this is not a priority  or it's too expensive  or telling yourself that giving a trans person a safe place to pee or get changed in supports a lifestyle choice that you feel offends your morality  or your masculinity  or your religious beliefs  then let me just appeal to the part of your heart that probably  hopefully  does care about the rest of the population. If you can't bring yourself to care enough about people like me  then what about women and girls with body image issues  What about anyone with body image stuff going on  What about that boy at school who is a foot shorter than his classmates  whose voice still hasn't dropped yet  Hey  Oh  grade eight  what a cruel master you can be. Right  What about people with anxiety issues  What about people with disabilities or who need assistance in there  What about folks with bodies who  for whatever reason  don't fit into the mainstream idea of what a body should look like  How many of us still feel shy or afraid to disrobe in front of our peers  and how many of us allow that fear to keep us from something as important as physical exercise  Would all those people not benefit from these single stall facilities  We can't change transphobic minds overnight  but we can give everybody a place to get changed in so that we can all get to work making the world safer for all of us. Thank you for listening. Thank you. As a kid  I used to dream about the ocean. It was this wild place full of color and life  home to these alien looking  fantastical creatures. I pictured big sharks ruling the food chain and saw graceful sea turtles dancing across coral reefs. As a marine biologist turned photographer  I've spent most of my career looking for places as magical as those I used to dream about when I was little. As you can see  I began exploring bodies of water at a fairly young age. But the first time I truly went underwater  I was about    years old. And I can still vividly remember furiously finning to reach this old  encrusted cannon on a shallow coral reef. And when I finally managed to grab hold of it  I looked up  and I was instantly surrounded by fish in all colors of the rainbow. That was the day I fell in love with the ocean. Thomas Peschak Conservation Photographer In my    years on this planet  I've had the great privilege to explore some of its most incredible seascapes for National Geographic Magazine and the Save Our Seas Foundation. I've photographed everything from really  really big sharks to dainty ones that fit in the palm of your hand. I've smelled the fishy  fishy breath of humpback whales feeding just feet away from me in the cold seas off Canada's Great Bear Rainforest. And I've been privy to the mating rituals of green sea turtles in the Mozambique Channel. Everyone on this planet affects and is affected by the ocean. And the pristine seas I used to dream of as a child are becoming harder and harder to find. They are becoming more compressed and more threatened. As we humans continue to maintain our role as the leading predator on earth  I've witnessed and photographed many of these ripple effects firsthand. For a long time  I thought I had to shock my audience out of their indifference with disturbing images. And while this approach has merits  I have come full circle. I believe that the best way for me to effect change is to sell love. I guess I'm a matchmaker of sorts and as a photographer  I have the rare opportunity to reveal animals and entire ecosystems that lie hidden beneath the ocean's surface. You can't love something and become a champion for it if you don't know it exists. Uncovering this    that is the power of conservation photography. I've visited hundreds of marine locations  but there are a handful of seascapes that have touched me incredibly deeply. The first time I experienced that kind of high was about    years ago  off South Africa's rugged  wild coast. And every June and July  enormous shoals of sardines travel northwards in a mass migration we call the Sardine Run. And boy  do those fish have good reason to run. In hot pursuit are hoards of hungry and agile predators. Common dolphins hunt together and they can separate some of the sardines from the main shoal and they create bait balls. They drive and trap the fish upward against the ocean surface and then they rush in to dine on this pulsating and movable feast. Close behind are sharks. Now  most people believe that sharks and dolphins are these mortal enemies  but during the Sardine Run  they actually coexist. In fact  dolphins actually help sharks feed more effectively. Without dolphins  the bait balls are more dispersed and sharks often end up with what I call a sardine donut  or a mouth full of water. Now  while I've had a few spicy moments with sharks on the sardine run  I know they don't see me as prey. However  I get bumped and tail slapped just like any other guest at this rowdy  rowdy banquet. From the shores of Africa we travel east  across the vastness that is the Indian Ocean to the Maldives  an archipelago of coral islands. And during the stormy southwest monsoon  manta rays from all across the archipelago travel to a tiny speck in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru. Armies of crustaceans  most no bigger than the size of your pupils  are the mainstay of the manta ray's diet. When plankton concentrations become patchy  manta rays feed alone and they somersault themselves backwards again and again  very much like a puppy chasing its own tail. However  when plankton densities increase  the mantas line up head to tail to form these long feeding chains  and any tasty morsel that escapes the first or second manta in line is surely to be gobbled up by the next or the one after. As plankton levels peak in the bay  the mantas swim closer and closer together in a unique behavior we call cyclone feeding. And as they swirl in tight formation  this multi step column of mantas creates its own vortex  sucking in and delivering the plankton right into the mantas' cavernous mouths. The experience of diving amongst such masses of hundreds of rays is truly unforgettable. When I first photographed Hanifaru  the site enjoyed no protection and was threatened by development. And working with NGOs like the Manta Trust  my images eventually helped Hanifaru become a marine protected area. Now  fisherman from neighboring islands  they once hunted these manta rays to make traditional drums from their skins. Today  they are the most ardent conservation champions and manta rays earn the Maldivian economy in excess of   million dollars every single year. I have always wanted to travel back in time to an era where maps were mostly blank or they read   There be dragons.  And today  the closest I've come is visiting remote atolls in the western Indian Ocean. Far  far away from shipping lanes and fishing fleets  diving into these waters is a poignant reminder of what our oceans once looked like. Very few people have heard of Bassas da India  a tiny speck of coral in the Mozambique Channel. Its reef forms a protective outer barrier and the inner lagoon is a nursery ground for Galapagos sharks. These sharks are anything but shy  even during the day. I had a bit of a hunch that they'd be even bolder and more abundant at night. Never before have I encountered so many sharks on a single coral outcrop. Capturing and sharing moments like this    that reminds me why I chose my path. Earlier this year  I was on assignment for National Geographic Magazine in Baja California. And about halfway down the peninsula on the Pacific side lies San Ignacio Lagoon  a critical calving ground for gray whales. For     years  this coast was the scene of a wholesale slaughter  where more than        gray whales were killed  leaving only a few hundred survivors. Today the descendents of these same whales nudge their youngsters to the surface to play and even interact with us. This species truly has made a remarkable comeback. Now  on the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo  a sleepy fishing village. Decades of overfishing had brought them close to collapse. In       local fisherman convinced the authorities to proclaim their waters a marine reserve. But what happened next was nothing short of miraculous. In       after only a single decade of protection  scientists measured the largest recovery of fish ever recorded. But don't take my word for it    come with me. On a single breath  swim with me in deep  into one of the largest and densest schools of fish I have ever encountered. We all have the ability to be creators of hope. And through my photography  I want to pass on the message that it is not too late for our oceans. And particularly  I want to focus on nature's resilience in the face of  .  billion people. My hope is that in the future  I will have to search much  much harder to make photographs like this  while creating images that showcase our respectful coexistence with the ocean. Those will hopefully become an everyday occurrence for me. To thrive and survive in my profession  you really have to be a hopeless optimist. And I always operate on the assumption that the next great picture that will effect change is right around the corner  behind the next coral head  inside the next lagoon or possibly  in the one after it.
