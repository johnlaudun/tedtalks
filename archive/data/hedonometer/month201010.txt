So  I'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years. But before I do that  I need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics  which require huge amounts of energy to create and  because of their disposal issues  are slowly poisoning our planet. I also want to tell you and share with you how my team and I have been using mushrooms over the last three years. Not like that.  Laughter  We're using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials  which perform a lot like plastics during their use  but are made from crop waste and are totally compostable at the end of their lives. But first  I need to talk to you about what I consider one of the most egregious offenders in the disposable plastics category. This is a material you all know is Styrofoam  but I like to think of it as toxic white stuff. In a single cubic foot of this material    about what would come around your computer or large television    you have the same energy content of about a liter and a half of petrol. Yet  after just a few weeks of use  you'll throw this material in the trash. And this isn't just found in packaging.    billion dollars of this material is produced every year  in everything from building materials to surfboards to coffee cups to table tops. And that's not the only place it's found. The EPA estimates  in the United States  by volume  this material occupies    percent of our landfills. Even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment    on the side of the road or next to a river. If it's not picked up by a human  like me and you  it'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years. Perhaps even worse is when it finds its way into our oceans  like in the great plastic gyre  where these materials are being mechanically broken into smaller and smaller bits  but they're not really going away. They're not biologically compatible. They're basically fouling up Earth's respiratory and circulatory systems. And because these materials are so prolific  because they're found in so many places  there's one other place you'll find this material  styrene  which is made from benzene  a known carcinogen. You'll find it inside of you. So  for all these reasons  I think we need better materials  and there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials. The first is feedstocks. Today  we use a single feedstock  petroleum  to heat our homes  power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you. We recognize this is a finite resource  and it's simply crazy to do this  to put a liter and a half of petrol in the trash every time you get a package. Second of all  we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials. I say far less  because    percent isn't going to cut it. We should be talking about half  a quarter  one tenth the energy content. And lastly  and I think perhaps most importantly  we should be creating materials that fit into what I call nature's recycling system. This recycling system has been in place for the last billion years. I fit into it  you fit into it  and a hundred years tops  my body can return to the Earth with no preprocessing. Yet that packaging I got in the mail yesterday is going to last for thousands of years. This is crazy. But nature provides us with a really good model here. When a tree's done using its leaves    its solar collectors  these amazing molecular photon capturing devices    at the end of a season  it doesn't pack them up  take them to the leaf reprocessing center and have them melted down to form new leaves. It just drops them  the shortest distance possible  to the forest floor  where they're actually upcycled into next year's topsoil. And this gets us back to the mushrooms. Because in nature  mushrooms are the recycling system. And what we've discovered is  by using a part of the mushroom you've probably never seen    analogous to its root structure  it's called mycelium    we can actually grow materials with many of the same properties of conventional synthetics. Now  mycelium is an amazing material  because it's a self assembling material. It actually takes things we would consider waste    things like seed husks or woody biomass    and can transform them into a chitinous polymer  which you can form into almost any shape. In our process  we basically use it as a glue. And by using mycelium as a glue  you can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry  and you can create materials with many different properties  materials that are insulating  fire resistant  moisture resistant  vapor resistant    materials that can absorb impacts  that can absorb acoustical impacts. But these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts  not petroleum. And because they're made of natural materials  they are     percent compostable in you own backyard. So I'd like to share with you the four basic steps required to make these materials. The first is selecting a feedstock  preferably something that's regional  that's in your area  right    local manufacturing. The next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool  physically filling an enclosure  a mold  in whatever shape you want to get. Then you actually grow the mycelium through these particles  and that's where the magic happens  because the organism is doing the work in this process  not the equipment. The final step is  of course  the product  whether it's a packaging material  a table top  or building block. Our vision is local manufacturing  like the local food movement  for production. So we've created formulations for all around the world using regional byproducts. If you're in China  you might use a rice husk or a cottonseed hull. If you're in Northern Europe or North America  you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls. We then process these husks with some basic equipment. And I want to share with you a quick video from our facility that gives you a sense of how this looks at scale. So what you're seeing here is actually cotton hulls from Texas  in this case. It's a waste product. And what they're doing in our equipment is going through a continuous system  which cleans  cooks  cools and pasteurizes these materials  while also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium. This gives us a continuous stream of material that we can put into almost any shape  though today we're making corner blocks. And it's when this lid goes on the part  that the magic really starts. Because the manufacturing process is our organism. It'll actually begin to digest these wastes and  over the next five days  assemble them into biocomposites. Our entire facility is comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools sitting indoors in the dark  quietly self assembling materials    and everything from building materials to  in this case  a packaging corner block. So I've said a number of times that we grow materials. And it's kind of hard to picture how that happens. So my team has taken five days worth of growth  a typical growth cycle for us  and condensed it into a    second time lapse. And I want you to really watch closely these little white dots on the screen  because  over the five day period  what they do is extend out and through this material  using the energy that's contained in these seed husks to build this chitinous polymer matrix. This matrix self assembles  growing through and around the particles  making millions and millions of tiny fibers. And what parts of the seed husk we don't digest  actually become part of the final  physical composite. So in front of your eyes  this part just self assembled. It actually takes a little longer. It takes five days. But it's much faster than conventional farming. The last step  of course  is application. In this case  we've grown a corner block. A major Fortune     furniture maker uses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment. They used to use a plastic packaging buffer  but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance with our grown material. Best of all  when it gets to the customer  it's not trash. They can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing  and it's going to improve the local soil. So  why mycelium  The first reason is local open feedstocks. You want to be able to do this anywhere in the world and not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls  because you have multiple choices. The next is self assembly  because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process. You don't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility. So you can have lots of small facilities spread all across the world. Biological yield is really important. And because     percent of what we put in the tool become the final product  even the parts that aren't digested become part of the structure  we're getting incredible yield rates. Natural polymers  well ... I think that's what's most important  because these polymers have been tried and tested in our ecosystem for the last billion years  in everything from mushrooms to crustaceans. They're not going to clog up Earth's ecosystems. They work great. And while  today  we can practically guarantee that yesterday's packaging is going to be here in        years  what I want to guarantee is that in        years  our descendants  our children's children  will be living happily and in harmony with a healthy Earth. And I think that can be some really good news. Thank you. I want to talk to you today about prosperity  about our hopes for a shared and lasting prosperity. And not just us  but the two billion people worldwide who are still chronically undernourished. And hope actually is at the heart of this. In fact  the Latin word for hope is at the heart of the word prosperity.  Pro speras    speras   hope    in accordance with our hopes and expectations. The irony is  though  that we have cashed out prosperity almost literally in terms of money and economic growth. And we've grown our economies so much that we now stand in a real danger of undermining hope    running down resources  cutting down rainforests  spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico  changing the climate    and the only thing that has actually remotely slowed down the relentless rise of carbon emissions over the last two to three decades is recession. And recession  of course  isn't exactly a recipe for hope either  as we're busy finding out. So we're caught in a kind of trap. It's a dilemma  a dilemma of growth. We can't live with it  we can't live without it. Trash the system or crash the planet    it's a tough choice  it isn't much of a choice. And our best avenue of escape from this actually is a kind of blind faith in our own cleverness and technology and efficiency and doing things more efficiently. Now I haven't got anything against efficiency. And I think we are a clever species sometimes. But I think we should also just check the numbers  take a reality check here. So I want you to imagine a world  in       of around nine billion people  all aspiring to Western incomes  Western lifestyles. And I want to ask the question    and we'll give them that two percent hike in income  in salary each year as well  because we believe in growth. And I want to ask the question  how far and how fast would be have to move  How clever would we have to be  How much technology would we need in this world to deliver our carbon targets  And here in my chart    on the left hand side is where we are now. This is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment. It's around about     grams of carbon. In the world I describe to you  we have to be right over here at the right hand side at six grams of carbon. It's a     fold improvement  and that is    times further and faster than anything we've ever achieved in industrial history. Maybe we can do it  maybe it's possible    who knows  Maybe we can even go further and get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere  which is what we're going to need to be doing by the end of the century. But shouldn't we just check first that the economic system that we have is remotely capable of delivering this kind of improvement  So I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics. It's a bit complex  and I apologize for that. What I'll try and do  is I'll try and paraphrase it is sort of human terms. So it looks a little bit like this. Firms produce goods for households    that's us    and provide us with incomes  and that's even better  because we can spend those incomes on more goods and services. That's called the circular flow of the economy. It looks harmless enough. I just want to highlight one key feature of this system  which is the role of investment. Now investment constitutes only about a fifth of the national income in most modern economies  but it plays an absolutely vital role. And what it does essentially is to stimulate further consumption growth. It does this in a couple of ways    chasing productivity  which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff. But I want to concentrate on the role of investment in seeking out novelty  the production and consumption of novelty. Joseph Schumpeter called this  the process of creative destruction.  It's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty  continually chasing expanding consumer markets  consumer goods  new consumer goods. And this  this is where it gets interesting  because it turns out that human beings have something of an appetite for novelty. We love new stuff    new material stuff for sure    but also new ideas  new adventures  new experiences. But the materiality matters too  because in every society that anthropologists have looked at  material stuff operates as a kind of language    a language of goods  a symbolic language that we use to tell each other stories    stories  for example  about how important we are. Status driven  conspicuous consumption thrives from the language of novelty. And here  all of a sudden  we have a system that is locking economic structure with social logic    the economic institutions  and who we are as people  locked together to drive an engine of growth. And this engine is not just economic value  it is pulling material resources relentlessly through the system  driven by our own insatiable appetites  driven in fact by a sense of anxiety. Adam Smith      years ago  spoke about our desire for a life without shame. A life without shame  in his day  what that meant was a linen shirt  and today  well  you still need the shirt  but you need the hybrid car  the HDTV  two holidays a year in the sun  the netbook and iPad  the list goes on    an almost inexhaustible supply of goods  driven by this anxiety. And even if we don't want them  we need to buy them  because  if we don't buy them  the system crashes. And to stop it crashing over the last two to three decades  we've expanded the money supply  expanded credit and debt  so that people can keep buying stuff. And of course  that expansion was deeply implicated in the crisis. But this    I just want to show you some data here. This is what it looks like  essentially  this credit and debt system  just for the U.K. This was the last    years before the crash  and you can see there  consumer debt rose dramatically. It was above the GDP for three years in a row just before the crisis. And in the mean time  personal savings absolutely plummeted. The savings ratio  net savings  were below zero in the middle of       just before the crash. This is people expanding debt  drawing down their savings  just to stay in the game. This is a strange  rather perverse  story  just to put it in very simple terms. It's a story about us  people  being persuaded to spend money we don't have on things we don't need to create impressions that won't last on people we don't care about. But before we consign ourselves to despair  maybe we should just go back and say   Did we get this right  Is this really how people are  Is this really how economies behave   And almost straightaway we actually run up against a couple of anomalies. The first one is in the crisis itself. In the crisis  in the recession  what do people want to do  They want to hunker down  they want to look to the future. They want to spend less and save more. But saving is exactly the wrong thing to do from the system point of view. Keynes called this the  paradox of thrift     saving slows down recovery. And politicians call on us continually to draw down more debt  to draw down our own savings even further  just so that we can get the show back on the road  so we can keep this growth based economy going. It's an anomaly  it's a place where the system actually is at odds with who we are as people. Here's another one    completely different one  Why is it that we don't do the blindingly obvious things we should do to combat climate change  very  very simple things like buying energy efficient appliances  putting in efficient lights  turning the lights off occasionally  insulating our homes  These things save carbon  they save energy  they save us money. So is it that  though they make perfect economic sense  we don't do them  Well  I had my own personal insight into this a few years ago. It was a Sunday evening  Sunday afternoon  and it was just after    actually  to be honest  too long after    we had moved into a new house. And I had finally got around to doing some draft stripping  installing insulation around the windows and doors to keep out the drafts. And my  then  five year old daughter was helping me in the way that five year olds do. And we'd been doing this for a while  when she turned to me very solemnly and said   Will this really keep out the giraffes    Here they are  the giraffes.  You can hear the five year old mind working. These ones  interestingly  are     miles north of here outside Barrow in Furness in Cumbria. Goodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather. But actually that childish misrepresentation stuck with me  because it suddenly became clear to me why we don't do the blindingly obvious things. We're too busy keeping out the giraffes    putting the kids on the bus in the morning  getting ourselves to work on time  surviving email overload and shop floor politics  foraging for groceries  throwing together meals  escaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening into prime time TV or TED online  getting from one end of the day to the other  keeping out the giraffes. What is the objective   What is the objective of the consumer   Mary Douglas asked in an essay on poverty written    years ago.  It is   she said   to help create the social world and find a credible place in it.  That is a deeply humanizing vision of our lives  and it's a completely different vision than the one that lies at the heart of this economic model. So who are we  Who are these people  Are we these novelty seeking  hedonistic  selfish individuals  Or might we actually occasionally be something like the selfless altruist depicted in Rembrandt's lovely  lovely sketch here  Well psychology actually says there is a tension    a tension between self regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors. And these tensions have deep evolutionary roots  so selfish behavior is adaptive in certain circumstances    fight or flight. But other regarding behaviors are essential to our evolution as social beings. And perhaps even more interesting from our point of view  another tension between novelty seeking behaviors and tradition or conservation. Novelty is adaptive when things are changing and you need to adapt yourself. Tradition is essential to lay down the stability to raise families and form cohesive social groups. So here  all of a sudden  we're looking at a map of the human heart. And it reveals to us  suddenly  the crux of the matter. What we've done is we've created economies. We've created systems  which systematically privilege  encourage  one narrow quadrant of the human soul and left the others unregarded. And in the same token  the solution becomes clear  because this isn't  therefore  about changing human nature. It isn't  in fact  about curtailing possibilities. It is about opening up. It is about allowing ourselves the freedom to become fully human  recognizing the depth and the breadth of the human psyche and building institutions to protect Rembrandt's fragile altruist within. What does all this mean for economics  What would economies look like if we took that vision of human nature at their heart and stretched them along these orthogonal dimensions of the human psyche  Well  it might look a little bit like the       community interest companies that have sprung up in the U.K. over the last five years and a similar rise in B corporations in the United States  enterprises that have ecological and social goals written into their constitution at their heart    companies  in fact  like this one  Ecosia. And I just want to  very quickly  show you this. Ecosia is an Internet search engine. Internet search engines work by drawing revenues from sponsored links that appear when you do a search. And Ecosia works in pretty much the same way. So we can do that here    we can just put in a little search term. There you go  Oxford  that's where we are. See what comes up. The difference with Ecosia though is that  in Ecosia's case  it draws the revenues in the same way  but it allocates    percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project in the Amazon. And we're going to do it. We're just going to click on Naturejobs.uk. In case anyone out there is looking for a job in a recession  that's the page to go to. And what happened then was the sponsor gave revenues to Ecosia  and Ecosia is giving    percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project. It's taking profits from one place and allocating them into the protection of ecological resources. It's a different kind of enterprise for a new economy. It's a form  if you like  of ecological altruism    perhaps something along those lines. Maybe it's that. Whatever it is  whatever this new economy is  what we need the economy to do  in fact  is to put investment back into the heart of the model  to re conceive investment. Only now  investment isn't going to be about the relentless and mindless pursuit of consumption growth. Investment has to be a different beast. Investment has to be  in the new economy  protecting and nurturing the ecological assets on which our future depends. It has to be about transition. It has to be investing in low carbon technologies and infrastructures. We have to invest  in fact  in the idea of a meaningful prosperity  providing capabilities for people to flourish. And of course  this task has material dimensions. It would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing if they didn't have food  clothing and shelter. But it's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this. It has social and psychological aims    family  friendship  commitments  society  participating in the life of that society. And this too requires investment  investment    for example  in places    places where we can connect  places where we can participate  shared spaces  concert halls  gardens  public parks  libraries  museums  quiet centers  places of joy and celebration  places of tranquility and contemplation  sites for the  cultivation of a common citizenship   in Michael Sandel's lovely phrase. An investment    investment  after all  is just such a basic economic concept    is nothing more nor less than a relationship between the present and the future  a shared present and a common future. And we need that relationship to reflect  to reclaim hope. So let me come back  with this sense of hope  to the two billion people still trying to live each day on less than the price of a skinny latte from the cafe next door. What can we offer those people  It's clear that we have a responsibility to help lift them out of poverty. It's clear that we have a responsibility to make room for growth where growth really matters in those poorest nations. And it's also clear that we will never achieve that unless we're capable of redefining a meaningful sense of prosperity in the richer nations  a prosperity that is more meaningful and less materialistic than the growth based model. So this is not just a Western post materialist fantasy. In fact  an African philosopher wrote to me  when  Prosperity Without Growth  was published  pointing out the similarities between this view of prosperity and the traditional African concept of ubuntu. Ubuntu says   I am because we are.  Prosperity is a shared endeavor. Its roots are long and deep    its foundations  I've tried to show  exist already  inside each of us. So this is not about standing in the way of development. It's not about overthrowing capitalism. It's not about trying to change human nature. What we're doing here is we're taking a few simple steps towards an economics fit for purpose. And at the heart of that economics  we're placing a more credible  more robust  and more realistic vision of what it means to be human. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  While they're taking the podium away  just a quick question. First of all  economists aren't supposed to be inspiring  so you may need to work on the tone a little. Can you picture the politicians ever buying into this  I mean  can you picture a politician standing up in Britain and saying   GDP fell two percent this year. Good news  We're actually all happier  and a country's more beautiful  and our lives are better.  Tim Jackson  Well that's clearly not what you're doing. You're not making news out of things falling down. You're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing. Can I picture politicians doing it  Actually  I already am seeing a little bit of it. When we first started this kind of work  politicians would stand up  treasury spokesmen would stand up  and accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves. And actually in the period through which we've been working over the last    years    partly because of the financial crisis and a little bit of humility in the profession of economics    actually people are engaging in this issue in all sorts of countries around the world. CA  But is it mainly politicians who are going to have to get their act together  or is it going to be more just civil society and companies  TJ  It has to be companies. It has to be civil society. But it has to have political leadership. This is a kind of agenda  which actually politicians themselves are kind of caught in that dilemma  because they're hooked on the growth model themselves. But actually opening up the space to think about different ways of governing  different kinds of politics  and creating the space for civil society and businesses to operate differently    absolutely vital. CA  And if someone could convince you that we actually can make the    what was it     the     fold improvement in efficiency  of reduction of carbon footprint  would you then actually like that picture of economic growth into more knowledge based goods  TJ  I would still want to know that you could do that and get below zero by the end of the century  in terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere  and solve the problem of biodiversity and reduce the impact on land use and do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water. If you can convince me we can do all that  then  yes  I would take the two percent. CA  Tim  thank you for a very important talk. Thank you. I've been fascinated for a lifetime by the beauty  form and function of giant bluefin tuna. Bluefin are warmblooded like us. They're the largest of the tunas  the second largest fish in the sea    bony fish. They actually are a fish that is endothermic    powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal. That's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. You can see in its shape and its streamlined design it's powered for ocean swimming. It flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins  gets lift  powers its movements with a lunate tail. It's actually got a naked skin for most of its body  so it reduces friction with the water. This is what one of nature's finest machines. Now  bluefin were revered by Man for all of human history. For       years  we fished sustainably for this animal  and it's evidenced in the art that we see from thousands of years ago. Bluefin are in cave paintings in France. They're on coins that date back       years. This fish was revered by humankind. It was fished sustainably till all of time  except for our generation. Bluefin are pursued wherever they go    there is a gold rush on Earth  and this is a gold rush for bluefin. There are traps that fish sustainably up until recently. And yet  the type of fishing going on today  with pens  with enormous stakes  is really wiping bluefin ecologically off the planet. Now bluefin  in general  goes to one place  Japan. Some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin. They're delectable muscle  rich in fat    absolutely taste delicious. And that's their problem  we're eating them to death. Now in the Atlantic  the story is pretty simple. Bluefin have two populations  one large  one small. The North American population is fished at about       ton. The European population and North African    the Eastern bluefin tuna    is fished at tremendous levels         tons over the last decade almost every year. The result is whether you're looking at the West or the Eastern bluefin population  there's been tremendous decline on both sides  as much as    percent if you go back with your baseline to     . For that  bluefin have been given a status equivalent to tigers  to lions  to certain African elephants and to pandas. These fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months. They were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago  despite outstanding science that shows from two committees this fish meets the criteria of CITES I. And if it's tunas you don't care about  perhaps you might be interested that international long lines and pursing chase down tunas and bycatch animals such as leatherbacks  sharks  marlin  albatross. These animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries. The challenge we face is that we know very little about tuna  and everyone in the room knows what it looks like when an African lion takes down its prey. I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed. This tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room. It's the   st century  but we really have only just begun to really study our oceans in a deep way. Technology has come of age that's allowing us to see the Earth from space and go deep into the seas remotely. And we've got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works. Most of us from the ship    even I    look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea. We don't know where the structure is. We can't tell where are the watering holes like we can on an African plain. We can't see the corridors  and we can't see what it is that brings together a tuna  a leatherback and an albatross. We're only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hot spot a hope spot. The reasons these challenges are great is that technically it's difficult to go to sea. It's hard to study a bluefin on its turf  the entire Pacific realm. It's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it. And then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU  getting up close to a blue whale and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays  an engineering challenge we've yet to really overcome. So the story of our team  a dedicated team  is fish and chips. We basically are taking the same satellite phone parts  or the same parts that are in your computer  chips. We're putting them together in unusual ways  and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before. And for the first time  we're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset. Now  I've been working with tunas for over    years. I have the privilege of being a partner with the Monterey Bay Aquarium. We've actually taken a sliver of the ocean  put it behind glass  and we together have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display. When the veil of bubbles lifts every morning  we can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean  one of the only places on Earth you can see giant bluefin swim by. We can see in their beauty of form and function  their ceaseless activity. They're flying through their space  ocean space. And we can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish and show them its beauty. Behind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Here  for over    or    years  we've actually brought in both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity. We'd been studying these fish  but first we had to learn how to husbandry them. What do they like to eat  What is it that they're happy with  We go in the tanks with the tuna    we touch their naked skin    it's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful. And then  better yet  we've got our own version of tuna whisperers  our own Chuck Farwell  Alex Norton  who can take a big tuna and in one motion  put it into an envelope of water  so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea. Jeff and Jason there  are scientists who are going to take a tuna and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill  a flume. And that tuna thinks it's going to Japan  but it's staying in place. We're actually measuring its oxygen consumption  its energy consumption. We're taking this data and building better models. And when I see that tuna    this is my favorite view    I begin to wonder  how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did  So take a look at that animal. That's the closest you'll probably ever get. Now  the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean. So in a program called Tag A Giant we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada  from Corsica to Spain. We've fished with many nations around the world in an effort to basically put electronic computers inside giant tunas. We've actually tagged       tunas. And I'm going to show you three clips  because I tagged       tunas. It's a very hard process  but it's a ballet. We bring the tuna out  we measure it. A team of fishers  captains  scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes. We put water over its gills  give it oxygen. And then with a lot of effort  after tagging  putting in the computer  making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment  we send this fish back into the sea. And when it goes  we're always happy. We see a flick of the tail. And from our data that gets collected  when that tag comes back  because a fisher returns it for a thousand dollar reward  we can get tracks beneath the sea for up to five years now  on a backboned animal. Now sometimes the tunas are really large  such as this fish off Nantucket. But that's about half the size of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged. It takes a human effort  a team effort  to bring the fish in. In this case  what we're going to do is put a pop up satellite archival tag on the tuna. This tag rides on the tuna  senses the environment around the tuna and actually will come off the fish  detach  float to the surface and send back to Earth orbiting satellites position data estimated by math on the tag  pressure data and temperature data. And so what we get then from the pop up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag. Both the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive. These tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in North America. They are some of our finest instruments  our new technology in the ocean today. One community in general has given more to help us than any other community. And that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina. There are two villages  Harris and Morehead City  every winter for over a decade  held a party called Tag A Giant  and together  fishers worked with us to tag     to     fish. In this case  we're actually going to measure the fish. We're going to do something that in recent years we've started  take a mucus sample. Watch how shiny the skin is  you can see my reflection there. And from that mucus  we can get gene profiles  we can get information on gender  checking the pop up tag one more time  and then it's out in the ocean. And this is my favorite. With the help of my former postdoc  Gareth Lawson  this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna. This tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean. The warm is the Gulf Stream  the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine. That's where the tuna wants to go    it wants to forage on schools of herring    but it can't get there. It's too cold. But then it warms up  and the tuna pops in  gets some fish  maybe comes back to home base  goes in again and then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina and then on to the Bahamas. And my favorite scene  three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico. Three tunas tagged. Astronomically  we're calculating positions. They're coming together. That could be tuna sex    and there it is. That is where the tuna spawn. So from data like this  we're able now to put the map up  and in this map you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging. And now we're showing that tunas on the western side go to the eastern side. So two populations of tunas    that is  we have a Gulf population  one that we can tag    they go to the Gulf of Mexico  I showed you that    and a second population. Living amongst our tunas    our North American tunas    are European tunas that go back to the Med. On the hot spots    the hope spots    they're mixed populations. And so what we've done with the science is we're showing the International Commission  building new models  showing them that a two stock no mixing model    to this day  used to reject the CITES treaty    that model isn't the right model. This model  a model of overlap  is the way to move forward. So we can then predict where management places should be. Places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean are places where the single species  the single population  can be captured. These become forthright in places we need to protect. The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is  I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish  because they manage their fisheries well  they're doing a good job. But in the international realm  where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild  these are the places that we have to make hope spots in. That's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna. Now in a second project called Tagging of Pacific Pelagics  we took on the planet as a team  those of us in the Census of Marine Life. And  funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others  we were able to actually go in  in our project    we're one of    field programs and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators  not just tunas. So what we've done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska  met salmon shark on their home territory  followed them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that  if we take a salmon and put it on a line  we can actually take up a salmon shark    This is the cousin of the white shark    and very carefully    note  I say  very carefully      we can actually keep it calm  put a hose in its mouth  keep it off the deck and then tag it with a satellite tag. That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message. And that shark leaping there  if you look carefully  has an antenna. It's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon  sending home its data. Salmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag. But there goes salmon sharks with this meter level resolution on an ocean of temperature    warm colors are warmer. Salmon sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into Monterey. Now right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones are a white shark team led by Scott Anderson    there    and Sal Jorgensen. They can throw out a target    it's a carpet shaped like a seal    and in will come a white shark  a curious critter that will come right up to our    ft. boat. It's a several thousand pound animal. And we'll wind in the target. And we'll place an acoustic tag that says   OMSHARK         or something like that  acoustically with a ping. And then we'll put on a satellite tag that will give us the long distance journeys with the light based geolocation algorithms solved on the computer that's on the fish. So in this case  Sal's looking at two tags there  and there they are  the white sharks of California going off to the white shark cafe and coming back. We also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues  blue sharks. And now  together  what we can see on this ocean of color that's temperature  we can see ten day worms of makos and salmon sharks. We have white sharks and blue sharks. For the first time  an ecoscape as large as ocean scale  showing where the sharks go. The tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable  three teams tagged       tunas  bluefin  yellowfin and albacore all at the same time    carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out  pick up juvenile tunas  put in the tags that actually have the sensors  stick out the tuna and then let them go. They get returned  and when they get returned  here on a NASA numerical ocean you can see bluefin in blue go across their corridor  returning to the Western Pacific. Our team from UCSC has tagged elephant seals with tags that are glued on their heads  that come off when they slough. These elephant seals cover half an ocean  take data down to       feet    amazing data. And then there's Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters wearing tuna tags  light based tags  that now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back  journeys of        nautical miles we had never seen before. But now with light based geolocation tags that are very small  we can actually see these journeys. Same thing with Laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes  up to the same zone the tunas use. You can see why they might be caught. Then there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande tagging leatherbacks that go right past where we are. And Scott Benson's team that showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia all the way to Monterey. So what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are. We can actually see how they're using ecospaces as large as an ocean. And from this information  we can begin to map the hope spots. So this is just three years of data right here    and there's a decade of this data. We see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going on. So what we're able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots        deployments  a huge herculean task        tags in an area  shown here for the first time  off the California coast  that appears to be a gathering place. And then for sort of an encore from these animals  they're helping us. They're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to       meters. They're taking information from our planet at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles. Those are seals from many countries being released who are sampling underneath the ice sheets and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality on both poles. This data  when visualized  is captivating to watch. We still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data. And then  as these animals swim and give us the information that's important to climate issues  we also think it's critical to get this information to the public  to engage the public with this kind of data. We did this with the Great Turtle Race    tagged turtles  brought in four million hits. And now with Google's Oceans  we can actually put a white shark in that ocean. And when we do and it swims  we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from California to Hawaii. But maybe Mission Blue can fill in that ocean that we can't see. We've got the capacity  NASA has the ocean. We just need to put it together. So in conclusion  we know where Yellowstone is for North America  it's off our coast. We have the technology that's shown us where it is. What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue is increasing the biologging capacity. How is it that we can actually take this type of activity elsewhere  And then finally    to basically get the message home    maybe use live links from animals such as blue whales and white sharks. Make killer apps  if you will. A lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone. That way we do away with a few internet myths. So we can save the bluefin tuna. We can save the white shark. We have the science and technology. Hope is here. Yes we can. We need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans. Thank you. We are here today because  the  United Nations have defined goals for the progress of countries. They're called Millennium Development Goals. And the reason I really like these goals is that there are eight of them. And by specifying eight different goals  the United Nations has said that there are so many things needed to change in a country in order to get the good life for people. Look here    you have to end poverty  education  gender  child and maternal health  control infections  protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspect from aid to trade. There's a second reason I like these development goals  and that is because each and every one is measured. Take child mortality  the aim here is to reduce child mortality by two thirds  from      to     . That's a four percent reduction per year    and this  with measuring. That's what makes the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing  a better life for people. And what I'm so happy about with this is that we have already documented that there are many countries in Asia  in the Middle East  in Latin America and East Europe that  are  reducing with this rate. And even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year  and Turkey with seven percent per year. So there's good news. But then I hear people saying   There is no progress in Africa. And there's not even statistics on Africa to know what is happening.  I'll prove them wrong on both points. Come with me to the wonderful world of statistics. I bring you to the webpage  ChildMortality.org  where you can take deaths in children below five years of age for all countries    it's done by U.N. specialists. And I will take Kenya as an example. Here you see the data. Don't panic    don't panic now  I'll help you through this. It looks nasty  like in college when you didn't like statistics. But first thing  when you see dots like this  you have to ask yourself  from where do the data come  What is the origin of the data  Is it so that in Kenya  there are doctors and other specialists who write the death certificate at the death of the child and it's sent to the statistical office  No    low income countries like Kenya still don't have that level of organization. It exists  but it's not complete because so many deaths occur in the home with the family  and it's not registered. What we rely on is not an incomplete system. We have interviews  we have surveys. And this is highly professional female interviewers who sit down for one hour with a woman and ask her about  her  birth history. How many children did you have  Are they alive  If they died  at what age and what year  And then this is done in a representative sample of thousands of women in the country and put together in what used to be called a demographic health survey report. But these surveys are costly  so they can only be done  in  three  to five year intervals. But they have good quality. So this is a limitation. And all these colored lines here are results  each color is one survey. But that's too complicated for today  so I'll simplify it for you  and I give you one average point for each survey. This was                   '   and     . And when the experts in the U.N. have got these surveys in place in their database  then they use advanced mathematical formulas to produce a trend line  and the trend line looks like this. See here    it's the best fit they can get of this point. But watch out    they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing. And they estimated that in       Kenya had per child mortality of    . And I was sad  because we could see this reversal in Kenya with an increased child mortality in the   s. It was so tragic. But in June  I got a mail in my inbox from Demographic Health Surveys  and it showed good news from Kenya. I was so happy. This was the estimate of the new survey. Then it just took another three months for  the  U.N. to get it into their server  and on Friday we got the new trend line    it was down here. Isn't it nice    isn't it nice  yeah  I was actually  on Friday  sitting in front of my computer  and I saw the death rate fall from     to    just that morning. So we celebrated. But now  when you have this trend line  how do we measure progress  I'm going into some details here  because  the  U.N. do it like this. They start  in          they measure to     . They say    .  percent  no progress.  That's unfair. As a professor  I think I have the right to propose something differently. I would say  at least do this       years is enough to follow the trend. It's two surveys  and you can see what's happening now. They have  .  percent. Had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya  I may have joined these two points. So what I'm telling you is that we know the child mortality. We have a decent trend. It's coming into some tricky things then when we are measuring MDGs. And the reason here for Africa is especially important  because '  s was a bad decade  not only in Kenya  but across Africa. The HIV epidemic peaked. There was resistance for the old malaria drugs  until we got the new drugs. We got  later  the mosquito netting. And there was socio economic problems  which are now being solved at a much better scale. So look at the average here    this is the average for all of sub Saharan Africa. And  the  U.N. says it's a reduction with  .  percent. Now this sounds a little theoretical  but it's not so theoretical. You know  these economists  they love money  they want more and more of it  they want it to grow. So they calculate the percent annual growth rate of  the  economy. We in public health  we hate child death  so we want less and less and less of child deaths. So we calculate the percent reduction per year  but it's sort of the same percentage. If your economy grows with four percent  you ought to reduce child mortality four percent  if it's used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want it. So is this fair now to measure this over    years  An economist would never do that. I have just divided it into two periods. In the   s  only  .  percent  only  .  percent. Whereas now  second gear    it's like Africa had first gear  now they go into second gear. But even this is not a fair representation of Africa  because it's an average  it's an average speed of reduction in Africa. And look here when I take you into my bubble graphs. Still here  child death per       on that axis. Here we have  the  year. And I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG. I start    years ago when Africa celebrated independence in most countries. I give you Congo  which was high  Ghana    lower. And Kenya    even lower. And what has happened over the years since then  Here we go. You can see  with independence  literacy improved and vaccinations started  smallpox was eradicated  hygiene was improved  and things got better. But then  in the '  s  watch out here. Congo got into civil war  and they leveled off here. Ghana got very ahead  fast. This was the backlash in Kenya  and Ghana bypassed  but then Kenya and Ghana go down together    still a standstill in Congo. That's where we are today. You can see it doesn't make sense to make an average of this zero improvement and this very fast improvement. Time has come to stop thinking about sub Saharan Africa as one place. Their countries are so different  and they merit to be recognized in the same way  as we don't talk about Europe as one place. I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different    everyone knows that. And they are judged  each country  on how they are doing. So let me show the wider picture. My country  Sweden        we were up there. What a strange personality disorder we must have  counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate. It's very strange. It's sort of embarrassing. But we had that habit in Sweden  you know  that we counted all the child deaths  even if we didn't do anything about it. And then  you see  these were famine years. These were bad years  and people got fed up with Sweden. My ancestors moved to the United States. And eventually  soon they started to get better and better here. And here we got better education  and we got health service  and child mortality came down. We never had a war  Sweden was in peace all this time. But look  the rate of lowering in Sweden was not fast. Sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early. We had primary school actually started in     . And then you get that wonderful effect when we got female literacy one generation later. You have to realize that the investments we do in progress are long term investments. It's not about just five years    it's long term investments. And Sweden never reached  the  Millennium Development Goal rate   .  percent when I calculated. So we are off track    that's what Sweden is. But you don't talk about it so much. We want others to be better than we were  and indeed  others have been better. Let me show you Thailand  see what a success story  Thailand from the     s    how they went down here and reached almost the same child mortality levels as Sweden. And I'll give you another story    Egypt  the most hidden  glorious success in public health. Egypt was up here in       higher than Congo. The Nile Delta was a misery for children with diarrheal disease and malaria and a lot of problems. And then they got the Aswan Dam. They got electricity in their homes  they increased education and they got primary health care. And down they went  you know. And they got safer water  they eradicated malaria. And isn't it a success story. Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality is fully possible. And the good thing is that Ghana today is going with the same rate as Egypt did at its fastest. Kenya is now speeding up. Here we have a problem. We have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill. Now  let me now bring you to a wider picture  a wider picture of child mortality. I'm going to show you the relationship between child mortality on this axis here    this axis here is child mortality    and here I have the family size. The relationship between child mortality and family size. One  two  three  four children per woman  six  seven  eight children per woman. This is  once again             years ago. Each bubble is a country    the color  you can see  a continent. The dark blue here is sub Saharan Africa. And the size of the bubble is the population. And these are the so called  developing  countries. They had high  or very high  child mortality and family size  six to eight. And the ones over there  they were so called Western countries. They had low child mortality and small families. What has happened  What I want you  to do  now is to see with your own eyes the relation between fall in child mortality and decrease in family size. I just want not to have any room for doubt    you have to see that for yourself. This is what happened. Now I start the world. Here we come down with the eradication of smallpox  better education  health service. It got down there    China comes into the Western box here. And here Brazil is in the Western Box. India is approaching. The first African countries coming into the Western box  and we get a lot a new neighbors. Welcome to a decent life. Come on. We want everyone down there. This is the vision we have  isn't it. And look now  the first African countries here are coming in. There we are today. There is no such thing as a  Western world  and  developing world.  This is the report from  the  U.N.  which came out on Friday. It's very good     Levels and Trends in Child Mortality     except this page. This page is very bad  it's a categorization of countries. It labels  developing countries      I can read from the list here    developing countries  Republic of Korea    South Korea. Huh  They get Samsung  how can they be  a  developing country  They have here Singapore. They have the lowest child mortality in the world  Singapore. They bypassed Sweden five years ago  and they are labeled a developing country. They have here Qatar. It's the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera. How the heck could they be  a  developing country  This is crap. The rest here is good    the rest is good. We have to have a modern concept  which fits to the data. And we have to realize that we are all going to into this  down to here. What is the importance now with the relations here. Look    even if we look in Africa    these are the African countries. You can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality and decreasing family size  even within Africa. It's very clear that this is what happens. And a very important piece of research came out on Friday from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle showing that almost    percent of the fall in child mortality can be attributed to female education. That is  when we get girls in school  we'll get an impact    to    years later  which is a secular trend which is very strong. That's why we must have that long term perspective  but we must measure the impact over    year periods. It's fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down in the corner where we all would like to live together. And of course  lowering child mortality is a matter of utmost importance from humanitarian aspects. It's a decent life for children  we are talking about. But it is also a strategic investment in the future of all mankind  because it's about the environment. We will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don't stabilize the world population. Let's be clear about that. And the way to do that  that is to get child mortality down  get access to family planning and behind that drive female education. And that is fully possible. Let's do it. Thank you very much. Imagine  if you will    a gift. I'd like for you to picture it in your mind. It's not too big    about the size of a golf ball. So envision what it looks like all wrapped up. But before I show you what's inside  I will tell you  it's going to do incredible things for you. It will bring all of your family together. You will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven't heard from in years. Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you. It will recalibrate what's most important in your life. It will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith. You'll have a new understanding and trust in your body. You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy. You'll expand your vocabulary  meet new people  and you'll have a healthier lifestyle. And get this    you'll have an eight week vacation of doing absolutely nothing. You'll eat countless gourmet meals. Flowers will arrive by the truckload. People will say to you   You look great. Have you had any work done   And you'll have a lifetime supply of good drugs. You'll be challenged  inspired  motivated and humbled. Your life will have new meaning. Peace  health  serenity  happiness  nirvana. The price           and that's an incredible deal. By now I know you're dying to know what it is and where you can get one. Does Amazon carry it  Does it have the Apple logo on it  Is there a waiting list  Not likely. This gift came to me about five months ago. It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up    not quite so pretty. And this  and then this. It was a rare gem    a brain tumor  hemangioblastoma    the gift that keeps on giving. And while I'm okay now  I wouldn't wish this gift for you. I'm not sure you'd want it. But I wouldn't change my experience. It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn't expect in all the ways I just shared with you. So the next time you're faced with something that's unexpected  unwanted and uncertain  consider that it just may be a gift. Sometimes I go browsing  through  a very old magazine. I found this observation test about the story of the ark. And the artist that drew this observation test did some errors  had some mistakes    there are more or less    mistakes. Some of them are very easy. There is a funnel  an aerial part  a lamp and clockwork key on the ark. Some of them are about the animals  the number. But there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark that's not reported here. And this problem is  where are the plants  So now we have God that is going to submerge Earth permanently or at least for a very long period  and no one is taking care of plants. Noah needed to take two of every kind of bird  of every kind of animal  of every kind of creature that moves  but no mention about plants. Why  In another part of the same story  all the living creatures are just the living creatures that came out from the ark  so birds  livestock and wild animals. Plants are not living creatures    this is the point. That is a point that is not coming out from the Bible  but it's something that really accompanied humanity. Let's have a look at this nice code that is coming from a Renaissance book. Here we have the description of the order of nature. It's a nice description because it's starting from left    you have the stones    immediately after the stones  the plants that are just able to live. We have the animals that are able to live and to sense  and on the top of the pyramid  there is the man. This is not the common man. The  Homo studiosus     the studying man. This is quite comforting for people like me    I'm a professor    this to be over there on the top of creation. But it's something completely wrong. You know very well about professors. But it's also wrong about plants  because plants are not just able to live  they are able to sense. They are much more sophisticated in sensing than animals. Just to give you an example  every single root apex is able to detect and to monitor concurrently and continuously at least    different chemical and physical parameters. And they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence. Well  but this is something    this underestimation of plants is something that is always with us. Let's have a look at this short movie now. We have David Attenborough. Now David Attenborough is really a plant lover  he did some of the most beautiful movies about plant behavior. Now  when he speaks about plants  everything is correct. When he speaks about animals   he  tends to remove the fact that plants exist. The blue whale  the biggest creature that exists on the planet    that is wrong  completely wrong. The blue whale  it's a dwarf if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet    that is  this wonderful  magnificent Sequoiadendron giganteum. And this is a living organism that has a mass of at least       tons. Now  the story that plants are some low level organisms has been formalized many times ago by Aristotle  that in  De Anima     that is a very influential book for the Western civilization    wrote that the plants are on the edge between living and not living. They have just a kind of very low level soul. It's called the vegetative soul  because they lack movement  and so they don't need to sense. Let's see. Okay  some of the movements of the plants are very well known. This is a very fast movement. This is a Dionaea  a Venus fly trap hunting snails    sorry for the snail. This has been something that has been refused for centuries  despite the evidence. No one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal  because it was against the order of nature. But plants are also able to show a lot of movement. Some of them are very well known  like the flowering. It's just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse. Some of them are much more sophisticated. Look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time. And it's really so graceful  it's like a dancing angel. They are also able to play    they are really playing. These are young sunflowers  and what they are doing cannot be described with any other terms than playing. They are training themselves  as many young animals do  to the adult life where they will be called to track the sun all the day. They are able to respond to gravity  of course  so the shoots are growing against the vector of gravity and the roots toward the vector of gravity. But they are also able to sleep. This is one  Mimosa pudica. So during the night  they curl the leaves and reduce the movement  and during the day  you have the opening of the leaves    there is much more movement. This is interesting because this sleeping machinery  it's perfectly conserved. It's the same in plants  in insects and in animals. And so if you need to study this sleeping problem  it's easy to study on plants  for example  than in animals and it's much more easy even ethically. It's a kind of vegetarian experimentation. Plants are even able to communicate    they are extraordinary communicators. They communicate with other plants. They are able to distinguish kin and non kin. They communicate with plants of other species and they communicate with animals by producing chemical volatiles  for example  during the pollination. Now with the pollination  it's a very serious issue for plants  because they move the pollen from one flower to the other  yet they cannot move from one flower to the other. So they need a vector    and this vector  it's normally an animal. Many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination  but not just insects  even birds  reptiles  and mammals like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen. This is a serious business. We have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance    very energizing    having in change this transportation of the pollen. But some plants are manipulating animals  like in the case of orchids that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen. Now  there is a big problem behind all this behavior that we have seen. How is it possible to do this without a brain  We need to wait until       when this big man  Charles Darwin  publishes a wonderful  astonishing book that starts a revolution. The title is  The Power of Movement in Plants.  No one was allowed to speak about movement in plants before Charles Darwin. In his book  assisted by his son  Francis    who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world  in Cambridge    they took into consideration every single movement for     pages. And in the last paragraph of the book  it's a kind of stylistic mark  because normally Charles Darwin stored  in the last paragraph of a book  the most important message. He wrote that   It's hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals.  This is not a metaphor. He wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was J.D. Hooker  or at that time  president of the Royal Society  so the maximum scientific authority in Britain speaking about the brain in the plants. Now  this is a root apex growing against a slope. So you can recognize this kind of movement  the same movement that worms  snakes and every animal that are moving on the ground without legs is able to display. And it's not an easy movement because  to have this kind of movement  you need to move different regions of the root and to synchronize these different regions without having a brain. So we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here  depicted in blue    that is called the  transition zone.  And this region  it's a very small region    it's less than one millimeter. And in this small region you have the highest consumption of oxygen in the plants and more important  you have these kinds of signals here. The signals that you are seeing here are action potential  are the same signals that the neurons of my brain  of our brain  use to exchange information. Now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature  but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant  like a plant of rye. We have almost    million roots. We have    and a half million root apex and a total length of     or more kilometers and a very high surface area. Now let's imagine that each single root apex is working in network with all the others. Here were have on the left  the Internet and on the right  the root apparatus. They work in the same way. They are a network of small computing machines  working in networks. And why are they so similar  Because they evolved for the same reason  to survive predation. They work in the same way. So you can remove    percent of the root apparatus and the plants  continue  to work. You can remove    percent of the Internet and it is  continuing  to work. So  a suggestion for the people working with networks  plants are able to give you good suggestions about how to evolve networks. And another possibility is a technological possibility. Let's imagine that we can build robots and robots that are inspired by plants. Until now  the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing a robot. We have the animaloid    and the normal robots inspired by animals  insectoid  so on. We have the androids that are inspired by man. But why have we not any plantoid  Well  if you want to fly  it's good that you look at birds    to be inspired by birds. But if you want to explore soils  or if you want to colonize new territory  to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this. We have another possibility we are working  on  in our lab   which  is to build hybrids. It's much more easy to build hybrids. Hybrid means it's something that's half living and half machine. It's much more easy to work with plants than with animals. They have computing power  they have electrical signals. The connection with the machine is much more easy  much more even ethically possible. And these are three possibilities that we are working on to build hybrids  driven by algae or by the leaves at the end  by the most  most powerful parts of the plants  by the roots. Well  thank you for your attention. And before I finish  I would like to reassure that no snails were harmed in making this presentation. Thank you. One of my favorite parts of my job at the Gates Foundation is that I get to travel to the developing world  and I do that quite regularly. And when I meet the mothers in so many of these remote places  I'm really struck by the things that we have in common. They want what we want for our children and that is for their children to grow up successful  to be healthy  and to have a successful life. But I also see lots of poverty  and it's quite jarring  both in the scale and the scope of it. My first trip in India  I was in a person's home where they had dirt floors  no running water  no electricity  and that's really what I see all over the world. So in short  I'm startled by all the things that they don't have. But I am surprised by one thing that they do have  Coca Cola. Coke is everywhere. In fact  when I travel to the developing world  Coke feels ubiquitous. And so when I come back from these trips  and I'm thinking about development  and I'm flying home and I'm thinking   We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations   you know  Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder  how is it that they can get Coke to these far flung places  If they can do that  why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing  And I'm not the first person to ask this question. But I think  as a community  we still have a lot to learn. It's staggering  if you think about Coca Cola. They sell  .  billion servings every single day. That's like every man  woman and child on the planet having a serving of Coke every week. So why does this matter  Well  if we're going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world  we need to learn from the innovators  and those innovators come from every single sector. I feel that  if we can understand what makes something like Coca Cola ubiquitous  we can apply those lessons then for the public good. Coke's success is relevant  because if we can analyze it  learn from it  then we can save lives. So that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke. And I think there are really three things we can take away from Coca Cola. They take real time data and immediately feed it back into the product. They tap into local entrepreneurial talent  and they do incredible marketing. So let's start with the data. Now Coke has a very clear bottom line    they report to a set of shareholders  they have to turn a profit. So they take the data  and they use it to measure progress. They have this very continuous feedback loop. They learn something  they put it back into the product  they put it back into the market. They have a whole team called  Knowledge and Insight.  It's a lot like other consumer companies. So if you're running Namibia for Coca Cola  and you have a     constituencies  you know where every can versus bottle of Sprite  Fanta or Coke was sold  whether it was a corner store  a supermarket or a pushcart. So if sales start to drop  then the person can identify the problem and address the issue. Let's contrast that for a minute to development. In development  the evaluation comes at the very end of the project. I've sat in a lot of those meetings  and by then  it is way too late to use the data. I had somebody from an NGO once describe it to me as bowling in the dark. They said   You roll the ball  you hear some pins go down. It's dark  you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on  and then you an see your impact.  Real time data turns on the lights. So what's the second thing that Coke's good at  They're good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent. Coke's been in Africa since       but most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets  because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world  which was a large truck rolling down the street. And in Africa  the remote places  it's hard to find a good road. But Coke noticed something    they noticed that local people were taking the product  buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these hard to reach places. And so they took a bit of time to learn about that. And they decided in      that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs  giving them small loans. They set them up as what they called micro distribution centers  and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people  who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product. There are now some       of these centers employing about        people in Africa. In Tanzania and Uganda  they represent    percent of Coke's sales. Let's look at the development side. What is it that governments and NGOs can learn from Coke  Governments and NGOs need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well  because the locals know how to reach the very hard to serve places  their neighbors  and they know what motivates them to make change. I think a great example of this is Ethiopia's new health extension program. The government noticed in Ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic  they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic. So if you're in an emergency situation    or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby    forget it  to get to the health care center. They decided that wasn't good enough  so they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala that also had a system like this  and they adapted it for Ethiopia. And in       the government of Ethiopia started this new system in their own country. They trained        health extension workers to deliver care directly to the people. In just five years  their ratio went from one worker for every        people to one worker for every       people. Now  think about how this can change people's lives. Health extension workers can help with so many things  whether it's family planning  prenatal care  immunizations for the children  or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on time delivery. That is having real impact in a country like Ethiopia  and it's why you see their child mortality numbers coming down    percent from      to     . In Ethiopia  there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program. So what's the next step for Ethiopia  Well  they're already starting talk about this. They're starting to talk about   How do you have the health community workers generate their own ideas  How do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting out in those remote villages   That's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock people's potential. The third component of Coke's success is marketing. Ultimately  Coke's success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a Coca Cola. Now the reason these micro entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow. So  they rely on Coca Cola in terms of its marketing  and what's the secret to their marketing  Well  it's aspirational. It is associated that product with a kind of life that people want to live. So even though it's a global company  they take a very local approach. Coke's global campaign slogan is  Open Happiness.  But they localize it. And they don't just guess what makes people happy  they go to places like Latin America and they realize that happiness there is associated with family life. And in South Africa  they associate happiness with seriti or community respect. Now  that played itself out in the World Cup campaign. Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it   Wavin' Flag  by a Somali hip hop artist.   Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh     Oh oh oh oh oh o oh     Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o oh    Give you freedom  give you fire    Give you reason  take you higher     See the champions take the field now     You define us  make us feel proud     In the streets our heads are lifted     As we lose our inhibition     Celebration  it's around us     Every nation  all around us   Melinda French Gates  It feels pretty good  right  Well  they didn't stop there    they localized it into    different languages. And it went number one on the pop chart in    countries. It reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood   I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing   that also went number one on the pop charts. Both songs have something in common  that same appeal of celebration and unity. So how does health and development market  Well  it's based on avoidance  not aspirations. I'm sure you've heard some of these messages.  Use a condom  don't get AIDS.   Wash you hands  you might not get diarrhea.  It doesn't sound anything like  Wavin' Flag  to me. And I think we make a fundamental mistake    we make an assumption  that we think that  if people need something  we don't have to make them want that. And I think that's a mistake. And there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change. One example is sanitation. We know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation. But there's a solution  you build a toilet. But what we're finding around the world  over and over again  is  if you build a toilet and you leave it there  it doesn't get used. People reuse it for a slab for their home. They sometimes store grain in it. I've even seen it used for a chicken coop. But what does marketing really entail that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea  Well  you work with the community. You start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that shouldn't be done in the village  and they agree to that. But then you take the toilet and you position it as a modern  trendy convenience. One state in Northern India has gone so far as to link toilets to courtship. And it works    look at these headlines. I'm not kidding. Women are refusing to marry men without toilets. No loo  no  I do.  Now  it's not just a funny headline    it's innovative. It's an innovative marketing campaign. But more importantly  it saves lives. Take a look at this    this is a room full of young men and my husband  Bill. And can you guess what the young men are waiting for  They're waiting to be circumcised. Can you you believe that  We know that circumcision reduces HIV infection by    percent in men. And when we first heard this result inside the Foundation  I have to admit  Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit and we were saying   But who's going to volunteer for this procedure   But it turns out the men do  because they're hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it  and the men also believe it improves their sex life. So if we can start to understand what people really want in health and development  we can change communities and we can change whole nations. Well  why is all of this so important  So let's talk about what happens when this all comes together  when you tie the three things together. And polio  I think  is one of the most powerful examples. We've seen a    percent reduction in polio in    years. So if you look back to       there are about         cases of polio on the planet that year. In       we're down to       cases. Well how did that happen  Let's look at a country like India. They have over a billion people in this country  but they have        local doctors who report paralysis  and clinicians  a huge reporting system in chemists. They have two and a half million vaccinators. But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you. Let me tell you the story of Shriram  an    month boy in Bihar  a northern state in India. This year on August  th  he felt paralysis and on the   th  his parents took him to the doctor. On August   th and   th  they took a stool sample  and by the   th of August  it was confirmed he had Type   polio. By August   th  a genetic test was done  and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had. Now it could have come from one of two places. It could have come from Nepal  just to the north  across the border  or from Jharkhand  a state just to the south. Luckily  the genetic testing proved that  in fact  this strand came north  because  had it come from the south  it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission. So many more people would have been affected. So what's the endgame  Well on September  th  there was a huge mop up campaign  which is what you do in polio. They went out and where Shriram lives  they vaccinated two million people. So in less than a month  we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program. And I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio. That's how you keep a huge outbreak from spreading  and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their hands  they can save lives. Now one of the challenges in polio  still  is marketing  but it might not be what you think. It's not the marketing on the ground. It's not telling the parents   If you see paralysis  take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated.  We have a problem with marketing in the donor community. The G  nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last    years  but we're starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations aren't willing to fund polio any longer. So by next summer  we're sighted to run out of money on polio. So we are    percent of the way there on this goal and we're about to run short of money. And I think that if the marketing were more aspirational  if we could focus as a community on how far we've come and how amazing it would be to eradicate this disease  we could put polio fatigue and polio behind us. And if we could do that  we could stop vaccinating everybody  worldwide  in all of our countries for polio. And it would only be the second disease ever wiped off the face of the planet. And we are so close. And this victory is so possible. So if Coke's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness  I'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms. To me  that is deep happiness. And so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector  then in the future we make together  that happiness can be just as ubiquitous as Coca Cola. Thank you. I learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype. My wife sent me a message   Whoa  earthquake   and then disappeared for    minutes. It was    minutes of absolute terror that thousands of people across the U.S. felt. I was afraid of a tsunami  what I didn't realize was there was a greater terror in Haiti  and that was building collapse. We've all seen the photos of the collapsed buildings in Haiti. These are shots my wife took a couple days after the quake  while I was making my way through the D.R. into the country. This is the national palace    the equivalent of the White House. This is the largest supermarket in the Caribbean at peak shopping time. This is a nurses' college    there are     nurses studying. The general hospital right next door emerged largely unscathed. This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance. We have all heard about the tremendous human loss in the earthquake in Haiti  but we haven't heard enough about why all those lives were lost. We haven't heard about why the buildings failed. After all  it was the buildings  not the earthquake  that killed         people  that injured          that displaced  .  million people  that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation. This is the largest metropolitan area disaster in decades  and it was not a natural disaster    it was a disaster of engineering. AIDG has worked in Haiti since       providing engineering and business support to small businesses. And after the quake  we started bringing in earthquake engineers to figure out why the buildings collapsed  to examine what was safe and what wasn't. Working with MINUSTAH  which is the U.N. mission in Haiti  with the Ministry of Public Works  with different NGOs  we inspected over       buildings. We inspected schools and private residencies. We inspected medical centers and food warehouses. We inspected government buildings. This is the Ministry of Justice. Behind that door is the National Judicial Archives. The fellow in the door  Andre Filitrault    who's the director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Earthquake Engineering Research at the University of Buffalo    was examining it to see if it was safe to recover the archives. Andre told me  after seeing these buildings fail again and again in the same way  that there is no new research here. There is nothing here that we don't know. The failure points were the same  walls and slabs not tied properly into columns    that's a roof slab hanging off the building    cantilevered structures  or structures that were asymmetric  that shook violently and came down  poor building materials  not enough concrete  not enough compression in the blocks  rebar that was smooth  rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away. Now there's a solution to all these problems. And we know how to build properly. The proof of this came in Chile  almost a month later  when  .  magnitude earthquake hit Chile. That is     times the power of the  .  that hit Port au Prince        times the power  yet only under a thousand casualties. Adjusted for population density  that is less than one percent of the impact of the Haitian quake. What was the difference between Chile and Haiti  Seismic standards and confined masonry  where the building acts as a whole    walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together to support each other    instead of breaking off into separate members and failing. If you look at this building in Chile  it's ripped in half  but it's not a pile of rubble. Chileans have been building with confined masonry for decades. Right now  AIDG is working with KPFF Consulting Engineers  Architecture for Humanity  to bring more confined masonry training into Haiti. This is Xantus Daniel  he's a mason  just a general construction worker  not a foreman  who took one of our trainings. On his last job he was working with his boss  and they started pouring the columns wrong. He took his boss aside  and he showed him the materials on confined masonry. He showed him   You know  we don't have to do this wrong. It won't cost us any more to do it the right way.  And they redid that building. They tied the rebar right  they poured the columns right  and that building will be safe. And every building that they build going forward will be safe. To make sure these buildings are safe  it's not going to take policy    it's going to take reaching out to the masons on the ground and helping them learn the proper techniques. Now there are many groups doing this. And the fellow in the vest there  Craig Toten  he has pushed forward to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this. Through Haiti Rewired  through Build Change  Architecture for Humanity  AIDG  there is the possibility to reach out to                  masons across the country and create a movement of proper building. If you reach out to the people on the ground in this collaborative way it's extremely affordable. For the billions spent on reconstruction  you can train masons for dollars on every house that they end up building over their lifetime. Ultimately  there are two ways that you can rebuild Haiti  the way at the top is the way that Haiti's been building for decades. The way at the top is a poorly constructed building that will fail. The way at the bottom is a confined masonry building  where the walls are tied together  the building is symmetric  and it will stand up to an earthquake. For all the disaster  there is an opportunity here to build better houses for the next generation  so that when the next earthquake hits  it is a disaster    but not a tragedy. I was informed by this kind of unoriginal and trite idea that new technologies were an opportunity for social transformation  which is what drove me then  and still  it's a delusion that drives me now. I wanted to update what I've been doing since then    but it's still the same theme song    and introduce you to my lab and current work  which is the Environmental Health Clinic that I run at NYU. And what it is    it's a twist on health. Because  really  what I'm trying to do now is redefine what counts as health. It's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university  except people come to the clinic with environmental health concerns  and they walk out with prescriptions for things they can do to improve environmental health  as opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns and walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals. It's a handy dandy quote from Hippocrates of the Hippocratic oath that says   The greater part of the soul lays outside the body  treatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer.  But that suggests the issue that I'm trying to get at here  that we have an opportunity to redefine what is health. Because this idea that health is internal and atomized and individual and pharmaceutical is largely an error. And I would use this study  a recent study by Philip Landrigan  to motivate a different view of health  where he went to most of the pediatricians in Manhattan and the New York area and logged what they spent their patient hours on.    to    percent of their time was spent on five things. Number one was asthma  number two was developmental delays  number three was     fold increases in rare childhood cancers in the last eight to        years. Number four and five were childhood obesity and diabetes related issues. So all of those    what's common about all of those  The environment is implicated  radically implicated  right. This is not the germs that medicos were trained to deal with  this is a different definition of health  health that has a great advantage because it's external  it's shared  we can do something about it  as opposed to internal  genetically predetermined or individualized. People who come to the clinic are called  not patients  but impatients  because they're too impatient to wait for legislative change to address local and environmental health issues. And I meet them at the University  I also have a few field offices that I set up in various places that provide an immersion in some of the environmental challenges we face. I like this one from the Belgian field office  where we met in a roundabout  precisely because the roundabout iconified the headless social movement that informs much social transformation  as opposed to the top down control of red light traffic intersections. In this case  of course  the roundabout with that micro decisions being made in situ by people not being told what to do. But  of course  affords greater throughput  fewer accidents  and an interesting model of social movement. Some of the things that the monitoring protocols have developed  this is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol  or keeping tabs  if you will. What they are is an addition of tadpoles that are named after a local bureaucrat whose decisions affect your water quality. So an impatient concerned for water quality would raise a tadpole bureaucrat in a sample of water in which they're interested. And we give them a couple of things to do that  to help them do companion animal devices while they're blogging and doing their email. This is a tadpole walker to take your tadpole walking in the evening. And the interesting thing that happens    because we're using tadpoles  of course  because they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have  several orders of magnitude more sensitive than some of our senses for sensing  responding in a biologically meaningful way  to that whole class of industrial contaminants we call endocrine disruptors or hormone emulators. But by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening    there's a few action shots    your neighbors are likely to say   What are you doing   And then you have to introduce your tadpole and who it's named after. You have to explain what you're doing and how the developmental events of a tadpole are  of course  very observable and they use the same T  mediated hormones that we do. And so next time your neighbor sees you they'll say   How is that tadpole doing   And you can let them social network with your tadpole  because the Environmental Health Clinic has a social networking site for  not only impatients  humans  but non humans  social networking for humans and non humans. And of course  these endocrine disruptors are things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic  the obesity epidemic  the two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls and other related things. The culmination of this is if you've successfully raised your tadpole  observing the behavioral and developmental events  you will then go and introduce your tadpole to its namesake and discuss the evidence that you've seen. Another quick protocol    and I'm going to go through these quickly  but just to give you the material sense of what we're doing here    instead of asking you for urine samples  I'll ask you for a mouse sample. Anyone here lucky enough to share  to cohabit with a mouse    a domestic partnership with mice  Very lucky. Mice  of course  are the quintessential model organism. They're even better models of environmental health  because not only the same mammalian biology  but they share your diet  largely. They share your environmental stressors  the asbestos levels and lead levels  whatever you're exposed to. And they're geographically more limited than you are  because we don't know if you've been exposed to persistent organic pollutants in your home  or occupationally or as a child. Mice are a very good representation. So it starts by building a better mousetrap  of course. This is one of them. Coping with environmental stressors is tricky. Is anybody here on antidepressants  There's a lot of people in Manhattan are. And we were testing if the mice would also self administer SSRIs. So this was Prozac  this was Zoloft  this was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant  all of which were the medications that the impatient was taking. So do you think the mice self administered antidepressants  What's the     Audience  Sure. Yes.  How did you know that  They did. This was vodka and solution  gin and solution. This guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant. Where's our expert  Vodka  gin    Yes. Yes. You know your mice well. They did  yes. So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water  which was interesting. Then of course  it goes into the entrapment device. There's an old cellphone in there    a good use for old cellphones    which dials the clinic  we go and pick up the mouse. We take the blood sample and do the blood work and hair work on the mice. And I want to sort of point out the big advantage of framing health in this external way. But we do have a few prescription products through this. It's very different from the medical model. Anything you do to improve your water quality or air quality  or to understand it or to change it  the benefits are enjoyed by anyone you share that water quality or air quality with. And that aggregating effect  that collective action effect  is actually something we can use to our advantage. So I want to show you one prescription product in the clinic called the No Park. This is a prescription to improve water quality. Many impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality. What we do is we take a fire hydrant  a  no parking  space associated with a fire hydrant  and we prescribe the removal of the asphalt to create an engineered micro landscape  to create an infiltration opportunity. Because  many of you will know  that the biggest pollution burden that we have on the New York  New Jersey harbor right now is no longer the point sources  no longer the big polluters  no longer the GEs  but that massive network of roads   those  impervious surfaces  that collect all that cadmium neurotoxin that comes from your brake liners or the oily hydrocarbon waste in every single storm event and medieval infrastructure washes it straight into the estuary system. That doesn't do a lot of good. These are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants before they enter the harbor  and they're produced by impatients on various city blocks in some very interesting ways. I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though  there's about two or three fire hydrants on every city block. By creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them  we don't prevent them from being used as emergency vehicle parking spaces  because  of course  a firetruck can come and park there. They flatten a few plants. No big deal  they'll regenerate. But if we did this in every single    every fire hydrant we could redefine the emergency. That    percent of the time when a firetruck is not parking there  it's infiltrating pollutants. It's also increasing fixing CO s  sequestering some of the airborne pollutants. And aggregated  these smaller interceptions could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution that now runs into the estuary system  up to a seven inch rain event  up to a hundred year storm. So these are small actions that can amount to a significant effect to improve local environmental health. This is one of the more ambitious ones. What the climate crisis has revealed to us is a secondary  more insidious and more pervasive crisis  which is the crisis of agency  which is what to do. Somehow buying a local lettuce  changing a light bulb  driving the speed limit  changing your tires regularly  doesn't seem sufficient in the face of climate crisis. And this is an interesting icon that happened    you remember these  fallout shelters. What is the fallout shelter for the climate crisis  This was civic mobilization. Churches  school groups  hospitals  private residents    everyone built one of these in a matter of months. And they still remain as icons of civic response in the face of shared  uncertain  collective threat. Fallout shelter for the climate crisis  I would say  looks something like this  or this  which is an intensive urban agriculture facility that's due to go on my lab building at NYU. What it does is a very simple idea of taking       to    percent of the CO  produced in Manhattan is building related    we take  just like a commercial greenhouse  we take the CO  from the building    CO  enriched air    we force it through the urban agriculture facility  and then we resupply oxygen enriched air. You can't actually build much on a roof  they're not designed for that. So it's on legs  so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns. It's built as a barn raising  using open source hardware. This is the quarter scale prototype that was functioning in Spain. This is what it will look like  fingers crossed  NYU willing. And what I want to show you is    actually this is one of the components of it that we've just recently been testing    which is a solar chimney    we have got    of them now put around New York at the moment    that passively draws air up. You understand a solar chimney. Hot air rises. You put a bit of black plastic on the side of a building  it'll heat up  and you'll get passive airflow. What we do is actually put a standard HVAC filter on the top of that. That actually removes about    percent of the carbon black  that stuff that  with ozone  is responsible for about half of global warming's effects  because it changes  it settles on the snow  it changes the reflectors  it changes the transmission qualities of the atmosphere. Carbon black is that grime that otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs  and it's associated with. It's not good stuff  and it's from inefficient combustion  not from combustion itself. When we put it through our solar chimney  we remove actually about    percent of that. And then I swap it out with the students and actually re release that carbon black. And we make pencils the length of which measures the grime that we've pulled out of the air. Here's one of them that we have up now. Here's who put them up and who are avid pencil users. Okay  so I want to show you just two more interfaces  because I think one of our big challenges is re imagining our relationship to natural systems  not only through this model of twisted personalized health  but through the animals with whom we cohabit. We are not alone  the animals are moving in. In fact  urban migration now describes the movement of animals formerly known as wild into urban centers. You know  coyote in Central Park  a whale in the Gowanus Canal  elk in Westchester County. It's happening all over the Developed World  probably for loss of habitat  but also because our cities are a little bit more livable than they have been. And every green space we create is an invitation for non humans to cohabit with us. But we've kind of lacked imagination in how we could do that well or interestingly. And I want to show you a few of the technological interfaces that have been developed under the moniker of OOZ    which is zoo backwards and without cages    to try and reform that relationship. This is communication technology for birds. It looks like this. When a bird lands on it  they trigger a sound file. This is actually in the Whitney Museum  where there were six of them  each of which had a different argument on it  different sound file. They said things like this. Recorded Voice  Here's what you need to do. Go down there and buy some of those health food bars  the ones you call bird food  and bring it here and scatter it around. There's a good person. Natalie Jeremijenko  Okay.  Laugher  So there was several of these. The birds were able to jump from one to the other. These are just your average urban pigeon. And an early test which argument elicited cooperative behavior from the people below    about a hundred to one decided that this was the argument that worked best on us. Recorded Voice  Tick  tick  tick. That's the sound of genetic mutations of the avian flu becoming a deadly human flu. Do you know what slows it down  Healthy sub populations of birds  increasing biodiversity generally. It is in your interests that I'm healthy  happy  well fed. Hence  you could share some of your nutritional resources instead of monopolizing them. That is  share your lunch. NJ  It worked  and it's true. The final project I'd like to show you is a new interface for fish that has just been launched    it's actually officially launched next week    with a wonderful commission from the Architectural League. You may not have known that you need to communicate with fish  but there is now a device for you to do so. It looks like this  buoys that float on the water  project three foot up  three foot down. When a fish swims underneath  a light goes on. This is what it looks like. So there's another function on here. This top light is    I'm sorry if I'm making you seasick    this top light is actually a water quality display that shifts from red  when the dissolved oxygen is low  to a blue green  when its dissolved oxygen is high. And then you can also text the fish. So there's business cards down there that'll give you contact details. And they text back. When the buoys get your text  they wink at you twice to say  we've got your message. But perhaps the most popular has been that we've got another array of these boys in the Bronx River  where the first beaver    crazy as he is    to have moved in and built a lodge in New York in     years  hangs out. So updates from a beaver. You can subscribe to updates from him. You can talk to him. And what I like to think of is this is an interface that re scripts how we interact with natural systems  specifically by changing who has information  where they have it  who can make sense of that information  and what you can do about it. In this case  instead of throwing chewing gum  or Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish    There's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with that's in the middle of the city  and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution  it's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds. Instead of doing that actually  we've developed some fish sticks that you can feed the fish. They're delicious. They're cross species delicious that is  delicious for humans and non humans. But they also have a chelating agent in them. They're nutritionally appropriate  not like Doritos. And so every time that desire to interact with the animals  which is at least as ubiquitous as that sign   Do not feed the animals.  And there's about three of them on every New York City park. And Yellowstone National Park  there's more  do not feed the animals  signs than there are animals you might wish to feed. But in that action  that interaction  by re scripting that  by changing it into an opportunity to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate  that could augment the nutritional resources that we ourselves have depleted for augmenting the fish population and also adding chelating agent  which  like any chelating agent that we use medicinally  binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs that are in the fish living in this particular habitat and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt where it's complexed by a reactive  effectively removing it from bioavailability. But I wanted to say that interaction  re scripting that interaction  into collective action  collective remediative action  very different from the approach that's being used on the other side on the Hudson River  where we're dredging the PCBs    after    years of legislative and legal struggle  GE's paying for the dredging of the largest Superfund site in the world    we're dredging it  and it'll probably get shipped off to Pennsylvania or the nearest Third World country  where it will continue to be toxic sludge. Displacement is not the way to deal with environmental issues. And that's typically the paradigm under which we've operated. By actually taking the opportunity that new technologies  new interactive technologies  present to re script our interactions  to script them  not just as isolated  individuated interactions  but as collective aggregating actions that can amount to something  we can really begin to address some of our important environmental challenges. Thank you. Every presentation needs this slide in it. It's beautiful  isn't it  Do you see  All the points  all the lines    it's incredible. It is the network  and in my case  the network has been important in media  because I get to connect to people. Isn't it amazing  Through that  I connect to people. And the way that I've been doing it has been multifaceted. For example  I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners. I put together projects like Earth Sandwich  where I ask people to try and simultaneously place two pieces of bread perfectly opposite each other on the Earth. And people started laying bread in tribute  and eventually a team was able to do it between New Zealand and Spain. It's pretty incredible    the video's online. Connecting to people in projects like YoungmeNowme for example. In YoungmeNowme  the audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as an adult. This is the same person    top photo  James  bottom photo   Jennifer . Poignant. This was a Mother's Day gift. Particularly creepy. My favorite of these photos  which I couldn't find  is there's a picture of a    year old woman or so with a little baby on her lap  and the next photo is a     lb man with a tiny  little old lady peaking over his shoulder. But this project changed the way that I thought about connecting to people. This is project called Ray. And what happened was I was sent this piece of audio and had no idea who generated the audio. Somebody said   You have to listen to this.  And this is what came to me. Recording  Hi  my name is Ray  and on yesterday my daughter called me because she was stressed out because of things that were going on on her job that she felt was quite unfair. Being quite disturbed  she called for comfort  and I didn't really know what to tell her  because we have to deal with so much mess in our society. So I was led to write this song just for her  just to give her some encouragement while dealing with stress and pressures on her job. And I figured I'd put it on the Internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job. Here's how the song goes.   I'm about to whip somebody's ass     Oh  I'm about to whip somebody's ass     Oh  if you don't leave me alone      you gonna have to send me home     'Cause I'm about to whip somebody's ass   Now you might not be able to sing that out loud  but you can hum it to yourself  and you know what the words are. And let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job. All right. Stay strong. Peace. Ze Frank  So    yeah. No  no  no  shush. We've got to go quickly. So I was so moved by this    this is incredible. This was connecting  right. This was  at a distance  realizing that someone was feeling something  wanting to affect them in a particular way  using media to do it  putting it online and realizing that there was a greater impact. This was incredible  this is what I wanted to do. So the first thing I thought of is we have to thank him. And I asked my audience  I said   Listen to this piece of audio. We have to remix it. He's got a great voice. It's actually in the key of B flat. And have to do something with it.  Hundreds of remixes came back    lots of different attempts. One stood out in particular. It was done by a guy named Goose. Remix    I'm about to whip somebody's ass     Oh  I'm about to whip somebody's ass     Oh  if you don't leave me alone      You gonna have to send me home     Cuz I'm about to whip somebody's ass     I'm about to whip some      ZF  Great  so it was incredible. That song     Applause  Thank you. So that song  somebody told me that it was at a baseball game in Kansas City. In the end  it was one of the top downloads on a whole bunch of music streaming services. And so I said   Let's put this together in an album.  And the audience came together  and they designed an album cover. And I said   If you put it all on this  I'm going to deliver it to him  if you can figure out who this person is   because all I had was his name    Ray    and this little piece of audio and the fact that his daughter was upset. In two weeks  they found him. I received and email and it said   Hi  I'm Ray. I heard you were looking for me.  And I was like   Yeah  Ray. It's been an interesting two weeks.  And so I flew to St. Louis and met Ray  and he's a preacher    among other things. So but anyways  here's the thing    is it reminds me of this  which is a sign that you see in Amsterdam on every street corner. And it's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world. I look at this photo  and he seems really interested in what's going on with that button  but it doesn't seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street. And it makes me think of this. On street corners everywhere  people are looking at their cell phones  and it's easy to dismiss this as some sort of bad trend in human culture. But the truth is life is being lived there. When they smile    right  you've seen people stop    all of a sudden  life is being lived there  somewhere up in that weird  dense network. And this is it  right  to feel and be felt. It's the fundamental force that we're all after. We can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier  but ultimately  what we're trying to do is really connect with one other person. And that's not always going to happen in physical spaces. It's also going to now happen in virtual spaces  and we have to get better at figuring that out. I think  of the people that build all this technology in the network  a lot of them aren't very good at connecting with people. This is kind of like something I used to do in third grade. So here's a series of projects over the last few years where I've been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection. Sometimes they're very  very simple things. A Childhood Walk  which is a project where I ask people to remember a walk that they used to take as a child over and over again that was sort of meaningless    like on the route to the bus stop  to a neighbor's house  and take it inside of Google Streetview. And I promise you  if you take that walk inside Google Streetview  you come to a moment where something comes back and hits you in the face. And I collected those moments    the photos inside Google Streetview and the memories  specifically.  Our conversation started with me saying  'I'm bored ' and her replying  'When I'm bored I eat pretzels.' I remember this distinctly because it came up a lot.   Right after he told me and my brother he was going to be separating from my mom  I remember walking to a convenience store and getting a cherry cola.   They used some of the morbidly artist footage  a close up of Chad's shoes in the middle of the highway. I guess the shoes came off when he was hit. He slept over at my house once  and he left his pillow. It had 'Chad' written in magic marker on it. He died long after he left the pillow at my house  but we never got around to returning it.  Sometimes they're a little bit more abstract. This is Pain Pack. Right after September   th  last year  I was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it  the way that we excise it from our bodies. So what I did is I opened up a hotline    a hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain  not necessarily related to that event. And people called in and left messages like this. Recording  Okay  here's something. I'm not alone  and I am loved. I'm really fortunate. But sometimes I feel really lonely. And when I feel that way even the smallest act of kindness can make me cry. Like even people in convenience stores saying   Have a nice day   when they're accidentally looking me in the eye. ZF  So what I did was I took those voicemails  and with their permission  converted them to MP s and distributed them to sound editors who created short sounds using just those voicemails. And those were then distributed to DJs who have made hundreds of songs using that source material. We don't have time to play much of it. You can look at it online.  From    to    with love  was a project around the time of the last election cycle  where McCain and Obama both  in their speeches after the election  talked about reconciliation  and I was like   What the hell does that look like   So I thought   Well let's just give it a try. Let's have people hold up signs about reconciliation.  And so some really nice things came together.  I voted blue. I voted red. Together  for our future.  These are very  very cute little things right. Some came from the winning party.  Dear     I promise to listen to you  to fight for you  to respect you always.  Some came from the party who had just lost.  From a    to a     may your party's leadership be as classy as you  but I doubt it.  But the truth was that as this start becoming popular  a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards apparently found it to be a little patronizing  which I could also see. And so I started getting amazing amounts of hate mail  death threats even. And one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful messages  and he was dressed as Batman. And he said   I'm dressed as Batman to hide my identity.  Just in case I thought the real Batman was coming after me  which actually made me feel a little better    like   Phew  it's not him.  So what I did    unfortunately  I was harboring all this kind of awful experience and this pain inside of me  and it started to eat away at my psyche. And I was protecting the project from it  I realized. I was protecting it    I didn't want this special  little group of photographs to get sullied in some way. So what I did  I took all those emails  and I put them together into something called Angrigami  which was an origami template made out of this sort of vile stuff. And I asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the Angrigami. But this was the emotional moment. One of my viewer's uncles died on a particular day and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate. It's amazing. The last thing I'm going to tell you about is a series of projects called Songs You Already Know  where the idea was  I was trying to figure out to address particular kinds of emotions with group projects. So one of them was fairly straightforward. A guy said that his daughter got scared at night and could I write a song for her  his daughter. And I said   Oh yeah  I'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself to help herself go to sleep.  And this was  Scared.    I don't know why but it helps me get over it     The words of the song just move me along     And somehow I get over it     At least I don't suck at life     I keep on trying despite     At least I don't suck at life     I keep on trying despite     This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something   Okay  so I wrote that song  right. Thank you. So the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter's room at some point  and she actually was singing that song to herself. So I was like   Awesome. This is great.  And then I got this email. And there's a little bit of a back story to this. And I don't have much time. But the idea was that at one point I did a project called Facebook Me Equals You  where I wanted to experience what it was like to live as another person. So I asked for people's usernames and passwords to be sent to me. And I got a lot  like    in a half an hour. And I shut that part down. And I chose two people to be  and I asked them to send me descriptions of how to act as them on Facebook. One person sent me a very detailed description  the other person didn't. And the person who didn't  it turned out  had just moved to a new city and taken on a new job. So  you know  people were writing me and saying   How's your new job   I was like   I don't know. Didn't know I had one.  But anyway  this same person  Laura  ended up emailing me a little bit after that project. And I felt badly for not having done a good job. And she said   I'm really anxious  I just moved to a new town  I have this new job  and I've just had this incredible amount of anxiety.  So she had seen the  Scared  song and wondered if I could do something. So I asked her   What does it feel like when you feel this way   And she wrote a sort of descriptive set of what it felt like to have had this anxiety. And so what I decided to do. I said   Okay  I'll think about it.  And so quietly in the background  I started sending people this.   You're okay     You'll be fine   So I asked people whether they had basic audio capabilities  just so they could sing along to the song with headphones on  so I could just get their voices back. And this is the kind of thing that I got back. Recording    Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine   ZF  So that's one of the better ones  really. But what's awesome is  as I started getting more and more and more of them  all of a sudden I had        voices from around the world. And when you put them together  something magical happens  something absolutely incredible happens  and all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world. And what was really great is  I'm putting all this work together in the background  and Laura sent me a follow up email because a good month had passed by. And she said   I know you've forgotten about me. I just want to say thanks for even considering it.  And then a few days later I sent her this.   And things that looked so good yesterday     are now shades of gray     And it seems like the world is spinning     while I'm standing still     Or maybe I am spinning I can't tell     And then you say     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe     And now the words sing     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe     Now everybody sings     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe   Thank you. The stories we tell about each other matter very much. The stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter. And most of all  I think the way that we participate in each other's stories is of deep importance. I was six years old when I first heard stories about the poor. Now I didn't hear those stories from the poor themselves  I heard them from my Sunday school teacher and Jesus  kind of via my Sunday school teacher. I remember learning that people who were poor needed something material    food  clothing  shelter    that they didn't have. And I also was taught  coupled with that  that it was my job    this classroom full of five and six year old children    it was our job  apparently  to help. This is what Jesus asked of us. And then he said   What you do for the least of these  you do for me.  Now I was pretty psyched. I was very eager to be useful in the world    I think we all have that feeling. And also  it was kind of interesting that God needed help. That was news to me  and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in. But I also learned very soon thereafter that Jesus also said  and I'm paraphrasing  the poor would always be with us. This frustrated and confused me  I felt like I had been just given a homework assignment that I had to do  and I was excited to do  but no matter what I would do  I would fail. So I felt confused  a little bit frustrated and angry  like maybe I'd misunderstood something here. And I felt overwhelmed. And for the first time  I began to fear this group of people and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people. I imagined in my head  a kind of long line of individuals that were never going away  that would always be with us. They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things  which I was excited to do  but I didn't know how it was going to work. And I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give  especially if the problem was never going away. In the years following  the other stories I heard about the poor growing up were no more positive. For example  I saw pictures and images frequently of sadness and suffering. I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor. I heard about disease  I heard about war    they always seemed to be kind of related. And in general  I got this sort of idea that the poor in the world lived lives that were wrought with suffering and sadness  devastation  hopelessness. And after a while  I developed what I think many of us do  is this predictable response  where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them. I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth  because I wasn't doing more  apparently  to make things better. And I even felt a sense of shame because of that. And so naturally  I started to distance myself. I stopped listening to their stories quite as closely as I had before. And I stopped expecting things to really change. Now I still gave    on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved. I gave of my time and my money  I gave when solutions were on sale. The cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life  right. I mean who can argue with that  I gave when I was cornered  when it was difficult to avoid and I gave  in general  when the negative emotions built up enough that I gave to relieve my own suffering  not someone else's. The truth be told  I was giving out of that place  not out of a genuine place of hope and excitement to help and of generosity. It became a transaction for me  became sort of a trade. I was purchasing something    I was buying my right to go on with my day and not necessarily be bothered by this bad news. And I think the way that we go through that sometimes can  first of all  disembody a group of people  individuals out there in the world. And it can also turn into a commodity  which is a very scary thing. So as I did this  and as I think many of us do this  we kind of buy our distance  we kind of buy our right to go on with our day. I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most. It can get in the way of our desire to really be meaningful and useful in another person's life and  in short to love. Thankfully  a few years ago  things shifted for me because I heard this gentleman speak  Dr. Muhammad Yunus. I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is  but to give the shorthand version for any who have not heard him speak  Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago for his work pioneering modern microfinance. When I heard him speak  it was three years before that. But basically  microfinance    if this is new to you as well    think of that as financial services for the poor. Think of all the things you get at your bank and imagine those products and services tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day. Dr. Yunus shared his story  explaining what that was  and what he had done with his Grameen Bank. He also talked about  in particular  microlending  which is a tiny loan that could help someone start or grow a business. Now  when I heard him speak  it was exciting for a number of reasons. First and foremost  I learned about this new method of change in the world that  for once  showed me  maybe  a way to interact with someone and to give  to share of a resource in a way that wasn't weird and didn't make me feel bad    that was exciting. But more importantly  he told stories about the poor that were different than any stories I had heard before. In fact  those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note. He was talking about strong  smart  hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day and were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better. All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better was a little bit of capital. It was an amazing sort of insight for me. And I  in fact  was so deeply moved by this    it's hard to express now how much that affected me    but I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later  and I moved to East Africa to try to see for myself what this was about. For the first time  actually  in a long time I wanted to meet those individuals  I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs  and see for myself what their lives were actually about. So I spent three months in Kenya  Uganda and Tanzania interviewing entrepreneurs that had received     dollars to start or grow a business. And in fact  through those interactions  for the first time  I was starting to get to be friends with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there that was supposed to be far away. I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories. And over and over again  as I interviewed them and spent my days with them  I did hear stories of life change and amazing little details of change. So I would hear from goat herders who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats. Their business trajectory would change. They would make a little bit more money  their standard of living would shift and would get better. And they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives  like they would start to send their children to school. They might be able to buy mosquito nets. Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure. Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when I came as their guest and that made them feel proud. But there were these beautiful details  even if I talked to    goat herders in a row  and some days that's what happened    these beautiful details of life change that were meaningful to them. That was another thing that really touched me. It was really humbling to see for the first time  to really understand that even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything  I probably would have gotten a lot wrong. Because the best way for people to change their lives is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them. So I saw that and it was very humbling. Anyway  another interesting thing happened while I was there. I never once was asked for a donation  which had kind of been my mode  right. There's poverty  you give money to help    no one asked me for a donation. In fact  no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all. If anything  they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already and to build on their own capabilities. So what I did hear  once in a while  was that people wanted a loan    I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting. And by the way  I was a philosophy and poetry major in school  so I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa. I just got this impression that the money would work. And my introduction to business was in these      little infuses of capital. And I learned about profit and revenue  about leverage  all sorts of things  from farmers  from seamstresses  from goat herders. So this idea that these new stories of business and hope might be shared with my friends and family  and through that  maybe we could get some of the money that they needed to be able to continue their businesses as loans  that's this little idea that turned into Kiva. A few months later  I went back to Uganda with a digital camera and a basic website that my partner  Matthew  and I had kind of built  and took pictures of seven of my new friends  posted their stories  these stories of entrepreneurship  up on the website  spammed friends and family and said   We think this is legal. Haven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details  but do you say  do you want to help participate in this  provide the money that they need   The money came in basically overnight. We sent it over to Uganda. And over the next six months  a beautiful thing happened  the entrepreneurs received the money  they were paid  and their businesses  in fact  grew  and they were able to support themselves and change the trajectory of their lives. In October of '    after those first seven loans were paid  Matt and I took the word beta off of the site. We said   Our little experiment has been a success. Let's start for real.  That was our official launch. And then that first year  October '   through '    Kiva facilitated          in loans. The second year  it was a total of    million. The third year  the total was up to around   . The fourth year  we were just short of    . And today  less than five years in  Kiva's facilitated more than     million dollars  in little    dollar bits  from lenders and entrepreneurs    more than a million of those  collectively in     countries. So that's where Kiva is today  just to bring you right up to the present. And while those numbers and those statistics are really fun to talk about and they're interesting  to me  Kiva's really about stories. It's about retelling the story of the poor  and it's about giving ourselves an opportunity to engage that validates their dignity  validates a partnership relationship  not a relationship that's based on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary weirdness that can happen. But instead a relationship that can promote respect and hope and this optimism that together we can move forward. So what I hope is that  not only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva    that's a very positive and meaningful thing    but I hope Kiva can blur those lines  like I said  between the traditional rich and poor categories that we're taught to see in the world  this false dichotomy of us and them  have and have not. I hope that Kiva can blur those lines. Because as that happens  I think we can feel free to interact in a way that's more open  more just and more creative  to engage with each other and to help each other. Imagine how you feel when you see somebody on street who is begging and you're about to approach them. Imagine how you feel  and then imagine the difference when you might see somebody who has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work who wants to tell you about their business. Maybe they're smiling  and they want to talk to you about what they've done. Imagine if you're speaking with somebody who's growing things and making them flourish  somebody who's using their talents to do something productive  somebody who's built their own business from scratch  someone who is surrounded by abundance  not scarcity  who's in fact creating abundance  somebody with full hands with something to offer  not empty hands asking for you to give them something. Imagine if you could hear a story you didn't expect of somebody who wakes up every day and works very  very hard to make their life better. These stories can really change the way that we think about each other. And if we can catalyze a supportive community to come around these individuals and to participate in their story by lending a little bit of money  I think that can change the way we believe in each other and each other's potential. Now for me  Kiva is just the beginning. And as I look forward to what is next  it's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far. The first one is  as I mentioned  entrepreneurship was a new idea to me. Kiva borrowers  as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years  have taught me what entrepreneurship is. And I think  at its core  it's deciding that you want your life to be better. You see an opportunity and you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that. In short  it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today and going after that. Second thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity. So they're not a donation. Yeah  maybe it doesn't sound that much different. But in fact  when you give something to someone and they say   Thanks   and let you know how things go  that's one thing. When you lend them money  and they slowly pay you back over time  you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue. This continued attention    this ongoing attention    is a really big deal to build different kinds of relationships among us. And then third  from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know  when all else is equal  given the option to have just money to do what you need to do  or money plus the support and encouragement of a global community  people choose the community plus the money. That's a much more meaningful combination  a more powerful combination. So with that in mind  this particular incident has led to the things that I'm working on now. I see entrepreneurs everywhere now  now that I'm tuned into this. And one thing that I've seen is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world. With social networks  it's an amazing way  growing the number of people that we all have around us in our own supportive communities  rapidly. And so  as I have been thinking about this  I've been wondering  how can we engage these supportive communities to catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas and to catalyze all of us to make tomorrow better than today  As I've researched what's going on in the United States  a few interesting little insights have come up. So one is that  of course  as we all might expect  many small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do or they might need money during a hard month. But there's always a need for resources close by. Another thing is  it turns out  those resources don't usually come from the places you might expect    banks  venture capitalists  other organizations and support structures    they come from friends and family. Some statistics say    percent or more of funding for small businesses comes from friends and family. That's around     billion dollars a year    it's a lot. And third  so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process  it's very awkward  people don't know exactly what to ask for  how to ask  what to promise in return  even though they have the best of intentions and want to thank those people that are supporting them. So to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way and to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves exactly what that financial exchange should look like  exactly what fits them and the people around them  this week actually  we're quietly doing a launch of Profounder  which is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need through investments from their friends and family. And it's investments  not donations  not loans  but investments that have a dynamic return. So the mapping of participating in the story  it actually flows with the up and down. So in short  it's a do it yourself tool for small businesses to raise these funds. And what you can do is go onto the site  create a profile  create investment terms in a really easy way. We make it really  really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site. And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues. They can raise up to a million dollars from an unlimited number of unaccredited  unsophisticated investors    everyday people  heaven forbid    and they can share those returns over time    again  whatever terms they set. As investors choose to become involved based on those terms  they can either take their rewards back as cash  or they can decide in advance to give those returns away to a non profit. So they can be a cash  or a cause  investor. It's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea a path to go do what they want to do in the world and to gather the people around them that they already have  the people that know them best and that love them and want to support them  to gather them to make this happen. So that's what I'm working on now. And to close  I just want to say  look these are tools. Right now  Profounder's right at the very beginning  and it's very palpable  it's very clear to me  that it's just a vessel  it's just a tool. What we need are for people to care  to actually go use it  just like they've cared enough to use Kiva to make those connections. But the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care    I'm not even going to try. I don't think  even though we often hear  you know  hear the ethical and moral reasons  the religious reasons   Here's why caring and giving will make you happier.  I don't think we need to be convinced of that. I think we know  in fact  I think we know so much  and it's such a reality that we care so deeply  that in fact  what usually stops us is that we're afraid to try and to mess up  because we care so very much about helping each other and being meaningful in each other's lives. So what I think I can do today  that best thing I can give you    I've given you my story  which is the best I can do. And I think I can remind us that we do care. I think we all already know that. And I think we know that love is resilient enough for us to get out there and try. Just a sec. Thanks. Thanks. For me  the best way to be inspired to try is to stop and to listen to someone else's story. And I'm grateful that I've gotten to do that here at TED. And I'm grateful that whenever I do that  guaranteed  I am inspired    I am inspired by the person I am listening to. And I believe more and more every time I listen in that that person's potential to do great things in the world and in my own potential to maybe help. And that    forget the tools  forget the moving around of resources    that stuff's easy. Believing in each other  really being sure when push comes to shove that each one of us can do amazing things in the world  that is what can make our stories into love stories and our collective story into one that continually perpetuates hope and good things for all of us. So that  this belief in each other  knowing that without a doubt and practicing that every day in whatever you do  that's what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today. Thank you. This technology made a very important impact on us. It changed the way our history developed. But it's a technology so pervasive  so invisible  that we  for a long time  forgot to take it into account when we talked about human evolution. But we see the results of this technology  still. So let's make a little test. So everyone of you turns to their neighbor please. Turn and face your neighbors. Please  also on the balcony. Smile. Smile. Open the mouths. Smile  friendly. Do you    Do you see any Canine teeth  Count Dracula teeth in the mouths of your neighbors  Of course not. Because our dental anatomy is actually made  not for tearing down raw meat from bones or chewing fibrous leaves for hours. It is made for a diet which is soft  mushy  which is reduced in fibers  which is very easily chewable and digestible. Sounds like fast food  doesn't it. It's for cooked food. We carry in our face the proof that cooking  food transformation  made us what we are. So I would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves. We talk about ourselves as omnivores. I would say  we should call ourselves coctivors    from coquere  to cook. We are the animals who eat cooked food. No  no  no  no. Better    to live of cooked food. So cooking is a very important technology. It's technology. I don't know how you feel  but I like to cook for entertainment. And you need some design to be successful. So  cooking is a very important technology  because it allowed us to acquire what brought you all here  the big brain  this wonderful cerebral cortex we have. Because brains are expensive. Those have to pay tuition fees know. But it's also  metabolically speaking  expensive. You now  our brain is two to three percent of the body mass  but actually it uses    percent of the total energy we use. It's very expensive. Where does the energy come from. Of course  from food. If we eat raw food  we cannot release really the energy. So this ingenuity of our ancestors  to invent this most marvelous technology. Invisible    everyone of us does it every day  so to speak. Cooking made it possible that mutations  natural selections  our environment  could develop us. So if we think about this unleashing human potential  which was possible by cooking and food  why do we talk so badly about food  Why is it always do and don'ts and it's good for you  it's not good for you  I think the good news for me would be if we could go back and talk about the unleashing  the continuation of the unleashing of human potential. Now  cooking allowed also that we became a migrant species. We walked out of Africa two times. We populated all the ecologies. If you can cook  nothing can happen to you  because whatever you find  you will try to transform it. It keeps also your brain working. Now the very easy and simple technology which was developed actually runs after this formula. Take something which looks like food  transform it  and it gives you a good  very easy  accessible energy. This technology affected two organs  the brain and the gut  which it actually affected. The brain could grow  but the gut actually shrunk. Okay  it's not obvious to be honest. But it shrunk to    percent of primate gut of my body mass. So because of having cooked food  it's easier to digest. Now having a large brain  as you know  is a big advantage  because you can actually influence your environment. You can influence your own technologies you have invented. You can continue to innovate and invent. Now the big brain did this also with cooking. But how did it actually run this show  How did it actually interfere  What kind of criteria did it use  And this is actually taste reward and energy. You know we have up to five tastes  three of them sustain us. Sweet    energy. Umami    this is a meaty taste. You need proteins for muscles  recovery. Salty  because you need salt  otherwise your electric body will not work. And two tastes which protect you    bitter and sour  which are against poisonous and rotten material. But of course  they are hard wired but we use them still in a sophisticated way. Think about bittersweet chocolate  or think about the acidity of yogurt    wonderful    mixed with strawberry fruits. So we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing because we know that  in cooking  we can transform it to the form. Reward  this is a more complex and especially integrative form of our brain with various different elements    the external states  our internal states  how do we feel  and so on are put together. And something which maybe you don't like but you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat. So satisfaction was a very important part. And as I say  energy was necessary. Now how did the gut actually participate in this development  And the gut is a silent voice    it's going more for feelings. I use the euphemism digestive comfort    actually    it's a digestive discomfort  which the gut is concerned with. If you get a stomach ache  if you get a little bit bloated  was not the right food  was not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other things went wrong. So my story is a tale of two brains  because it might surprise you  our gut has a full fledged brain. All the managers in the room say   You don't tell me something new  because we know  gut feeling. This is what we are using.  And actually you use it and it's actually useful. Because our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system  they do speak with each other and make decisions. But what it means to have a brain there is that  not only the big brain has to talk with the food  the food has to talk with the brain  because we have to learn actually how to talk to the brains. Now if there's a gut brain  we should also learn to talk with this brain. Now     years ago  anatomists described very  very carefully    here is a model of a wall of a gut. I took the three elements    stomach  small intestine and colon. And within this structure  you see these two pinkish layers  which are actually the muscle. And between this muscle  they found nervous tissues  a lot of nervous tissues  which penetrate actually the muscle    penetrate the submucosa  where you have all the elements for the immune system. The gut is actually the largest immune system  defending your body. It penetrates the mucosa. This is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest  which is actually the lumen. Now if you think about the gut  the gut is    if you could stretch it       meters long  the length of a tennis court. If we could unroll it  get out all the folds and so on  it would have     sq. meters of surface. And now this brain takes care over this  to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface and  of course  digest our food we cook. So if we give you a specification  this brain  which is autonomous  have     million nerve cells      million neurons    so around the size of a cat brain  so there sleeps a little cat    thinks for itself  optimizes whatever it digests. It has    different neuron types. It's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain  where you have     billion neurons. It has autonomous organized microcircuits  has these programs which run. It senses the food  it knows exactly what to do. It senses it by chemical means and very importantly by mechanical means  because it has to move the food    it has to mix all the various elements which we need for digestion. This control of muscle is very  very important  because  you know  there can be reflexes. If you don't like a food  especially if you're a child  you gag. It's this brain which makes this reflex. And then finally  it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery  which actually digests the food we cook. Now how do the two brains work with each other  I took here a model from robotics    it's called the Subsumption Architecture. What it means is that we have a layered control system. The lower layer  our gut brain  has its own goals    digestion defense    and we have the higher brain with the goal of integration and generating behaviors. Now both look    and this is the blue arrows    both look to the same food  which is in the lumen and in the area of your intestine. The big brain integrates signals  which come from the running programs of the lower brain  But subsumption means that the higher brain can interfere with the lower. It can replace  or it can inhibit actually  signals. So if we take two types of signals    a hunger signal for example. If you have an empty stomach  your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin. It's a very big signal  it's sent to the brain says   Go and eat.  You have stop signals    we have up to eight stop signals. At least in my case  they are not listened to. So what happens if the big brain in the integration overrides the signal  So if you override the hunger signal  you can have a disorder  which is called anorexia. Despite generating a healthy hunger signal  the big brain ignores it and activates different programs in the gut. The more usual case is overeating. It actually takes the signal and changes it  and we continue  even  though  our eight signals would say   Stop  enough. We have transferred enough energy.  Now the interesting thing is that  along this lower layer    this gut    the signal becomes stronger and stronger if undigested  but digestible  material could penetrate. This we found from bariatric surgery. That then the signal would be very  very high. So now back to the cooking question and back to the design. We have learned to talk to the big brain    taste and reward  as you know. Now what would be the language we have to talk to the gut brain that its signals are so strong that the big brain cannot ignore it  Then we would generate something all of us would like to have    a balance between the hunger and the satiation. Now I give you  from our research  a very short claim. This is fat digestion. You have on your left an olive oil droplet  and this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes. This is an in vitro experiment. It's very difficult to work in the intestine. Now everyone would expect that when the degradation of the oil happens  when the constituents are liberated  they disappear  they go away because they  were  absorbed. Actually  what happens is that a very intricate structure appears. And I hope you can see that there are some ring like structures in the middle image  which is water. This whole system generates a huge surface to allow more enzymes to attack the remaining oil. And finally  on your right side  you see a bubbly  cell like structure appearing  from which the body will absorb the fat. Now if we could take this language    and this is a language of structures    and make it longer lasting  that it can go through the passage of the intestine  it would generate stronger signals. So our research    and I think the research also at the universities    are now fixing on these points to say  how can we actually    and this might sound trivial now to you    how can we change cooking  How can we cook that we have this language developed  So what we have actually  it's not an omnivore's dilemma. We have a coctivor's opportunity  because we have learned over the last two million years which taste and reward    quite sophisticated to cook    to please ourselves  to satisfy ourselves. If we add the matrix  if we add the structure language  which we have to learn  when we learn it  then we can put it back  and around energy  we could generate a balance  which comes out from our really primordial operation  cooking. So  to make cooking really a very important element  I would say even philosophers have to change and have to finally recognize that cooking is what made us. So I would say  coquo ergo sum  I cook  therefore I am. Thank you very much. I'm a visual artist  and I'm also one of the co founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition. I've been working with plastic bags  which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork for the last    years. I turn them into two and three dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations. Upon working with the plastic  after about the first eight years  some of my work started to fissure and break down into smaller little bits of plastic. And I thought   Great. It's ephemeral just like us.  Upon educating myself a little further about plastics  I actually realized this was a bad thing. It's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits  because it's always still plastic. And what we're finding is that a lot of it is in the marine environment. I then  in the last few years  learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre. And my initial reaction    and I think this is a lot of people's first reaction to learning about it    is   Oh my God  We've got to go out there and clean this thing up.  So I actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decommissioned fishing trawlers  a crane  a chipping machine and a cold molding machine. And my intention was to go out to the gyre  raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic  chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in underdeveloped communities. I began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so  I realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world  and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture. And the bigger picture is  we need to find a way to turn off the faucet. We need to cut the spigot of single use and disposable plastics  which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale. So in looking at that  I also realized that I was really angry. I wasn't just concerned about plastic that you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean    of which I have learned there are now    gyres  potentially  of plastic in five major oceans in the world. It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about    it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket. I'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic. All of my beverages are packaged in plastic  even at the health food market. I'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator  and I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic into us and into our bodies. So I came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue  and we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition. We have many initiatives that we're working on  but some of them are very basic. One is  if    to    percent of what we're finding in the ocean    of the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean    is plastic  then why don't we call it what it is. It's plastic pollution. Recycling    everybody kind of ends their books about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling. You put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again. What is the reality of that  In the United States  less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled. And if you really look into it  particularly when it comes to plastic bottles  most of it is only down cycled  or incinerated  or shipped to China. It is down cycled and turned into lesser things  while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again or can be used again    a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again. So this is a big issue for us. Another thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about is we've added a fourth R onto the front of the  Reduce  Reuse  Recycle   three R's  and that is refuse. Whenever possible  refuse single use and disposable plastics. Alternatives exist  some of them are very old school. I myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers and using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers to store food in. And I know that I am doing a service to myself and my family. It's very easy to pick up a stainless steel bottle or a glass bottle  if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless steel bottle and fill that up with water or filtered water  versus purchasing plastic bottled water. I guess what I want to say to everybody here    and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue    is that this is a huge problem in the oceans  but this is a problem that we've created as consumers and we can solve. We can solve this by raising awareness of the issue and teaching people to choose alternatives. So whenever possible  to choose alternatives to single use plastics. We can cut the stem    tide the stem of this into our oceans and in doing so  save our oceans  save our planet  save ourselves. Thank you.  Applause  So yeah  I'm a newspaper cartoonist    political cartoonist. I don't know if you've heard about it    newspapers  It's a sort of paper based reader. It's lighter than an iPad  it's a bit cheaper. You know what they say  They say the print media is dying    who says that  Well  the media. But this is no news  right  You've read about it already. Ladies and gentlemen  the world has gotten smaller. I know it's a cliche  but look  look how small  how tiny it has gotten. And you know the reason why  of course. This is because of technology    yeah. Any computer designers in the room  Yeah well  you guys are making my life miserable because track pads used to be round  a nice round shape. That makes a good cartoon. But what are you going to do with a flat track pad  those square things  There's nothing I can do as a cartoonist. Well  I know the world is flat now. That's true. And the Internet has reached every corner of the world  the poorest  the remotest places. Every village in Africa now has a cyber cafe. Don't go asking for a Frappuccino there. So we are bridging the digital divide. The Third World is connected  we are connected. And what happens next  Well  you've got mail. Yeah. Well  the Internet has empowered us. It has empowered you  it has empowered me and it has empowered some other guys as well. You know  these last two cartoons    I did them live during a conference in Hanoi. And they were not used to that in communist  .  Vietnam. So I was cartooning live on a wide screen    it was quite a sensation    and then this guy came to me. He was taking pictures of me and of my sketches  and I thought   This is great  a Vietnamese fan.  And as he came the second day  I thought   Wow  that's really a cartoon lover.  And on the third day  I finally understood  the guy was actually on duty. So by now  there must be a hundred pictures of me smiling with my sketches in the files of the Vietnamese police. No  but it's true  the Internet has changed the world. It has rocked the music industry  it has changed the way we consume music. For those of you old enough to remember  we used to have to go to the store to steal it. And it has changed the way your future employer will look at your application. So be careful with that Facebook account    your momma told you  be careful. And technology has set us free    this is free WiFi. But yeah  it has liberated us from the office desk. This is your life  enjoy it. In short  technology  the internet  they have changed our lifestyle. Tech guru  like this man    that a German magazine called the philosopher of the   st century    they are shaping the way we do things. They are shaping the way we consume. They are shaping our very desires. You will not like it. And technology has even changed our relationship to God. Now I shouldn't get into this. Religion and political cartoons  as you may have heard  make a difficult couple  ever since that day of       when a bunch of cartoonists in Denmark drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world    demonstrations  fatwa  they provoked violence. People died in the violence. This was so sickening  people died because of cartoons. I mean    I had the feeling at the time that cartoons had been used by both sides  actually. They were used first by a Danish newspaper  which wanted to make a point on Islam. A Danish cartoonist told me he was one of the    who received the assignment to draw the prophet       of them refused. Did you know that  He told me   Nobody has to tell me what I should draw. This is not how it works.  And then  of course  they were used by extremists and politicians on the other side. They wanted to stir up controversy. You know the story. We know that cartoons can be used as weapons. History tells us  they've been used by the Nazis to attack the Jews. And here we are now. In the United Nations  half of the world is pushing to penalize the offense to religion    they call it the defamation of religion    while the other half of the world is fighting back in defense of freedom of speech. So the clash of civilizations is here  and cartoons are at the middle of it  This got me thinking. Now you see me thinking at my kitchen table  and since you're in my kitchen  please meet my wife. In       a few months after  I went Ivory Coast    Western Africa. Now  talk of a divided place    the country was cut in two. You had a rebellion in the North  the government in the South    the capital  Abidjan    and in the middle  the French army. This looks like a giant hamburger. You don't want to be the ham in the middle. I was there to report on that story in cartoons. I've been doing this for the last    years  it's my side job  if you want. So you see the style is different. This is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning. I went to places like Gaza during the war in     . So this is really journalism in cartoons. You'll hear more and more about it. This is the future of journalism  I think. And of course  I went to see the rebels in the north. Those were poor guys fighting for their rights. There was an ethnic side to this conflict as very often in Africa. And I went to see the Dozo. The Dozo  they are the traditional hunters of West Africa. People fear them    they help the rebellion a lot. They are believed to have magical powers. They can disappear and escape bullets. I went to see a Dozo chief  he told me about his magical powers. He said   I can chop your head off right away and bring you back to life.  I said   Well  maybe we don't have time for this right now.   Another time.  So back in Abidjan  I was given a chance to lead a workshop with local cartoonists there and I thought  yes  in a context like this  cartoons can really be used as weapons against the other side. I mean  the press in Ivory Coast was bitterly divided    it was compared to the media in Rwanda before the genocide    so imagine. And what can a cartoonist do  Sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists to draw what they wanted to see  and the guy has to feed his family  right  So the idea was pretty simple. We brought together cartoonists from all sides in Ivory Coast. We took them away from their newspaper for three days. And I asked them to do a project together  tackle the issues affecting their country in cartoons  yes  in cartoons. Show the positive power of cartoons. It's a great tool of communication for bad or for good. And cartoons can cross boundaries  as you have seen. And humor is a good way  I think  to address serious issues. And I'm very proud of what they did. I mean  they didn't agree with each other    that was not the point. And I didn't ask them to do nice cartoons. The first day  they were even shouting at each other. But they came up with a book  looking back at    years of political crisis in Ivory Coast. So the idea was there. And I've been doing projects like this  in      in Lebanon  this year in Kenya  back in January. In Lebanon  it was not a book. The idea was to have    the same principal  a divided country    take cartoonists from all sides and let them do something together. So in Lebanon  we enrolled the newspaper editors  and we got them to publish eight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page  addressing the issue affecting Lebanon  like religion in politics and everyday life. And it worked. For three days  almost all the newspapers of Beirut published all those cartoonists together    anti government  pro government  Christian  Muslim  of course  English speaking  well  you name it. So this was a great project. And then in Kenya  what we did was addressing the issue of ethnicity  which is a poison in a lot of places in Africa. And we did video clips    you can see them if you go to YouTube Kenyatoons. So  preaching for freedom of speech is easy here  but as you have seen in contexts of repression or division  again  what can a cartoonist do  He has to keep his job. Well I believe that in any context anywhere  he always has the choice at least not to do a cartoon that will feed hatred. And that's the message I try to convey to them. I think we all always have the choice in the end not to do the bad thing. But we need to support these  unclear   critical and responsible voices in Africa  in Lebanon  in your local newspaper  in the Apple store. Today  tech companies are the world's largest editors. They decide what is too offensive or too provocative for you to see. So really  it's not about the freedom of cartoonists  it's about your freedoms. And for dictators all over the world  the good news is when cartoonists  journalists and activists shut up. Thank you. The big residual is always value for money. All the time we are trying to get value for money. What we don't look for is value for many  while we are generating value for money. Do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day  the so called bottom of the pyramid  What are the challenges in getting value for money as well as value for many  We have described here in terms of the performance and the price. If you have money  of course  you can get the value. You can get a Mercedes for a very high price  very high performance. But if you don't have money  what happens  Well  you are to ride a bicycle  carrying your own weight and also some other weight  so that you can earn the bread for the day. Well  poor do not remain poor  they become lower middle class. And if they do so  then  of course  the conditions improve  and they start riding on scooters. But the challenge is  again  they don't get much value  because they can't afford anything more than the scooter. The issue is  at that price  can you give them some extra value  A super value  in terms of their ability to ride in a car  to get that dignity  to get that safety  looks practically impossible  isn't it. Now  this is something that we see on Indian streets all the time. But many people see the same thing and think things differently  and one of them is here  Ratan Tata. The great thing about our leaders is that  should they not only have passion in their belly  which practically all of them have  they're also very innovative. An innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done. They believe that things can be done. But great leaders like Ratan have compassion. And what you said  Lakshmi  is absolutely true  it's not just Ratan Tata  it's the house of Tatas over time. Let me confirm what she said. Yes  I went barefoot until I was   . I struggled to  unclear  day was a huge issue. And when I finished my SSC  the eleventh standard  I stood eleventh among         students. But I was about to leave the school  because my poor mother couldn't afford schooling. And it was  unclear  Tata Trust  which gave me six rupees per month  almost a dollar per month for six years. That's how I'm standing before you. So that is the House of Tata. Innovation  compassion and passion. They combine all that. And it was that compassion which bothered them  because when he saw    in fact  he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was driving his own car    he drives his own car by the way    and he saw in the rain  a family like the one that I showed to you getting drenched with an infant. And then he said   Well  I must give them a car that they can afford  one lakh car         car.  Of course  as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible  and that's what was said by Suzuki. He said  oh  probably he is going to build a three wheeler with stepney. And you can see the cartoon here. Well they didn't build that. They built a proper car. Nano. And mind you  I'm six feet half an inch  Ratan is taller than me  and we have ample space in the front and ample space in the back in this particular car. And incredible car. And of course  nothing succeeds like success  the cynics then turned around  and one after the other they also started saying   Yes  we also want to make a car in the Nano Segment. We'll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment.  How did this great story unfold  the making of Nano  Let me tell you a bit about it. For example  how we started  Ratan just began with a five engineer team  young people in their mid twenties. And he said   Well  I won't define the vehicle for you  but I will define the cost for you. It is one lakh          rupees  and you are to make it within that.  And he told them   Question the unquestionable. Stretch the envelope.  And at a point in time  he got so engrossed in the whole challenge  that he himself became a member of the team. Can you believe it  I still am told about this story of that single wiper design in which he participated. Until midnight  he'd be thinking. Early morning he'll be coming back with sort of solutions. But who was the team leader  The team leader was Girish Wagh  a    year old boy in  unclear . And the Nano team average age was just    years. And they did innovation in design and beyond. Broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time. For example  that a two cylinder gas engine was used in a car with a single balancer shaft. Adhesives were replacing the rivets. There was a co creation  a huge co creation  with vendors and suppliers. All ideas on board were welcome.     vendors were co located adjacent to the plant  and innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed. Imagine that a fellow who sells cloth  for example  will be selling Nano. I mean  it was incredible innovation. Seeking solutions for non auto sectors. It was an open innovation  ideas from all over were welcome. The mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used  by the way  as well as a dashboard that was inspired by two wheelers. The fuel lines and lamps were as in two wheelers. And the crux of the matter was  however  getting more from less. All the time  you have been given an envelope. You can't cross that envelope  which is         rupees        dollars. And therefore  each component had to have a dual functionality. And the seat riser  for example  serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity. Half the number of parts are contained in Nano in comparison to a typical passenger car. The length is smaller by eight percent by the way. But the current entry level cars in comparison to that is eight percent less  but    percent more inside space. And what happened was that    more from less    you can see how much more for how much less. When the Model T was launched    and this is  by the way  all the figures that are adjusted to      dollar prices    Model T was        by Ford. Volkswagon was       . And British Motor was around       . And Nano was  bang        dollars. This is why you started actually a new paradigm shift  where the same people who could not dream of sitting in a car  who were carrying their entire family in a scooter  started dreaming of being in a car. And those dreams are getting fulfilled. This is a photograph of a house and a driver and a car near my own home. The driver's name is Naran. He has bought his own Nano. And you can see  there is a physical space that has been created for him  parking that car  along with the owner's car  but more importantly  they've created a space in their mind that  Yes  my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it.  And that's why I call it a transformational innovation. It is not just technological  it is social innovation that we talk about. And that is where  ladies and gentlemen  this famous theme of getting more from less for more becomes important. I remember talking about this for the first time in Australia  about one and a half years ago  when their academy honored me with a fellowship. And unbelievably  in    years  I was the first Indian to be honored. And the title of my talk was therefore  Indian innovation from Gandhi to Gandhian engineering.  And I titled this more from less for more and more people as Gandhian engineering. And Gandhian engineering  in my judgment  is the one which is going to take the world forward  is going to make a difference  not just for a few  but for everyone. Let me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility for those unfortunates who have lost their legs. Here is an American citizen and his son having an artificial foot. What is its price         dollars. And of course  these feet are so designed that they can walk only on such perfect pavement or roads. Unfortunately  that's not the case in India. You can see him walk barefoot on an awkward land  sometimes in a marshy land  and so on and so forth. More importantly  they not only walk far to work  and not only do they cycle to work  but they cycle for work  as you can see here. And they climb up for their work. You have to design an artificial foot for such conditions. A challenge  of course. Four billion people  their incomes are less then two dollars a day. And if you talk about a        dollar shoe  you're talking about        days of income. You just don't have it. And therefore  you ought to look at alternatives. And that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India. It had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system  a quick molding and modular components  enabling custom made  on the spot limb fitments. You could feel it actually in an hour  by the way  whereas the equivalent other feet took something like a day  as so on. Outer socket made by using heated high density polyethylene pipes  rather than using heated sheets. And unique high ankle design and human like looks   unclear  and functions. And I like to show how it looks and how it works. See  he jumps. You can see what stress it must have. ... above the limb  yes  it would be difficult ...  Did it hurt    No ... not at all.  ... he can run a kilometer in four minutes and    seconds ...  One kilometer in four minutes and    seconds. So that's what it is all about. And therefore Time took notice of this    dollar foot  basically. An incredible story. Let's move on to something else. I've been talking about getting more from less for more. Let's move to health. We've talked about mobility and the rest of it  let's talk about health. What's happening in the area of health  You know  you have new diseases that require new drugs. And if you look at the drug development    years ago and now  what has happened     years ago  it used to cost about a quarter billion. Today it costs  .  billion dollars. Time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace  after all the human and animal testing  was    years  now it is    years. Are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money  No  I'm sorry. We used to have     now they have come down to   . So actually we are getting less from more for less and less people. Why less and less people  Because it is so expensive  so very few will be able to basically afford that. Let us just take an example. Psoriasis is very dreadful disease of the skin. The cost of treatment         dollars.       dollar antibody injections under the skin  by the way  and    of them. Time for development    it took around    years and     million dollars. Let's start in the spirit of more from less and more for more and start putting some targets. For example  we don't want        dollars  we don't have it. Can we do it  for      dollars  Time for development  not    years. We are in a hurry. Five years. Cost of development        million dollars. Sorry. I can't spend more than    million dollars. Looks absolutely audacious. Looks absolutely ridiculous. You know something  This has been achieved in India. These targets have been achieved in India. And how they have been achieved ... Sir Francis Bacon once said   When you wish to achieve results that have not been achieved before  it is an unwise fancy to think that they can be achieved by using methods that have been used before.  And therefore  the standard process  where you develop a molecule  put it into mice  into men  are not yielding those results    the billions of dollars that have been spent. The Indian cleverness was using its traditional knowledge  however  scientifically validating it and making that journey from men to mice to men  not molecule to mice to men  you know. And that is how this difference has come. And you can see this blending of traditional medicine  modern medicine  modern science. I launched a big program  unclear  CSIR about nine years ago. He is giving us not just for Psoriasis  for cancer and a whole range of things  changing the whole paradigm. And you can see this Indian Psoriasis breakthrough obtained by this reverse form of  unclear  by doing things differently. You can see before treatment and after treatment. This is really getting more from less for more and more people  because these are all affordable treatments now. Let me just remind you of what Mahatma Gandhi had said. He had said   Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's need  but not every man's greed.  So the message he was giving us was you must get more from less and less and less so that you can share it for more and more people  not only the current generation  but the future generations. And he also said   I would prize every invention of science made for the benefit for all.  So he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people  not just a few people. And therefore  ladies and gentlemen  this is the theme  getting more from less for more. And mind you  it is not getting just a little more for just a little less. It's not about low cost. It's about ultra low cost. You cannot say it's a mere treatment        dollars  but because you are poor I'll give it for      . Sorry  it doesn't work. You have to give it for     dollars      dollars. Is it possible  It has been made possible  by the way  for certain other different reasons. So you are not talking about low cost  you are talking about ultra low cost. You are not talking about affordability  you are talking about extreme affordability. Because of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day. You're not talking exclusive innovation. You're talking about inclusive innovation. And therefore  you're not talking about incremental innovation  you're talking about disruptive innovation. The ideas have to be such that you think in completely different terms. And I would also add  it is not only getting more from less for more by more and more people  the whole world working for it. I was very touched when I saw a breakthrough the other day. You know  incubators for infants  for example. They're not available in Africa. They're not available in Indian villages. And infants die. And incubator costs       dollars. And there's a    dollar incubator giving that performance that had been created. And by whom  By young students from Standford University on an extreme affordability project that they had  basically. Their heart is in the right place  like Ratan Tata. It's not just innovation  compassion and passion    compassion in the heart and passion in the belly. That's the new world that we want to create. And that is why the message is that of Gandhian engineering. Ladies and gentlemen  I'd like to end before time. I was also afraid of those    minutes. I've still one and a half to go. The message  the final message  is this  India gave a great gift to the world. What was that   In the    th century  we gave Gandhi to the world. The   st century gift  which is very  very important for the whole world  whether it is global economic meltdown  whether it is climate change    any problem that you talk about is gaining more from less for more and more    not only the current generations  for the future generations. And that can come only from Gandhian engineering. So ladies and gentlemen  I'm very happy to announce  this gift of the   st century to the world from India  Gandhian engineering. Lakshmi Pratury  Thank you  Dr. Mashelkar.  R.A. Mashelkar  Thank you very much.  LP  A quick question for you. Now  when you were a young boy in this school  what were your thoughts  like what did you think you could become  What do you think that drove you  Was there a vision you had  What is it that drove you  RAM  I'll tell you a story that drove me  that transformed my life. I remember  I went to a poor school  because my mother could not gather the    rupees  that half a dollar that was required within the stipulated time. It was  unclear  high school. But it was a poor school with rich teachers  honestly. And one of them was  unclear  who taught us physics. One day he took us out into the sun and tried to show us how to find the focal length of a convex lens. The lens was here. The piece of paper was there. He moved it up and down. And there was a bright spot up there. And then he said   This is the focal length.  But then he held it for a little while  Lakshmi. And then the paper burned. When the paper burned  for some reason he turned to me  and he said   Mashelkar  like this  if you do not diffuse your energies  if you focus your energies  you can achieve anything in the world.  That gave me a great message  focus and you can achieve. I said   Whoa  science is so wonderful  I have to become a scientist.  But more importantly  focus and you can achieve. And that message  very frankly  is valuable for society today. What does that focal length do  It has parallel lines  which are sun rays. And the property of parallel lines is that they never meet. What does that convex lens do  It makes them meet. This is convex lens leadership. You know what today's leadership is doing  Concave length. They divide them farther. So I learned the lesson of convex lens leadership from that. And when I was at National Chemical Laboratory  unclear . When I was at Council of Scientific Industry Research       laboratories    when two laboratories were not talking to each other  I would  unclear . And currently I'm president of Global Research Alliance         scientists in nine counties  right from India to the U.S. I'm trying to build a global team  which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing. That was the lesson. That was the inspirational moment. LP  Thank you very much.  RAM  Thank you.  I'm going to talk to you about power in this   st century. And basically  what I'd like to tell you is that power is changing  and there are two types of changes I want to discuss. One is power transition  which is change of power amongst states. And there the simple version of the message is it's moving from West to East. The other is power diffusion  the way power is moving from all states West or East to non state actors. Those two things are the huge shifts of power in our century. And I want to tell you about them each separately and then how they interact and why  in the end  there may be some good news. When we talk about power transition  we often talk about the rise of Asia. It really should be called the recovery or return of Asia. If we looked at the world in       you'd find that more than half of the world's people lived in Asia and they made more than half the world's product. Now fast forward to       half the world's people    more than half    still live in Asia  but they're now making only a fifth of the world's product. What happened  The Industrial Revolution  which meant that all of a sudden  Europe and America became the dominant center of the world. What we're going to see in the   st century is Asia gradually returning to being more than half of the world's population and more than half of the world's product. That's important and it's an important shift. But let me tell you a little bit about the other shift that I'm talking about  which is power diffusion. To understand power diffusion put this in your mind  computing and communications costs have fallen a thousandfold between      and the beginning of this century. Now that's a big abstract number. But to make it more real  if the price of an automobile had fallen as rapidly as the price of computing power  you could buy a car today for five dollars. Now when the price of any technology declines that dramatically  the barriers to entry go down. Anybody can play in the game. So in       if you wanted to communicate from Oxford to Johannesburg to New Delhi to Brasilia and anywhere simultaneously  you could do it. The technology was there. But to be able to do it  you had to be very rich    a government  a multinational corporation  maybe the Catholic Church    but you had to be pretty wealthy. Now  anybody has that capacity  which previously was restricted by price just to a few actors. If they have the price of entry into an Internet cafe    the last time I looked  it was something like a pound an hour    and if you have Skype  it's free. So capabilities that were once restricted are now available to everyone. And what that means is not that the age of the State is over. The State still matters. But the stage is crowded. The State's not alone. There are many  many actors. Some of that's good  Oxfam  a great non governmental actor. Some of it's bad  Al Qaeda  another non governmental actor. But think of what it does to how we think in traditional terms and concepts. We think in terms of war and interstate war. And you can think back to      when the government of Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor. It's worth noticing that a non state actor attacking the United States in      killed more Americans than the government of Japan did in     . You might think of that as the privatization of war. So we're seeing a great change in terms of diffusion of power. Now the problem is that we're not thinking about it in very innovative ways. So let me step back and ask  what's power  Power is simple the ability to affect others to get the outcomes you want  and you can do it in three ways. You can do it with threats of coercion   sticks   you can do it with payments   carrots   or you can do it by getting others to want what you want. And that ability to get others to want what you want  to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment  is what I call soft power. And that soft power has been much neglected and much misunderstood  and yet it's tremendously important. Indeed  if you can learn to use more soft power  you can save a lot on carrots and sticks. Traditionally  the way people thought about power was primarily in terms of military power. For example  the great Oxford historian who taught here at this university  A.J.P. Taylor  defined a great power as a country able to prevail in war. But we need a new narrative if we're to understand power in the   st century. It's not just prevailing at war  though war still persists. It's not whose army wins  it's also whose story wins. And we have to think much more in terms of narratives and whose narrative is going to be effective. Now let me go back to the question of power transition between states and what's happening there. the narratives that we use now tend to be the rise and fall of the great powers. And the current narrative is all about the rise of China and the decline of the United States. Indeed  with the      financial crisis  many people said this was the beginning of the end of American power. The tectonic plates of world politics were shifting. And president Medvedev of Russia  for example  pronounced in      this was the beginning of the end of United States power. But in fact  this metaphor of decline is often very misleading. If you look at history  in recent history  you'll see the cycles of belief in American decline come and go every    or    years or so. In       after the Soviets put up Sputnik  it was  That's the end of America.  In       with the oil embargo and the closing of the gold window  that was the end of America. In the     s  as America went through a transition in the Reagan period  between the rust belt economy of the midwest to the Silicon Valley economy of California  that was the end of America. But in fact  what we've seen is none of those were true. Indeed  people were over enthusiastic in the early     s  thinking America could do anything  which led us into some disastrous foreign policy adventures  and now we're back to decline again. The moral of this story is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline tell us a lot more about psychology than they do about reality. If we try to focus on the reality  then what we need to focus on is what's really happening in terms of China and the United States. Goldman Sachs has projected that China  the Chinese economy  will surpass that of the U.S. by     . So we've got  what     more years to go or so before China's bigger. Now someday  with a billion point three people getting richer  they are going to be bigger than the United States. But be very careful about these projections such as the Goldman Sachs projection as though that gives you an accurate picture of power transition in this century. Let me mention three reasons why it's too simple. First of all  it's a linear projection. You know  everything says  here's the growth rate of China  here's the growth rate of the U.S.  here it goes    straight line. History is not linear. There are often bumps along the road  accidents along the way. The second thing is that the Chinese economy passes the U.S. economy in  let's say        which it may it  that will be a measure of total economic size  but not of per capita income    won't tell you about the composition of the economy. China still has large areas of underdevelopment and per capita income is a better measure of the sophistication of the economy. And that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans until somewhere in the latter part  after       of this century. The other point that's worth noticing is how one dimensional this projection is. You know  it looks at economic power measured by GDP. Doesn't tell you much about military power  doesn't tell you very much about soft power. It's all very one dimensional. And also  when we think about the rise of Asia  or return of Asia as I called it a little bit earlier  it's worth remembering Asia's not one thing. If you're sitting in Japan  or in New Delhi  or in Hanoi  your view of the rise of China is a little different than if you're sitting in Beijing. Indeed  one of the advantages that the Americans will have in terms of power in Asia is all those countries want an American insurance policy against the rise of China. It's as though Mexico and Canada were hostile neighbors to the United States  which they're not. So these simple projections of the Goldman Sachs type are not telling us what we need to know about power transition. But you might ask  well so what in any case  Why does it matter  Who cares  Is this just a game that diplomats and academics play  The answer is it matters quite a lot. Because  if you believe in decline and you get the answers wrong on this  the facts  not the myths  you may have policies which are very dangerous. Let me give you an example from history. The Peloponnesian War was the great conflict in which the Greek city state system tore itself apart two and a half millennia ago. What caused it  Thucydides  the great historian of the the Peloponnesian War  said it was the rise in the power of Athens and the fear it created in Sparta. Notice both halves of that explanation. Many people argue that the   st century is going to repeat the   th century  in which World War One  the great conflagration in which the European state system tore itself apart and destroyed its centrality in the world  that that was caused by the rise in the power of Germany and the fear it created in Britain. So there are people who are telling us this is going to be reproduced today  that what we're going to see is the same thing now in this century. No  I think that's wrong. It's bad history. For one thing  Germany had surpassed Britain in industrial strength by     . And as I said earlier  China has not passed the United States. But also  if you have this belief and it creates a sense of fear  it leads to overreaction. And the greatest danger we have of managing this power transition of the shift toward the East is fear. To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt from a different context  the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself. We don't have to fear the rise of China or the return of Asia. And if we have policies in which we take it in that larger historical perspective  we're going to be able to manage this process. Let me say a word now about the distribution of power and how it relates to power diffusion and then pull these two types together. If you ask how is power distributed in the world today  it's distributed much like a three dimensional chess game. Top board  military power among states. The United States is the only superpower  and it's likely to remain that way for two or three decades. China's not going to replace the U.S. on this military board. Middle board of this three dimensional chess game  economic power among states. Power is multi polar. There are balancers    the U.S.  Europe  China  Japan can balance each other. The bottom board of this three dimensional  the board of transnational relations  things that cross borders outside the control of governments  things like climate change  drug trade  financial flows  pandemics  all these things that cross borders outside the control of governments  there nobody's in charge. It makes no sense to call this unipolar or multi polar. Power is chaotically distributed. And the only way you can solve these problems    and this is where many greatest challenges are coming in this century    is through cooperation  through working together  which means that soft power becomes more important  that ability to organize networks to deal with these kinds of problems and to be able to get cooperation. Another way of putting it is that as we think of power in the   st century  we want to get away from the idea that power's always zero sum    my gain is your loss and vice versa. Power can also be positive sum  where your gain can be my gain. If China develops greater energy security and greater capacity to deal with its problems of carbon emissions  that's good for us as well as good for China as well as good for everybody else. So empowering China to deal with its own problems of carbon is good for everybody  and it's not a zero sum  I win  you lose. It's one in which we can all gain. So as we think about power in this century  we want to get away from this view that it's all I win  you lose. Now I don't mean to be Pollyannaish about this. Wars persist. Power persists. Military power is important. Keeping balances is important. All this still persists. Hard power is there  and it will remain. But unless you learn how to mix hard power with soft power into strategies that I call smart power  you're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems that we're facing. So the key question that we need to think about as we look at this is how do we work together to produce global public goods  things from which all of us can benefit  How do we define our national interests so that it's not just zero sum  but positive sum. In that sense  if we define our interests  for example  for the United States the way Britain defined its interests in the   th century  keeping an open trading system  keeping a monetary stability  keeping freedom of the seas    those were good for Britain  they were good for others as well. And in the   st century  you have to do an analog to that. How do we produce global public goods  which are good for us  but good for everyone at the same time  And that's going to be the good news dimension of what we need to think about as we think of power in the   st century. There are ways to define our interests in which  while protecting ourselves with hard power  we can organize with others in networks to produce  not only public goods  but ways that will enhance our soft power. So if one looks at the statements that have been made about this  I am impressed that when Hillary Clinton described the foreign policy of the Obama administration  she said that the foreign policy of the Obama administration was going to be smart power  as she put it   using all the tools in our foreign policy tool box.  And if we're going to deal with these two great power shifts that I've described  the power shift represented by transition among states  the power shift represented by diffusion of power away from all states  we're going to have to develop a new narrative of power in which we combine hard and soft power into strategies of smart power. And that's the good news I have. We can do that. Thank you very much. Sustainability represents the what  the where and the how of what is caught. The who and the why are what's important to me. I want to know the people behind my dinner choices. I want to know how I impact them. I want to know how they impact me. I want to know why they fish. I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty for their living. Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem. It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we're also so fortunate to eat. So what do we call this  I think we call it restorative seafood. Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain  restorative is the ability to replenish and progress. Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource  suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency. It is a more hopeful  it is a more human  and is a more useful way of understanding our environment. Wallet guides    standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world    are very handy  they're a wonderful tool. Green  yellow and red lists  of  seafood species. The association is very easy  buy green  don't buy red  think twice about yellow. But in my mind  it's really not enough to just eat green list. We can't sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red. But what if we eat only in the green list  You've got pole caught yellowfin tuna here    comes from sustainable stocks. Pole caught    no bycatch. Great for fishermen. Lots of money. Supporting local economies. But it's a lion of the sea. It's a top predator. What's the context of this meal  Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a    ounce portion of this  Do I do this three times a week  I might still be in the green list  but I'm not doing myself  or you  or the oceans any favors. The point is that we have to have a context  a gauge for our actions in all this. Example  I've heard that red wine is great for my health    antioxidants and minerals    heart healthy. That's great  I love red wine  I'm going to drink so much of it. I'm going to be so healthy. Well  how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem  Well folks  we have a protein problem. We have lost this sensibility when it regards our food  and we are paying a cost. The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves. We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines. And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits. So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs. Restorative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws  or by Flipper  or the Gordon's fisherman  but rather  by the Jolly Green Giant. Vegetables  they might yet save the oceans. Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green. Well I'd like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue. We must continue to eat the best seafood possible  if at all. But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables. The best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half shell with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges. It comes in a five ounce portion of tilapia breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy  broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy  grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake. Whooo  This is an easy sell. And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart. Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat. Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat. There's a pattern here. Forget nuclear holocaust  it's the fork that we have to worry about. We have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we've sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one. So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong. And so I think it's time we change what we expect from our food. Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand. So let's start there. There's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems. Dan Barber and Alice Waters are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution. But green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters. Just because it comes from a green source doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate. We have eco friendly shrimp. We can make them  we have that technology. But we can never have any eco friendly all you can eat shrimp buffet. It doesn't work. Heart healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood. While we try to manage declining marine populations  the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood. Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers  grandfathers  mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood. That's a reward I am not willing to pass up. But it's not all about the seafood. It's about the way that we look at our plates. As a chef  I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate. A couple things happened. I made more money. People started buying appetizers and salads  because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone. People spent more time engaging in their meals  engaging with each other over their meals. People got  in short  more of what they came there for even though they got less protein. They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal. They got healthier. I made more money. This is great. Environmental consideration was served with every plate  but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time. One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served    small silverfish  anchovies  mackerel  sardines were uncommon. Shellfish  mussels  oysters  clams  tilapia  char    these were the common species. We were directing tastes towards more resilience  more restorative options. This is what we need to favor. This is what the green list says. But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment. But what of those big predators  those fashionable species  that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier  Well  if you must  I have a recipe for you. It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean  so here we go. Start with a    ounce portion of big fish. Get a knife. Cut it into four portions. Put it on four plates. Mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have  light the candles and celebrate it. Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this. Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year  maybe. I expect a lot from food. I expect health and joy and family and community. I expect that producing ingredients  preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests. I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook. And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents. I remember well the meals of my childhood. They were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch  usually rice. This is still how I largely eat today. I get sick when I go to steakhouses. I get the meat sweats. It's like a hangover from protein. It's disgusting. But of all the dire news that you'll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans  I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right. Eat your vegetables. It's pretty straightforward. So what are we looking for in a meal  Well for health  I'm looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body. For joy  I'm looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance. For family  I'm looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories. For community though  we start at the very beginning. There's no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact. So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it. We've seen an image of our blue planet  our world bank. But it is more than just a repository of our resources  it's also the global geography of the communion we call dinner. So if we all take only what we need  then we can begin to share the rest  we can begin to celebrate  we can begin to restore. We need to savor vegetables. We need to savor smaller portions of seafood. And we need to save dinner. Thank you. I'm a bug lover  myself    not from childhood  by the way  but rather late. When I bachelored  majoring in zoology in Tel Aviv University  I kind of fell in love with bugs. And then  within zoology  I took the course or the discipline of entomology  the science of insects. And then I thought  myself  how can I be practical or help in the science of entomology  And then I moved to the world of plant protection    plant protection from insects  from bad bugs. And then within plant protection  I came into the discipline of biological pest control which we actually define as the use of living organisms to reduce populations of noxious plant pests. So it's a whole discipline in plant protection that's aiming at the reduction of chemicals. And biological pest control  by the way  or these good bugs that we are talking about  they've existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years  for a long  long time. But only in the last     years people started  or people knew more and more how to exploit  or how to use  this biological control phenomenon  or in fact  natural control phenomenon  to their own needs. Because biological control phenomenon  you can see it in your backyard. Just take a magnifying glass. You see what I have here  That's a magnifier times   . Yeah  times   . Just open it. You just twist leaves  and you see a whole new world of minute insects  or little spiders of one millimeter  one and a half  two millimeters long  and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones. So this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere. Here  in front of this building  I'm sure. Just have a look at the plants. So it's everywhere  and we need to know how to exploit it. Well let us go hand by hand and browse through just a few examples. What is a pest  What damage  does  it actually inflict on the plant  And what is the natural enemy  the biologically controlled agent  or the good bug  that we are talking about  In general  I'm going to talk about insects and spiders  or mites  let us call them. Insects  those six legged organisms and spiders or mites  the eight legged organisms. Let's have a look at that. Here is a pest  devastating pest  a spider mite  because it does a lot of webbing like a spider. You see the mother in between and two daughters  probably on the left and right  and a single egg on the right hand side. And then you see what kind of damage it can inflict. On your right hand side you can see a cucumber leaf  and on the middle  cotton leaf  and on the left a tomato leaf with these little stipplings. They can literally turn from green to white because of the sucking  piercing mouthparts of those spiders. But here comes nature that provides us with a good spider. This is a predatory mite    just as small as a spider mite  by the way  one millimeter  two millimeters long  not more than that  running quickly  hunting  chasing the spider mites. And here you can see this lady in action on your left hand side    just pierces  sucks the body fluids on the left hand side of the pest mite. And after five minutes  this is what you see  just a typical dead corpse  shriveled  sucked out  dead corpse of the spider mite  and next to it  two satiated individuals of predatory mites  a mother on the left hand side  a young nymph on the right hand side. By the way  a meal for them for    hours is about five individuals of the spider mites  of the bad mites  or    to    eggs of the pest mites. By the way  they are hungry always. And there is another example  aphids. By the way  it's springtime now in Israel. When temperature rises sharply  you can see those bad ones  those aphids  all over the plants  in your hibiscus  in your lantana  in the young  fresh foliage of the spring flush  so called. By the way  with aphids you have only females  like Amazons. Females giving rise to females giving rise to other females. No males at all. Parthenogenesis   as it  was so called. And they are very happy with that  apparently. Here we can see the damage. Those aphids secrete some sticky  sugary liquid called honeydew  and this just globs the upper parts of the plant. Here you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of a black fungus  sooty mold  which is covering it. And here comes the salvation through this parasitic wasp. Here we are not talking about a predator. Here we are talking a parasite    not a two legged parasite  but an eight legged parasite  of course. This is a parasitic wasp  again  two millimeters long  slender  a very quick and sharp flier. And here you can see this parasite in action  like in an acrobatic maneuver. She stands vis a vis in front of the victim at the right hand side  bending its abdomen and inserting a single egg  a single egg into the body fluids of the aphid. By the way  the aphid tries to escape. She kicks and bites and secretes different liquids  but nothing will happen  in fact. Only the egg of the parasite will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid. And after a few days  depending upon temperature  the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside. This is all natural. This is all natural. This is not fiction  nothing at all. Again  in your backyard  in your backyard. But this is the end result. This is the end result  Mummies    M U M M Y. This is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside  in fact  a developing parasitoid that after a few minutes you see halfway out. The birth is almost complete. You can see  by the way  in different movies  etc.  it takes just a few minutes. And if this is a female  she'll immediately mate with a male and off she goes because time is very short. This female can live only three to four days  and she needs to give rise to around     eggs. That means she has     bad aphids to put her eggs into their body fluids. And this is of course not the end of it. There is a whole wealth of other natural enemies and this is just the last example. Again  we'll start first with the pest  the thrips. By the way  all these weird names    I didn't bother you with the Latin names of these creatures  okay  just the popular names. But this is a nice  slender  very bad pest. If you can see this  sweet peppers. This is not just an exotic  ornamental sweet pepper. This is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults. And here comes the natural enemy  minute pirate bug   minute  because it is rather small. Here you can see the adult  black  and two young ones. And again  in action. This adult pierces the thrips  sucking it within just several minutes  just going to the other prey  continuing all over the place. And if we spread those minute pirate bugs  the good ones  for example  in a sweet pepper plot  they go to the flowers. And look  this flower is flooded with predatory bugs  with the good ones after wiping out the bad ones  the thrips. So this is a very positive situation  by the way. No harm to the developing fruit. No harm to the fruit set. Everything is just fine under these circumstances. But again  the question is  here you saw them on a one to one basis    the pest  the natural enemy. What we do is actually this. In Northeast Israel  in Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu  there is a facility that mass produces those natural enemies. In other words  what we do there  we amplify  we amplify the natural control  or the biological control phenomenon. And in        square meters of state of the art greenhouses  there  we are mass producing those predatory mites  those minute pirate bugs  those parasitic wasps  etc.  etc. Many different parts. By the way  they have a very nice landscape    you see the Jordanian Mountains on the one hand and the Jordan Valley on the other hand  and a good  mild winter and a nice  hot summer  which is an excellent condition to mass produce those creatures. And by the way  mass production    it is not genetic manipulation. There are no GMOs    Genetically Modified Organisms    whatsoever. We take them from nature  and the only thing that we do  we give them the optimal conditions  under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms  in order to proliferate  multiply and reproduce. And that's what we get  in fact. You see under a microscope. You see in the upper left corner  you see a single predatory mite. And this is the whole bunch of predatory mites. You see this ampoule. You see this one. I have one gram of those predatory mites. One gram's        individuals         individuals are good enough to control one acre        square meters  of a strawberry plot against spider mites for the whole season of almost one year. And we can produce from this  believe you me  several dozens of kilograms on an annual basis. So this is what I call amplification of the phenomenon. And no  we do not disrupt the balance. On the contrary  because we bring it to every cultural plot where the balance was already disrupted by the chemicals. Here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals. That's the whole idea. And what is the impact  In this table  you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs. For example  in Israel  where we employ more than       hectares           dunams in Israeli terms    of biological pest controlling sweet pepper under protection     percent of the pesticides were actually reduced. And Israeli strawberries  even more       percent of the pesticides  especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries. So the impact is very strong. And there goes the question  especially if you ask growers  agriculturists  Why biological control  Why good bugs  By the way  the number of answers you get equals the number of people you ask. But if we go  for example  to this place  Southeast Israel  the Arava area above the Great Rift Valley  where the really top notch    the pearl of the Israeli agriculture is located  especially under greenhouse conditions  or under screenhouse conditions    if you drive all the way to Eilat  you see this just in the middle of the desert. And if you zoom in  you can definitely watch this  grandparents with their grandchildren  distributing the natural enemies  the good bugs  instead of wearing special clothes and gas masks and applying chemicals. So safety  with respect to the application  this is the number one answer that we get from growers  why biological control. Number two  many growers are in fact petrified from the idea of resistance  that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals  just in our case that bacteria becomes resistant to antibiotics. It's the same  and it can happen very quickly. Fortunately  in either biological control or even natural control  resistance is extremely rare. It hardly happens. Because this is evolution  this is the natural ratio  unlike resistance  which happens in the case of chemicals. And thirdly  public demand. Public demand    the more the public demands the reduction of chemicals  the more growers become aware of the fact they should  wherever they can and wherever possible  replace the chemical control with biological control. Even here  there is another grower  you see  very interested in the bugs  the bad ones and the good ones  wearing this magnifier already on her head  just walking safely in her crop. Finally  I want to get actually to my vision  or in fact  to my dream. Because  you see  this is the reality. Have a look at the gap. If we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide  it's     million dollars. And look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crops throughout the world. I think it's times     or something like that. Twenty five billion. So there is a huge gap to bridge. So actually  how can we do it  How can we bridge  or let's say  narrow  this gap in the course of the years  First of all  we need to find more robust  good and reliable biological solutions  more good bugs that we can either mass produce or actually conserve in the field. Secondly  to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agricultural fresh produce. And thirdly  also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry. And this gap really narrows. Step by step  it does narrow. So I think my last slide is  All we are saying  we can actually sing it  Give nature a chance. So I'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol petitioners and implementers  in Israel and abroad  really give nature a chance. Thank you.
