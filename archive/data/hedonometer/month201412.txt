I would like to start with the story of Mary  a woman from an African village. Her first memories are of her family fleeing violent riots orchestrated by  the ruling political party. Her brother was murdered by the state sponsored militia  and she was raped more than once just because she belonged to the wrong party. One morning  a month before the election  Mary's village was called  to another intimidation meeting. In this meeting  there is a man standing in front of them  telling them   We know who you are  we know who you will vote for  and if you're not going to drop the right paper  we're going to take revenge.  But for Mary  this meeting is different. She feels different. This time  she's waiting for this meeting  because this time  she's carrying a small hidden camera in her dress  a camera that nobody else can see. Nobody is allowed to film in these meetings. You risk your life if you do. Mary knows that  but she also knows that the only way to stop them and to protect herself and her community is to expose their intimidation  to make sure they understand somebody is following them  to break the impunity they feel. Mary and her friends were filming for months  undercover  the intimidation of the ruling political party. Man  We are now going to speak about the upcoming elections. Nothing can stop us  from doing what we want. If we hear you are with  The Opposition  we will not forgive you.   Militia intimidation rally    The Party  can torture you at any time. The youth can beat you.   Disruption of political meeting   For those who lie  saying they  are back with  The Party   your time is running out.   Party youth militia   Some have died because they rebelled. Some have lost their homes. If you don't work together  with  The Party   you will lead a very bad life. Oren Yakobovich  These images were broadcast all over the world  but more importantly  they have been broadcast back to the community. The perpetrators saw them too. They understood somebody is following them. They got scared. Impunity was broken. Mary and her friends forced the ruling political party not to use violence during the election  and saved hundreds of lives. Mary is just one of hundreds of people that my organization had helped  to document human rights violations using cameras. My background should have led me to a different direction. I was born in Israel to a right wing family  and as long as I remember myself  I wanted to join the Israeli army to serve my country and prove what I believed  was our right for the whole land. I joined the Israeli army  just after the first intifada  the first Palestinian uprising  and I served in one of the hard minded  toughest  aggressive infantry units  and I got the biggest gun in my platoon. Quite fast  I became an officer and got soldiers under my command  and as time passed  I started serving in the West Bank  and I saw these images. I didn't like what I saw. It took me a while  but eventually I refused to serve in the West Bank and had to spend time in jail. It was a bit   It was not that bad  I have to say. It was a bit like being in a hotel  but with very shitty food. In jail  I kept thinking  that I need people to know. I need people to understand what the reality in the West Bank looks like. I need them to hear what I heard  I need them to see what I saw  but I also understood  we need  the Palestinians themselves  the people that are suffering  to be able to tell their own stories  not journalists or filmmakers that are coming outside of the situation. I joined a human rights organization  an Israeli human rights  organization called B'Tselem. Together  we analyzed the West Bank and picked     families that are living in the most risky places  close to checkpoints  near army bases  side by side with settlers. We gave them cameras and training. Quite fast  we started getting very disturbing images about how the settlers  and the soldiers are abusing them. I would like to share with you two clips from this project. Both of them were broadcast in Israel  and it created a massive debate. And I have to warn you  some of you might  find them quite explicit. The masked men you  will see in the first clips are Jewish settlers. Minutes before the camera was turned on  they approached a Palestinian family that was working their land and told them that they have to leave the land  because this land belongs to the Jewish settlers. The Palestinians refused. Let's see what happened. The masked men that are approaching are Jewish settlers. They are approaching the Palestinian family. This is a demonstration in the West Bank. The guy in green is Palestinian. He will be arrested in a second. Here you see him blindfolded and handcuffed. In a few seconds  he regrets  he came to this demonstration. He's been shot in the foot with a rubber bullet. He is okay. Not all the settlers and the soldiers are acting this way. We're talking about a tiny minority  but they have to be brought to justice. These clips  and others like them  forced the army and the police to start investigations. They've been shown in Israel  of course  and the Israeli public was exposed to them also. This project redefined the struggle for human rights in the occupied territories  and we managed to reduce the number  of violent attacks in the West Bank. The success of this project got me thinking how I can take the same methodology to other places in the world. Now  we tend to believe that today  with all of the technology  the smartphones and the Internet  we are able to see and understand most of what's happening in the world  and people are able to tell their story   but it's only partly true. Still today  with all the technology we have  less than half of the world's population has access to the Internet  and more than three billion people   I'm repeating the number   three billion people are consuming news that is censored by those in power. More or less around the same time  I'm approached by a great guy named Uri Fruchtmann. He's a filmmaker and an activist. We understood we were thinking along the same lines  and we decided to establish Videre  our organization  together. While building the organization in London  we've been traveling undercover to places where a community  was suffering from abuses  where mass atrocities were happening  and there was a lack of reporting. We tried to understand how we can help. There were four things that I learned. The first thing is that we have to engage with communities that are living in rural areas  where violations are happening far from the public eye. We need to partner with them  and we need to understand which images are not making it out there and help them to document them. The second thing I learned is that we have to enable them  to film in a safe way. Security has to be the priority. Where I used to work before  in the West Bank  one can take a camera out  most likely not going to get shot  but in places we wanted to work  just try to pull a phone out  and you're dead   literally dead. This is why we decided to take the operation undercover when necessary  and use mostly hidden cameras. Unfortunately  I can't show you the hidden cameras we're using today   for obvious reasons   but these are cameras we used before. You can buy them off the shelf. Today  we're building  a custom made hidden camera  like the one that Mary was wearing in her dress to film the intimidation meeting of the ruling political party. It's a camera that nobody can see  that blends into the environment  into the surroundings. Now  filming securities go beyond using hidden cameras. Being secure starts way before the activist is turning the camera on. To keep our partners safe  we work to understand the risk of every location and of every shot before it's happened  building a backup plan if something goes wrong  and making sure  we have everything in place before our operations start. The third thing I learned is the importance of verification. You can have an amazing shot of atrocity  but if you can't verify it  it's worth nothing. Recently  like in the ongoing war  in Syria or the war in Gaza  we've seen images that are staged  or brought from a different conflict. This misinformation destroyed the credibility of the source  and it's harmed the credibility of other reliable and trustworthy sources. We use a variety of ways to make sure we can verify the information and we can trust the material. It starts with vetting the partners  understanding who they are  and working with them very intensively. How do you film a location  You film road signs  you film watches  you film newspapers. We are checking maps  looking at maps  double checking the information  and looking also at  the metadata of the material. Now  the fourth and the most important thing I learned is how you use images  to create a positive change. To have an effect  the key thing is how you use the material. Today  we're working with hundreds of activists filming undercover. We work with them both to understand  the situation on the ground and which images  are missing to describe it  who are the ones that are  influencing the situation  and when to release the material to advance the struggle. Sometimes  it's about putting it in the media  mostly local ones  to create awareness. Sometimes it's working with decision makers  to change laws. Sometimes  it's working with lawyers to use as evidence in court. But more than often  the most effective way to create a social change is to work within the community. I want to give you one example. Fatuma is part of a network of women that are fighting abuses in Kenya. Women in her community have been harassed constantly on their way to school and on their way to work. They are trying to change  the behavior of the community from inside. In the next clip  Fatuma is taking us with her on her journey to work. Her voice is superimposed on images that she filmed herself using hidden cameras. I'm    years old  a mother  And Ziwa La Ng'Ombe is my home. Each morning  I ride the mini bus Number   . But instead of a peaceful journey to work  each day begins with fear. Come with me now and use my eyes to feel what I feel. As I walk  I think to myself  Will I be touched  Grabbed  Violated by this conductor again  Even the men inside the way they look at me touch my body  rub against me  grab me  and now  as I sit in my seat I only wish my mind was full of thoughts for my day  my dreams  my children at school  but instead I worry about the moment when we will arrive and I will be violated again. OY  Today  there is a new front in the fight for human rights. I used to carry a big gun. Now  I am carrying this. This is a much more powerful and much  much more effective weapon. But we have to use its power wisely. By putting the right images in the right hands at the right time  we can truly create an impact. Thank you. Thank you. So in the oasis of  intelligentsia that is TED  I stand here before you this evening as an expert in dragging heavy stuff around cold places. I've been leading polar expeditions  for most of my adult life  and last month  my teammate  Tarka L'Herpiniere and I finished the most ambitious  expedition I've ever attempted. In fact  it feels like I've been transported straight here from four months in the middle of nowhere  mostly grunting and swearing   straight to the TED stage. So you can imagine that's a transition that hasn't been entirely seamless. One of the interesting side effects seems to be that my short term memory is entirely shot. So I've had to write some notes to avoid too much grunting and swearing in the next    minutes. This is the first talk I've given about this expedition  and while we weren't sequencing genomes or building space telescopes  this is a story about giving everything we had to achieve something that hadn't been done before. So I hope in that you might  find some food for thought. It was a journey  an  expedition in Antarctica  the coldest  windiest  driest and highest altitude continent on Earth. It's a fascinating place. It's a huge place. It's twice the size of Australia  a continent that is the same size as China and India put together. As an aside  I have experienced an interesting phenomenon in the last few days  something that I expect Chris Hadfield may get at TED in a few years' time  conversations that go something like this   Oh  Antarctica. Awesome. My husband and I did Antarctica with Lindblad for our anniversary.  Or   Oh cool  did you go there for the marathon   Our journey was  in fact     marathons back to back in     days  an       mile round trip on foot from the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back again. In the process  we broke the record for the longest human powered polar journey in history by more than     miles. For those of you from the Bay Area  it was the same as walking from  here to San Francisco  then turning around and walking back again. So as camping trips go  it was a long one  and one I've seen summarized  most succinctly here on the hallowed pages  of Business Insider Malaysia.   Two Explorers Just Completed A Polar Expedition  That Killed Everyone The Last Time It Was Attempted   Chris Hadfield talked so eloquently about fear and about the odds of success  and indeed the odds of survival. Of the nine people in history that had attempted this journey before us  none had made it to the pole and back  and five had died in the process. This is Captain Robert Falcon Scott. He led the last team to attempt this expedition. Scott and his rival Sir Ernest Shackleton  over the space of a decade  both led expeditions battling to become the first to reach the South Pole  to chart and map the interior of Antarctica  a place we knew less about  at the time  than the surface of the moon  because we could see the moon through telescopes. Antarctica was  for the most part  a century ago  uncharted. Some of you may know the story. Scott's last expedition  the  Terra Nova Expedition in       started as a giant siege style approach. He had a big team using ponies  using dogs  using petrol driven tractors  dropping multiple  pre positioned depots of food and fuel through which Scott's final team of five would travel to the Pole  where they would turn around and ski  back to the coast again on foot. Scott and his final team of five arrived at the South Pole  in January      to find they had been beaten to it by a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen  who rode on dogsled. Scott's team ended up on foot. And for more than a century this journey has remained unfinished. Scott's team of five died  on the return journey. And for the last decade  I've been asking myself why that is. How come this has remained  the high water mark  Scott's team covered       miles on foot. No one's come close to that ever since. So this is the high water mark  of human endurance  human endeavor   human athletic achievement in arguably the harshest climate on Earth. It was as if the marathon record has remained unbroken since     . And of course some strange and  predictable combination of curiosity  stubbornness  and probably hubris led me to thinking I might be the man to try to finish the job. Unlike Scott's expedition  there were just two of us  and we set off from the coast of Antarctica in October last year  dragging everything ourselves  a process Scott called  man hauling.  When I say it was like walking from here to San Francisco and back  I actually mean it was like dragging something that weighs a shade more than the heaviest ever NFL player. Our sledges weighed     kilos  or     pounds each at the start  the same weights that the weakest of Scott's ponies pulled. Early on  we averaged  .  miles per hour. Perhaps the reason no one had  attempted this journey until now  in more than a century  was that no one had been quite stupid enough to try. And while I can't claim we were exploring in the genuine Edwardian sense of the word   we weren't naming any mountains or mapping any uncharted valleys   I think we were stepping into uncharted territory in a human sense. Certainly  if in the future we learn there is an area of the human brain that lights up when one curses oneself  I won't be at all surprised. You've heard that the average American spends    percent of their time indoors. We didn't go indoors for nearly four months. We didn't see a sunset either. It was    hour daylight. Living conditions were quite spartan. I changed my underwear  three times in     days and Tarka and I shared     square feet on the canvas. Though we did have some technology that Scott could never have imagined. And we blogged live every evening from the tent via a laptop and a custom made satellite transmitter  all of which were solar powered  we had a flexible photovoltaic panel over the tent. And the writing was important to me. As a kid  I was inspired by the  literature of adventure and exploration  and I think we've all seen here this week the importance and  the power of storytelling. So we had some   st century gear  but the reality is that the  challenges that Scott faced were the same that we faced  those of the weather and of  what Scott called glide  the amount of friction between the sledges and the snow. The lowest wind chill  we experienced was in the    s  and we had zero visibility  what's called white out  for much of our journey. We traveled up and down one of the largest and most dangerous glaciers in the world  the Beardmore glacier. It's     miles long  most of its surface is what's called blue ice. You can see it's a beautiful   shimmering steel hard blue surface covered with thousands  and thousands of crevasses  these deep cracks in the glacial ice  up to     feet deep. Planes can't land here  so we were at the most risk  technically  when we had the slimmest chance of being rescued. We got to the South Pole after    days on foot  with one day off for bad weather  and I'm sad to say  it was something of an anticlimax. There's a permanent American base  the Amundsen Scott South Pole Station at the South Pole. They have an airstrip  they have a canteen  they have hot showers  they have a post office  a tourist shop  a basketball court that doubles as a movie theater. So it's a bit different these days  and there are also acres of junk. I think it's a marvelous thing that humans can exist     days of the year with hamburgers and hot showers and movie theaters  but it does seem to produce a lot of empty cardboard boxes. You can see on the left of  this photograph  several square acres of junk waiting to be flown out from the South Pole. But there is also a pole at the South Pole  and we got there on foot  unassisted  unsupported  by the hardest route      miles in record time  dragging more weight than anyone in history. And if we'd stopped there  and flown home  which would have been the eminently sensible thing to do  then my talk would end here and it would end something like this. If you have the right team around you  the right tools  the right technology  and if you have enough self belief and enough determination  then anything is possible. But then we turned around  and this is where things get interesting. High on the Antarctic plateau  over        feet  it's very windy  very cold  very dry  we were exhausted. We'd covered    marathons  we were only halfway  and we had a safety net  of course  of ski planes and satellite phones and live     hour tracking beacons that didn't exist for Scott  but in hindsight  rather than making our lives easier  the safety net actually allowed us to cut things very fine indeed  to sail very close to our absolute limits as human beings. And it is an exquisite form of torture to exhaust yourself to the point of starvation day after day while dragging a sledge full of food. For years  I'd been writing glib lines in sponsorship proposals about pushing the limits of human endurance  but in reality  that was  a very frightening place to be indeed. We had  before we'd got to the Pole  two weeks of almost permanent headwind  which slowed us down. As a result  we'd had several days of eating half rations. We had a finite amount of food in the sledges to make this journey  so we were trying to string that out by reducing our intake to half  the calories we should have been eating. As a result  we both became increasingly hypoglycemic   we had low blood sugar  levels day after day   and increasingly susceptible to the extreme cold. Tarka took this photo of me one evening after I'd nearly passed out with hypothermia. We both had repeated bouts of hypothermia  something I hadn't experienced before  and it was very humbling indeed. As much as you might like to think  as I do  that you're the kind of person who doesn't quit  that you'll go down swinging  hypothermia doesn't leave you much choice. You become utterly incapacitated. It's like being a drunk toddler. You become pathetic. I remember just wanting to lie down and quit. It was a peculiar  peculiar feeling  and a real surprise to me to be debilitated to that degree. And then we ran out of food completely     miles short of the first of the depots that we'd laid on our outward journey. We'd laid    depots of food  literally burying food and fuel  for our return journey   the fuel was for a cooker so you could melt snow to get water   and I was forced to make the decision to call for a resupply flight  a ski plane carrying eight days of food to tide us over that gap. They took    hours to reach us from the other side of Antarctica. Calling for that plane was one of  the toughest decisions of my life. And I sound like a bit of a fraud standing here now with a sort of belly. I've put on    pounds in the last three weeks. Being that hungry has left an interesting mental scar  which is that I've been hoovering up every hotel buffet that I can find. But we were genuinely quite hungry  and in quite a bad way. I don't regret calling for that plane for a second  because I'm still standing here alive  with all digits intact   telling this story. But getting external assistance like that was never part of the plan  and it's something my ego is still struggling with. This was the biggest dream I've ever had  and it was so nearly perfect. On the way back down to the coast  our crampons   they're  the spikes on our boots that we have for traveling over this blue ice on the glacier   broke on the top of the Beardmore. We still had     miles to go downhill on very slippery rock hard blue ice. They needed repairing almost every hour. To give you an idea of scale  this is looking down towards the mouth of the Beardmore Glacier. You could fit the entirety of Manhattan in the gap on the horizon. That's    miles between Mount Hope and Mount Kiffin. I've never felt as small  as I did in Antarctica. When we got down to the mouth of the glacier  we found fresh snow had obscured the dozens of deep crevasses. One of Shackleton's men described crossing this sort of terrain as like walking over the glass roof of a railway station. We fell through more times than I can remember  usually just putting a ski or a boot through the snow. Occasionally we went in all  the way up to our armpits  but thankfully never deeper than that. And less than five weeks ago  after     days  we crossed this oddly  inauspicious finish line  the coast of Ross Island  on the New Zealand side of Antarctica. You can see the ice in the foreground and the sort of rubbly rock behind that. Behind us lay an unbroken  ski trail of nearly       miles. We'd made the longest ever polar journey on foot  something I'd been dreaming  of doing for a decade. And looking back  I still stand by all the things I've been saying for years about the importance of goals and determination and self belief  but I'll also admit that I hadn't given much thought to what happens when you reach the all consuming goal that you've dedicated  most of your adult life to  and the reality is that I'm  still figuring that bit out. As I said  there are very few superficial signs that I've been away. I've put on    pounds. I've got some very faint  probably  covered in makeup now  frostbite scars. I've got one on my nose  one on  each cheek  from where the goggles are  but inside I am a very  different person indeed. If I'm honest  Antarctica challenged me and humbled me so deeply that I'm not sure I'll ever be able to put it into words. I'm still struggling to piece together my thoughts. That I'm standing here  telling this story is proof that we all can  accomplish great things  through ambition  through passion  through sheer stubbornness  by refusing to quit  that if you dream something  hard enough  as Sting said  it does indeed come to pass. But I'm also standing here  saying  you know what  that cliche about the journey being  more important than the destination  There's something in that. The closer I got to my finish line  that rubbly  rocky coast of Ross Island  the more I started to realize that the biggest lesson that this very long  very hard walk might be teaching me is that happiness is not a finish line  that for us humans  the perfection that so many of us seem to dream of might not ever be truly attainable  and that if we can't feel content here  today  now  on our journeys amidst the mess and the striving that we all inhabit  the open loops   the half finished to do lists  the could do better next times  then we might never feel it. A lot of people have asked me  what next  Right now  I am very happy just recovering and in front of hotel buffets. But as Bob Hope put it  I feel very humble  but I think I have the strength of character to fight it.  Laughter  Thank you.      is a very special year for me     years as a consultant     years of marriage  and I'm turning    in one month. That means I was born in      in a small town in Germany. It was a gray November day  and I was overdue. The hospital's maternity ward was really stressed out because a lot of babies were born on this gray November day. As a matter of fact       was the year with the highest birth rate ever in Germany  more than  .  million. Last year  we just hit over          so half of my number. What you can see here is the German age pyramid  and there  the small black point at the top  that's me. In red  you can see the potential working age population  so people over    and under     and I'm actually only interested in this red area. Now  let's do a simple simulation of how this age structure will develop over the next couple of years. As you can see  the peak is moving to the right  and I  with many other baby boomers  will retire in     . By the way  I don't need any forecasts of birth rates for predicting this red area. The red area  so the potential working age population in       is already set in stone today  except for much higher migration rates. And if you compare this red area in      with the red area in       it is much  much smaller. So before I show you the rest of the world  what does this mean for Germany  So what we know from this picture is that the labor supply  so people who provide labor  will go down in Germany  and will go down significantly. Now  what about labor demand  That's where it gets tricky. As you might know  the consultant's favorite answer to any question is   It depends.  So I would say it depends. We didn't want to forecast the future. Highly speculative. We did something else. We looked at the GDP and productivity growth of Germany over the last    years  and calculated the following scenario  if Germany wants to continue this GDP and productivity growth  we could directly calculate how many people Germany would need to support this growth. And this is the green line  labor demand. So Germany will run into a major talent shortage very quickly. Eight million people are missing  which is more than    percent of our current workforce  so big numbers  really big numbers. And we calculated several scenarios  and the picture always looked like this. Now  to close the gap  Germany has to significantly increase migration  get many more women in the workforce  increase retirement age   by the way  we just lowered it this year   and all these measures at once. If Germany fails here  Germany will stagnate. We won't grow anymore. Why  Because the workers are not there who can generate this growth. And companies will look for talents somewhere else. But where  Now  we simulated labor supply and labor demand for the largest    economies in the world  representing more than    percent of world GDP  and the overall picture looks like this by     . Blue indicates a labor surplus  red indicates a labor shortfall  and gray are those countries which are borderline. So by       we still see a labor surplus in some countries  like Italy  France  the U.S.  but this picture will change dramatically by     . By       we will face a global workforce crisis in most of our largest economies  including three out of the four BRIC countries. China  with its former one child policy  will be hit  as well as Brazil and Russia. Now  to tell the truth  in reality  the situation will be even more challenging. What you can see here are average numbers. We de averaged them and broke them down into different skill levels  and what we found were even higher shortfalls for high skilled people and a partial surplus for low skilled workers. So on top of an overall labor shortage  we will face a big skill mismatch in the future  and this means huge challenges in terms of education  qualification  upskilling for governments and companies. Now  the next thing we looked into was robots  automation  technology. Will technology change this picture and boost productivity  Now  the short answer would be that our numbers already include a significant growth in productivity driven by technology. A long answer would go like this. Let's take Germany again. The Germans have a certain reputation in the world when it comes to productivity. In the '  s  I worked in our Boston office for almost two years  and when I left  an old senior partner told me  literally   Send me more of these Germans  they work like machines.  That was     . Sixteen years later  you'd probably say the opposite.  Send me more of these machines. They work like Germans.  Technology will replace a lot of jobs  regular jobs. Not only in the production industry  but even office workers are in jeopardy and might be replaced by robots  artificial intelligence  big data  or automation. So the key question is not if technology replaces some of these jobs  but when  how fast  and to what extent  Or in other words  will technology help us to solve this global workforce crisis  Yes and no. This is a more sophisticated version of  it depends.  Let's take the automotive industry as an example  because there  more than    percent of industrial robots are already working and automation has already taken place. In       less than    percent of the production cost of a car was caused by electronic parts. Today  this number is more than    percent and it will grow to more than    percent by     . And these new electronic parts and applications require new skills and have created a lot of new jobs  like the cognitive systems engineer who optimizes the interaction between driver and electronic system. In       no one had the slightest clue that such a job would ever exist. As a matter of fact  the overall number of people involved in the production of a car has only changed slightly in the last decades  in spite of robots and automation. So what does this mean  Yes  technology will replace a lot of jobs  but we will also see a lot of new jobs and new skills on the horizon  and that means technology will worsen our overall skill mismatch. And this kind of de averaging reveals the crucial challenge for governments and businesses. So people  high skilled people  talents  will be the big thing in the next decade. If they are the scarce resource  we have to understand them much better. Are they actually willing to work abroad  What are their job preferences  To find out  this year we conducted a global survey among more than         job seekers from     countries. Migration is certainly one key measure to close a gap  at least in the short term  so we asked about mobility. More than    percent of these         job seekers are willing to work abroad. For me  a surprisingly high number. If you look at the employees aged    to     this number is even higher. If you split this number up by country  yes  the world is mobile  but only partly. The least mobile countries are Russia  Germany and the U.S. Now where would these people like to move  Number seven is Australia  where    percent could imagine moving. Then France  Switzerland  Germany  Canada  U.K.  and the top choice worldwide is the U.S. Now  what are the job preferences of these         people  So  what are they looking for  Out of a list of    topics  salary is only number eight. The top four topics are all around culture. Number four  having a great relationship with the boss  three  enjoying a great work life balance  two  having a great relationship with colleagues  and the top priority worldwide is being appreciated for your work. So  do I get a thank you  Not only once a year with the annual bonus payment  but every day. And now  our global workforce crisis becomes very personal. People are looking for recognition. Aren't we all looking for recognition in our jobs  Now  let me connect the dots. We will face a global workforce crisis which consists of an overall labor shortage plus a huge skill mismatch  plus a big cultural challenge. And this global workforce crisis is approaching very fast. Right now  we are just at the turning point. So what can we  what can governments  what can companies do  Every company  but also every country  needs a people strategy  and to act on it immediately  and such a people strategy consists of four parts. Number one  a plan for how to forecast supply and demand for different jobs and different skills. Workforce planning will become  more important than financial planning. Two  a plan for how to attract great people  generation Y  women  but also retirees. Three  a plan for how to educate and upskill them. There's a huge upskilling challenge ahead of us. And four  for how to retain the best people  or in other words  how to realize an appreciation and relationship culture. However  one crucial underlying factor is to change our attitudes. Employees are resources  are assets  not costs  not head counts  not machines  not even the Germans. Thank you. Ten years ago  I got a phone call that changed my life. At the time  I was  cardiologist at UCLA  specializing in cardiac  imaging techniques. The call came from a veterinarian at the Los Angeles Zoo. An elderly female chimpanzee had woken up with a facial droop and the veterinarians were worried that she'd had a stroke. They asked if I'd  come to the zoo and image the animal's heart to look for a possible cardiac cause. Now  to be clear  North American zoos are staffed by highly qualified   board certified veterinarians who take outstanding  care of their animal patients. But occasionally  they do reach into  the human medical community  particularly for some  speciality consultation  and I was one of the lucky physicians who was invited in to help. I had a chance to rule out a stroke in this chimpanzee and make sure that this gorilla  didn't have a torn aorta  evaluate this macaw for a heart murmur  make sure that this California sea lion's paricardium wasn't inflamed  and in this picture  I'm listening to the heart of a lion after a lifesaving   collaborative procedure with veterinarians and physicians where we drained     cc's of  fluid from the sac in which this lion's  heart was contained. And this procedure  which I have done on many human patients  was identical  with the exception of that paw and that tail. Now most of the time  I was working at UCLA Medical Center with physicians  discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for my human patients  but some of the time  I was working at the Los Angeles Zoo with veterinarians  discussing  symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for their animal patients. And occasionally  on  the very same day  I went on rounds at  UCLA Medical Center and at the Los Angeles Zoo. And here's what started coming into very clear focus for me. Physicians and veterinarians were essentially taking care of the same disorders in their  animal and human patients  congestive heart failure  brain tumors  leukemia  diabetes   arthritis  ALS  breast cancer  even psychiatric syndromes like depression  anxiety  compulsions  eating disorders and self injury. Now  I've got a confession to make. Even though I studied comparative physiology and evolutionary biology as an undergrad    I had even written my senior  thesis on Darwinian theory    learning about the  significant overlap between the disorders of  animals and humans  it came as a much needed  wake up call for me. So I started wondering  with all of these overlaps  how was it that I had never thought to ask a veterinarian  or consult the veterinary literature  for insights into one  of my human patients  Why had I never  nor had any of my  physician friends and colleagues whom I asked  ever attended  a veterinary conference  For that matter  why was  any of this a surprise  I mean  look  every single physician accepts some biological connection between animals and humans. Every medication that we prescribe or that we've taken ourselves or we've given to our families has first been tested on an animal. But there's something very different about giving an animal a  medication or a human disease and the animal developing  congestive heart failure or diabetes or breast cancer  on their own. Now  maybe some of the surprise comes from the increasing separation in our world between the urban and the nonurban. You know  we hear about these city kids who think that wool grows on trees or that cheese comes from a plant. Well  today's human hospitals  increasingly  are turning into these gleaming cathedrals of technology. And this creates a psychological distance between the human patients who are being treated there and animal patients who are living in oceans and farms and jungles. But I think there's an  even deeper reason. Physicians and scientists  we accept intellectually that our species  Homo sapiens  is merely  one species  no more unique or special than any other. But in our hearts  we don't  completely believe that. I feel it myself when I'm  listening to Mozart or looking at pictures of the  Mars Rover on my MacBook. I feel that tug of  human exceptionalism  even as I recognize the  scientifically isolating cost of seeing ourselves as a superior species  apart. Well  I'm trying these days. When I see a human patient now  I always ask  what do the animal doctors know about this problem that I don't know  And  might I be taking better  care of my human patient if I saw them as a human animal patient  Here are a few examples of the  kind of exciting connections that this kind of  thinking has led me to. Fear induced heart failure. Around the year       human cardiologists  discovered  emotionally induced heart failure. It was described in a gambling father  who had lost his life's savings with a roll of the dice  in a bride who'd been left at the alter. But it turns out  this   new  human diagnosis was neither new  nor was it uniquely human. Veterinarians had been diagnosing   treating and even preventing emotionally induced symptoms in animals ranging from monkeys to flamingos  from to deer to rabbits  since the     s. How many human lives  might have been saved if this veterinary knowledge had been put into the hands of E.R. docs and cardiologists  Self injury. Some human patients  harm themselves. Some pluck out patches of hair  others actually cut themselves. Some animal patients  also harm themselves. There are birds that  pluck out feathers. There are stallions that repetitively bite their flanks until they bleed. But veterinarians have very specific and very effective ways of treating and even preventing self injury in their self injuring animals. Shouldn't this veterinary knowledge be put into the hands of psychotherapists and  parents and patients struggling with self injury  Postpartum depression and  postpartum psychosis. Sometimes  soon after giving birth  some women become depressed  and sometimes they become seriously  depressed and even psychotic. They may neglect their newborn  and in some extreme cases  even harm the child. Equine veterinarians also know that occasionally  a mare  soon after giving birth  will neglect the foal  refusing to nurse  and in some instances  kick the foal  even to death. But veterinarians have devised an intervention to deal with this foal rejection syndrome that involves increasing  oxytocin in the mare. Oxytocin is the bonding hormone  and this leads to renewed interest  on the part of the mare  in her foal. Shouldn't this information be put into the hands of ob gyn's and family doctors and patients who are struggling with postpartum depression and psychosis  Well  despite all of this promise  unfortunately the gulf between our fields remains large. To explain it  I'm afraid I'm going  to have to air some dirty laundry. Some physicians can be real snobs about doctors who are not M.D.'s. I'm talking about dentists and  optometrists and psychologists  but maybe especially animal doctors. Of course  most physicians don't realize that it is harder to get into vet school these days than medical school  and that when we go  to medical school  we learn everything  there is to know about one species  Homo sapiens  but veterinarians need to learn about health and disease in mammals  amphibians  reptiles  fish and birds. So I don't blame the vets for feeling annoyed by my profession's condescension and ignorance. But here's one from the vets  What do you call a veterinarian who can only take  care of one species  A physician.  Laughter  Closing the gap has become  a passion for me  and I'm doing this  through programs like Darwin on Rounds at UCLA  where we're bringing animal experts  and evolutionary biologists and embedding them on our medical teams with our interns and our residents. And through Zoobiquity conferences  where we bring medical schools  together with veterinary schools for collabortive discussions of the shared diseases and disorders of animal and human patients. At Zoobiquity conferences  participants learn how treating breast cancer in a tiger can help us better treat breast cancer in a kindergarten teacher  how understanding polycystic overies in a Holstein cow can help us better take care of a dance instructor  with painful periods  and how better understanding the  treatment of separation anxiety in a high strung Sheltie can help an anxious young child struggling with his first days of school. In the United States and now  internationally  at Zoobiquity conferences physicians and veterinarians check  their attitudes and their preconceptions at the door and come  together as colleagues  as peers  as doctors. After all  we humans  are animals  too  and it's time for us physicians to embrace our patients' and our own animal natures and join veterinarians in a species spanning approach to health. Because it turns out  some of the best and  most humanistic medicine is being practiced by doctors whose patients aren't human. And one of the best ways  we can take care of the human patient is by  paying close attention to how all the other  patients on the planet live  grow  get sick and heal. Thank you. So  I thought a lot about the first word I'd say today  and I decided to say  Colombia.  And the reason  I don't know how many of you have visited Colombia  but Colombia is just north of the border with Brazil. It's a beautiful country with extraordinary people  like me and others     Laughter     and it's populated with incredible fauna  flora. It's got water  it's got everything to be the perfect place. But we have a few problems. You may have heard of some of them. We have the oldest standing guerrilla in the world. It's been around for over    years  which means that in my lifetime  I have never lived one day  of peace in my country. This guerrilla    and the main group is the FARC guerrillas  Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia    they have financed their war by kidnapping  by extortion  by getting into the drug trade  by illegal mining. There has been terrorism. There have been random bombs. So it's not good. It's not really good. And if you look at the human cost of this war over    years  we have had more than  .  million displaced population. It's one of the biggest displaced populations in the world  and this conflict has cost over         lives. So it's a little bit like the Bol var wars again. It's a lot of people who have died unnecessarily. We are now in the middle of peace talks  and we've been trying to help resolve this problem peacefully  and as part of that  we decided to try something completely lateral and different  Christmas lights. So Christmas lights  and you're saying  what the hell is this guy going to talk about  I am going to talk about gigantic trees that we put in nine strategic  pathways in the jungle covered with Christmas lights. These trees helped us  demobilize     guerrillas  roughly five percent of the guerrilla force at the time. These trees were lit up at night  and they had a sign beside them that said   If Christmas can come to the jungle  you can come home. Demobilize. At Christmas  everything is possible.  So how do we know these trees worked  Well  we got      which is okay  but we also know that not a lot of guerrillas saw them  but we know that a lot of guerrillas heard about them  and we know this because we are constantly talking to demobilized guerrillas. So let me take you back four years before the trees. Four years before the trees  we were approached by the government to help them come up with a communications strategy to get as many guerrillas as we could out of the jungle. The government had a military strategy  it had a legal strategy  it had a political strategy  but it said   We don't really have a communications strategy  and it probably would be a good thing to have   so we decided to immediately jump into this  because it is an opportunity to affect the outcome of the conflict with the things that we do  with the tools that we have. But we didn't know very much about it. We didn't understand in Colombia   if you live in the cities  you're very far away from where  the war is actually happening  so you don't really understand it  and we asked the government  to give us access to as many demobilized guerrillas as possible. And we talked to about    of them before we felt we fully understood the problem. We talked about    they told us why  they had joined the guerrillas  why the left the guerrillas  what their dreams were  what their frustrations were  and from those conversations came the underlying insight that has guided this whole campaign  which is that guerrillas are as much prisoners of their organizations as the people they hold hostage. And at the beginning  we were so touched by these stories  we were so amazed by these stories  that we thought that maybe  the best way to talk to the guerrillas was to have them talk to themselves  so we recorded about a hundred different stories during the first year  and we put them on the radio and television so that the guerrillas in the jungle could hear stories  their stories  or stories similar to theirs  and when they heard them  they decided to go out. I want to tell you one of these stories. This person you see here  is Giovanni Andres. Giovanni Andres is    when we took that picture. He had been seven years in the guerrilla  and he had demobilized very recently. His story is the following  He was recruited when he was     and sometime later  in his squadron  if you will  this beautiful girl was recruited  and they fell in love. Their conversations were about what their family was going to be like  what their kids' names would be  how their life would be when they left the guerrilla. But it turns out that love is very strictly forbidden in the lower ranks of the guerrilla  so their romance was discovered and they were separated. He was sent very far away  and she was left behind. She was very familiar with the territory  so one night  when she was on guard  she just left  and she went to the army  she demobilized  and she was one of the persons that we had the fortune to talk to  and we were really touched by this story  so we made a radio spot  and it turns out  by chance  that far away  many   many kilometers north  he heard her on the radio  and when he heard her on the radio  he said   What am I doing here  She had the balls to get out. I need to do the same thing.  And he did. He walked for two days and two nights  and he risked his life and he got out  and the only thing he wanted was to see her. The only thing that was in his mind was to see her. The story was  they did meet. I know you're wondering if they did meet. They did meet. She had been recruited when she was     and she left when she was     so there were a lot of other complications  but they did eventually meet. I don't know if they're together now  but I can find out.  Laughter  But what I can tell you is that our radio strategy was working. The problem is that it was working in the lower ranks of the guerrilla. It was not working with the commanders  the people that are more difficult to replace  because you can easily recruit but you can't get the older commanders. So we thought  well  we'll use the same strategy. We'll have commanders talking to commanders. And we even went as far as asking ex commanders of the guerrilla to fly on helicopters with microphones telling the people that used to fight with them   There is a better life out there    I'm doing good    This is not worth it   etc. But  as you can all imagine  it was very easy to counteract  because what was the guerrilla going to say   Yeah  right  if he doesn't do that  he's going to get killed.  So it was easy  so we were suddenly left with nothing  because the guerrilla were spreading the word that all of those things are done because if they don't do it   they're in danger. And somebody  some brilliant person in our team  came back and said   You know what I noticed  I noticed that around Christmastime  there have been peaks of demobilization since this war has started.  And that was incredible  because that led us to think  that we needed to talk to the human being and not to the soldier. We needed to step away from talking from government to army  from army to army  and we needed to talk about the universal values  and we needed to talk about humanity. And that was when the Christmas tree happened. This picture that I have here  you see this is the planning of the Christmas trees  and that man you see there with the three stars  he's Captain Juan Manuel Valdez. Captain Valdez was the first  high ranking official to give us the helicopters  and the support we needed to put these Christmas trees up  and he said in that meeting something that I will never forget. He said   I want to do this because being generous makes me stronger  makes my men feel stronger.  And I get very emotional when I remember him because he was killed later in combat and we really miss him  but I wanted you all to see him  because he was really  really important. He gave us all the support to put up the first Christmas trees. What happened later is that the guerrillas who came out during the Christmas tree  operation and all of that said   That's really good  Christmas trees are really cool  but you know what  We really don't walk anymore. We use rivers.  So rivers are the highways of the jungle  and this is something we learned  and most of the recruiting was being done in and around the river villages. So we went to these river villages  and we asked the people  and probably some of them were direct acquaintances of the guerrillas. We asked them   Can you send guerrillas a message   We collected over       messages. Some of them were notes saying  get out. Some of them were toys. Some of them were candy. Even people took off their jewelry  their little crosses and religious things  and put them in these floating balls that we sent down the rivers so that they could be picked up at night. And we sent thousands of these down the rivers  and then picked them up later if they weren't. But lots of them were picked up. This generated  on average  a demobilization every six hours  so this was incredible and it was about  Come home at Christmas. Then came the peace process  and when the peace process started  the whole mindset of the guerrilla changed. And it changed because it makes you think   Well  if there's a peace process  this is probably going to be over. At some point I'm going to get out.  And their fears completely changed  and their fears were not about   Am I going to get killed   Their fears were   Am I going to be rejected  When I get out of this  am I going to be rejected   So the past Christmas   what we did was we asked    we found    mothers of guerrillas  and we asked them to give us  pictures of their children  when they only could recognize themselves  so as not to put their lives in danger  and we asked them to give the most motherly message you can get  which is   Before you were a guerrilla  you were my child  so come home  I'm waiting for you.  You can see the pictures here. I'll show you a couple. Thank you. And these pictures were placed in many different places  and a lot of them came back  and it was really  really beautiful. And then we decided to work with society. So we did mothers around Christmastime. Now let's talk about the rest of the people. And you may be aware of this or not  but there was a World Cup this year  and Colombia played really well  and it was a unifying moment for Colombia. And what we did was tell the guerrillas   Come  get out of the jungle. We're saving a place for you.  So this was television  this was  all different types of media saying   We are saving a place for you.  The soldier here in the commercial says   I'm saving a place for you right here in this helicopter so that you can get out of this jungle and go enjoy the World Cup.  Ex football players  radio announcers  everybody was saving a place for the guerrilla. So since we started this work a little over eight years ago         guerrillas have demobilized. I do not     Applause  Thank you. I don't want to say in any way that it only has to do with what we do  but what I do know is that our work and the work that we do may have helped a lot of them start thinking about demobilization  and it may have helped a lot of them take the final decision. If that is true  advertising is still one of the most powerful tools of change that we have available. And I speak not only my behalf  but on behalf of all the colleagues I see here who work in advertising  and of all the team that has worked with me to do this  that if you want to change the world  or if you want to achieve  peace  please call us. We'd love to help. Thank you. When I arrived in Kiev  on February   this year  Independence Square was under siege  surrounded by police loyal to the government. The protesters who occupied Maidan  as the square is known  prepared for battle  stockpiling homemade weapons and mass producing improvised body armor. The Euromaidan protests began peacefully at the end of       after the president of Ukraine  Viktor Yanukovych  rejected a far reaching accord with the European Union in favor of stronger ties with Russia. In response  tens of thousands of dissatisfied citizens poured into central Kiev to demonstrate against this allegiance. As the months passed  confrontations between police and civilians intensified. I set up a makeshift portrait studio by the barricades on Hrushevsky Street. There  I photographed the fighters against a black curtain  a curtain that obscured the highly seductive and visual backdrop of fire  ice and smoke. In order to tell the individual human stories here  I felt that I needed to remove the dramatic visuals that had become so familiar and repetitive within the mainstream media. What I was witnessing was not only news  but also history. With this realization  I was free from the photojournalistic conventions of the newspaper and the magazine. Oleg  Vasiliy and Maxim were all ordinary men  with ordinary lives from ordinary towns. But the elaborate costumes that they had bedecked themselves in were quite extraordinary. I say the word  costume  because these were not clothes that had been issued or coordinated by anyone. They were improvised uniforms made up of decommissioned military equipment  irregular combat fatigues and trophies taken from the police. I became interested in the way they were choosing to represent themselves  this outward expression of masculinity  the ideal of the warrior. I worked slowly  using an analog film camera with a manual focusing loop and a handheld light meter. The process is old fashioned. It gives me time to speak with each person and to look at them  in silence  while they look back at me. Rising tensions culminated in the worst day of violence on February     which became known as Bloody Thursday. Snipers  loyal to the government  started firing on the civilians and protesters on Institutskaya Street. Many were killed in a very short space of time. The reception of the Hotel Ukraine became a makeshift morgue. There were lines of bodies laid in the street. And there was blood all over the pavements. The following day  President Yanukovych fled Ukraine. In all  three months of protests resulted in more than     confirmed dead and many more missing. History unfolded quickly  but celebration remained elusive in Maidan. As the days passed in Kiev's central square  streams of armed fighters were joined by tens of thousands of ordinary people  filling the streets in an act of collective mourning. Many were women who often carried flowers that they had brought to lay as marks of respect for the dead. They came day after day and they covered the square with millions of flowers. Sadness enveloped Maidan. It was quiet and I could hear the birds singing. I hadn't heard that before. I stopped women as they approached the barricades to lay their tributes and asked to make their picture. Most women cried when I photographed them. On the first day  my fixer  Emine  and I cried with almost every woman who visited our studio. There had been such a noticeable absence of women up until that point. And the color of their pastel coats  their shiny handbags  and the bunches of red carnations  white tulips and yellow roses that they carried jarred with the blackened square and the blackened men who were encamped there. It is clear to me that these two sets of pictures don't make much sense without the other. They are about men and women and the way we are    not the way we look  but the way we are. They speak about different gender roles in conflict  not only in Maidan  and not only in Ukraine. Men fight most wars and women mourn them. If the men showed the ideal of the warrior  then the women showed the implications of such violence. When I made these pictures  I believed that I was documenting the end of violent events in Ukraine. But now I understand that it is a record of the beginning. Today  the death toll stands around        while hundreds of thousands have been displaced. I was in Ukraine again six weeks ago. In Maidan  the barricades have been dismantled  and the paving stones which were used as weapons during the protests replaced  so that traffic flows freely through the center of the square. The fighters  the women and the flowers are gone. A huge billboard depicting geese flying over a wheat field covers the burned out shell of the trade union's building and proclaims   Glory to Ukraine. Glory to heroes.  Thank you. Thank you. I have only got    minutes to explain something  that lasts for hours and days  so I'd better get started. Let's start with a clip from Al Jazeera's Listening Post. Richard Gizbert  Norway is a country that  gets relatively little media coverage. Even the elections this past week passed without much drama. And that's the Norwegian media in a nutshell  not much drama. A few years back  Norway's public TV channel NRK decided to broadcast live coverage of a seven hour train ride    seven hours of simple footage  a train rolling down the tracks. Norwegians  more than a million of them according to the ratings  loved it. A new kind of reality TV show was born  and it goes against all the rules of TV engagement. There is no story line  no script  no drama  no climax  and it's called Slow TV. For the past two months  Norwegians have been watching  a cruise ship's journey up the coast  and there's a lot of fog on that coast. Executives at Norway's National Broadcasting Service are now considering broadcasting a night of knitting nationwide. On the surface  it sounds boring  because it is  but something about this TV experiment has gripped Norwegians. So we sent the Listening Post's Marcela Pizarro to Oslo to find out what it is  but first a warning  Viewers may find some of the images in the following report disappointing. Thomas Hellum  And then follows an eight minute story on Al Jazeera about some strange TV programs in little Norway. Al Jazeera. CNN. How did we get there  We have to go back to       when one of my colleagues got a great idea. Where do you get your ideas  In the lunchroom. So he said  why don't we make a radio program marking the day of the German invasion of Norway in     . We tell the story at the exact time during the night. Wow. Brilliant idea  except this was just a couple of weeks before the invasion day. So we sat in our lunchroom and discussed what other stories can you tell as they evolve  What other things take a really long time  So one of us came up with a train. The Bergen Railway had its      year anniversary that year It goes from western Norway to eastern Norway  and it takes exactly the same time as it did    years ago  over seven hours.  Laughter  So we caught our commissioning editors  in Oslo  and we said  we want to make a documentary about the Bergen Railway  and we want to make it in full length  and the answer was   Yes  but how long will the program be    Oh   we said   full length.   Yes  but we mean the program.  And back and forth. Luckily for us  they met us with laughter  very  very good laughter  so one bright day in September  we started a program that we thought should be seven hours and four minutes. Actually  it turned out to be seven hours and    minutes due to a signal failure at the last station. We had four cameras  three of them pointing out to the beautiful nature. Some talking to the guests  some information. TH  And that's about it  but of course  also the     tunnels gave us the opportunity to do some archives. Narrator  in Norwegian   Then a bit of flirting while the food is digested. The last downhill stretch before we reach our destination. We pass Mj lfjell Station. Then a new tunnel. TH  And now we thought  yes  we have a brilliant program. It will fit for the       train spotters in Norway. We brought it on air in November     . But no  this was far more attractive. This is the five biggest TV channels in Norway on a normal Friday  and if you look at NRK  over here  look what happened when they put on the Bergen Railway show   .  million Norwegians watched part of this program. And another funny thing  When the host on our main channel  after they have got news for you  she said   And on our second channel  the train has now nearly reached Myrdal station.  Thousands of people just jumped on the train on our second channel like this.  Laughter  This was also a huge success in terms of social media. It was so nice to see all the thousands of Facebook and Twitter users discussing the same view  talking to each other as if they were on the same train together. And especially  I like this one. It's a    year old man. He's watched all the program  and at the end station  he rises up to pick up what he thinks is his luggage  and his head hit the curtain rod  and he realized he is in his own living room. So that's strong and living TV. Four hundred and thirty six minute by minute on a Friday night  and during that first night  the first Twitter message came  Why be a chicken  Why stop at     when you can expand that to        minute by minute  and do the iconic journey in Norway  the coastal ship journey Hurtigruten from Bergen to Kirkenes  almost       kilometers  covering most of our coast. It has     year old  very interesting history  and literally takes part in life and death along the coast. So just a week after the Bergen Railway  we called the Hurtigruten company and we started planning for our next show. We wanted to do something different. The Bergen Railway was a recorded program. So when we sat in our editing room  we watched this picture    it's all  l Station    we saw this journalist. We had called him  we had spoken to him  and when we left the station  he took this picture of us and he waved to the camera  and we thought  what if more people knew that we were on board that train  Would more people show up  What would it look like  So we decided our next project  it should be live. We wanted this picture of us on the fjord and on the screen at the same time. So this is not the first time NRK had been on board a ship. This is back in       when the technical managers have suits and ties and NRK rolled all its equipment on board a ship  and     meters out of the shore  transmitting the signal back  and in the machine room  they talked to the machine guy  and on the deck  they have splendid entertainment. So being on a ship   it's not the first time. But five and a half days in a row  and live  we wanted some help. And we asked our viewers out there  what do you want to see  What do you want us to film  How do you want this to look  Do you want us to make a website  What do you want on it  And we got some answers from you out there  and it helped us a very lot to build the program. So in June          of us went on board the Hurtigruten coastal ship and we set off. I have some really strong memories from that week  and it's all about people. This guy  for instance  he's head of research at the University in Troms  And I will show you a piece of cloth  this one. It's the other strong memory. It belongs to a guy called Erik Hansen. And it's people like those two who took a firm grip of our program  and together with thousands of others along the route  they made the program what it became. They made all the stories. This is Karl. He's in the ninth grade. It says   I will be a little late for school tomorrow.  He was supposed to be in the school at   a.m. He came at   a.m.  and he didn't get a note from his teacher  because the teacher had watched the program. How did we do this  Yes  we took a conference room on board the Hurtigruten. We turned it into a complete TV control room. We made it all work  of course  and then we took along    cameras. This is one of them. This is my sketch from February  and when you give this sketch to professional people in the Norwegian broadcasting company NRK  you get some cool stuff back. And with some very creative solutions. This is Norway's most important drill right now. It regulates the height of a bow camera in NRK's live production  one of    that capture great shots from the MS Nord Norge. Eight wires keep the camera stable. Cameraman  I work  on different camera solutions. They're just tools used in a different context. TH  Another camera is this one. It's normally used for sports. It made it possible for us to take close up pictures of people     kilomteres away  like this one.  Laughter  People called us and asked  how is this man doing  He's doing fine. Everything went well. We also could take pictures of people waving at us  people along the route  thousands of them  and they all had a phone in their hand. And when you take a picture of them  and they get the message   Now we are on TV  dad   they start waving back. This was waving TV  for five and a half days  and people get so extremely happy when they can send a warm message to their loved ones. It was also a great success on social media. On the last day  we met Her Majesty the Queen of Norway  and Twitter couldn't quite handle it. And we also  on the web  during this week we streamed more than     years of video to     nations  and the websites are still there and they will be forever  actually  because Hurtigruten was selected to be part of the Norwegian UNESCO list of documents  and it's also in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest documentary ever. Thank you. But it's a long program  so some watched part of it  like the Prime Minister. Some watched a little bit more. It says   I haven't used my bed for five days.  And he's    years old  and he hardly slept. He kept watching because something might happen  though it probably won't.  Laughter  This is the number of viewers along the route. You can see the famous Trollfjord and a day after  all time high for NRK . If you see the four biggest channels in Norway during June       they will look like this  and as a TV producer  it's a pleasure to put Hurtigruten on top of it. It looks like this   .  million Norwegians watched part of this program  and we are only five million here. Even the passengers on board the Hurtigruten coastal ship    they chose to watched the telly instead of turning    degrees and watching out the window. So we were allowed to be  part of people's living room with this strange TV program  with music  nature  people. And Slow TV was now a buzzword  and we started looking for other things we could make Slow TV about. So we could either take something long and make it a topic  like with the railway and the Hurtigruten  or we could take a topic and make it long. This is the last project. It's the peep show. It's    hours of birdwatching on a TV screen  actually    days on the web. We have made    hours of live salmon fishing. It actually took three hours before we got the first fish  and that's quite slow. We have made    hours of boat ride into the beautiful Telemark Canal  and we have made another train ride with the northern railway  and because this we couldn't do live  we did it in four seasons just to give the viewer another experience on the way. So our next project got us some attention outside Norway. This is from the Colbert Report on Comedy Central. called  National Firewood Night   which consisted of mostly people in parkas chatting and chopping in the woods  and then eight hours of a fire  burning in a fireplace.  Laughter  It destroyed the other  top Norwegian shows  like  So You Think You Can Watch Paint Dry  and  The Amazing Glacier Race.  And get this  almost    percent of the Norwegian population tuned in     percent. TH  So  when wood fire and wood chopping can be that interesting  why not knitting  So on our next project  we used more than eight hours to go live from a sheep to a sweater  and Jimmy Kimmel in the ABC show  he liked that. and after all that  the knitters actually failed to break the world record. They did not succeed  but remember the old Norwegian saying  it's not whether you win or lose that counts. In fact  nothing counts   and death is coming for us all. TH  Exactly. So why does this stand out  This is so completely different to other TV programming. We take the viewer on a journey that happens right now in real time  and the viewer gets the feeling of actually being there  actually being on the train  on the boat  and knitting together with others  and the reason I think why they're doing that is because we don't edit the timeline. It's important that we don't edit the timeline  and it's also important that what we make Slow TV about is something that we all can relate to  that the viewer can relate to  and that somehow has  a root in our culture. This is a picture from last summer when we traveled the coast again for seven weeks. And of course this is a lot of planning  this is a lot of logistics. So this is the working plan for     people last summer  but more important is what you don't plan. You don't plan what's going to happen. You have to just take your cameras with you. It's like a sports event. You rig them and you see what's happening. So this is actually the whole running order for Hurtigruten      hours  just written on one page. We didn't know anything more when we left Bergen. So you have to let the viewers make the stories themselves  and I'll give you an example of that. This is from last summer  and as a TV producer  it's a nice picture  but now you can cut to the next one. But this is Slow TV  so you have to keep this picture until  it really starts hurting your stomach  and then you keep it a little bit longer  and when you keep it that long  I'm sure some of you now have noticed the cow. Some of you have seen the flag. Some of you start wondering  is the farmer at home  Has he left  Is he watching the cow  And where is that cow going  So my point is  the longer you keep a picture like this  and we kept it for    minutes  you start making the stories in your own head. That's Slow TV. So we think that Slow TV is one nice way of telling a TV story  and we think that we can continue doing it  not too often  once or twice a year  so we keep the feeling of an event  and we also think that the good Slow TV idea  that's the idea when people say   Oh no  you can't put that on TV.  When people smile  it might be a very good slow idea  so after all  life is best when it's a bit strange. Thank you. The shocking police crackdown on protestors in Ferguson  Missouri  in the wake of the police  shooting of Michael Brown  underscored the extent to which advanced military weapons and equipment  designed for the battlefield  are making their way to small town police departments across the United States. Although much tougher to observe  this same thing is happening  with surveillance equipment. NSA style mass  surveillance is enabling local police departments  to gather vast quantities of sensitive information about each and every one of us in a way that was never previously possible. Location information can  be very sensitive. If you drive your car around the United States  it can reveal if you go  to a therapist  attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting  if you go to church  or if you don't go to church. And when that  information about you is combined with the same information about everyone else  the government can gain  a detailed portrait of how private citizens interact. This information used to be private. Thanks to modern technology  the government knows far too much about what happens behind closed doors. And local police departments make decisions about who they think you are based on this information. One of the key technologies  driving mass location tracking is the innocuous sounding Automatic License Plate Reader. If you haven't seen one  it's probably because you didn't know what to look for    they're everywhere. Mounted on roads or  on police cars  Automatic License Plate Readers capture images of every passing car and convert the license plate into machine readable text so that they can be checked against hot lists of cars potentially wanted for wrongdoing. But more than that  increasingly  local police departments  are keeping records not just of people wanted for wrongdoing  but of every plate that  passes them by  resulting in the collection of mass quantities of data about where Americans have gone. Did you know this was happening  When Mike Katz Lacabe asked his local police department for information about the plate reader data they had on him  this is what they got  in addition to the date   time and location  the police department had  photographs that captured where he was going and  often who he was with. The second photo from the top is a picture of Mike and his two daughters getting out of their car in their own driveway. The government has  hundreds of photos like this about Mike going about his daily life. And if you drive a car  in the United States  I would bet money  that they have photographs like this of you going about your daily life. Mike hasn't done anything wrong. Why is it okay that the government is keeping all of this information  The reason it's happening is because  as the cost of storing this data has plummeted  the police departments simply hang on to it  just in case it could be useful someday. The issue is not just that one police department is gathering this information in isolation or even that multiple police  departments are doing it. At the same time  the federal government is collecting all of these individual pots of data  and pooling them together  into one vast database with hundreds of millions of hits  showing where Americans have traveled. This document from the  Federal Drug Enforcement Administration  which is one of the agencies primarily interested in this  is one of several that reveal  the existence of this database. Meanwhile  in New York City  the NYPD has driven police cars equipped with license plate readers past mosques in order to figure out who is attending. The uses and abuses of this technology aren't limited to the United States. In the U.K.  the police department put    year old John Kat on a plate reader watch list after he had attended dozens of lawful political demonstrations where he liked to sit on a bench and sketch the attendees. License plate readers aren't the only mass location tracking technology available to law enforcement agents today. Through a technique known as a cell tower dump  law enforcement agents can uncover who was using one or more cell towers at a particular time  a technique which has been known to reveal the location of tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands of people. Also  using a device known as a StingRay  law enforcement agents can send tracking signals inside people's houses to identify the cell phones located there. And if they don't know which house to target  they've been known  to drive this technology around through whole neighborhoods. Just as the police in Ferguson possess high tech military weapons and equipment  so too do police departments across the United States possess high tech surveillance gear. Just because you don't see it  doesn't mean it's not there. The question is  what should we do about this  I think this poses a serious civil liberties threat. History has shown that once the police  have massive quantities of data  tracking the movements of innocent people  it gets abused  maybe for blackmail  maybe for political advantage  or maybe for simple voyeurism. Fortunately  there are steps we can take. Local police departments can  be governed by the city councils  which can pass laws requiring the police to dispose of the data  about innocent people while allowing the legitimate uses of the technology to go forward. Thank you. When we think about mapping cities  we tend to think about roads and streets and buildings  and the settlement narrative that led to their creation  or you might think about the bold vision of an urban designer  but there's other ways to think about mapping cities and how they got to be made. Today  I want to show you a new kind of map. This is not a geographic map. This is a map of the relationships  between people in my hometown of Baltimore  Maryland  and what you can see here is that each dot represents a person  each line represents a relationship between those people  and each color represents a community within the network. Now  I'm here on the green side  down on the far right where the geeks are  and TEDx also is down  on the far right.  Laughter  Now  on the other side of the network  you tend to have primarily African American and Latino folks who are really concerned about somewhat different things than the geeks are  but just to give some sense  the green part of the network  we call Smalltimore  for those of us that inhabit it  because it seems as though we're living in a very small town. We see the same people over and over again  but that's because we're not really exploring the full depth and breadth of the city. On the other end of the network  you have folks who are interested in things like hip hop music and they even identify with living in the DC Maryland Virginia area over  say  the Baltimore city designation proper. But in the middle  you see that there's something that connects the two communities together  and that's sports. We have the Baltimore Orioles  the Baltimore Ravens football team  Michael Phelps  the Olympian. Under Armour  you may have heard of  is a Baltimore company  and that community of sports acts as the only bridge between these two ends of the network. Let's take a look at San Francisco. You see something a little bit different happening in San Francisco. On the one hand  you do have the media  politics and news lobe that tends to exist in Baltimore and other cities  but you also have this very predominant group of geeks and techies that are sort of taking over the top half of the network  and there's even a group that's so distinct and clear that we can identify it as Twitter employees  next to the geeks  in between the gamers and the geeks  at the opposite end of the hip hop spectrum. So you can see  though  that the tensions that we've heard about in San Francisco in terms of people being concerned about gentrification and all the new tech companies that are bringing new wealth and settlement into the city are real  and you can actually see that documented here. You can see the LGBT community is not really getting along with the geek community that well  the arts community  the music community. And so it leads to things like this.   Evict Twitter   Somebody sent me this photo a few weeks ago  and it shows what is happening on the ground in San Francisco  and I think you can actually try to understand that through looking at a map like this. Let's take a look at Rio de Janeiro. I spent the last few weeks gathering data about Rio  and one of the things that stood out to me about this city is that everything's really kind of mixed up. It's a very heterogenous city in a way  that Baltimore or San Francisco is not. You still have the lobe of people involved with government  newspapers  politics  columnists. TEDxRio is down in the lower right  right next to bloggers and writers. But then you also have this tremendous diversity of people that are interested in different kinds of music. Even Justin Bieber fans are represented here. Other boy bands  country singers  gospel music  funk and rap and stand up comedy  and there's even a whole section around drugs and jokes. How cool is that  And then the Flamengo football team is also represented here. So you have that same kind of spread of sports and civics and the arts and music  but it's represented in a very different way  and I think that maybe fits with our understanding of Rio as being a very multicultural  musically diverse city. So we have all this data. It's an incredibly rich set of data that we have about cities now  maybe even richer than any data set that we've ever had before. So what can we do with it  Well  I think the first thing that we can try to understand is that segregation is a social construct. It's something that we choose to do  and we could choose not to do it  and if you kind of think about it  what we're doing with this data is aiming a space telescope at a city and looking at it as if was a giant high school cafeteria  and seeing how everybody arranged themselves in a seating chart. Well maybe it's time to shake up the seating chart a little bit. The other thing that we start to realize is that race is a really poor proxy for diversity. We've got people represented from all different types of races across the entire map here    only looking at race doesn't really contribute to our development of diversity. So if we're trying to use diversity as a way to tackle some of our more intractable problems  we need to start to think  about diversity in a new way. And lastly  we have the ability to create interventions to start to reshape our cities in a new way  and I believe that if we have that capability  we may even bear some responsibility to do so. So what is a city  I think some might say that it is a geographical area or a collection of streets and buildings  but I believe that a city  is the sum of the relationships of the people that live there  and I believe that if we can start to document those relationships in a real way then maybe we have a real shot at creating those kinds of cities that we'd like to have. Thank you. I was on a long road trip this summer  and I was having a wonderful time listening to the amazing Isabel Wilkerson's  The Warmth of Other Suns.  It documents six million black folks fleeing the South from      to      looking for a respite from all the brutality and trying to get to a better opportunity up North  and it was filled with stories of the resilience and the brilliance of African Americans  and it was also really hard to hear all the stories of the horrors and the humility  and all the humiliations. It was especially hard to hear about the beatings and the burnings and the lynchings of black men. And I said   You know  this is a little deep. I need a break. I'm going to turn on the radio.  I turned it on  and there it was  Ferguson  Missouri  Michael Brown     year old black man  unarmed  shot by a white police officer  laid on the ground dead  blood running for four hours while his grandmother and little children and his neighbors watched in horror  and I thought  here it is again. This violence  this brutality against black men has been going on for centuries. I mean  it's the same story. It's just different names. It could have been Amadou Diallo. It could have been Sean Bell. It could have been Oscar Grant. It could have been Trayvon Martin. This violence  this brutality  is really something that's part of our national psyche. It's part of our collective history. What are we going to do about it  You know that part of us that still crosses the street  locks the doors  clutches the purses  when we see young black men  That part. I mean  I know we're not shooting people down in the street  but I'm saying that the same stereotypes and prejudices that fuel those kinds of tragic incidents are in us. We've been schooled in them as well. I believe that we can stop these types of incidents  these Fergusons from happening  by looking within and being willing to change ourselves. So I have a call to action for you. There are three things that I want to offer us today to think about as ways to stop Ferguson from happening again  three things that I think will help us reform our images of young black men  three things that I'm hoping will not only protect them but will open the world so that they can thrive. Can you imagine that  Can you imagine our country embracing young black men  seeing them as part of our future  giving them that kind of openness  that kind of grace we give to people we love  How much better would our lives be  How much better would our country be  Let me just start with number one. We gotta get out of denial. Stop trying to be good people. We need real people. You know  I do a lot of diversity work  and people will come up to me at the beginning of the workshop. They're like   Oh  Ms. Diversity Lady  we're so glad you're here      but we don't have a biased bone  in our body.  And I'm like   Really  Because I do this work every day  and I see all my biases.  I mean  not too long ago  I was on a plane and I heard the voice of a woman pilot coming over the P.A. system  and I was just so excited  so thrilled. I was like   Yes  women  we are rocking it. We are now in the stratosphere.  It was all good  and then it started getting turbulent and bumpy  and I was like   I hope she can drive.  I know. Right. But it's not even like I knew that was a bias until I was coming back on the other leg and there's always a guy driving and it's often turbulent and bumpy  and I've never questioned the confidence of the male driver. The pilot is good. Now  here's the problem. If you ask me explicitly  I would say   Female pilot  awesome.  But it appears that when things get funky and a little troublesome  a little risky  I lean on a bias that I didn't even know that I had. You know  fast moving planes in the sky  I want a guy. That's my default. Men are my default. Who is your default  Who do you trust  Who are you afraid of  Who do you implicitly feel connected to  Who do you run away from  I'm going to tell you what we have learned. The implicit association test  which measures unconscious bias  you can go online and take it. Five million people have taken it. Turns out  our default is white. We like white people. We prefer white. What do I mean by that  When people are shown images  of black men and white men  we are more quickly able to associate that picture with a positive word  that white person with a positive word  than we are when we are  trying to associate positive with a black face  and vice versa. When we see a black face  it is easier for us to connect black with negative than it is white with negative. Seventy percent of white people taking that test prefer white. Fifty percent of black people taking that test prefer white. You see  we were all outside when the contamination came down. What do we do about the fact that our brain automatically associates  You know  one of the things that you probably are thinking about  and you're probably like  you know what  I'm just going to double down on my color blindness. Yes  I'm going to recommit to that. I'm going to suggest to you  no. We've gone about as far as we can go trying to make a difference trying to not see color. The problem was never that we saw color. It was what we did when we saw the color. It's a false ideal. And while we're busy  pretending not to see  we are not being aware of the ways in which racial difference is changing people's possibilities  that's keeping them from thriving  and sometimes it's causing them an early death. So in fact  what the scientists are telling us is  no way. Don't even think about color blindness. In fact  what they're suggesting is  stare at awesome black people. Look at them directly in their faces and memorize them  because when we look at awesome folks who are black  it helps to dissociate the association that happens automatically in our brain. Why do you think I'm showing you these beautiful black men behind me  There were so many  I had to cut them. Okay  so here's the thing  I'm trying to reset your automatic associations about who black men are. I'm trying to remind you that young black men grow up to be amazing human beings who have changed our lives and made them better. So here's the thing. The other possibility in science  and it's only temporarily changing our automatic assumptions  but one thing we know is that if you take a white person who is odious that you know  and stick it up next to a person of color  a black person  who is fabulous  then that sometimes actually causes us to disassociate too. So think Jeffrey Dahmer and Colin Powell. Just stare at them  right   Laughter  But these are the things. So go looking for your bias. Please  please  just get out of denial and go looking for disconfirming data that will prove that in fact your old stereotypes are wrong. Okay  so that's number one  number two  what I'm going to say is move toward young black men instead of away from them. It's not the hardest thing to do  but it's also one of these things where you have to be conscious  and intentional about it. You know  I was in a Wall Street area  one time several years ago when I was with a colleague of mine  and she's really wonderful and she does diversity work with me and she's a woman of color  she's Korean. And we were outside  it was late at night  and we were sort of wondering where we were going  we were lost. And I saw this person across the street  and I was thinking   Oh great  black guy.  I was going toward him without even thinking about it. And she was like   Oh  that's interesting.  The guy across the street  he was a black guy. I think black guys generally know where they're going. I don't know why exactly I think that  but that's what I think. So she was saying   Oh  you were going  'Yay  a black guy'   She said   I was going  'Ooh  a black guy.'  Other direction. Same need  same guy  same clothes  same time  same street  different reaction. And she said   I feel so bad. I'm a diversity consultant. I did the black guy thing. I'm a woman of color. Oh my God   And I said   You know what  Please. We really need to relax about this.  I mean  you've got to realize I go way back with black guys. My dad is a black guy. You see what I'm saying  I've got a  '   black guy son. I was married to a black guy. My black guy thing is so wide and so deep that I can pretty much sort and figure out who that black guy is  and he was my black guy. He said   Yes  ladies  I know where you're going. I'll take you there.  You know  biases are the stories we make up about people before we know who they actually are. But how are we going to know who they are when we've been told to avoid and be afraid of them  So I'm going to tell you to walk toward your discomfort. And I'm not asking you to take any crazy risks. I'm saying  just do an inventory  expand your social and professional circles. Who's in your circle  Who's missing  How many authentic relationships do you have with young black people  folks  men  women  Or any other major difference from who you are and how you roll  so to speak  Because  you know what  Just look around your periphery. There may be somebody at work  in your classroom  in your house of worship  somewhere  there's some black young guy there. And you're nice. You say hi. I'm saying go deeper  closer  further  and build the kinds of relationships  the kinds of friendships that actually cause you to see the holistic person and to really go against the stereotypes. I know some of you are out there  I know because I have some white friends in particular that will say   You have no idea how awkward I am. Like  I don't think this is going to work for me. I'm sure I'm going to blow this.  Okay  maybe  but this thing is not  about perfection. It's about connection. And you're not going to get comfortable before you get uncomfortable. I mean  you just have to do it. And young black men  what I'm saying is if someone comes your way  genuinely and authentically  take the invitation. Not everyone is out to get you. Go looking for those people who can see your humanity. You know  it's the empathy and the compassion that comes out of having relationships with people who are different from you. Something really powerful and beautiful happens  you start to realize that they are you  that they are part of you  that they are you in your family  and then we cease to be bystanders and we become actors  we become advocates  and we become allies. So go away from your comfort into a bigger  brighter thing  because that is how we will stop another Ferguson from happening. That's how we create a community where everybody  especially young black men  can thrive. So this last thing is going to be harder  and I know it  but I'm just going to put it out there anyway. When we see something  we have to have the courage to say something  even to the people we love. You know  it's holidays and it's going to be a time when we're sitting around the table and having a good time. Many of us  anyways  will be in holidays  and you've got to listen to the conversations around the table. You start to say things like   Grandma's a bigot.   Uncle Joe is racist.  And you know  we love Grandma and we love Uncle Joe. We do. We know they're good people  but what they're saying is wrong. And we need to be able to say something  because you know who else is at the table  The children are at the table. And we wonder why these biases don't die  and move from generation to generation  Because we're not saying anything. We've got to be willing to say   Grandma  we don't call people that anymore.   Uncle Joe  it isn't true that he deserved that. No one deserves that.  And we've got to be willing to not shelter our children from the ugliness of racism when black parents don't have the luxury to do so  especially those who have  young black sons. We've got to take  our lovely darlings  our future  and we've got to tell them we have  an amazing country with incredible ideals  we have worked incredibly hard  and we have made some progress  but we are not done. We still have in us this old stuff about superiority and it is causing us to embed those further into our institutions and our society and generations  and it is making for despair and disparities and a devastating devaluing of young black men. We still struggle  you have to tell them  with seeing both the color and the character of young black men  but that you  and you expect them  to be part of the forces of change in this society that will stand against injustice and is willing  above all other things  to make a society where young black men  can be seen for all of who they are. So many amazing black men  those who are the most amazing statesmen that have ever lived  brave soldiers  awesome  hardworking laborers. These are people who are powerful preachers. They are incredible scientists and artists and writers. They are dynamic comedians. They are doting grandpas  caring sons. They are strong fathers  and they are young men with dreams of their own. Thank you. It used to be that if you wanted to get a computer to do something new  you would have to program it. Now  programming  for those of you here that haven't done it yourself  requires laying out in excruciating detail every single step that you want the computer to do in order to achieve your goal. Now  if you want to do something that you don't know how to do yourself  then this is going to be a great challenge. So this was the challenge faced by this man  Arthur Samuel. In       he wanted to get this computer to be able to beat him at checkers. How can you write a program  lay out in excruciating detail  how to be better than you at checkers  So he came up with an idea  he had the computer play against itself thousands of times and learn how to play checkers. And indeed it worked  and in fact  by       this computer had beaten the Connecticut state champion. So Arthur Samuel was the father of machine learning  and I have a great debt to him  because I am a machine learning practitioner. I was the president of Kaggle  a community of over         machine learning practictioners. Kaggle puts up competitions to try and get them to solve previously unsolved problems  and it's been successful  hundreds of times. So from this vantage point  I was able to find out a lot about what machine learning can do in the past  can do today  and what it could do in the future. Perhaps the first big success of  machine learning commercially was Google. Google showed that it is possible to find information by using a computer algorithm  and this algorithm is based on machine learning. Since that time  there have been many commercial successes of machine learning. Companies like Amazon and Netflix use machine learning to suggest products that you might like to buy  movies that you might like to watch. Sometimes  it's almost creepy. Companies like LinkedIn and Facebook sometimes will tell you about who your friends might be and you have no idea how it did it  and this is because it's using the power of machine learning. These are algorithms that have learned how to do this from data rather than being programmed by hand. This is also how IBM was successful in getting Watson to beat the two world champions at  Jeopardy   answering incredibly subtle and complex questions like this one.   The ancient 'Lion of Nimrud' went missing from this city's national museum in        along with a lot of other stuff    This is also why we are now able to see the first self driving cars. If you want to be able to tell the difference between  say  a tree and a pedestrian  well  that's pretty important. We don't know how to write those programs by hand  but with machine learning  this is now possible. And in fact  this car has driven  over a million miles without any accidents on regular roads. So we now know that computers can learn  and computers can learn to do things that we actually sometimes don't know how to do ourselves  or maybe can do them better than us. One of the most amazing examples I've seen of machine learning happened on a project that I ran at Kaggle where a team run by a guy called Geoffrey Hinton from the University of Toronto won a competition for automatic drug discovery. Now  what was extraordinary here is not just that they beat all of the algorithms developed by Merck or the international academic community  but nobody on the team had any background in chemistry or biology or life sciences  and they did it in two weeks. How did they do this  They used an extraordinary algorithm called deep learning. So important was this that in fact the success was covered in The New York Times in a front page article a few weeks later. This is Geoffrey Hinton here on the left hand side. Deep learning is an algorithm inspired by how the human brain works  and as a result it's an algorithm which has no theoretical limitations on what it can do. The more data you give it and the more computation time you give it  the better it gets. The New York Times also showed in this article another extraordinary result of deep learning which I'm going to show you now. It shows that computers  can listen and understand. that I want to be able to take in this process is to actually speak to you in Chinese. Now the key thing there is  we've been able to take a large amount  of information from many Chinese speakers and produce a text to speech system that takes Chinese text and converts it into Chinese language  and then we've taken an hour or so of my own voice and we've used that to modulate the standard text to speech system so that it would sound like me. Again  the result's not perfect. There are in fact quite a few errors. There's much work to be done in this area. Jeremy Howard  Well  that was at a machine learning conference in China. It's not often  actually  at academic conferences that you do hear spontaneous applause  although of course sometimes at TEDx conferences  feel free. Everything you saw there was happening with deep learning. The transcription in English was deep learning. The translation to Chinese and the text in the top right  deep learning  and the construction of the voice was deep learning as well. So deep learning is this extraordinary thing. It's a single algorithm that can seem to do almost anything  and I discovered that a year earlier  it had also learned to see. In this obscure competition from Germany called the German Traffic Sign  Recognition Benchmark  deep learning had learned to recognize traffic signs like this one. Not only could it recognize the traffic signs better than any other algorithm  the leaderboard actually showed it was better than people  about twice as good as people. So by       we had the first example of computers that can see better than people. Since that time  a lot has happened. In       Google announced that they had a deep learning algorithm watch YouTube videos and crunched the data on        computers for a month  and the computer independently learned about concepts such as people and cats just by watching the videos. This is much like the way that humans learn. Humans don't learn by being told what they see  but by learning for themselves what these things are. Also in       Geoffrey Hinton  who we saw earlier  won the very popular ImageNet competition  looking to try to figure out  from one and a half million images what they're pictures of. As of       we're now down to a six percent error rate in image recognition. This is better than people  again. So machines really are doing an extraordinarily good job of this  and it is now being used in industry. For example  Google announced last year that they had mapped every single location in France in two hours  and the way they did it was that they fed street view images into a deep learning algorithm to recognize and read street numbers. Imagine how long it would have taken before  dozens of people  many years. This is also happening in China. Baidu is kind of  the Chinese Google  I guess  and what you see here in the top left is an example of a picture that I uploaded to Baidu's deep learning system  and underneath you can see that the system has understood what that picture is and found similar images. The similar images actually have similar backgrounds  similar directions of the faces  even some with their tongue out. This is not clearly looking at the text of a web page. All I uploaded was an image. So we now have computers which really understand what they see and can therefore search databases of hundreds of millions of images in real time. So what does it mean now that computers can see  Well  it's not just  that computers can see. In fact  deep learning has done more than that. Complex  nuanced sentences like this one are now understandable with deep learning algorithms. As you can see here  this Stanford based system showing the red dot at the top has figured out that this sentence is expressing negative sentiment. Deep learning now in fact is near human performance at understanding what sentences are about and what it is saying about those things. Also  deep learning has been used to read Chinese  again at about native Chinese speaker level. This algorithm developed out of Switzerland by people  none of whom speak or understand any Chinese. As I say  using deep learning is about the best system in the world for this  even compared to native human understanding. This is a system that we put together at my company which shows putting all this stuff together. These are pictures which have no text attached  and as I'm typing in here sentences  in real time it's understanding these pictures and figuring out what they're about and finding pictures that are similar to the text that I'm writing. So you can see  it's actually understanding my sentences and actually understanding these pictures. I know that you've seen something like this on Google  where you can type in things and it will show you pictures  but actually what it's doing is it's searching the webpage for the text. This is very different from actually understanding the images. This is something that computers have only been able to do for the first time in the last few months. So we can see now that computers can not only see but they can also read  and  of course  we've shown that they can understand what they hear. Perhaps not surprising now that I'm going to tell you they can write. Here is some text that I generated using a deep learning algorithm yesterday. And here is some text that an algorithm out of Stanford generated. Each of these sentences was generated by a deep learning algorithm to describe each of those pictures. This algorithm before has never seen a man in a black shirt playing a guitar. It's seen a man before  it's seen black before  it's seen a guitar before  but it has independently generated this novel description of this picture. We're still not quite at human performance here  but we're close. In tests  humans prefer the computer generated caption one out of four times. Now this system is now only two weeks old  so probably within the next year  the computer algorithm will be well past human performance at the rate things are going. So computers can also write. So we put all this together and it leads to very exciting opportunities. For example  in medicine  a team in Boston announced that they had discovered dozens of new clinically relevant features of tumors which help doctors make a prognosis of a cancer. Very similarly  in Stanford  a group there announced that  looking at tissues under magnification  they've developed  a machine learning based system which in fact is better than human pathologists at predicting survival rates for cancer sufferers. In both of these cases  not only were the predictions more accurate  but they generated new insightful science. In the radiology case  they were new clinical indicators that humans can understand. In this pathology case  the computer system actually discovered that the cells around the cancer are as important as the cancer cells themselves in making a diagnosis. This is the opposite of what pathologists had been taught for decades. In each of those two cases  they were systems developed by a combination of medical experts and machine learning experts  but as of last year  we're now beyond that too. This is an example of identifying cancerous areas of human tissue under a microscope. The system being shown here can identify those areas more accurately  or about as accurately  as human pathologists  but was built entirely with deep learning using no medical expertise by people who have no background in the field. Similarly  here  this neuron segmentation. We can now segment neurons about as accurately as humans can  but this system was developed with deep learning using people with no previous  background in medicine. So myself  as somebody with no previous background in medicine  I seem to be entirely well qualified to start a new medical company  which I did. I was kind of terrified of doing it  but the theory seemed to suggest that it ought to be possible to do very useful medicine using just these data analytic techniques. And thankfully  the feedback has been fantastic  not just from the media but from the medical community  who have been very supportive. The theory is that we can take the middle part of the medical process and turn that into data analysis as much as possible  leaving doctors to do what they're best at. I want to give you an example. It now takes us about    minutes to generate a new medical diagnostic test and I'll show you that in real time now  but I've compressed it down to  three minutes by cutting some pieces out. Rather than showing you creating a medical diagnostic test  I'm going to show you  a diagnostic test of car images  because that's something we can all understand. So here we're starting with  about  .  million car images  and I want to create something that can split them into the angle of the photo that's being taken. So these images are entirely unlabeled  so I have to start from scratch. With our deep learning algorithm  it can automatically identify areas of structure in these images. So the nice thing is that the human and the computer can now work together. So the human  as you can see here  is telling the computer about areas of interest which it wants the computer then to try and use to improve its algorithm. Now  these deep learning systems actually are in        dimensional space  so you can see here the computer rotating this through that space  trying to find new areas of structure. And when it does so successfully  the human who is driving it can then point out the areas that are interesting. So here  the computer has successfully found areas  for example  angles. So as we go through this process  we're gradually telling the computer more and more about the kinds of structures we're looking for. You can imagine in a diagnostic test this would be a pathologist identifying areas of pathosis  for example  or a radiologist indicating potentially troublesome nodules. And sometimes it can be difficult for the algorithm. In this case  it got kind of confused. The fronts and the backs of the cars are all mixed up. So here we have to be a bit more careful  manually selecting these fronts as opposed to the backs  then telling the computer that this is a type of group that we're interested in. So we do that for a while  we skip over a little bit  and then we train the machine learning algorithm based on these couple of hundred things  and we hope that it's gotten a lot better. You can see  it's now started to fade some of these pictures out  showing us that it already is recognizing how to understand some of these itself. We can then use this concept of similar images  and using similar images  you can now see  the computer at this point is able to entirely find just the fronts of cars. So at this point  the human can tell the computer  okay  yes  you've done a good job of that. Sometimes  of course  even at this point it's still difficult to separate out groups. In this case  even after we let the computer try to rotate this for a while  we still find that the left sides and the right sides pictures are all mixed up together. So we can again give the computer some hints  and we say  okay  try and find a projection that separates out the left sides and the right sides as much as possible using this deep learning algorithm. And giving it that hint    ah  okay  it's been successful. It's managed to find a way of thinking about these objects that's separated out these together. So you get the idea here. This is a case not where the human is being replaced by a computer  but where they're working together. What we're doing here is we're replacing something that used to take a team of five or six people about seven years and replacing it with something that takes    minutes for one person acting alone. So this process takes about four or five iterations. You can see we now have    percent of our  .  million images  classified correctly. And at this point  we can start to quite quickly grab whole big sections  check through them to make sure that there's no mistakes. Where there are mistakes  we can let the computer know about them. And using this kind of process for each of the different groups  we are now up to an    percent success rate in classifying the  .  million images. And at this point  it's just a case of finding the small number that aren't classified correctly  and trying to understand why. And using that approach  by    minutes we get to    percent classification rates. So this kind of technique could allow us to fix a major problem  which is that there's a lack of medical expertise in the world. The World Economic Forum says that there's between a   x and a   x shortage of physicians in the developing world  and it would take about     years to train enough people to fix that problem. So imagine if we can help enhance their efficiency using these deep learning approaches  So I'm very excited about the opportunities. I'm also concerned about the problems. The problem here is that every area in blue on this map is somewhere where services are over    percent of employment. What are services  These are services. These are also the exact things that computers have just learned how to do. So    percent of the world's employment in the developed world is stuff that computers  have just learned how to do. What does that mean  Well  it'll be fine. They'll be replaced by other jobs. For example  there will be more jobs for data scientists. Well  not really. It doesn't take data scientists  very long to build these things. For example  these four algorithms were all built by the same guy. So if you think  oh   it's all happened before  we've seen the results in the past of when new things come along and they get replaced by new jobs  what are these new jobs going to be  It's very hard for us to estimate this  because human performance grows at this gradual rate  but we now have a system  deep learning  that we know actually grows in capability exponentially. And we're here. So currently  we see the things around us and we say   Oh  computers are still pretty dumb.  Right  But in five years' time  computers will be off this chart. So we need to be starting to think about this capability right now. We have seen this once before  of course. In the Industrial Revolution  we saw a step change in capability thanks to engines. The thing is  though  that after a while  things flattened out. There was social disruption  but once engines were used  to generate power in all the situations  things really settled down. The Machine Learning Revolution is going to be very different from the Industrial Revolution  because the Machine Learning Revolution  it never settles down. The better computers get at intellectual activities  the more they can build better computers to be better at intellectual capabilities  so this is going to be a kind of change that the world has actually never experienced before  so your previous understanding of what's possible is different. This is already impacting us. In the last    years  as capital productivity has increased  labor productivity has been flat  in fact even a little bit down. So I want us to start having this discussion now. I know that when I often tell people about this situation  people can be quite dismissive. Well  computers can't really think  they don't emote  they don't understand poetry  we don't really understand how they work. So what  Computers right now can do the things that humans spend most of their time being paid to do  so now's the time to start thinking about how we're going to adjust our social structures and economic structures to be aware of this new reality. Thank you. The power of yet. I heard about a high school in Chicago where students had to pass a certain number of courses to graduate  and if they didn't pass a course  they got the grade  Not Yet.  And I thought that was fantastic  because if you get a failing grade  you think  I'm nothing  I'm nowhere. But if you get the grade  Not Yet  you understand that you're on a learning curve. It gives you a path into the future.  Not Yet  also gave me insight into a critical event early in my career  a real turning point. I wanted to see how children coped  with challenge and difficulty  so I gave    year olds problems that were slightly too hard for them. Some of them reacted in a shockingly positive way. They said things like   I love a challenge   or   You know  I was hoping this would be informative.  They understood that their abilities could be developed. They had what I call a growth mindset. But other students felt it was tragic  catastrophic. From their more fixed mindset perspective  their intelligence had been  up for judgment and they failed. Instead of luxuriating in the power of yet  they were gripped in the tyranny of now. So what do they do next  I'll tell you what they do next. In one study  they told us they would probably cheat the next time instead of studying more if they failed a test. In another study  after a failure  they looked for someone who did worse than they did so they could feel really good about themselves. And in study after study  they have run from difficulty. Scientists measured the electrical activity from the brain as students confronted an error. On the left  you see the fixed mindset students. There's hardly any activity. They run from the error. They don't engage with it. But on the right  you have the students with the growth mindset  the idea that abilities can be developed. They engage deeply. Their brain is on fire with yet. They engage deeply. They process the error. They learn from it and they correct it. How are we raising our children  Are we raising them for now instead of yet  Are we raising kids who are obsessed with getting A's  Are we raising kids who don't know how to dream big dreams  Their biggest goal is getting the next A or the next test score  And are they carrying this need for constant validation with them into their future lives  Maybe  because employers are coming to me and saying  we have already raised a generation of young workers who can't get through the day without an award. So what can we do  How can we build that bridge to yet  Here are some things we can do. First of all  we can praise wisely  not praising intelligence or talent. That has failed. Don't do that anymore. But praising the process that kids engage in  their effort  their strategies  their focus  their perseverance  their improvement. This process praise creates kids who are hardy and resilient. There are other ways to reward yet. We recently teamed up with game scientists from the University of Washington to create a new online math game that rewarded yet. In this game  students were rewarded for effort  strategy and progress. The usual math game rewards you for getting answers right right now  but this game rewarded process. And we got more effort  more strategies  more engagement over longer periods of time  and more perseverance when they hit really  really hard problems. Just the words  yet  or  not yet   we're finding  give kids greater confidence  give them a path into the future that creates greater persistence. And we can actually change students' mindsets. In one study  we taught them that every time they push out of their comfort zone to learn something new and difficult  the neurons in their brain can form new  stronger connections  and over time they can get smarter. Look what happened  in this study  students who were not taught this growth mindset continued to show declining grades over this difficult school transition  but those who were taught this lesson showed a sharp rebound in their grades. We have shown this now  this kind of improvement  with thousands and thousands of kids  especially struggling students. So let's talk about equality. In our country  there are groups of students who chronically underperform  for example  children in inner cities  or children on  Native American reservations. And they've done so poorly for so long that many people think it's inevitable. But when educators create growth mindset classrooms steeped in yet  equality happens. And here are just a few examples. In one year  a kindergarten class in Harlem  New York scored in the   th percentile on the National Achievement Test. Many of those kids could not hold a pencil when they arrived at school. In one year  fourth grade students  in the South Bronx  way behind  became the number one fourth grade class in the state of New York on the state math test. In a year to a year and a half  Native American students in a school on a reservation went from the bottom of their district to the top  and that district included affluent sections of Seattle. So the native kids outdid the Microsoft kids. This happened because the meaning of effort and difficulty were transformed. Before  effort and difficulty made them feel dumb  made them feel like giving up  but now  effort and difficulty  that's when their neurons are making new connections  stronger connections. That's when they're getting smarter. I received a letter recently from a    year old boy. He said   Dear Professor Dweck  I appreciate that your writing is based on solid scientific research  and that's why I decided to put it into practice. I put more effort into my schoolwork  into my relationship with my family  and into my relationship with kids at school  and I experienced great improvement in all of those areas. I now realize I've wasted most of my life.  Let's not waste any more lives  because once we know that abilities are capable of such growth  it becomes a basic human right for children  all children  to live in places that create that growth  to live in places filled with yet. Thank you. Has anyone among you ever been exposed to tear gas  Tear gas  Anyone  I'm sorry to hear that  so you might know that it's a very toxic substance  but you might not know that it's a very simple molecule with an unpronouncable name  it's called chlorobenzalmalononitrile. I made it. It's decades old  but it's becoming very trendy among police forces around the planet lately  it seems  and according to my experience as a non voluntary breather of it  tear gas has two main but quite opposite effects. One  it can really burn your eyes  and two  it can also help you to open them. Tear gas definitely helped to open mine to something that I want to share with you this afternoon  that livestreaming the power of independent broadcasts through the web can be a game changer in journalism  in activism  and as I see it  in the political discourse as well. That idea started  to dawn on me in early      when I was covering a protest in S o Paulo. It was the marijuana march  a gathering of people asking for the legalization of cannabis. When that group started to move  the riot police came from the back with rubber bullets  bombs  and then the gas. But to make a long story short  I had entered that protest as the editor in chief of a well established printed magazine where I'd worked for    years  and thanks to this unsolicited effects of tear gas  I left it as a journalist that was now committed to new ways of sharing the raw experience of what it's like to be there  actually. So in the following week  I was back in the streets  but that time  I wasn't a member of any media outlet anymore. I was there as an independent livestreamer  and all I had with me was basically borrowed equipment. I had a very simple camera and a backpack with  G modems. And I had this weblink that could be shared through social media  could be put in any website  and that time  the protest went along fine. There was no violence. There was no action scenes. But there was something really exciting  because I could see at a distance the TV channels covering it  and they had these big vans and the teams and the cameras  and I was basically doing the same thing and all I had was a backpack. And that was really exciting to a journalist  but the most interesting part was when I got back home  actually  because I learned that I had been watched by more than        people  and I got hundreds of emails and messages of people asking me  basically  how did I do it  how it was possible to do such a thing. And I learned something else  that that was actually the first time that somebody had ever done a livestreaming in a street protest in the country. And that really shocked me  because I was no geek  I was no technology guy  and all the equipment needed was already there  was easily available. And I realized that we had a frontier here  a very important one  that it was just a matter of changing the perspective  and the web could be actually used  already used  as a colossal and uncontrollable and highly anarchical TV channel  TV network  and anyone with very basic skills and very basic equipment  even someone like me who had this little stuttering issue  so if it happens  bear with me please  even someone like me could become a broadcaster. And that sounded revolutionary in my mind. So for the next couple of years  I started to experiment with livestreaming in different ways  not only in the streets but mostly in studios and in homes  until the beginning of       last year  when I became the cofounder of a group called M dia NINJA. NINJA is an acronym that stands for Narrativas Independentes  Jornalismo e A  o  or in English  independent narratives  journalism  and action. It was a media group that had little media plan. We didn't have any financial structure. We were not planning to make money out of this  which was wise  because you shouldn't try to make money out of journalism now. But we had a very solid and clear conviction  that we knew that the hyperconnected environment of social media could maybe allow us to consolidate a network of experimental journalists throughout the country. So we launched a Facebook page first  and then a manifesto  and started to cover the streets in a very simple way. But then something happened  something that wasn't predicted  that no one could have anticipated. Street protests started to erupt in S o Paulo. They began as very local and specific. They were against the bus fare hike that had just happened in the city. This is a bus. It's written there   Theft.  But those kind of manifestations started to grow  and they kept happening. So the police violence against them started to grow as well. But there was another conflict  the one I believe that's more important here to make my point that it was a narrative conflict. There was this mainstream media version of the facts that anyone who was on the streets could easily challenge if they presented their own vision of what was actually happening there. And it was this clash of visions  this clash of narratives  that I think turned those protests into a long period in the country of political reckoning where hundreds of thousands of people  probably more than a million people took to the streets in the whole country. But it wasn't about the bus fare hike anymore. It was about everything. The people's demands  their expectations  the reasons why they were on the streets could be as diverse as they could be contradictory in many cases. If you could read it  you would understand me. But it was in this environment of political catharsis that the country was going through that it had to do with politics  indeed  but it had to do also with a new way of organizing  through a new way of communicating. It was in that environment that M dia NINJA emerged from almost anonymity to become a national phenomenon  because we did have the right equipment. We are not using big cameras. We are using basically this. We are using smartphones. And that  actually  allowed us to become invisible in the middle of the protests  but it allowed us to do something else  to show what it was like to be in the protests  to present to people at home a subjective perspective. But there was something that is more important  I think  than the equipment. It was our mindset  because we are not behaving as a media outlet. We are not competing for news. We are trying to encourage people  to invite people  and to actually teach people how to do this  how they also could become broadcasters. And that was crucial to turn M dia NINJA from a small group of people  and in a matter of weeks  we multiplied and we grew exponentially throughout the country. So in a matter of a week or two  as the protests kept happening  we were hundreds of young people connected in this network throughout the country. We were covering more than    cities at the same time. That's something that no TV channel could ever do. That was responsible for turning us suddenly  actually  into kind of the mainstream media of social media. So we had a couple of thousands of followers on our Facebook page  and soon we had a quarter of a million followers. Our posts and our videos were being seen by more than    million timelines a week. It was way more than any newspaper or any magazine could ever do. And that turned M dia NINJA into something else  more than a media outlet  than a media project. It became almost like a public service to the citizen  to the protester  to the activist  because they had a very simple and efficient and peaceful tool to confront both police and media authority. Many of our images started  to be used in regular TV channels. Our livestreams started to be broadcast even in regular televisions when things got really rough. Some our images were responsible to take some people out of jail  people who were being arrested unfairly under false accusations  and we could prove them innocent. And that also turned M dia NINJA very soon to be seen as almost an enemy of cops  unfortunately  and we started to be severely beaten  and eventually arrested on the streets. It happened in many cases. But that was also useful  because we were still at the web  so that helped to trigger an important debate in the country on the role of the media itself and the state of the freedom of the press in the country. So M dia NINJA now evolved and finally consolidated itself in what we hoped it would become  a national network of hundreds of young people  self organizing themselves locally to cover social  human rights issues  and expressing themselves not only politically but journalistically. What I started to do in the beginning of this year  as M dia NINJA is already a self organizing network  I'm dedicating myself to another project. It's called Fluxo  which is Portuguese for  stream.  It's a journalism studio in S o Paulo downtown  where I used livestream to experiment with what I call post television formats. But I'm also trying to come up with ways to finance independent journalism through a direct relationship with an audience  with an active audience  because now I really want to try to make a living out of my tear gas resolution back then. But there's something more significant here  something that I believe is more important and more crucial than my personal example. I said that livestream could turn the web into a colossal TV network  but I believe it does something else  because after watching people using it  not only to cover things but to express  to organize themselves politically  I believe livestream can turn cyberspace into a global political arena where everyone might have a voice  a proper voice  because livestream takes the monopoly of the broadcast political discourse  of the verbal aspect of the political dialogue out of the mouths of just politicians and political pundits alone  and it empowers the citizen through this direct and non mediated power of exchanging experiences and dialogue  empowers them to question and to influence authorities in ways in which we are about to see. And I believe it does something else that might be even more important  that the simplicity of the technology can merge objectivity and subjectivity in a very political way  as I see it  because it really helps the audience  the citizen  to see the world through somebody else's eye  so it helps the citizen to put him  or herself in other people's place. And that idea  I think   should be the intention  should be the goal of any good journalism  any good activism  but most of all  any good politics. Thank you very much. It was an honor. Our world has many superheroes. But they have the worst of all superpowers  invisibility. For example  the catadores  workers who collect recyclable  materials for a living. Catadores emerged from  social inequality  unemployment  and the abundance of solid waste from the deficiency of the  waste collection system. Catadores provide a heavy   honest and essential work that benefits the entire population. But they are not acknowledged for it. Here in Brazil  they collect    percent of all the waste that's actually recycled. Most of the catadores work independently  picking waste from the streets and  selling to junk yards at very low prices. They may collect over     kilos in their bags  shopping carts   bicycles and carro as. Carro as are carts built from wood or metal and found in several streets in Brazil  much like graffiti and street art. And this is how I first met these  marginalized superheroes. I am a graffiti artist and activist and my art is social  environmental  and political in nature. In       I took my work beyond walls and onto the carro as  as a new urban support for my message. But at this time   giving voice to the catadores. By adding art and humor to the cause  it became more appealing  which helped call attention  to the catadores and improve their self esteem. And also  they are famous now  on the streets  on mass media and social. So  the thing is  I plunged into this universe  and have not stopped working since. I have painted over      carro as in many cities and have been invited to do exhibitions  and trips worldwide. And then I realized that catadores  in their invisibility  are not exclusive to Brazil. I met them in Argentina  Chile  Bolivia  South Africa  Turkey and even in developed countries such as the United States and Japan. And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people join the cause because it's a big challenge. And then  I created a collaborative  movement called Pimp My Carro a    Thank you. So Pimp My Carro a is a large  crowdfunded event to help catadores and their carro as. Catadores are assisted by well being  professionals and healthcare  like physicians  dentists  podiatrists   hair stylists  massage therapists and much more. But also  they also receive safety shirts  gloves  raincoats and eyeglasses to see in high definition the city  while their carro as are renovated by our incredible volunteers. And then they receive safety items  too  reflective tapes  horns and mirrors. Then  finally  painted by a street artist and become part of part of this huge   amazing mobile art exhibition. Pimp My Carro a took to the streets of S o Paulo  Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba. But to meet the demand in other cities  including outside of Brazil  we have created Pimpx  which is inspired by TEDx  and it's a simplified  do it yourself  crowdfunded edition of Pimp My Carro a. So now everybody can join. In two years  over     catadores      volunteers and     street artists and more than       donors have been involved in the  Pimp My Carro a movement  whose actions have even been used in teaching recycling at a local school. So catadores are leaving  invisibility behind and becoming increasingly respected and valued. Because of their pimped carro as  they are able to fight back to prejudice  increase their income and  their interaction with society. So now  I'd like to challenge you  to start looking at and acknowledging the catadores and other  invisible superheroes from your city. Try to see the world as one   without boundaries or frontiers. Believe it or not  there are over    million  catadores worldwide. So next time you see one  recognize them as a vital part of our society. Muito obrigado  thank you. I'm a lexicographer. I make dictionaries. And my job as a lexicographer is to try to put all the words possible  into the dictionary. My job is not to decide what a word is  that is your job. Everybody who speaks English  decides together what's a word and what's not a word. Every language is just a group of people who agree to understand each other. Now  sometimes when people are trying  to decide whether a word is good or bad  they don't really have a good reason. So they say something like   Because grammar   I don't actually really care about grammar too much    don't tell anybody. But the word  grammar   actually  there are two kinds of grammar. There's the kind of grammar that lives inside your brain  and if you're a native  speaker of a language or a good speaker of a language  it's the unconscious rules that you follow when you speak that language. And this is what you learn when you learn a language as a child. And here's an example  This is a wug  right  It's a wug. Now there is another one. There are two of these. There are two ... Audience  Wugs. Erin McKean  Exactly  You know  how to make the plural of wug. That rule lives in your brain. You never had to be taught this rule   you just understand it. This is an experiment that was invented by a professor at  Boston University  named Jean Berko Gleason back in     . So we've been talking about this  for a long time. Now  these kinds of natural rules  that exist in your brain  they're not like traffic laws  they're more like laws of nature. And nobody has to remind you to obey  a law of nature  right  When you leave the house in the morning   your mom doesn't say   Hey  honey  I think it's going to be cold  take a hoodie  don't forget to obey the law of gravity.  Nobody says this. Now  there are other rules that are more about manners than they are about nature. So you can think of a word as like a hat. Once you know how hats work  nobody has to tell you    Don't wear hats on your feet.  What they have to tell you is    Can you wear hats inside  Who gets to wear a hat  What are the kinds of hats you get to wear   Those are more of the second kind  of grammar  which linguists often call usage   as opposed to grammar. Now  sometimes people use this kind of  rules based grammar to discourage people from making up words. And I think that is  well  stupid. So  for example   people are always telling you   Be creative  make new music  do art   invent things  science and technology.  But when it comes to  words  they're like   Don't  No. Creativity stops right here  whippersnappers. Give it a rest.  But that makes no sense to me. Words are great. We should have more of them. I want you to make as many new words as possible. And I'm going to tell you six ways that you can use to make new words in English. The first way is the simplest way. Basically  steal them from other  languages.   Go rob other people    Laughter  Linguists call this borrowing  but we never give the words back   so I'm just going to be honest and call it stealing. We usually take words for things  that we like  like delicious food. We took  kumquat  from Chinese  we took  caramel  from French. We also take words  for cool things like  ninja   right  We took that from Japanese  which is kind of a cool trick because  ninjas are hard to steal from. So another way that you  can make words in English is by squishing two  other English words together. This is called compounding. Words in English are like Lego  If you use enough force   you can put any two of them together. We do this all the time in English  Words like  heartbroken    bookworm     sandcastle  all are compounds. So go ahead and make words like  duckface   just don't make duckface. Another way that you can make words  in English is kind of like compounding  but instead you use so much force when you squish the words together that some parts fall off. So these are blend words  like  brunch  is a blend  of  breakfast  and  lunch.   Motel  is a blend of  motor  and  hotel.  Who here knew that  motel   was a blend word  Yeah  that word is so old in English that lots of people don't know that  there are parts missing.  Edutainment  is a blend  of  education  and  entertainment.  And of course   electrocute  is a blend of  electric  and  execute.  You can also make words by changing how they operate. This is called functional shift. You take a word that acts  as one part of speech  and you change it into another  part of speech. Okay  who here knew that  friend  hasn't always been a verb   Friend  used to be noun  and then we verbed it. Almost any word in English can be verbed. You can also take adjectives  and make them into nouns.  Commercial  used to be an adjective  and now it's a noun. And of course  you can  green  things. Another way to make words in English is back formation. You can take a word and you can kind of squish it down a little bit. So for example  in English we had the word  editor  before we had the word  edit.   Edit  was formed from  editor.  Sometimes these back formations  sound a little silly  Bulldozers bulldoze  butlers butle  and burglers burgle. Another way to make words in English is to take the first letters of something and squish them together. So National Aeronautics and Space  Administration becomes NASA. And of course you can do this  with anything  OMG  So it doesn't matter how silly  the words are. They can be really good words of English.  Absquatulate  is a perfectly  good word of English.  Mugwump  is a perfectly  good word of English. So the words don't have have to sound  normal  they can sound really silly. Why should you make words  You should make words because every word is a chance to express your idea and get  your meaning across. And new words grab people's attention. They get people to focus on what  you're saying and that gives you a better chance to get  your meaning across. A lot of people  on this stage today have said   In the future  you can do this  you can help with this  you can  help us explore  you can help us invent.  You can make a new word right now. English has no age limit. Go ahead  start making words today  send them to me  and I will put them  in my online dictionary  Wordnik. Thank you so much. So over the past few centuries  microscopes have revolutionized our world. They revealed to us a tiny world of objects  life and structures that are too small for us to see with our naked eyes. They are a tremendous contribution to science and technology. Today I'd like to introduce you to a new type of microscope  a microscope for changes. It doesn't use optics like a regular microscope to make small objects bigger  but instead it uses a video camera and image processing to reveal to us the tiniest motions and color changes in objects and people  changes that are impossible for us to see with our naked eyes. And it lets us look at our world in a completely new way. So what do I mean by color changes  Our skin  for example  changes its color very slightly when the blood flows under it. That change is incredibly subtle  which is why  when you look at other people  when you look at the person sitting next to you  you don't see their skin or their face changing color. When we look at this video of Steve here  it appears to us like a static picture  but once we look at this video through our new  special microscope  suddenly we see a completely different image. What you see here are small changes in the color of Steve's skin  magnified     times so that they become visible. We can actually see a human pulse. We can see how fast Steve's heart is beating  but we can also see the actual way that the blood flows in his face. And we can do that not just to visualize the pulse  but also to actually  recover our heart rates  and measure our heart rates. And we can do it with regular cameras and without touching the patients. So here you see the pulse and heart rate we extracted from a neonatal baby from a video we took with a regular DSLR camera  and the heart rate measurement we get is as accurate as the one you'd get with a standard monitor in a hospital. And it doesn't even have to be a video we recorded. We can do it essentially with other videos as well. So I just took a short clip from  Batman Begins  here just to show Christian Bale's pulse. And you know  presumably he's wearing makeup  the lighting here is kind of challenging  but still  just from the video  we're able to extract his pulse and show it quite well. So how do we do all that  We basically analyze the changes in the light that are recorded at every pixel in the video over time  and then we crank up those changes. We make them bigger so that we can see them. The tricky part is that those signals  those changes that we're after  are extremely subtle  so we have to be very careful when you try to separate them from noise that always exists in videos. So we use some clever image processing techniques to get a very accurate measurement of the color at each pixel in the video  and then the way the color changes over time  and then we amplify those changes. We make them bigger to create those types of enhanced videos  or magnified videos  that actually show us those changes. But it turns out we can do that not just to show tiny changes in color  but also tiny motions  and that's because the light that gets recorded in our cameras will change not only if the color of the object changes  but also if the object moves. So this is my daughter when she was about two months old. It's a video I recorded about three years ago. And as new parents  we all want to make sure our babies are healthy  that they're breathing  that they're alive  of course. So I too got one of those baby monitors so that I could see my daughter when she was asleep. And this is pretty much what you'll see with a standard baby monitor. You can see the baby's sleeping  but  there's not too much information there. There's not too much we can see. Wouldn't it be better  or more informative  or more useful  if instead we could look at the view like this. So here I took the motions and I magnified them    times  and then I could clearly see that my daughter was indeed alive and breathing. Here is a side by side comparison. So again  in the source video  in the original video  there's not too much we can see  but once we magnify the motions  the breathing becomes much more visible. And it turns out  there's a lot of phenomena we can reveal and magnify with our new motion microscope. We can see how our veins and arteries are pulsing in our bodies. We can see that our eyes are constantly moving in this wobbly motion. And that's actually my eye  and again this video was taken right after my daughter was born  so you can see I wasn't getting too much sleep.  Laughter  Even when a person is sitting still  there's a lot of information we can extract about their breathing patterns  small facial expressions. Maybe we could use those motions to tell us something about our thoughts or our emotions. We can also magnify small mechanical movements  like vibrations in engines  that can help engineers detect and diagnose machinery problems  or see how our buildings and structures sway in the wind and react to forces. Those are all things that our society knows how to measure in various ways  but measuring those motions is one thing  and actually seeing those motions as they happen is a whole different thing. And ever since we discovered this new technology  we made our code available online so that  others could use and experiment with it. It's very simple to use. It can work on your own videos. Our collaborators at Quanta Research even created this nice website where you can upload your videos and process them online  so even if you don't have any experience in computer science or programming  you can still very easily experiment with this new microscope. And I'd like to show you just a couple of examples of what others have done with it. So this video was made by a YouTube user called Tamez  . I don't know who that user is  but he  or she  used our code to magnify small belly movements during pregnancy. It's kind of creepy. People have used it to magnify pulsing veins in their hands. And you know it's not real science unless you use guinea pigs  and apparently this guinea pig is called Tiffany  and this YouTube user claims it is the first rodent on Earth that was motion magnified. You can also do some art with it. So this video was sent to me by a design student at Yale. She wanted to see if there's any difference in the way her classmates move. She made them all stand still  and then magnified their motions. It's like seeing  still pictures come to life. And the nice thing with  all those examples is that we had nothing to do with them. We just provided this new tool  a new way to look at the world  and then people find other interesting  new and creative ways of using it. But we didn't stop there. This tool not only allows us to look at the world in a new way  it also redefines what we can do and pushes the limits of what we can do with our cameras. So as scientists  we started wondering  what other types of physical phenomena produce tiny motions that we could now use our cameras to measure  And one such phenomenon that we focused on recently is sound. Sound  as we all know  is basically changes in air pressure that travel through the air. Those pressure waves hit objects and they create small vibrations in them  which is how we hear and how we record sound. But it turns out that sound also produces visual motions. Those are motions that are not visible to us but are visible to a camera with the right processing. So here are two examples. This is me demonstrating my great singing skills. And I took a high speed video of my throat while I was humming. Again  if you stare at that video  there's not too much you'll be able to see  but once we magnify the motions     times  we can see all the motions and ripples in the neck that are involved in producing the sound. That signal is there in that video. We also know that singers can break a wine glass if they hit the correct note. So here  we're going to play a note that's in the resonance frequency of that glass through a loudspeaker that's next to it. Once we play that note and magnify the motions     times  we can very clearly see  how the glass vibrates and resonates in response to the sound. It's not something you're used to seeing every day. But this made us think. It gave us this crazy idea. Can we actually invert this process and recover sound from video by analyzing the tiny vibrations that sound waves create in objects  and essentially convert those back into the sounds that produced them. In this way  we can turn everyday objects into microphones. So that's exactly what we did. So here's an empty bag of chips that was lying on a table  and we're going to turn that  bag of chips into a microphone by filming it with a video camera and analyzing the tiny motions that sound waves create in it. So here's the sound that we played in the room. And this is a high speed video we recorded of that bag of chips. Again it's playing. There's no chance you'll be able to see anything going on in that video just by looking at it  but here's the sound we were able to recover just by analyzing the tiny motions in that video. I call it    Thank you. I call it the visual microphone. We actually extract audio signals from video signals. And just to give you a sense of the scale of the motions here  a pretty loud sound will cause that bag of chips to move less than a micrometer. That's one thousandth of a millimeter. That's how tiny the motions are that we are now able to pull out just by observing how light bounces off objects and gets recorded by our cameras. We can recover sounds from other objects  like plants. And we can recover speech as well. So here's a person speaking in a room. Voice  Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow  and everywhere that Mary went  that lamb was sure to go. Michael Rubinstein  And here's that speech again recovered just from this video of that same bag of chips. Voice  Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow  and everywhere that Mary went  that lamb was sure to go. MR  We used  Mary Had a Little Lamb  because those are said to be the first words that Thomas Edison spoke  into his phonograph in     . It was one of the first sound recording devices in history. It basically directed the sounds onto a diaphragm that vibrated a needle that essentially engraved the sound on tinfoil that was wrapped around the cylinder. Here's a demonstration of recording and  replaying sound with Edison's phonograph. Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow  and everywhere that Mary went  the lamb was sure to go. Testing  testing  one two three. Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow  and everywhere that Mary went  the lamb was sure to go. MR  And now      years later  we're able to get sound in pretty much similar quality but by just watching objects vibrate to sound with cameras  and we can even do that when the camera is    feet away from the object  behind soundproof glass. So this is the sound that we were  able to recover in that case. Voice  Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow  and everywhere that Mary went  the lamb was sure to go. MR  And of course  surveillance is the first application that comes to mind. But it might actually be useful for other things as well. Maybe in the future  we'll be able to use it  for example  to recover sound across space  because sound can't travel in space  but light can. We've only just begun exploring other possible uses for this new technology. It lets us see physical processes that we know are there but that we've never been able to see with our own eyes until now. This is our team. Everything I showed you today is a result of a collaboration with this great group of people you see here  and I encourage you and welcome you to check out our website  try it out yourself  and join us in exploring this world of tiny motions. Thank you.
