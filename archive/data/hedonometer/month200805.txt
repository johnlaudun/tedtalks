You know  one of the things that I'd like to say upfront is that I'm really here by accident. And what I mean    not at TED    that I'm    at this point in my life  truly my set of circumstances I would truly consider an accident. But what I'd like to talk to you about today is perhaps a way in which we could use technology to make those accidents happen often. Because I really think  when I look back at how I actually ended up in this accident  technology played a big role in that. So  what I'd like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself  because I'd like to put in context what I'm going to tell you. And I think you will see why the two greatest passions in my life today are children and education. And once I put that in context  I'd like to tell you a little bit about technology  why I believe technology is a tremendous enabler  a very powerful tool to help address some of these challenges. Then  about the initiative that Chris mentioned  that we decided to launch at AMD that we call   x  . And then I'll come back to the beginning  and tell you a little bit more    hopefully convince you    that I believe that in today's world  it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about  but to have a passion for something that is meaningful. So  with that in mind  first of all let me tell you  I'm one of five children. I'm the oldest  the other four are women. So I grew up in a family of women. I learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world. And  as you can imagine  if you can picture this  I was born in a very small village in Mexico  in  unfortunately  very poor surroundings  and my parents did not have a college education. But I was fortunate to be able to have one  and so were my four sisters. That kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of the emphasis that my parents placed on education. My parents were fanatics about learning  and I'll come back to that a little bit later. But one of the things that exposed me early to learning  and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child  was through a technology which is on the screen    is a Victrola. My father found that in a junkyard  and was able to repair it and make it work. And somehow    to this day  I frankly don't know how he was so aware of what was going on in the world    but  by inviting me to sit down with him when I was only a few years old  and playing records in this Victrola by Mozart  and he would tell me how Mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever  and how Claire de Lune  which was one of his favorites  was a real exposure to me to classical music. He explained to me about Johann Strauss  and how he created the waltzes that became so famous in the world. And would tell me a little bit about history too  when he'd play the      Overture by Tchaikovsky on this little Victrola  and he would tell me about Russia and all the things that were happening in Russia at those times and why this music  in some way  represented a little bit of that history. And even as a child  he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity. And perhaps to you this product may not look like high tech  but if you can imagine the time when this occurred    it was in the mid '  s    this was really  in his view  a pretty piece of high tech. Well  one of the things that is really critical to try to distill from that experience is that in addition to that  people ask me and say   Well  how did your parents treat you when you were a child   And I always said that they were really tough on me. And not tough in the sense that most people think of  where your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever. They were tough in the sense that  as I grew up  both my mother and father would always say to me  it's really important that you always remember two things. First of all  when you go to bed at night  you've got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt the day was a day which you contributed something  and that you did everything you could to do it the best way you could. And the second thing they said  and we trust you  that no matter where you are or where you go  you will always do the right thing. Now  I don't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids  but if you do  please trust me  it's the most pressure you can put on a child  to say       we trust you that you will always do the right thing. When I was out with my friends drinking beer  I always was very aware of those words       and very careful. One of the things that has happened with technology is that it can only be helpful if it is useful  of course  but it can only be helpful too if it's accessible  and it can only be helpful if it's affordable. And in today's world  being useful  affordable and accessible is not necessarily what happens in a lot of the technology that is done today. So  one of our passions in our company  and now one of my personal passions  is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful  accessible and affordable. And to me  that is very  very critical. Now  technology has changed a lot since the Victrola days. You know  we now have  of course  incredibly powerful computers. A tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the Internet. Although frankly speaking  we don't believe the Internet is the killer app. What we believe is that the Internet  frankly  is a connection of people and ideas. The Internet happens to be just the medium in which those people and ideas get connected. And the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome. And so  we believe that through all the changes that have occurred  that we're faced today with a tremendous opportunity. If we can connect people and ideas more intensely    and although you've seen a plethora and a myriad of products that have come to the market today  the key to me is how many of these products are able to provide people connectivity  in a useful way  accessibility  in an easy manner  and also affordability  that regardless of the economic status that a person could have  that they could have the opportunity to afford this technology. So  when you look at that  we said  well  we would like to  then  enable that a little bit. We would like to create an initiative. And a couple of years ago at AMD  we came up with this idea of saying  what if we create this initiative we call   x    where we are going to aim  that by the year       half of the world will be connected to the Internet so that people and ideas can get connected. We knew we couldn't do it by ourselves  and by no means did we ever intend to imply that we at AMD could do it alone. We always felt that this was something that could be done through partnerships with governments  industry  educational institutions  a myriad of other companies and  frankly  even competitors. So  it is really a rather lofty initiative  if you want to think that way  but we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead  that was bold enough and courageous enough that it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently. And I'll come back to that in a minute  because I think the results so far have been remarkable  and I can only anticipate and get real excited about what I think is going to happen in the next eight years  while we get to the      initiative. Where are we today  That's year by year. This comes from our friends at Gapminder.com. Those of you who've never looked at their website  you should look at it. It's really impressive. And you can see how the Internet penetration has changed over the years. And so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say well  where are we related to our goal towards       the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces. One is the Western world  defined mostly by Western Europe and the United States  has made an awful lot of progress. The connectivity in these parts of the world are really truly phenomenal and continue to increase. As a matter of fact  we think reaching     percent is very doable  even before the      timeframe. In other parts of emerging countries  such as India and China  the progress has been good    has been solid  has been good. But in places that are not as developed  places like Africa  Latin America and other places in the world  the progress has been rather slow. As a matter of fact  I was just recently visiting South Africa. I had the opportunity to have a discussion with President Mbeki  and one of the things that we talked about is  what is it that's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster  And one of the reasons is  in South Africa  it costs     dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity. It is impossible  even in the United States  for that cost  to be able to enable the connectivity that we're all trying to reach. So  we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down. So  when you look at this chart  you look at the very last    it's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale    you look at the very end  we've got quite a long way to go to get to the      goal of    percent. But we're excited in our company  we're motivated. We really think it's a phenomenal driver of things  to force us to do things differently  and we look forward to being able to actually  working with so many partners around the world  to be able to reach that goal. Now  one of the things I'd like to explain  about    x    which I think is really critical  is that it is not a charity. It is actually a business venture. Let's take a small segment of this  of this unconnected world  and call it the education market. When you look at elementary school children  we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world that could benefit tremendously from being able to be connected to the Internet. Therefore  when we see that  we see an opportunity to have a business that addresses the need of that segment. And when we embarked in this initiative  from the very beginning we said it very clearly  this is not a charity. This is really a business venture  one that addresses a very challenging segment of the market. Because what we have learned in the last three years is that this segment of the market  whether it's education or under developed nations  either way  it's a segment that demands incredibly high quality  incredibly high reliability  tremendous low cost and access  and a lot of challenges that frankly  without actually doing it  it would be very difficult to understand  and I'll explain that in just a minute. It is an initiative that is focused on simple  accessible and human centric solutions. What we mean by that is  you know  frankly  the PC was invented in       roughly speaking more or less  and for    odd years  it hasn't changed. It is still  in most places  a gray or black box  and it looks the same. And frankly    and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customers when I say this  but I truly mean it    if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it  it would be very difficult to judge who made it  because they're all highly commoditized but they're all different. So  there has not been a human centric approach to addressing this segment of the market  so we really believe it is critical to think of it. It reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning  about this operating room machinery that was designed specifically for Africa. We're talking about something very similar here. And it has to be based on a geo sensitive approach. What I mean by that is that in some parts of the world  the government plays a key role in the development of technology. In other parts  it doesn't. In other parts of the world  you have an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place. In other parts  it doesn't. And then we have to be sensitive about how this technology can be developed and put into action in those regions. And the last piece  which is really important    and this is an opinion that we have  not shared by many  this is one where we seem to stand alone  on this one    is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local  integrated  end to end ecosystems. What I mean by that  and let me use this example  the country of South Africa  because I was just there  therefore I'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have. It's a country of    million people. It's an economy that's emerging. It's beginning to grow tremendously. They have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity. They have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa. They're developing a software training environment in their universities. What a place  what an ideal place to create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software needed for their schools. And to my surprise  I learned in South Africa they have    dialects  I always thought they only had two    English and Afrikaans    but it turns out they have    dialects. And to be able to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system  it could only be done from inside. I don't think this segment of the market can be addressed by companies parachuting from another place of the world  and just dumping product and selling into the markets. So  we believe that in those regions of the world where the population is large  and there's an infrastructure that can provide it  that a local  integrated  end to end system is really critical for its success. This is a picture of a classroom that we outfitted with computers in Mexico  in my home country. This particular classroom happens to be in the state of Michoacan. Those of you that might be familiar with Mexico    Michoacan is a very colorful state. Children dress with very colorful  colorful clothes  and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids  in a computer. And I have to tell you that it's so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids. We just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the West Cape in South Africa  in a school that's called Nelson Mandela School  and when you see the faces and activities of these children being able to access computers  it's just phenomenal. And recently  they've written us letters  telling us how excited they are about the impact that this has had on their lives  on their educational dreams  on their capabilities  and it's just phenomenal. We have now deployed    different technologists in    different countries  and we have been able to connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn what this particular segment of the market needs and demands. And I have to tell you that although millions doesn't sound like a lot in terms of the billions that need to be connected  it's a start. And we are learning a lot. And we're learning a tremendous amount about what we believe this segment needs to be able to be effective. One example of this has been the One Laptop per Child. Some of you are familiar with this. This is a partnership between MIT and a group of companies    Google is involved  Red Hat    and AMD is a key player. The electronics behind the One Laptop per Child are based on AMD technology  it's a microprocessor. But to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be  one of the objectives of the One Laptop per Child is to be able to achieve a    hour battery life. Because it was felt that a school day would last at least eight hours  and you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop for at least one full day without having to recharge it. The engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part  and battery life on this product is now    hours    just through a lot of innovative work people have done because they're passionate and motivated to be able to do this. We expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year  and we're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer in the field of education. It's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market  not only in the developing countries  but actually in the developed regions as well  because there are parts of the United States where this can have also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient. We also have partnered with TED in this project  with Architecture for Humanity  and along with the TED Prize winner Cameron Sinclair  we're having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community to come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region. And we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this  and can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting  exciting activity. Let me come back to the beginning  to end this presentation. I'll tell you that one of the things that I feel is really critical for us in industry  in business  is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems. I don't think it's enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet  and look at numbers and say  yes  that's a good business. I really believe that you have to have a passion for it. And one of the things that I learned  too  from my parents    and I'll give you a little anecdote    especially from my father. And it took me a while to understand it  but he said to me  when I went to college  he said   You're the first person in the family to go to college. And it's really important you understand that for civilization to make progress  each generation has to do better than the last one. And therefore  this is your opportunity to do better than my generation.  Frankly  I don't know that I really understood what he told me at the time. I was eager to go off to college  and go find girls  and study  and girls  and study  but then I finished college and I fell in love. I graduated. I decided to get married. And on my wedding day  my father came to me again and said   You know  I'm going to remind you again  that each generation has to do better than the last one. You have to be a better husband than I was  because that's how you make progress.  And now he began to make sense. Because I knew what a great husband he was  and now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me  like he did when I was a little kid. And then a few years later  I had a child  my first child  and again  my father comes to the hospital  and we're looking at the glass  and see all the children on the other side  and he said   I've got to remind you again  that for each generation to do better  you're going to have to be a better father than I was.  That's when it dawned on me the tremendous challenge that he was placing on me  because he was a great father. But the key is that he instilled in me a passion to really get up every day in the morning and want to do better  to really get up and think that my role in life is not just to be the CEO of a Fortune     company. It's got to be that someday I can look back  and this place is truly better through some small contribution that perhaps each of us could make. Thank you very much. I love a challenge  and saving the Earth is probably a good one. We all know the Earth is in trouble. We have now entered in the  X  the sixth major extinction on this planet. I often wondered  if there was a United Organization of Organisms    otherwise known as  Uh Oh     would we be voted on the planet  or off the planet  I think that vote is occurring right now. I want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions  using fungi  and these solutions are based on mycelium. The mycelium infuses all landscapes  it holds soils together  it's extremely tenacious. This holds up to        times its mass. They're the grand molecular disassemblers of nature    the soil magicians. They generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth. We have now discovered that there is a multi directional transfer of nutrients between plants  mitigated by the mcyelium    so the mycelium is the mother that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees to hemlocks  cedars and Douglas firs. Dusty and I  we like to say  on Sunday  this is where we go to church. I'm in love with the old growth forest  and I'm a patriotic American because we have those. Most of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms. And frankly  I face a big obstacle. When I mention mushrooms to somebody  they immediately think Portobellos or magic mushrooms  their eyes glaze over  and they think I'm a little crazy. So  I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group. We call it mycophobia  the irrational fear of the unknown  when it comes to fungi. Mushrooms are very fast in their growth. Day     day     day   . Mushrooms produce strong antibiotics. In fact  we're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom. A group of    eukaryotic microbiologists published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta    a super kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together. We share in common the same pathogens. Fungi don't like to rot from bacteria  and so our best antibiotics come from fungi. But here is a mushroom that's past its prime. After they sporulate  they do rot. But I propose to you that the sequence of microbes that occur on rotting mushrooms are essential for the health of the forest. They give rise to the trees  they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium. And so we see a mushroom here sporulating. And the spores are germinating  and the mycelium forms and goes underground. In a single cubic inch of soil  there can be more than eight miles of these cells. My foot is covering approximately     miles of mycelium. This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey. And notice that as the mycelium grows  it conquers territory and then it begins the net. I've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years  I have thousands of electron micrographs  and when I'm staring at the mycelium  I realize that they are microfiltration membranes. We exhale carbon dioxide  so does mycelium. It inhales oxygen  just like we do. But these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs. And I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes. And in these cavities  these micro cavities form  and as they fuse soils  they absorb water. These are little wells. And inside these wells  then microbial communities begin to form. And so the spongy soil not only resists erosion  but sets up a microbial universe that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms. I first proposed  in the early     s  that mycelium is Earth's natural Internet. When you look at the mycelium  they're highly branched. And if there's one branch that is broken  then very quickly  because of the nodes of crossing    Internet engineers maybe call them hot points    there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information. The mycelium is sentient. It knows that you are there. When you walk across landscapes  it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris. So  I believe the invention of the computer Internet is an inevitable consequence of a previously proven  biologically successful model. The Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit  and we now  being the top organism on this planet  are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere. Going way out  dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype. I believe matter begets life  life becomes single cells  single cells become strings  strings become chains  chains network. And this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe. Most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land. They came to land  .  billion years ago  and plants followed several hundred million years later. How is that possible  It's possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids  and many other acids and enzymes  pockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals and forming calcium oxalates. Makes the rocks crumble  and the first step in the generation of soil. Oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together. So  fungi and mycelium sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates. And all sorts of other oxalates are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix. This was first discovered in     . This is a photograph by Franz Hueber. This photograph's taken     s in Saudi Arabia.     million years ago  this organism existed. It was called Prototaxites. Prototaxites  laying down  was about three feet tall. The tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet. Dr. Boyce  at the University of Chicago  published an article in the Journal of Geology this past year determining that Prototaxites was a giant fungus  a giant mushroom. Across the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms. All across most land masses. And these existed for tens of millions of years. Now  we've had several extinction events  and as we march forward       million years ago    most of you know about it    we had an asteroid impact. The Earth was struck by an asteroid  a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere. Sunlight was cut off  and fungi inherited the Earth. Those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded  because fungi do not need light. More recently  at Einstein University  they just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy  much like plants use light. So  the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere  I think  is a forgone conclusion  at least in my own mind. The largest organism in the world is in Eastern Oregon. I couldn't miss it. It was       acres in size        acres in size        years old. The largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat  one cell wall thick. How is it that this organism can be so large  and yet be one cell wall thick  whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us  The mycelium  in the right conditions  produces a mushroom    it bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt. We were involved with several experiments. I'm going to show you six  if I can  solutions for helping to save the world. Battelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham  Washington. There were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste  one was a control pile  one pile was treated with enzymes  one pile was treated with bacteria  and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium. The mycelium absorbs the oil. The mycelium is producing enzymes    peroxidases    that break carbon hydrogen bonds. These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together. So  the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil  and then  when we returned six weeks later  all the tarps were removed  all the other piles were dead  dark and stinky. We came back to our pile  it was covered with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms  and the color changed to a light form. The enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons into carbohydrates    fungal sugars. Some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms. They're very large. They're showing how much nutrition that they could've obtained. But something else happened  which was an epiphany in my life. They sporulated  the spores attract insects  the insects laid eggs  eggs became larvae. Birds then came  bringing in seeds  and our pile became an oasis of life. Whereas the other three piles were dead  dark and stinky  and the PAH's    the aromatic hydrocarbons    went from        parts per million to less than     in eight weeks. The last image we don't have. The entire pile was a green berm of life. These are gateway species  vanguard species that open the door for other biological communities. So I invented burlap sacks  bunker spawn    and putting the mycelium    using storm blown debris  you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm that's producing E. coli  or other wastes  or a factory with chemical toxins  and it leads to habitat restoration. So  we set up a site in Mason County  Washington  and we've seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms. And I'll show you a graph here. This is a logarithmic scale     to the eighth power. There's more than a     million colonies per gram  and    to the third power is around      . In    hours to    hours  these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria        times. Think of the implications. This is a space conservative method that uses storm debris    and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year. So  this one mushroom  in particular  has drawn our interest over time. This is my wife Dusty  with a mushroom called Fomitopsis officinalis    Agarikon. It's a mushroom exclusive to the old growth forest that Dioscorides first described in    A.D. as a treatment against consumption. This mushroom grows in Washington State  Oregon  northern California  British Columbia  now thought to be extinct in Europe. May not seem that large    let's get closer. This is extremely rare fungus. Our team    and we have a team of experts that go out    we went out    times in the old growth forest last year. We found one sample to be able to get into culture. Preserving the genome of these fungi in the old growth forest I think is absolutely critical for human health. I've been involved with the U.S. Defense Department BioShield program. We submitted over     samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water  and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites. And a few years ago  we received these results. We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms that were highly active against poxviruses. Dr. Earl Kern  who's a smallpox expert of the U.S. Defense Department  states that any compounds that have a selectivity index of two or more are active.    or greater are considered to be very active. Our mushroom strains were in the highly active range. There's a vetted press release that you can read    it's vetted by DOD    if you Google  Stamets  and  smallpox.  Or you can go to NPR.org and listen to a live interview. So  encouraged by this  naturally we went to flu viruses. And so  for the first time  I am showing this. We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms highly active against flu viruses. Here's the selectivity index numbers    against pox  you saw   s and   s    now against flu viruses  compared to the ribavirin controls  we have an extraordinarily high activity. And we're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical. We tried it against flu A viruses    H N   H N     as well as flu B viruses. So then we tried a blend  and in a blend combination we tried it against H N   and we got greater than       selectivity index. I then think that we can make the argument that we should save the old growth forest as a matter of national defense. I became interested in entomopathogenic fungi    fungi that kill insects. Our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants. So  I went to the EPA homepage  and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants  as well as termites. I did something that nobody else had done. I actually chased the mycelium  when it stopped producing spores. These are spores    this is in their spores. I was able to morph the culture into a non sporulating form. And so the industry has spent over     million dollars specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house. But the insects aren't stupid  and they would avoid the spores when they came close  and so I morphed the cultures into a non sporulating form. And I got my daughter's Barbie doll dish  I put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants were making debris fields  every day  in my house  and the ants were attracted to the mycelium  because there's no spores. They gave it to the queen. One week later  I had no sawdust piles whatsoever. And then    a delicate dance between dinner and death    the mycelium is consumed by the ants  they become mummified  and  boing  a mushroom pops out of their head. Now after sporulation  the spores repel. So  the house is no longer suitable for invasion. So  you have a near permanent solution for reinvasion of termites. And so my house came down  I received my first patent against carpenter ants  termites and fire ants. Then we tried extracts  and lo and behold  we can steer insects to different directions. This has huge implications. I then received my second patent    and this is a big one. It's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent. It covers over         species. This is the most disruptive technology    I've been told by executives of the pesticide industry    that they have ever witnessed. This could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world. You could fly     Ph.D. students under the umbrella of this concept  because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi  prior to sporulation  attract the very insects that are otherwise repelled by those spores. And so I came up with a Life Box  because I needed a delivery system. The Life Box    you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference    you add soil  you add water  you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores  like of the Agarikon mushroom. The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium. And then you put tree seeds in here  and then you end up growing    potentially    an old growth forest from a cardboard box. I want to reinvent the delivery system  and the use of cardboard around the world  so they become ecological footprints. If there's a YouTube like site that you could put up  you could make it interactive  zip code specific    where people could join together  and through satellite imaging systems  through Virtual Earth or Google Earth  you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered by the trees that are coming through Life Boxes. You could take a cardboard box delivering shoes  you could add water    I developed this for the refugee community    corns  beans and squash and onions. I took several containers    my wife said  if I could do this  anybody could    and I ended up growing a seed garden. Then you harvest the seeds    and thank you  Eric Rasmussen  for your help on this    and then you're harvesting the seed garden. Then you can harvest the kernels  and then you just need a few kernels. I add mycelium to it  and then I inoculate the corncobs. Now  three corncobs  no other grain    lots of mushrooms begin to form. Too many withdrawals from the carbon bank  and so this population will be shut down. But watch what happens here. The mushrooms then are harvested  but very importantly  the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars. And so I thought  how could we address the energy crisis in this country  And we came up with Econol. Generating ethanol from cellulose using mycelium as an intermediary    and you gain all the benefits that I've described to you already. But to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent  and I think that we need to be econologically intelligent about the generation of fuels. So  we build the carbon banks on the planet  renew the soils. These are a species that we need to join with. I think engaging mycelium can help save the world. Thank you very much. What I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter  and actually all the way down into the sewer because I want to talk about diarrhea. And in particular  I want to talk about the design of diarrhea. And when evolutionary biologists talk about design  they really mean design by natural selection. And that brings me to the title of the talk   Using Evolution to Design Disease Organisms Intelligently.  And I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this. But I'm not just doing this to be cute. I really think that this subtitle explains what somebody like me  who's sort of a Darwin wannabe  how they actually look at one's role in sort of coming into this field of health sciences and medicine. It's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists. You actually see a great potential  but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf  and may actually be very resistant  when one tries to introduce ideas. So  all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions. One is that  why are some disease organisms more harmful  And a very closely related question  which is  how can we take control of this situation once we understand the answer to the first question  How can we make the harmful organisms more mild  And I'm going to be talking  to begin with  as I said  about diarrheal disease organisms. And the focus when I'm talking about the diarrheal organisms  as well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms that cause acute infectious disease  is to think about the problem from a germ's point of view  germ's eye view. And in particular  to think about a fundamental idea which I think makes sense out of a tremendous amount of variation in the harmfulness of disease organisms. And that idea is that from the germ's eye point of view  disease organisms have to get from one host to another  and often they have to rely on the well being of the host to move them to another host. But not always. Sometimes  you get disease organisms that don't rely on host mobility at all for transmission. And when you have that  then evolutionary theory tells us that natural selection will favor the more exploitative  more predator like organisms. So  natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage. If instead transmission to another host requires host mobility  then we expect that the winners of the competition will be the milder organisms. So  if the pathogen doesn't need the host to be healthy and active  and actual selection favors pathogens that take advantage of those hosts  the winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts for their own reproductive success. But if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen  then it's the benign ones that tend to be the winners. So  I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases. Diarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways. They can be transmitted from person to person contact  person to food then to person contact  when somebody eats contaminated food  or they can be transmitted through the water. And when they're transmitted through the water  unlike the first two modes of transmission  these pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission. A person can be sick in bed and still infect tens  even hundreds of other individuals. To sort of illustrate that  this diagram emphasizes that if you've got a sick person in bed  somebody's going to be taking out the contaminated materials. They're going to wash those contaminated materials  and then the water may move into sources of drinking water. People will come in to those places where you've got contaminated drinking water  bring things back to the family  may drink right at that point. The whole point is that a person who can't move can still infect many other individuals. And so  the theory tells us that when diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water  we expect them to be more predator like  more harmful. And you can test these ideas. So  one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria  and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water  tend to be more harmful. And the answer is    yep  they are. Now I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs  but the main point here is that    there's a lot of them here  I can tell    the main point here is that those data points all show a very strong  positive association between the degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water  and how harmful they are  how much death they cause per untreated infection. So this suggests we're on the right track. But this  to me  suggests that we really need to ask some additional questions. Remember the second question that I raised at the outset was  how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evolve to be mild  Now  this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission  you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right hand side of that graph to the left hand side of the graph. But it doesn't tell you how long. I mean  if this would require thousands of years  then it's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens. But if it could occur in just a few years  then it might be a very important way to control some of the nasty problems that we haven't been able to control. In other words  this suggests that we could domesticate these organisms. We could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us. And so  as I was thinking about this  I focused on this organism  which is the El Tor biotype of the organism called Vibrio cholerae. And that is the species of organism that is responsible for causing cholera. And the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at is that we understand why it's so harmful. It's harmful because it produces a toxin  and that toxin is released when the organism gets into our intestinal tract. It causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine into the lumen  the internal chamber of our intestine  and then that fluid goes the only way it can  which is out the other end. And it flushes out thousands of different other competitors that would otherwise make life difficult for the Vibrios. So what happens  if you've got an organism  it produces a lot of toxin. After a few days of infection you end up having    the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine. It's sort of cloudy water. And if you took a drop of that water  you might find a million diarrheal organisms. If the organism produced a lot of toxin  you might find    million  or     million. If it didn't produce a lot of this toxin  then you might find a smaller number. So the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission  thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted by person to person contact  or person food person contact    both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission. Now  I can think of some possible experiments. One would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism    some that produce a lot of toxins  some that produce a little    and take those strains and spew them out in different countries. Some countries that might have clean water supplies  so that you can't get waterborne transmission  you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there. Other countries  in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission  there you expect these organisms to evolve towards a high level of harmfulness  right  There's a little ethical problem in this experiment. I was hoping to hear a few gasps at least. That makes me worry a little bit. But anyhow  the laughter makes me feel a little bit better. And this ethical problem's a big problem. Just to emphasize this  this is what we're really talking about. Here's a girl who's almost dead. She got rehydration therapy  she perked up  within a few days she was looking like a completely different person. So  we don't want to run an experiment like that. But interestingly  just that thing happened in     . In       this cholera organism got into Lima  Peru  and within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas. Now  I don't know how that happened  and I didn't have anything to do with it  I promise you. I don't think anybody knows  but I'm not averse to  once that's happened  to see whether or not the prediction that we would make  that I did make before  actually holds up. Did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile  which has some of the most well protected water supplies in Latin America  And did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador  which has some of the least well protected  And Peru's got something sort of in between. And so  with funding from the Bosack Kruger Foundation  I got a lot of strains from these different countries and we measured their toxin production in the lab. And we found that in Chile    within two months of the invasion of Peru you had strains entering Chile    and when you look at those strains  in the very far left hand side of this graph  you see a lot of variation in the toxin production. Each dot corresponds to an islet from a different person    a lot of variation on which natural selection can act. But the interesting point is  if you look over the     s  within a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild. They evolved to produce less toxin. And to just give you a sense of how important this might be  if we look in       we find that there's only one case of cholera  on average  reported from Chile every two years. So  it's controlled. That's how much we have in America  cholera that's acquired endemically  and we don't think we've got a problem here. They didn't    they solved the problem in Chile. But  before we get too confident  we'd better look at some of those other countries  and make sure that this organism doesn't just always evolve toward mildness. Well  in Peru it didn't. And in Ecuador    remember  this is the place where it has the highest potential waterborne transmission    it looked like it got more harmful. In every case there's a lot of variation  but something about the environment the people are living in  and I think the only realistic explanation is that it's the degree of waterborne transmission  favored the harmful strains in one place  and mild strains in another. So  this is very encouraging  it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow  if we had enough money  could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck. It would make these organisms evolve to mildness  so that even though people might be getting infected  they'd be infected with mild strains. It wouldn't be causing severe disease. But there's another really interesting aspect of this  and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence  evolution of harmfulness  then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance. And the idea is very simple. If you've got a harmful organism  a high proportion of the people are going to be symptomatic  a high proportion of the people are going to be going to get antibiotics. You've got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance  so you get increased virulence leading to the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance. And once you get increased antibiotic resistance  the antibiotics aren't knocking out the harmful strains anymore. So  you've got a higher level of virulence. So  you get this vicious cycle. The goal is to turn this around. If you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply  you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance. So  we can go to the same countries and look and see. Did Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance  whereas did Ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem  If we look in the beginning of the     s  we see  again  a lot of variation. In this case  on the Y axis  we've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity    and I won't go into that. But we've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity in Chile  Peru and Ecuador  and no trend across the years. But if we look at the end of the     s  just half a decade later  we see that in Ecuador they started having a resistance problem. Antibiotic sensitivity was going down. And in Chile  you still had antibiotic sensitivity. So  it looks like Chile dodged two bullets. They got the organism to evolve to mildness  and they got no development of antibiotic resistance. Now  these ideas should apply across the board  as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolved to virulence. And I want to give you just one more example  because we've talked a little bit about malaria. And the example I want to deal with is  or the idea I want to deal with  the question is  what can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness  Now  malaria's transmitted by a mosquito  and normally if you're infected with malaria  and you're feeling sick  it makes it even easier for the mosquito to bite you. And you can show  just by looking at data from literature  that vector borne diseases are more harmful than non vector borne diseases. But I think there's a really fascinating example of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this. In the case of waterborne transmission  we'd like to clean up the water supplies  see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness. In the case of malaria  what we'd like to do is mosquito proof houses. And the logic's a little more subtle here. If you mosquito proof houses  when people get sick  they're sitting in bed    or in mosquito proof hospitals  they're sitting in a hospital bed    and the mosquitoes can't get to them. So  if you're a harmful variant in a place where you've got mosquito proof housing  then you're a loser. The only pathogens that get transmitted are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough to walk outside and get mosquito bites. So  if you were to mosquito proof houses  you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness. And there's a really wonderful experiment that was done that suggests that we really should go ahead and do this. And that experiment was done in Northern Alabama. Just to give you a little perspective on this  I've given you a star at the intellectual center of the United States  which is right there in Louisville  Kentucky. And this really cool experiment was done about     miles south of there  in Northern Alabama  by the Tennessee Valley Authority. They had dammed up the Tennessee River. They'd caused the water to back up  they needed electric  hydroelectric power. And when you get stagnant water  you get mosquitoes. They found in the late '  s       years after they'd made these dams    that the people in Northern Alabama were infected with malaria  about a third to half of them were infected with malaria. This shows you the positions of some of these dams. OK  so the Tennessee Valley Authority was in a little bit of a bind. There wasn't DDT  there wasn't chloroquines  what do they do  Well  they decided to mosquito proof every house in Northern Alabama. So they did. They divided Northern Alabama into    zones  and within three years  about     dollars per house  they mosquito proofed every house. And these are the data. Every row across here represents one of those    zones. And the asterisks represent the time at which the mosquito proofing was complete. And so what you can see is that just the mosquito proofed housing  and nothing else  caused the eradication of malaria. And this was  incidentally  published in       in the leading textbook of malaria  called  Boyd's Malariology.  But almost no malaria experts even know it exists. This is important  because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities  you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses. Now  I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places. Like  you know  just as you get into the malaria zone  sub Saharan Africa. But as you move to really intense biting rate areas  like Nigeria  you're certainly not going to eradicate. But that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness. So to me  it's an experiment that's waiting to happen  and if it confirms the prediction  then we should have a very powerful tool. In a way  much more powerful than the kind of tools we're looking at  because most of what's being done today is to rely on things like anti malarial drugs. And we know that  although it's great to make those anti malarial drugs available at really low cost and high frequency  we know that when you make them highly available you're going to get resistance to those drugs. And so it's a short term solution. This is a long term solution. What I'm suggesting here is that we could get evolution working in the direction we want it to go  rather than always having to battle evolution as a problem that stymies our efforts to control the pathogen  for example with anti malarial drugs. So  this table I've given just to emphasize that I've only talked about two examples. But as I said earlier  this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases  and it ought to. Because when we're dealing with infectious diseases  we're dealing with living systems. We're dealing with living systems  we're dealing with systems that evolve. And so if you do something with those systems  they're going to evolve one way or another. And all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve  so that    we need to adjust our interventions to get the most bang for the intervention buck  so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go. So  I don't really have time to talk about those things  but I did want to put them up there  just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with. And this links up with a lot of the other ideas that have been talked about. So  for example  earlier today there was discussion of  how do you really lower sexual transmission of HIV  What this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how it will work. Will it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area  It may get lowered if we intervene in ways that encourage people to stay more faithful to partners  and so on. But the key thing is to figure out how to lower it  because if we lower it  we'll get an evolutionary change in the virus. And the data really do support this  that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness. And that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts. So the other thing I really like about this  besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension into the study of control of disease  is that often the kinds of interventions that you want  that it indicates should be done  are the kinds of interventions that people want anyhow. But people just haven't been able to justify the cost. So  this is the kind of thing I'm talking about. If we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water  then I think that we can say  let's push the effort into that aspect of the control  so that we can actually solve the problem  even though  if you just look at the frequency of infection  you would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough just by cleaning up water supply. Anyhow  I'll end that there  and thank you very much. I started juggling a long time ago  but long before that  I was a golfer  and that's what I was  a golfer. And as a golfer and as a kid  one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores  that I sort of lived my whole life  is process. And it's the process of learning things. One of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer  but he was lefty. And he had a real passion for golf  and he also created this whole mythology about Ben Hogan and various things. Well  I learned a lot about interesting things that I knew nothing about at the time  but grew to know stuff about. And that was the mythology of skill. So  one of the things that I love to do is to explore skill. And since Richard put me on this whole thing with music    I'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machover with the MIT Media Lab    it relates a lot to music. But Tod couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere  I'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought  or not. But I'm going to explore skill  and juggling  and basically visual music  I guess. OK  you can start the music  thanks. Thanks. Thank you. Now  juggling can be a lot of fun  play with skill and play with space  play with rhythm. And you can turn the mike on now. I'm going to do a couple of pieces. I do a big piece in a triangle and these are three sections from it. Part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands    because a lot of juggling is hand oriented    but using the rhythm of my body and feet  and controlling the balls with my feet. Thanks. Now  this next section was an attempt to explore space. You see  I think Richard said something about people that are against something. Well  a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff. Well  I kind of  from my childhood and golf and all that  it's a process of joining with forces. And so what I'd like to do is try to figure out how to join with the space through the technique. So juggling gravity    up  down. If you figure out what up and down really are  it's a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything  but then you add in sideways. Now  I look at it somewhat as a way    when you learn juggling what you learn is how to feel with your eyes  and see with your hands because you're not looking at your hands  you're looking at where the balls are or you're looking at the audience. So this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm  with the obvious reference to the feet  but it's also time    where the feet were  where the balls were. Thanks. So  visual music  rhythm and complexity. I'm going to build towards complexity now. Juggling three balls is simple and normal. Excuse me. We're jugglers  OK. And remember  you're transposing  you're getting into a subculture here. And juggling    the balls cross and all that. OK  if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines of different heights  but then hopefully even rhythm. And you can change the rhythm    good  Michael. You can change the rhythm  if you get out of the lights. OK  Change the rhythm  so it's even. Or you can go back and change the height. Now  skill. But you're boxed in  if you can only do it up and down that way. So  you've got to go after the space down there. OK  then you've got to combine them  because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you. And then you get crazy. Now  I'm actually going to ask you to try something  so you've got to pay attention. Complexity  if you spend enough time doing something  time slows down or your skill increases  so your perceptions change. It's learning skills    like being in a high speed car crash. Things slow down as you learn  as you learn  as you learn. You may not be able to affect it  it almost drifts on you. It goes. But that's the closest approximation I can have to it. So  complexity. Now  how many here are jugglers  OK  so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this. OK  And whoever laughed there    you understood it completely  right  No  it looks like a mess. It looks like a mess with a guy there  who's got his hands around that mess  OK. Well  that's what juggling is about  right  It's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand. All right. So  that's one way of doing it  which is five balls down. OK  Another way is the outside. And you could play with the rhythm. Same pattern. Make it faster and smaller. Make it wider. Make it narrower. Bring it back up. OK. It's done. Thanks. Now  what I wanted to get to is that you're all very bright  very tactile. I have no idea how computer oriented or three dimensionally oriented you are  but let's try something. OK  so since you all don't understand what the five ball pattern is  I'm going to give you a little clue. Enough of a clue  So  you get the pattern  right  OK. You're not getting off that easy. All right  Now  do me a favor  follow the ball that I ask you to follow. Green. Yellow. Pink. White. OK  you can do that  Yeah  OK. Now  let's actually learn something. Actually  let me put you in that area of learning  which is very insecure. You want to do it  Yeah  OK. Hands out in front of you. Palms up  together. What you're going to learn is this. OK  So what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it. Index finger  middle finger  ring  little. Little  ring  middle  index. And then open. Finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. A little bit faster. Finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. Finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. All right. A lot of different learning processes going on in here. One learning process that I see is this    OK. Another learning process that I see is this    OK. So  everybody take a deep breath in  breath out. OK. Now  one more time  and    finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. Open. Finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. OK. Shake your hands out. Now  I assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer. OK  So  what you're doing is  you're going la  la  la  and you're getting this. OK  So that's exactly what I'm going to ask you to do  but in a slightly different way. You're going to combine it. So what I want you to do is    fingers. I'll tell you what to do with your fingers  same thing. But I want you to do is also  with your eyes  is follow the colored ball that I ask you to follow. OK  Here we go. So  we're going to start off looking at the white ball    and I'm going to tell you which color  and I'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers. OK  So white ball and    finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. Pink. Finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. Green. Finger  finger  finger  finger. Yellow. Finger  finger  finger  pink or finger. Pink  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. All right. How did you do  Well  OK. The reason I wanted you to do this is because that's actually what most people face throughout their lives  a moment of learning  a moment of challenge. It's a moment that you can't make sense of. Why the hell should I learn this  OK  Does it really have anything to do with anything in my life  You know  I can't decipher    is it fun  Is it challenging  Am I supposed to cheat  You know  what are you supposed to do  You've got somebody up here who is the operative principle of doing that for his whole life. OK  Trying to figure that stuff out. But is it going to get you anywhere  It's just a moment. That's all it is  a moment. OK  I'm going to change the script for one second. Just let me do this. I don't need music for it. Talking about time in a moment. There's a piece that I recently developed which was all about that  a moment. And what I do as a creative artist is I develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects. What I've done for you here  I developed a lot of those tricks and I put the choreography together  but they're not original techniques. Now  I'm going to start showing you some original techniques that come from the work that I've developed. OK  So  a moment  how would you define a moment  Well  as a juggler  what I wanted to do was create something that was representational of a moment. Ahhh. All right  I'm going to get on my knees and do it. So  a moment. OK  And then  what I did as a juggler was say  OK  what can I do to make that something that is dependent on something else  another dynamic. So  a moment. Another moment. Excuse me  still getting there. A moment that travels. A moment    no  we'll try that again. It separates  and comes back together. Time. How can you look at time  And what do you dedicate it to  in exploring a particular thing  Well  obviously  there's something in here  and you can all have a guess as to what it is. There's a mystery. There's a mystery in the moment. And it has to settle. And then it's dependent on something else. And then it comes to rest. Just a little thing about time. Now  this has expanded into a much bigger piece  because I use ramps of different parabolas that I roll the balls on while I'm keeping time with this. But I just thought I'd talk about a moment. All right. OK. Can we show the video of the triangle  Are we ready to do that  Yes  This is the piece that I told you about. It's a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle. Thanks. The only thing I'll say about the last session is  you ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees at     miles an hour  The only other thing is  it was a real shock. I always drove motorcycles. And when I bought my first car  it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents' house. Interesting. Anyway  balance  constant movement to find an approach to stillness. Cheating. Balance  making up the rules so you can't cheat  so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body. To have a conversation with it. To speak. To listen. Hup. Now  it's dependent on rhythm  and keeping a center of balance. When it falls  going underneath. So  there's a rhythm to it. The rhythm can get much smaller. As your skill increases  you learn to find those tinier spaces  those tinier movements. Thanks. Now  I'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways  and also    oh  actually  if you're bored  not here  here's one use for it. You can go with the  Sticks One  music. Thanks. That has a certain kind of balance to it  which is all about plumb. I apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb  square and level. And they influenced that  and this next piece  which I'll do a little segment of.  Two Sticks   you can go with it. Thanks. Which is again exploring space  or the lines in space. Working with space and the lines in space in a different way. Oh  let's see here. So  I'll come back to that in a second. But working with one ball  now  what if you attach something to it  or change it. This is a little thing that I made because I really like the idea of curves and balls together. And then creating space and the rhythm of space  using the surface of the balls  the surface of the arms. Just a little toy. Which leads me to the next thing  which is    what have I got here  OK. All right. I'm actually leading up to something  the newest thing that I'm working on. This is not it. This is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape. Now  what I just did was I worked with the mathematics    the diameter and the circumference. Sometimes these pieces are mathematical  in that way that I look at a shape and say  what about if I use this and this and this. Sometimes what happens in life affects my choice of objects that I try to work with. The next piece that I'm going to do    which is the cylinders piece  if you want to get that up    it has to do with cylinder seals from about       years ago  which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay with all sorts of great designs. I love ceramics and all of that. It's a combination of that  the beauty of that  the shape  and the stories that were involved in it  as well as the fact that they protected the contents. The second influence on this piece came from recycling and looking into a tin can recycling bin and seeing all that beautiful emptiness. So  if you want to go with the music for cylinders. Talking about geometry and everything  if you take the circle and you split it in half    can you run  S Curve music   I'm going to do just a short version of it. Circles split in half and rotated  and mythology. Anyway  that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it  and I dance around a small stage so    two minutes  just to end  The latest piece that I'm working on    what I love is that I never know what I'm working on  why I'm working on it. They're not ideas  they're instincts. And the latest thing that I'm working on    is something really    I don't know what it is yet. And that's good. I like not to know for as long as possible. Well  because then it tells me the truth  instead of me imposing the truth. And what it is  is working with both positive and negative space but also with these curves. And what it involves  and I don't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not  but I'll do a little bit of it. It initially started off with me stacking these things  bunches of them  and then playing with the sense of space  of filling in the space. And then it started changing  and become folding on themselves. And then changing levels. Because my attempt is to make visual instruments  not to just make    I'll try one other thing. For work in three dimensions  with your perceptions of space and time. Now  I don't know exactly where it's going  but I've got a bit of effort involved in this thing. And it's going to change as I go through it. But I really like it  it feels right. This may not be the right shape  and    look at this shape  and then I'll show you the first design I ever put to it  just to see  just to play  because I love all different kinds of things to play with. Let's see here. To work with the positive and negative in a different way. And to change  and to change. So  I'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space. We'll see what I come up with. Thanks for having me. How many of you have seen the Alfred Hitchcock film  The Birds   Any of you get really freaked out by that  You might want to leave now. So  this is a vending machine for crows. And over the past few days  many of you have been asking me   How did you come to this  How did you get started doing this   And it started  as with many great ideas  or many ideas you can't get rid of anyway  at a cocktail party. About    years ago  I was at a cocktail party with a friend of mine  and we're sitting there  and he was complaining about the crows that he had seen that were all over his yard and making a big mess. And he was telling me that really  we ought to try and eradicate these things. We gotta kill them because they're making a mess. I said that was stupid  you know  maybe we should just train them to do something useful. And he said that was impossible. And I'm sure I'm in good company in finding that tremendously annoying    when someone tells you it's impossible. So  I spent the next    years reading about crows in my spare time. And after    years of this  my wife eventually said   Look  you know  you gotta do this thing you've been talking about  and build the vending machine.  So I did. But part of the reason that I found this interesting is that I started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion  and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living    that are surviving. And I'm talking specifically about synanthropic species  which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies  species like rats and cockroaches and crows. And as I started looking at them  I was finding that they had hyper adapted. They'd become extremely adept at living with us. And in return  we just tried to kill them all the time. And in doing so  we were breeding them for parasitism. We were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways. So  for example  rats are incredibly responsive breeders. And cockroaches  as anyone who's tried to get rid of them knows  have become really immune to the poisons that we're using. So  I thought  let's build something that's mutually beneficial. Well  then let's build something that we can both benefit from  and find some way to make a new relationship with these species. And so I built the vending machine. But the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting if you know more about crows. It turns out that crows aren't just surviving with human beings    they're actually really thriving. They're found everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic and the southern tip of South America. And in all that area  they're only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings. So we may not think about them  but they're always around. And not surprisingly  given the human population growth  more than half of the human population is living in cities now. And out of those  nine tenths of the human growth population is occurring in cities. We're seeing a population boom with crows. So bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers. So that's no great surprise. But what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way. And I'll give you an example of that. So this is Betty. She's a New Caledonian crow. And these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood. Here  she's trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube. But the researchers had a problem. They messed up and left just a stick of wire in there. And she hadn't had the opportunity to do this before. You see  it wasn't working very well. So she adapted. Now this is completely unprompted. She had never seen this done before. No one taught her to bend this into a hook  had shown her how it could happen. But she did it all on her own. So keep in mind that she's never seen this done. Right. Yeah. All right. That's the part where the researchers freak out. So  it turns out we've been finding more and more that crows are really  really intelligent. Their brains are proportionate  in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are. There are all kinds of anecdotes for different kinds of intelligence they have. For example  in Sweden  crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice. And when the fishermen move off  the crows fly down  reel up the lines  and eat the fish or the bait. It's pretty annoying for the fishermen. On an entirely different tack  at University of Washington  they  a few years ago  were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus. Some students went out and netted some crows  brought them in  and were    weighed them  and measured them and whatnot  and then let them back out again. And were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week  these crows  whenever these particular students walked around campus  these crows would caw at them  and run around and make their life kind of miserable. They were significantly less entertained when this went on for the next week. And the next month. And after summer break. Until they finally graduated and left campus  and    glad to get away  I'm sure    came back sometime later  and found the crows still remembered them. So    the moral being  don't piss off crows. So now  students at the University of Washington that are studying these crows do so with a giant wig and a big mask. It's fairly interesting. So we know that these crows are really smart  but the more I dug into this  the more I found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation. Video  Crows have become highly skilled at making a living in these new urban environments. In this Japanese city  they have devised a way of eating a food that normally they can't manage  drop it among the traffic. The problem now is collecting the bits  without getting run over. Wait for the light to stop the traffic. Then  collect your cracked nut in safety. Joshua Klein  Yeah  yeah. Pretty interesting. So what's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars to crack nuts. In fact  that's old hat for crows. This happened about    years ago in a place called Sendai City  at a driving school in the suburbs of Tokyo. And since that time  all of the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior. And now  every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk  waiting to collect its lunch. So  they're learning from each other. And research bears this out. Parents seem to be teaching their young. They've learned from their peers. They've learned from their enemies. If I have a little extra time  I'll tell you about a case of crow infidelity that illustrates that nicely. The point being that they've developed cultural adaptation. And as we heard yesterday  that's the Pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble  and we're starting to see it with them. They're able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt to new challenges and new resources in their environment  which is really useful if you live in a city. So we know that there's lots of crows. We found out they're really smart  and we found out that they can teach each other. And when all this became clear to me  I realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine. So that's what we did. This is a vending machine for crows. And it uses Skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages. It's pretty simple. Basically  what happens is that we put this out in a field  or someplace where there's lots of crows  and we put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine. And crows eventually come by  and eat the peanuts and get used to the machine being there. And eventually  they eat up all the peanuts. And then they see that there are peanuts here on the feeder tray  and they hop up and help themselves. And then they leave  and the machine spits up more coins and peanuts  and life is really dandy  if you're a crow. Then you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut. So  when they get really used to that  we move on to the crows coming back. Now  they're used to the sound of the machine  and they keep coming back  and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins that's there. And when they get really happy about this  we go ahead and stymie them. And we move to the third stage  where we only give them a coin. Now  like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing  this really pisses them off. So  they do what they do in nature when they're looking for something    they sweep things out of the way with their beak. And they do that here  and that knocks the coins down the slot  and when that happens  they get a peanut. And so this goes on for some time. The crows learn that all they have to do is show up  wait for the coin to come out  put the coin in the slot  and then they get their peanut. And when they're really good and comfortable with that  we move to the final stage  in which they show up and nothing happens. And this is where we see the difference between crows and other animals. Squirrels  for example  would show up  look for the peanut  go away. Come back  look for the peanut  go away. They do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored  and then they go off and play in traffic. Crows  on the other hand  show up  and they try and figure it out. They know that this machine's been messing with them  through three different stages of behavior. They figure it's gotta have more to it. So  they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot. And eventually some crow gets a bright idea that   Hey  there's lots of coins lying around from the first stage  lying around on the ground   hops down  picks it up  drops it in the slot. And then  we're off to the races. That crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts  until his friends figure out how to do it  and then there we go. So  what's significant about this to me isn't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts. Mind you  there's     million dollars' worth of change lost every year  but I'm not sure I can depend on that ROI from crows. Instead  I think we should look a little bit larger. I think that crows can be trained to do other things. For example  why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events  Or find expensive components from discarded electronics  Or maybe do search and rescue  The main thing  the main point of all this for me is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species. We can find ways to interact with these other species that doesn't involve exterminating them  but involves finding an equilibrium with them that's a useful balance. Thanks very much. How does the news shape the way we see the world  Here's the world based on the way it looks    based on landmass. And here's how news shapes what Americans see. This map     Applause     this map shows the number of seconds that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories  by country  in February of         just one year ago. Now  this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities. There was massive flooding in Indonesia. And in Paris  the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming. The U.S. accounted for    percent of total news coverage. And when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining    percent  we see a lot of Iraq    that's that big green thing there    and little else. The combined coverage of Russia  China and India  for example  reached just one percent. When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story  here's how the world looked. What was that story  The death of Anna Nicole Smith. This story eclipsed every country except Iraq  and received    times the coverage of the IPCC report. And the cycle continues  as we all know  Britney has loomed pretty large lately. So  why don't we hear more about the world  One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half. Aside from one person ABC mini bureaus in Nairobi  New Delhi and Mumbai  there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa  India or South America    places that are home to more than two billion people. The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper. And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing when we see where people go for news. Local TV news looms large  and unfortunately only dedicates    percent of its coverage to international news. And what about the web  The most popular news sites don't do much better. Last year  Pew and the Colombia J School analyzed the        stories that appeared on Google News' front page. And they  in fact  covered the same    news events. Similarly  a study in e content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creators is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters  and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it. So  if you put it all together  this could help explain why today's college graduates  as well as less educated Americans  know less about the world than their counterparts did    years ago. And if you think it's simply because we are not interested  you would be wrong. In recent years  Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time grew to over    percent. The real question  is this distorted worldview what we want for Americans in our increasingly interconnected world  I know we can do better. And can we afford not to  Thank you. I write about food. I write about cooking. I take it quite seriously  but I'm here to talk about something that's become very important to me in the last year or two. It is about food  but it's not about cooking  per se. I'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow. I'm not a vegetarian    this is the old Nixon line  right  But I still think that this       may be this year's version of this. Now  that is only a little bit hyperbolic. And why do I say it  Because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined. There was the bomb  and there's now. And where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives  but whether  if we could see the Earth a century from now  we'd recognize it. It's a holocaust of a different kind  and hiding under our desks isn't going to help. Start with the notion that global warming is not only real  but dangerous. Since every scientist in the world now believes this  and even President Bush has seen the light  or pretends to  we can take this is a given. Then hear this  please. After energy production  livestock is the second highest contributor to atmosphere altering gases. Nearly one fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production    more than transportation. Now  you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts  but methane is    times more poisonous than CO   and it's not just methane. Livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation  air and water pollution  water shortages and loss of biodiversity. There's more. Like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people  but to animals. But lists like this become kind of numbing  so let me just say this  if you're a progressive  if you're driving a Prius  or you're shopping green  or you're looking for organic  you should probably be a semi vegetarian. Now  I'm no more anti cattle than I am anti atom  but it's all in the way we use these things. There's another piece of the puzzle  which Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday  and one you already know. There's no question  none  that so called lifestyle diseases    diabetes  heart disease  stroke  some cancers    are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world. And that's the direct result of eating a Western diet. Our demand for meat  dairy and refined carbohydrates    the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day    our demand for these things  not our need  our want  drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us. And those calories are in foods that cause  not prevent  disease. Now global warming was unforeseen. We didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility. Maybe a few lung diseases here and there  but  you know  that's not such a big deal. The current health crisis  however  is a little more the work of the evil empire. We were told  we were assured  that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate  the healthier we'd be. No. Overconsumption of animals  and of course  junk food  is the problem  along with our paltry consumption of plants. Now  there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here  but the evidence is that plants    and I want to make this clear    it's not the ingredients in plants  it's the plants. It's not the beta carotene  it's the carrot. The evidence is very clear that plants promote health. This evidence is overwhelming at this point. You eat more plants  you eat less other stuff  you live longer. Not bad. But back to animals and junk food. What do they have in common  One  we don't need either of them for health. We don't need animal products  and we certainly don't need white bread or Coke. Two  both have been marketed heavily  creating unnatural demand. We're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles. Three  their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health  and Earth friendly diet. Now  let's imagine a parallel. Let's pretend that our government supported an oil based economy  while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy  knowing all the while that the result would be pollution  war and rising costs. Incredible  isn't it  Yet they do that. And they do this here. It's the same deal. The sad thing is  when it comes to diet  is that even when well intentioned Feds try to do right by us  they fail. Either they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness  or they are puppets of agribusiness. So  when the USDA finally acknowledged that it was plants  rather than animals  that made people healthy  they encouraged us  via their overly simplistic food pyramid  to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day  along with more carbs. What they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others  and that plants and whole grains should be supplanting eating junk food. But industry lobbyists would never let that happen. And guess what  Half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness. So  instead of substituting plants for animals  our swollen appetites simply became larger  and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged. So called low fat diets  so called low carb diets    these are not solutions. But with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local  or whether we're being nice to animals  the most important issues just aren't being addressed. Now  don't get me wrong. I like animals  and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches. But there's no way to treat animals well  when you're killing    billion of them a year. That's our number.    billion. If you strung all of them    chickens  cows  pigs and lambs    to the moon  they'd go there and back five times  there and back. Now  my math's a little shaky  but this is pretty good  and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long  but you get the idea. That's just the United States. And with our hyper consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease  kindness might just be a bit of a red herring. Let's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down  and then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left. Another red herring might be exemplified by the word  locavore   which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary. Seriously. And locavore  for those of you who don't know  is someone who eats only locally grown food    which is fine if you live in California  but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke. Between the official story    the food pyramid    and the hip locavore vision  you have two versions of how to improve our eating. They both get it wrong  though. The first at least is populist  and the second is elitist. How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States. And I'm going to go through that  at least the last hundred years or so  very quickly right now. A hundred years ago  guess what  Everyone was a locavore  even New York had pig farms nearby  and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion. Every family had a cook  usually a mom. And those moms bought and prepared food. It was like your romantic vision of Europe. Margarine didn't exist. In fact  when margarine was invented  several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink  so we'd all know that it was a fake. There was no snack food  and until the '  s  until Clarence Birdseye came along  there was no frozen food. There were no restaurant chains. There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people  but none of them would think to open another one. Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic. And fancy food was entirely French. As an aside  those of you who remember Dan Aykroyd in the     s doing Julia Child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide. Back in those days  before even Julia  back in those days  there was no philosophy of food. You just ate. You didn't claim to be anything. There was no marketing. There were no national brands. Vitamins had not been invented. There were no health claims  at least not federally sanctioned ones. Fats  carbs  proteins    they weren't bad or good  they were food. You ate food. Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient  because it was an ingredient. The cornflake hadn't been invented. The Pop Tart  the Pringle  Cheez Whiz  none of that stuff. Goldfish swam. It's hard to imagine. People grew food  and they ate food. And again  everyone ate local. In New York  an orange was a common Christmas present  because it came all the way from Florida. From the '  s on  road systems expanded  trucks took the place of railroads  fresh food began to travel more. Oranges became common in New York. The South and West became agricultural hubs  and in other parts of the country  suburbs took over farmland. The effects of this are well known. They are everywhere. And the death of family farms is part of this puzzle  as is almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good tomato  even in summer. Eventually  California produced too much food to ship fresh  so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods. Thus arrived convenience. It was sold to proto feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework. Now  I know everybody over the age of  like       their mouths are watering at this point. If we had a slide of Salisbury steak  even more so  right  But this may have cut down on housework  but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well. Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad. I  for one    and I'm not kidding    didn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was   . Who needed it though  Meat was everywhere. What could be easier  more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak  But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally. Rather than spending their lives eating grass  for which their stomachs were designed  they were forced to eat soy and corn. They have trouble digesting those grains  of course  but that wasn't a problem for producers. New drugs kept them healthy. Well  they kept them alive. Healthy was another story. Thanks to farm subsidies  the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress  soy  corn and cattle became king. And chicken soon joined them on the throne. It was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began  the thing we're only realizing just now. Listen to this  between      and       the world's population doubled. Meat consumption increased five fold. Now  someone had to eat all that stuff  so we got fast food. And this took care of the situation resoundingly. Home cooking remained the norm  but its quality was down the tubes. There were fewer meals with home cooked breads  desserts and soups  because all of them could be bought at any store. Not that they were any good  but they were there. Most moms cooked like mine  a piece of broiled meat  a quickly made salad with bottled dressing  canned soup  canned fruit salad. Maybe baked or mashed potatoes  or perhaps the stupidest food ever  Minute Rice. For dessert  store bought ice cream or cookies. My mom is not here  so I can say this now. This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself. It wasn't all bad. By the '  s  forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients. We tended gardens  we became interested in organic food  we knew or we were vegetarians. We weren't all hippies  either. Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well. Meanwhile  food production had become industrial. Industrial. Perhaps because it was being produced rationally  as if it were plastic  food gained magical or poisonous powers  or both. Many people became fat phobic. Others worshiped broccoli  as if it were God like. But mostly they didn't eat broccoli. Instead they were sold on yogurt  yogurt being almost as good as broccoli. Except  in reality  the way the industry sold yogurt was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream. Similarly  let's look at a granola bar. You think that that might be healthy food  but in fact  if you look at the ingredient list  it's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal. Sadly  it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma  if not actually killed    the beginning of the heyday of value added food  which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it. Think of the frozen chicken nugget. The chicken is fed corn  and then its meat is ground up  and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder  and then it's fried in corn oil. All you do is nuke it. What could be better  And zapped horribly  pathetically. By the '  s  home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like McNuggets and Hot Pockets    and we all have our favorites  actually    made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home. At the same time  masses of women were entering the workforce  and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden. So now  you've got your pizza nights  you've got your microwave nights  you've got your grazing nights  you've got your fend for yourself nights and so on. Leading the way    what's leading the way  Meat  junk food  cheese  the very stuff that will kill you. So  now we clamor for organic food. That's good. And as evidence that things can actually change  you can now find organic food in supermarkets  and even in fast food outlets. But organic food isn't the answer either  at least not the way it's currently defined. Let me pose you a question. Can farm raised salmon be organic  when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet  even if the feed itself is supposedly organic  and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens  swimming in their own filth  And if that salmon's from Chile  and it's killed down there and then flown       miles  whatever  dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere  I don't know. Packed in Styrofoam  of course  before landing somewhere in the United States  and then being trucked a few hundred more miles. This may be organic in letter  but it's surely not organic in spirit. Now here is where we all meet. The locavores  the organivores  the vegetarians  the vegans  the gourmets and those of us who are just plain interested in good food. Even though we've come to this from different points  we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food. We need to start acting. And this is not only an issue of social justice  as Ann Cooper said    and  of course  she's completely right    but it's also one of global survival. Which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue  the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food. As I said     percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production. How much livestock do you need to produce this     percent of the agricultural land on Earth     percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we'll eat. And this amount is predicted to double in the next    years or so. And if the numbers coming in from China are anything like what they look like now  it's not going to be    years. There is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do. And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life. The most common argument is that we need nutrients    even though we eat  on average  twice as much protein as even the industry obsessed USDA recommends. But listen  experts who are serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week. What do you think we eat per day  Half a pound. But don't we need meat to be big and strong  Isn't meat eating essential to health  Won't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into godless  sissy  liberals  Some of us might think that would be a good thing. But  no  even if we were all steroid filled football players  the answer is no. In fact  there's no diet on Earth that meets basic nutritional needs that won't promote growth  and many will make you much healthier than ours does. We don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition  we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition  and it's killing us. To suggest that in the interests of personal and human health Americans eat    percent less meat    it's not enough of a cut  but it's a start. It would seem absurd  but that's exactly what should happen  and what progressive people  forward thinking people should be doing and advocating  along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants. I've been writing about food more or less omnivorously    one might say indiscriminately    for about    years. During that time  I've eaten and recommended eating just about everything. I'll never stop eating animals  I'm sure  but I do think that for the benefit of everyone  the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly. Ann Cooper's right. The USDA is not our ally here. We have to take matters into our own hands  not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone    and that's the hard part    but by improving our own. And that happens to be quite easy. Less meat  less junk  more plants. It's a simple formula  eat food. Eat real food. We can continue to enjoy our food  and we continue to eat well  and we can eat even better. We can continue the search for the ingredients we love  and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals. We'll reduce not only calories  but our carbon footprint. We can make food more important  not less  and save ourselves by doing so. We have to choose that path. Thank you. The first question is this. Our country has two exploration programs. One is NASA  with a mission to explore the great beyond  to explore the heavens  which we all want to go to if we're lucky. And you can see we have Sputnik  and we have Saturn  and we have other manifestations of space exploration. Well  there's also another program  in another agency within our government  in ocean exploration. It's in NOAA  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And my question is this   why are we ignoring the oceans   Here's the reason  or not the reason  but here's why I ask that question. If you compare NASA's annual budget to explore the heavens  that one year budget would fund NOAA's budget to explore the oceans for       years. Why  Why are we looking up  Is it because it's heaven  And hell is down here  Is it a cultural issue  Why are people afraid of the ocean  Or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark  gloomy place that has nothing to offer  I'm going to take you on a    minute trip on    percent of the planet  so buckle up. OK. And what we're going to do is we're going to immerse ourselves in my world. And what I'm going to try    I hope I make the following points. I'm going to make it right now in case I forget. Everything I'm going to present to you was not in my textbooks when I went to school. And most of all  it was not even in my college textbooks. I'm a geophysicist  and all my Earth science books when I was a student    I had to give the wrong answer to get an A. We used to ridicule continental drift. It was something we laughed at. We learned of Marshall Kay's geosynclinal cycle  which is a bunch of crap. In today's context  it was a bunch of crap  but it was the law of geology  vertical tectonics. All the things we're going to walk through in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans were mostly discoveries made by accident. Mostly discoveries made by accident. We were looking for something and found something else. And everything we're going to talk about represents a one tenth of one percent glimpse  because that's all we've seen. I have a characterization. This is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water. It gives you the false impression it's a map. It is not a map. In fact  I have another version at my office and I ask people   Why are there mountains here  on this area here  but there are none over here   And they go   Well  gee  I don't know   saying   Is it a fracture zone  Is it a hot spot   No  no  that's the only place a ship's been. Most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored. We had more exploration ships down there during Captain Cook's time than now. It's amazing. All right. So we're going to immerse ourselves in the    percent of the planet because  you know  it's really naive to think that the Easter Bunny put all the resources on the continents. You know  it's just ludicrous. We are always  constantly playing the zero sum game. You know  we're going to do this  we're going to take it away from something else. I believe in just enriching the economy. And we're leaving so much on the table     percent of the planet. And as I will point out later in the presentation     percent of the United States of America lies beneath the sea.    percent of our country that we own  have all legal jurisdiction  have all rights to do whatever we want  lies beneath the sea and we have better maps of Mars than that    percent. Why  OK. Now  I began my explorations the hard way. Back then    actually my first expedition was when I was    years old. It was    years ago. Do the math  I'm   . And I went out to sea on a Scripps ship and we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave  and I was too young to be    you know  I thought it was great  I was a body surfer and I thought   Wow  that was an incredible wave   And we almost sank the ship  but I became enraptured with mounting expeditions. And over the last    years  I've done about             I keep doing them    expeditions. But in the early days  the only way I could get to the bottom was to crawl into a submarine  a very small submarine  and go down to the bottom. I dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles. Alvin and Sea Cliff and Cyana  and all the major deep submersibles we have  which are about eight. In fact  on a good day  we might have four or five human beings at the average depth of the Earth    maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we've got going. And so it's very difficult to get there  if you do it physically. But I was enraptured  and in my graduate years was the dawn of plate tectonics. And we realized that the greatest mountain range on Earth lies beneath the sea. The mid ocean ridge runs around like the seam on a baseball. This is on a Mercator projection. But if you were to put it on an equal area projection  you'd see that the mid ocean ridge covers    percent of the Earth's total surface area. Almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range and we didn't enter it until after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin went to the moon. So we went to the moon  played golf up there  before we went to the largest feature on our own planet. And our interest in this mountain range  as Earth scientists in those days  was not only because of its tremendous size  dominating the planet  but the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin. Because it's along the axis of the mid ocean ridge where the great crustal plates are separating. And like a living organism  you tear it open  it bleeds its molten blood  rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere  hardens  forms new tissue and moves laterally. But no one had actually gone down into the actual site of the boundary of creation as we call it    into the Rift Valley    until a group of seven of us crawled in our little submarines in the summer of            and were the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley. We went down into the Rift Valley. This is all accurate except for one thing    it's pitch black. It's absolutely pitch black  because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean  which is        feet. In the Rift Valley  it's       feet. Most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the sun. Most of our planet is in eternal darkness. And for that reason  you do not have photosynthesis in the deep sea. And with the absence of photosynthesis you have no plant life  and as a result  you have very little animal life living in this underworld. Or so we thought. And so in our initial explorations  we were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation  looking at the volcanic features running along that entire        miles. Running along this entire        miles are tens of thousands of active volcanoes. Tens of thousands of active volcanoes. There are more active volcanoes beneath the sea than on land by two orders of magnitude. So  it's a phenomenally active region  it's not just a dark  boring place. It's a very alive place. And it's then being ripped open. But we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then. We couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension. In plate tectonic theory  we knew that if you had plates collide  it made sense  they would crush into one another  you would thicken the crust  you'd uplift it. That's why you get  you know  you get seashells up on Mount Everest. It's not a flood  it was pushed up there. We understood mountains under compression  but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension. It should not be. Until one of my colleagues said   It looks to me like a thermal blister  and the mid ocean ridge must be a cooling curve.  We said   Let's go find out.  We punched a bunch of heat probes. Everything made sense  except  at the axis  there was missing heat. It was missing heat. It was hot. It wasn't hot enough. So  we came up with multiple hypotheses  there's little green people down there taking it  there's all sorts of things going on. But the only logical  explanation  was that there were hot springs. So  there must be underwater hot springs. We mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat. And so we went along this mountain range  in an area along Galapagos Rift  and did we find the missing heat. It was amazing. These giant chimneys  huge giant chimneys. We went up to them with our submersible. We wanted to get a temperature probe  we stuck it in there  looked at it    it pegged off scale. The pilot made this great observation   That's hot.  And then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff    it could have melted. But it turns out the exiting temperature was     degrees F  hot enough to melt lead. This is what a real one looks like  on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. What you're looking at is an incredible pipe organ of chemicals coming out of the ocean. Everything you see in this picture is commercial grade  copper  lead  silver  zinc and gold. So the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor  and you have massive heavy metal deposits that we're making in this mountain range. We're making huge discoveries of large commercial grade ore along this mountain range  but it was dwarfed by what we discovered. We discovered a profusion of life  in a world that it should not exist  in . Giant tube worms     feet tall. I remember having to use vodka    my own vodka    to pickle it because we don't carry formaldehyde. We went and found these incredible clam beds sitting on the barren rock. Large clams  and when we opened them  they didn't look like a clam. And when we cut them open  they didn't have the anatomy of a clam. No mouth  no gut  no digestive system. Their bodies had been totally taken over by another organism  a bacterium  that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark  through a process we now call chemosynthesis. None of it in our textbooks. None of this in our textbooks. We did not know about this life system. We were not predicting it. We stumbled on it  looking for some missing heat. So  we wanted to accelerate this process. We wanted to get away from this silly trip  up and down on a submarine  average depth of the ocean         feet  two and half hours to get to work in the morning  two and half hours to get to home. Five hour commute to work. Three hours of bottom time  average distance traveled    one mile. On a        mile mountain range. Great job security  but not the way to go. So  I began designing a new technology of telepresence  using robotic systems to replicate myself  so I wouldn't have to cycle my vehicle system. We began to introduce that in our explorations  and we continued to make phenomenal discoveries with our new robotic technologies. Again  looking for something else  moving from one part of the mid ocean ridge to another. The scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life forms. They came across new creatures they had not seen before. But more importantly  they discovered edifices down there that they did not understand. That did not make sense. They were not above a magma chamber. They shouldn't be there. And we called it Lost City. And Lost City was characterized by these incredible limestone formations and upside down pools. Look at that. How do you do that  That's water upside down. We went in underneath and tapped it  and we found that it had the pH of Drano. The pH of     and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it and at this extreme environment. And the hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment. All the way at the other end  in an alkaline environment  at a pH of     life existed. So life was much more creative than we had ever thought. Again  discovered by accident. Just two years ago working off Santorini  where people are sunning themselves on the beach  unbeknownst to them in the caldera nearby  we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems and more life systems. This was two miles from where people go to sunbathe  and they were oblivious to the existence of this system. Again  you know  we stop at the water's edge. Recently  diving off    in the Gulf of Mexico  finding pools of water  this time not upside down  right side up. Bingo. You'd think you're in air  until a fish swims by. You're looking at brine pools formed by salt diapirs. Near that was methane. I've never seen volcanoes of methane. Instead of belching out lava  they were belching out big  big bubbles of methane. And they were creating these volcanoes  and there were flows  not of lava  but of the mud coming out of the Earth but driven by    I've never seen this before. Moving on  there's more than just natural history beneath the sea    human history. Our discoveries of the Titanic. The realization that the deep sea is the largest museum on Earth. It contains more history than all of the museums on land combined. And yet we're only now penetrating it. Finding the state of preservation. We found the Bismarck in        feet. We then found the Yorktown. People always ask   Did you find the right ship   It said Yorktown on the stern. More recently  finding ancient history. How many ancient mariners have had a bad day  The number's a million. We've been discovering these along ancient trade routes  where they're not supposed to be. This shipwreck sank     years before the birth of Christ. This one sank carrying a prefabricated  Home Depot Roman temple. And then here's one that sank at the time of Homer  at     B.C. More recently  into the Black Sea  where we're exploring. Because there's no oxygen there  it's the largest reservoir of hydrogen sulfide on Earth. Shipwrecks are perfectly preserved. All their organics are perfectly preserved. We begin to excavate them. We expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their DNA. Look at the state of preservation    still the ad mark of a carpenter. Look at the state of those artifacts. You still see the beeswax dripping. When they dropped  they sealed it. This ship sank       years ago. Fortunately  we've been able to convince Congress. We begin to go on the Hill and lobby. And we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy. The Okeanos Explorer on its mission. Its mission is as good as you could get. Its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet Earth. And I was looking at it yesterday  it's up in Seattle. OK. It comes online this summer  and it begins its journey of exploration. But we have no idea what we're going find when we go out there with our technology. But certainly  it's going to be going to the unknown America. This is that part of the United States that lies beneath the sea. We own all of that blue and yet  like I say  particularly the western territorial trust  we don't have maps of them. We don't have maps of them. We have maps of Venus  but not of the western territorial trust. The way we're going to run this    we have no idea what we're going to discover. We have no idea what we're going to discover. We're going to discover an ancient shipwreck  a Phoenician off Brazil  or a new rock formation  a new life. So  we're going to run it like an emergency hospital. We're going to connect our command center  via a high bandwidth satellite link to a building we're building at the University of Rhode Island  called the Interspace Center. And within that  we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine  blue gold team  switching them off and on  running    hours a day. A discovery is made  that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later. But then it's connected through Internet too    the new Internet highway that makes Internet one look like a dirt road on the information highway    with    gigabits of bandwidth. We'll go into areas we have no knowledge of. It's a big blank sheet on our planet. We'll map it within hours  have the maps disseminated out to the major universities. It turns out that    percent of all the oceanographic intellect in this country are at    universities. They're all on I  . We can then build a command center. This is a remote center at the University of Washington. She's talking to the pilot. She's       miles away  but she's assumed command. But the beauty of this  too  is we can then disseminate it to children. We can disseminate. They can follow this expedition. I've started a program    where are you Jim  Jim Young who helped me start a program called the Jason Project. More recently  we've started a program with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America  so that we can use exploration  and the excitement of live exploration  to motivate them and excite them and then give them what they're already ready for. I would not let an adult drive my robot. You don't have enough gaming experience. But I will let a kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system. Because we want to create    we want to create the classroom of tomorrow. We have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it's all being done. You win or lose an engineer or a scientist by eighth grade. The game is not over    it's over by the eighth grade  it's not beginning. We need to be not only proud of our universities. We need to be proud of our middle schools. And when we have the best middle schools in the world  we'll have the best kids pumped out of that system  let me tell you. Because this is what we want. This is what we want. This is a young lady  not watching a football game  not watching a basketball game. Watching exploration live from thousands of miles away  and it's just dawning on her what she's seeing. And when you get a jaw drop  you can inform. You can put so much information into that mind  it's in full  receiving  mode. This  I hope  will be a future engineer or a future scientist in the battle for truth. And my final question  my final question    why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea  Why do we have programs to build habitation on Mars  and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon  but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet  And the technology is at hand. Thank you very much. Being a child  and sort of crawling around the house  I remember these Turkish carpets  and there were these scenes  these battle scenes  these love scenes. I mean  look  this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier. And my mom took these pictures actually  last week  of our carpets  and I remember this to this day. There was another object  this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gargoyles and nudity    pretty scary stuff  when you're a little kid. What I remember today from this is that objects tell stories  so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work. And then there was another influence. I was a teenager  and at    or     I guess like all teenagers  we want to just do what we love and what we believe in. And so  I fused together the two things I loved the most  which was skiing and windsurfing. Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland. So  I created this compilation of the two  I took my skis and I took a board and I put a mast foot in there  and some foot straps  and some metal fins  and here I was  going really fast on frozen lakes. It was really a death trap. I mean  it was incredible  it worked incredibly well  but it was really dangerous. And I realized then I had to go to design school. I mean  look at those graphics there. So  I went to design school  and it was the early '  s when I finished. And I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley  so I wanted to be there  and I saw that the computer was coming into our homes  that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes. And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy  and we would get in to these meetings  and these managers would come in  and they would say   Well  what we're going to do here is really important  you know.  And they would give the projects code names  you know  mostly from  Star Wars   actually  things like C PO  Yoda  Luke. So  in anticipation  I would be this young designer in the back of the room  and I would raise my hand  and I would ask questions. I mean  in retrospect  probably stupid questions  but things like   What's this Caps Lock key for   or  What's this Num Lock key for   You know  that thing   You know  do people really use it  Do they need it  Do they want it in their homes   What I realized then is  they didn't really want to change the legacy stuff  they didn't want to change the insides. They were really looking for us  the designers  to create the skins  to put some pretty stuff outside of the box. And I didn't want to be a colorist. It wasn't what I wanted to do. I didn't want to be a stylist in this way. And then I saw this quote   advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal.  So  I had to start on my own. So I moved to San Francisco  and I started a little company  fuseproject. And what I wanted to work on is important stuff. And I wanted to really not just work on the skins  but I wanted to work on the entire human experience. And so the first projects were sort of humble  but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would use in a new way  and maybe finding some new functionality. This is a watch we made for Mini Cooper  the car company  right when it launched  and it's the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical. And that allows me to check my timer discretely  here  without bending my elbow. And other projects  which were really about transformation  about matching the human need. This is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer  and it ships completely flat  and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot. And something a little bit more experimental  this is a light fixture for Swarovski  and what it does is  it changes shape. So  it goes from a circle  to a round  to a square  to a figure eight. And just by drawing on a little computer tablet  the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want. And then finally  the leaf lamp for Herman Miller. This is a pretty involved process  it took us about four and a half years. But I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light  a new experience of light. So  we had to design both the light and the light bulb. And that's a unique opportunity  I would say  in design. And the new experience I was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm  sort of glowing kind of mood light  all the way to a bright work light. So  the light bulb actually does that. It allows the person to switch  and to mix these two colorations. And it's done in a very simple way  one just touches the base of the light  and on one side  you can mix the brightness  and on the other  the coloration of the light. So  all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them  and I think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world  whether it's for business  or  as I'm going to show  on some civic type projects. Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value to business  value to the users also  but I think it's the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater value. And the values we bring can be about environmental issues  about sustainability  about lower power consumption. You know  they can be about function and beauty  they can be about business strategy. But designers are really the glue that brings these things together. So Jawbone is a project that you're familiar with  and it has a humanistic technology. It feels your skin. It rests on your skin  and it knows when it is you're talking. And by knowing when it is you're talking  it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about  which is the environmental noises. But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff  and all the nerdy stuff out of it  and try to make it as beautiful as we can. I mean  think about it  the care we take in selecting sunglasses  or jewelry  or accessories is really important  so if it isn't beautiful  it really doesn't belong on your face. And this is what we're pursuing here. But how we work on Jawbone is really unique. I want to point at something here  on the left. This is the board  this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work. But this is the design process  there's somebody changing the board  putting tracers on the board  changing the location of the ICs  as the designers on the other side are doing the work. So  it's not about slapping skins  anymore  on a technology. It's really about designing from the inside out. And then  on the other side of the room  the designers are making small adjustments  sketching  drawing by hand  putting it in the computer. And it's what I call being design driven. You know  there is some push and pull  but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out. And then  of course  design is never done. And this is    the other new way that is unique in how we work is  because it's never done  you have to do all this other stuff. The packaging  and the website  and you need to continue to really touch the user  in many ways. But how do you retain somebody  when it's never done  And Hosain Rahman  the CEO of Aliph Jawbone  you know  really understands that you need a different structure. So  in a way  the different structure is that we're partners  it's a partnership. We can continue to work and dedicate ourselves to this project  and then we also share in the rewards. And here's another project  another partnership type approach. This is called Y Water  and it's this guy from Los Angeles  Thomas Arndt  Austrian originally  who came to us  and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink  or an organic drink for his kids  to replace the high sugar content sodas that he's trying to get them away from. So  we worked on this bottle  and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension. And this allows the bottle to turn into a game. The bottles connect together  and you can create different shapes  different forms. Thank you. And then while we were doing this  the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y  and then we thought  well these words   why  and  why not   are probably the most important words that kids ask. So we called it Y Water. And so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room  the three dimensional design  the ideas  the branding  it all becomes deeply connected. And then the other thing about this project is  we bring intellectual property  we bring a marketing approach  we bring all this stuff  but I think  at the end of the day  what we bring is these values  and these values create a soul for the companies we work with. And it's especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor  when others can be creative and do more with it. Here's another project  which I think really emulates that. This is the One Laptop per Child  the      laptop. This picture is incredible. In Nigeria  people carry their most precious belongings on their heads. This girl is going to school with a laptop on her head. I mean  to me  it just means so much. But when Nicholas Negroponte    and he has spoken about this project a lot  he's the founder of OLPC    came to us about two and a half years ago  there were some clear ideas. He wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology  and those are pillars of his life  but also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child. But the third pillar that he talked about was design. And at the time  I wasn't really working on computers. I didn't really want to  from the previous adventure. But what he said was really significant  is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product  how we were going to make it low cost  robust. And plus  he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key    and the Num Lock key  too. So  I was convinced. We designed it to be iconic  to look different. To look like it's for a kid  but not like a toy. And then the integration of all these great technologies  which you've heard about  the Wi Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect  the screen  which you can read in sunlight  the keyboard  which is made out of rubber  and it's protected from the environment. You know  all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and the OLPC people and the engineers. They fought the suppliers  they fought the manufacturers. I mean  they fought like animals for this to remain they way it is. And in a way  it is that will that makes projects like this one    allows the process from not destroying the original idea. And I think this is something really important. So  now you get these pictures    you get up in the morning  and you see the kids in Nigeria and you see them in Uruguay with their computers  and in Mongolia. And we went away from obviously the beige. I mean it's colorful  it's fun. In fact  you can see each logo is a little bit different. It's because we were able to run  during the manufacturing process     colors for the X and the O  which is the name of the computer  and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor  you get    times     you get     different options there. So  the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible. But this is my nephew  Anthony  in Switzerland  and he had the laptop for an afternoon  and I had to take it back. It was hard. And it was a prototype. And a month and a half later  I come back to Switzerland  and there he is playing with his own version. Like paper  paper and cardboard. So  I'm going to finish with one last project  and this is a little bit more of adult play. Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom. It's actually just launched  actually launched on Valentine's Day  February     about    days ago. So  the Department of Health in New York came to us  and they needed a way to distribute    million condoms for free to the citizens of New York. So a pretty big endeavor  and we worked on the dispensers. These are the dispensers. There's this friendly shape. It's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant  and it has to be easily serviceable  you have to know where it is and what it does. And we also designed the condoms themselves. And I was just in New York at the launch  and I went to see all these places where they're installed  this is at a Puerto Rican little mom and pop store  at a bar in Christopher Street  at a pool hall. I mean  they're being installed in homeless clinics    everywhere. Of course  clubs and discos  too. And here's the public service announcement for this project. Get some. So  this is really where design is able to create a conversation. I was in these venues  and people were  you know  really into getting them. They were excited. It was breaking the ice  it was getting over a stigma  and I think that's also what design can do. So  I was going to throw some condoms in the room and whatnot  but I'm not sure it's the etiquette here. Yeah  All right  all right. I have only a few. So  I have more  you can always ask me for some more later. And if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom  you can just say you like the design. So  I'll finish with just one thought  if we all work together on creating value  but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do  I think we can change the work that we do. We can change these values  can change the companies we work with  and eventually  together  maybe we can change the world. So  thank you. A few words about how I got started  and it has a lot to do with happiness  actually. When I was a very young child  I was extremely introverted and very much to myself. And  kind of as a way of surviving  I would go into my own very personal space  and I would make things. I would make things for people as a way of  you know  giving  showing them my love. I would go into these private places  and I would put my ideas and my passions into objects    and sort of learning how to speak with my hands. So  the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects is very much connected with not only the idea realm  but also with very much the feeling realm. And the ideas are very disparate. I'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces  and there's no real connection between one or the other  except that they sort of come out of my brain  and they're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered by looking at life  and seeing nature and seeing objects  and just having kind of playful random thoughts about things. When I was a child  I started to explore motion. I fell in love with the way things moved  so I started to explore motion by making little flipbooks. And this is one that I did  probably like when I was around seventh grade  and I remember when I was doing this  I was thinking about that little rock there  and the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air  and how the characters    would come shooting out of the car  so  on my mind  I was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles. And of course  when you're a little kid  there's always destruction. So  it has to end with this    gratuitous violence. So that was how I first started to explore the way things moved  and expressed it. Now  when I went to college  I found myself making fairly complicated  fragile machines. And this really came about from having many different kinds of interests. When I was in high school  I loved to program computers  so I sort of liked the logical flow of events. I was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon  because it meant working with my hands in a very focused  intense way. So  I started taking art courses  and I found a way to make sculpture that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands  with coming up with different kinds of logical flows of energy through a system. And also  working with wire    everything that I did was both a visual and a mechanical engineering decision at the same time. So  I was able to sort of exercise all of that. Now  this kind of machine is as close as I can get to painting. And it's full of many little trivial end points  like there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles and it doesn't really mean anything. It's really just for the sort of joy of its own triviality. The connection I have with engineering is the same as any other engineer  in that I love to solve problems. I love to figure things out  but the end result of what I'm doing is really completely ambiguous. That's pretty ambiguous. The next piece that is going to come up is an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex. I gave myself the problem. Since I'm always liking to solve problems  I gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction  and solving all of the mechanical problems for getting this little man to walk back and forth. So  when I started this  I didn't have an overall plan for the machine  but I did have a sense of the gesture  and a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space. And then it was a matter of starting from one point and sort of building to that final point. That little gear there switches back and forth to change direction. And that's a little found object. So a lot of the pieces that I've made  they involve found objects. And it really    it's almost like doing visual puns all the time. When I see objects  I imagine them in motion. I imagine what can be said with them. This next one here   Machine with Wishbone   it came about from playing with this wishbone after dinner. You know  they say  never play with your food    but I always play with things. So  I had this wishbone  and I thought  it's kind of like a cowboy who's been on his horse for too long. And I started to make him walk across the table  and I thought   Oh  I can make a little machine that will do that.  So  I made this device  linked it up  and the wishbone walks. And because the wishbone is bone    it's animal    it's sort of a point where I think we can enter into it. And that's the whole piece. That's about that big. This kind of work is also very much like puppetry  where the found object is  in a sense  the puppet  and I'm the puppeteer at first  because I'm playing with an object. But then I make the machine  which is sort of the stand in for me  and it is able to achieve the action that I want. The next piece I'll show you is a much more conceptual thought  and it's a little piece called  Cory's Yellow Chair.  I had this image in my mind  when I saw my son's little chair  and I saw it explode up and out. And    so the way I saw this in my mind at first  was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed  and the pieces would move far out  and then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravitational feel  to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center. And they would coalesce for just a moment  so you could perceive that there was a chair there. For me  it's kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment  and I wanted to express that. Now  the machine is    in this case  it's a real approximation of that  because obviously you can't move physical matter infinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously. This whole thing is about four feet wide  and the chair itself is only about a few inches. Now  this is a funny sort of conceptual thing  and yesterday we were talking about Danny Hillis'         Year Clock.  So  we have a motor here on the left  and it goes through a gear train. There are    pairs of      reductions  so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once. So I've invented it in concrete  because it doesn't really matter. Because it could run all the time. Now  a completely different thought. I'm always imagining myself in different situations. I'm imagining myself as a machine. What would I love  I would love to be bathed in oil. So  this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil. And it's really  just sort of    for me  it was just really about the lusciousness of oil. And then  I got a call from a friend who wanted to have a show of erotic art  and I didn't have any pieces. But when she suggested to be in the show  this piece came to mind. So  it's sort of related  but you can see it's much more overtly erotic. And this one I call  Machine with Grease.  It's just continually ejaculating  and it's    this is a happy machine  I'll tell you. It's definitely happy. From an engineering point of view  this is just a little four bar linkage. And then again  this is a found object  a little fan that I found. And I thought  what about the gesture of opening the fan  and how simply could I state something. And  in a case like this  I'm trying to make something which is clear but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant. For me  the process is very important  because I'm inventing machines  but I'm also inventing tools to make machines  and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning. So this is a little wire bending tool. After many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers  I made that tool  and then I made this other tool for sort of centering gears very quickly    sort of developing my own little world of technology. My life completely changed when I found a spot welder. And that was that tool. It completely changed what I could do. Now here  I'm going to do a very poor job of silver soldering. This is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school. I just like  throw it in. I mean  real jewelers put little bits of solder in. So  that's a finished gear. When I moved to Boston  I joined a group called the World Sculpture Racing Society. And the idea  their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street  and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best. It would be    whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner. So I made    this is my first racing sculpture  and I thought   Oh  I'm going to make a cart  and I'm going to have it    I'm going to have my hand writing 'faster ' so as I run down the street  the cart's going to talk to me and it's going to go  'Faster  faster '   So  that's what it does. But then in the end  what I decided was every time you finish writing the word  I would stop and I would give the card to somebody on the side of the road. So I would never win the race because I'm always stopping. But I had a lot of fun. Now  I only have two and a half minutes    I'm going to play this. This is a piece that  for me  is in some ways the most complete kind of piece. Because when I was a kid  I also played a lot of guitar. And when I had this thought  I was imagining that I would make    I would have a whole machine theater evening  where I would    you would have an audience  the curtain would open  and you'd be entertained by machines on stage. So  I imagined a very simple gestural dance that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair  and ... When I'm making these pieces  I'm always trying to find a point where I'm saying something very clearly and it's very simple  but also at the same time it's very ambiguous. And I think there's a point between simplicity and ambiguity which can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it. And that leads me to the thought that all of these pieces start off in my own mind  in my heart  and I do my best at finding ways to express them with materials  and it always feels really crude. It's always a struggle  but somehow I manage to sort of get this thought out into an object  and then it's there  OK. It means nothing at all. The object itself just means nothing. Once it's perceived  and someone brings it into their own mind  then there's a cycle that has been completed. And to me  that's the most important thing because  ever since being a kid  I've wanted to communicate my passion and love. And that means the complete cycle of coming from inside  out to the physical  to someone perceiving it. So I'll just let this chair come down. Thank you. Just to put everything in context  and to kind of give you a background to where I'm coming from  so that a lot of the things I'm going to say  and the things I'm going to do    or things I'm going to tell you I've done    you will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am. I graduated high school in Cleveland  Ohio      . And just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad  we went back home. Finished university education  got a medical degree      . And by the time I was an intern house officer  I could barely afford to maintain my mother's    year old car    and I was a paid doctor. This brings us to why a lot of us  who are professionals  are now  as they say  in diaspora. Now  are we going to make that a permanent thing  where we all get trained  and we leave  and we don't go back  Perhaps not  I should certainly hope not    because that is not my vision. All right  for good measure  that's where Nigeria is on the African map  and just there is the Delta region that I'm sure everybody's heard of. People getting kidnapped  where the oil comes from  the oil that sometimes I think has driven us all crazy in Nigeria. But  critical poverty  this slide is from a presentation I gave not that long ago. Gapminder.org tells the story of the gap between Africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care. Very interesting. How many people do you think are on that taxi  And believe it or not  that is a taxi in Nigeria. And the capital    well  what used to be the capital of Nigeria    Lagos  that's a taxi  and you have police on them. So  tell me  how many policemen do you think are on this taxi  And now  Three. So  when these kind of people    and  believe me  it's not just the police that use these taxis in Lagos. We all do. I've been on one of these  and I didn't have a helmet  either. And it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us on a taxi like this falls off  has an accident and needs a hospital. Believe it or not  some of us do survive. Some of us do survive malaria  we do survive AIDS. And like I tell my family  and my wife reminds me every time   You're risking your life  you know  every time you go to that country.  And she's right. Every time you go there  you know that if you actually need critical care    critical care of any sort    if you have an accident    of which there are many  there are accidents everywhere    where do they go  Where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff  I'm not saying instead of  I'm saying as well as  AIDS  TB  malaria  typhoid    the list goes on. I'm saying  where do they go when they're like me  When I go back home    and I do all kinds of things  I teach  I train    but I catch one of these things  or I'm chronically ill with one of those  where do they go  What's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled  I think it's quite significant. This is where they go. These are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden    this is a major hospital. In fact  it's from a major teaching hospital in Nigeria. Now that is less than a year old  in an operating room. That's sterilizing equipment in Nigeria. You remember all that oil  Yes  I'm sorry if it upsets some of you  but I think you need to see this. That's the floor  OK  You can say some of this is education. You can say it's hygiene. I'm not pleading poverty. I'm saying we need more than just  you know  vaccination  malaria  AIDS  because I want to be treated in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there. In fact  when I start running around saying   Hey  boys and girls  you're cardiologists in the U.S.  can you come home with me and do a mission   I want them to think   Well there's some hope.  Now  have a look at that. That's the anesthesiology machine. And that's my specialty  right  Anesthesiology and critical care    look at that bag. It's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the U.K. And believe me  these are current pictures. Now  if something like this  which has happened in the U.K.  that's where they go. This is the intensive care unit in which I work. All right  this is a slide from a talk I gave about intensive care units in Nigeria  and jokingly we refer to it as  Expensive Scare.  Because it's scary and it's expensive  but we need to have it  OK  So  these are the problems. There are no prizes for telling us what the problems are  are there  I think we all know. And several speakers before and speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems. These are a few of them. So  what did I do  There we go    we're going on a mission. We're going to do some open heart surgery. I was the only Brit  on a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons  cardiac nurse  intensive care nurse. We all went out and did a mission and we've done three of them so far. Just so you know  I do believe in missions  I do believe in aid and I do believe in charity. They have their place  but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier  Because it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission. Health is wealth  in the words of Hans Rosling. You get wealthier faster if you are healthy first. So  here we are  mission. Big trouble. Open heart surgery in Nigeria    big trouble. That's Mike  Mike comes out from Mississippi. Does he look like he's happy  It took us two days just to organize the place  but hey  you know  we worked on it. Does he look happy  Yes  that's the medical advice the committee chairman says   Yes  I told you  you weren't going to be able to  you can't do this  I just know it.  Look  that's the technician we had. So yes  you go on  all right  I got him to come with me    anesthesia tech    come with me from the U.K. Yes  let's just go work this thing out. See  that's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally. We get a lot of donated equipment. Equipment that's obsolete  equipment that doesn't quite work  or it works and you can't fix it. And there's nothing wrong with that  so long as we use it and we move on. But we had problems with it. We had severe problems there. He had to get on the phone. This guy was always on the phone. So what we going to do now  It looks like all these Americans are here and yes  one Brit  and he's not going to do anything    he thinks he's British actually  and he's actually Nigerian  I just thought about that. We eventually got it working  is the truth  but it was one of these. Even older than the one you saw. The reason I have this picture here  this X ray  it's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X rays. Do you figure where that is  It was on a window. I mean  what's an X ray viewing box  Please. Well  nowadays everything's on PAX anyway. You look at your X rays on a screen and you do stuff with them  you email them. But we were still using X rays  but we didn't even have a viewing box  And we were doing open heart surgery. OK  I know it's not AIDS  I know it's not malaria  but we still need this stuff. Oh yeah  echo    this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready. People still believe in Voodoo. Heart disease  VSD  hole in the heart  tetralogies. You still get people who believe in it and they came. At    percent oxygen saturation  the normal is about   . Her condition  open heart surgery that as she required  would have been treated when she was a child. We had to do these for adults. So  we did succeed and we still do. We've done three. We're planning another one in July in the north of the country. So  we certainly still do open heart  but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in    we ship everything  instruments. We had explosions because the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it. The oxygen tanks didn't quite work right. But how many did we do the first one    . We did    open heart surgical patients successfully. Here is our very first patient  out of intensive care  and just watch that chair  all right  This is what I mean about appropriate technology. That's what he was doing  propping up the bed because the bed simply didn't work. Have you seen one of those before  No  Yes  Doesn't matter  it worked. I'm sure you've all seen or heard this before   We  the willing  have been doing so much with so little for so long       we are now qualified to do anything with nothing.  Thank you. Sustainable Solutions    this was my first company. This one's sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing. So  we put my hand in my pocket and say   Guys  let's just buy stuff. Let's go set up a company that teaches people  educates them  gives them the tools they need to keep going.  And that's a perfect example of one. Usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital  you buy a different one for children  you buy a different one for transport. This one will do everything  and it will do it at half the price and doesn't need compressed air. If you're in America and you don't know about this one  we do  because we make it our duty to find out what's appropriate technology for Africa    what's appropriately priced  does the job  and we move on. Anesthesia machine  multi parameter monitor  operating lights  suction. This little unit here    remember your little    volt plug in the car  that charges your  whatever  Game Boy  telephone  That's exactly how the outlets are designed. Yes  it will take a solar panel. Yes a solar panel will charge it. But if you've got mains as well  it will charge the batteries in there. And guess what  We have a little pedal charger too  just in case. And guess what  if it all fails  if you can find a car that's still got a live battery and you stick it in  it will still work. Then you can customize it. Is it dental surgery you want  General surgery you want  Decide which instruments  stock it up with consumables. And currently we're working on oxygen    oxygen delivery on site. The technology for oxygen delivery is not new. Oxygen concentrators are very old technology. What is new  and what we will have in a few months  I hope  is that ability to use this same renewable energy system to provide and produce oxygen on site. Zeolite    it's not new    zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is    percent of air. If you take nitrogen out  what's left  Oxygen  pretty much. So that's not new. What we're doing is applying this technology to it. These are the basic features of my device  or our device. This is what makes it so special. Apart from the awards it's won  it's portable and it's certified. It's registered  the MHRA    and the CE mark  for those who don't know  for Europe  is the equivalent of the FDA in the U.S. If you compare it with what's on the market  price wise  size wise  ease of use  complexity ... This picture was taken last year. These are members of my graduating class      . It was in this gentleman's house in the Potomac  for those of you who are familiar with Maryland. There are too many of us outside and everybody  just to borrow a bit from Hans    Hans Rosling  he's my guy    if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention  it's the problems. But what we really need are African solutions that are appropriate for Africa    looking at the culture  looking at the people  looking at how much money they've got. African people  because they will do it with a passion  I hope. And lots and lots of that little bit down there  sacrifice. You have to do it. Africans have to do it  in conjunction with everyone else. Thank you. So  can we dare to be optimistic  Well  the thesis of  The Bottom Billion  is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for    years  and hence diverging from the rest of mankind. And so  the real question to pose is not   Can we be optimistic   It's   How can we give credible hope to that billion people   That  to my mind  is the fundamental challenge now of development. What I'm going to offer you is a recipe  a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good  which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self interest. Compassion  because a billion people are living in societies that have not offered credible hope. That is a human tragedy. Enlightened self interest  because if that economic divergence continues for another    years  combined with social integration globally  it will build a nightmare for our children. We need compassion to get ourselves started  and enlightened self interest to get ourselves serious. That's the alliance that changes the world. So  what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion  What can we actually do  Well  a good guide is to think   What did we do last time the rich world got serious about developing another region of the world   That gives us  it turns out  quite a good clue  except you have to go back quite a long time. The last time the rich world got serious about developing another region was in the late     s. The rich world was you  America  and the region that needed to be developed was my world  Europe. That was post War Europe. Why did America get serious  It wasn't just compassion for Europe  though there was that. It was that you knew you had to  because  in the late     s  country after country in Central Europe was falling into the Soviet bloc  and so you knew you'd no choice. Europe had to be dragged into economic development. So  what did you do  last time you got serious  Well  yes  you had a big aid program. Thank you very much. That was Marshall aid  we need to do it again. Aid is part of the solution. But what else did you do  Well  you tore up your trade policy  and totally reversed it. Before the war  America had been highly protectionist. After the war  you opened your markets to Europe  you dragged Europe into the then global economy  which was your economy  and you institutionalized that trade liberalization through founding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. So  total reversal of trade policy. Did you do anything else  Yes  you totally reversed your security policy. Before the war  your security policy had been isolationist. After the war  you tear that up  you put         troops in Europe for over    years. So  total reversal of security policy. Anything else  Yes  you tear up the  Eleventh Commandment     national sovereignty. Before the war  you treated national sovereignty as so sacrosanct that you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations. After the war  you found the United Nations  you found the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  you found the IMF  you encouraged Europe to create the European Community    all systems for mutual government support. That is still the waterfront of effective policies  aid  trade  security  governments. Of course  the details of policy are going to be different  because the challenge is different. It's not rebuilding Europe  it's reversing the divergence for the bottom billion  so that they actually catch up. Is that easier or harder  We need to be at least as serious as we were then. Now  today I'm going to take just one of those four. I'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest  the one that's just motherhood and apple pie    governments  mutual systems of support for governments    and I'm going to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance  and I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now. The opportunity we're going to look to is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion  and that is the commodity booms. The commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many  though not all  of the countries of the bottom billion. Partly  they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high  but it's not just that. There's also a range of new discoveries. Uganda has just discovered oil  in about the most disastrous location on Earth  Ghana has discovered oil  Guinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground. So  a mass of new discoveries. Between them  these new revenue flows dwarf aid. Just to give you one example  Angola alone is getting    billion dollars a year in oil revenue. The entire aid flows to the    countries of the bottom billion last year were    billion. So  the flow of resources from the commodity booms to the bottom billion are without precedent. So there's the optimism. The question is  how is it going to help their development  It's a huge opportunity for transformational development. Will it be taken  So  here comes a bit of science  and this is a bit of science I've done since  The Bottom Billion   so it's new. I've looked to see what is the relationship between higher commodity prices of exports  and the growth of commodity exporting countries. And I've looked globally  I've taken all the countries in the world for the last    years  and looked to see what the relationship is. And the short run    say  the first five to seven years    is just great. In fact  it's hunky dory  everything goes up. You get more money because your terms of trade have improved  but also that drives up output across the board. So GDP goes up a lot    fantastic  That's the short run. And how about the long run  Come back    years later. Well  the short run  it's hunky dory  but the long run  it's humpty dumpty. You go up in the short run  but then most societies historically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all. That is not a forecast about how commodity prices go  it's a forecast of the consequences  the long term consequences  for growth of an increase in prices. So  what goes wrong  Why is there this  resource curse   as it's called  And again  I've looked at that  and it turns out that the critical issue is the level of governance  the initial level of economic governance  when the resource booms accrue. In fact  if you've got good enough governance  there is no resource boom. You go up in the short term  and then you go up even more in the long term. That's Norway  the richest country in Europe. It's Australia. It's Canada. The resource curse is entirely confined to countries below a threshold of governance. They still go up in the short run. That's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment. The best growth rates they've had    ever. And the question is whether the short run will persist. And with bad governance historically  over the last    years  it hasn't. It's countries like Nigeria  which are worse off than if they'd never had oil. So  there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term  and below which you go down. Just to benchmark that threshold  it's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid     s. So  the question is  are the bottom billion above or below that threshold  Now  there's one big change since the commodity booms of the     s  and that is the spread of democracy. So I thought  well  maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion. Maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy. So  I looked. Democracy does have significant effects    and unfortunately  they're adverse. Democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies. At that stage I just wanted to abandon the research  but       it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that. Because there are two distinct aspects of democracy  there's electoral competition  which determines how you acquire power  and there are checks and balances  which determine how you use power. It turns out that electoral competition is the thing that's doing the damage with democracy  whereas strong checks and balances make resource booms good. And so  what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances. They haven't got them. They got instant democracy in the     s  elections without checks and balances. How can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances  In all the societies of the bottom billion  there are intense struggles to do just that. The simple proposal is that we should have some international standards  which will be voluntary  but which would spell out the key decision points that need to be taken in order to harness these resource revenues. We know these international standards work because we've already got one. It's called the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. That is the very simple idea that governments should report to their citizens what revenues they have. No sooner was it proposed than reformers in Nigeria adopted it  pushed it and published the revenues in the paper. Nigerian newspapers circulations spiked. People wanted to know what their government was getting in terms of revenue. So  we know it works. What would the content be of these international standards  I can't go through all of them  but I'll give you an example. The first is how to take the resources out of the ground    the economic processes  taking the resources out of the ground and putting assets on top of the ground. And the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction. You know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment  how they've been sold over the last    years  A company flies in  does a deal with a minister. And that's great for the company  and it's quite often great for the minister       and it's not great for their country. There's a very simple institutional technology which can transform that  and it's called verified auctions. The public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth is of course the treasury    that is  the British Treasury. And the British Treasury decided that it would sell the rights to third generation mobile phones by working out what those rights were worth. They worked out they were worth two billion pounds. Just in time  a set of economists got there and said   Why not try an auction  It'll reveal the value.  It went for    billion pounds through auction. If the British Treasury can be out by a factor of     think what the ministry of finance in Sierra Leone is going to be like. When I put that to the President of Sierra Leone  the next day he asked the World Bank to send him a team to give expertise on how to conduct auctions. There are five such decision points  each one needs an international standard. If we could do it  we would change the world. We would be helping the reformers in these societies  who are struggling for change. That's our modest role. We cannot change these societies  but we can help the people in these societies who are struggling and usually failing  because the odds are so stacked against them. And yet  we've not got these rules. If you think about it  the cost of promulgating international rules is zilch    nothing. Why on Earth are they not there  I realized that the reason they're not there is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies  politicians will get away with gestures. That unless we have an informed society  what politicians do  especially in relation to Africa  is gestures  things that look good  but don't work. And so I realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry. That's why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist  and I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach. However  I have to say  the process of communication does not come naturally to me. This is why I'm on this stage  but it's alarming. I grew up in a culture of self effacement. My wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks  and the blog comment said   Collier is not charismatic       but his arguments are compelling.  If you agree with that sentiment  and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry  you will realize that I need you. Please  become ambassadors. Thank you.
