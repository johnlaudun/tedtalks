I would like to share with you a new model of higher education  a model that  once expanded  can enhance the collective intelligence of millions of creative and motivated individuals that otherwise would be left behind. Look at the world. Pick up a place and focus on it. You will find humans chasing higher education. Let's meet some of them. Patrick. Patrick was born in Liberia to a family of    children. During the civil war  he and his family were forced to flee to Nigeria. There  in spite of his situation  he graduated high school with nearly perfect grades. He wanted to continue to higher education  but due to his family living on the poverty line  he was soon sent to South Africa to work and send back money to feed his family. Patrick never gave up his dream of higher education. Late at night  after work  he surfed the Net looking for ways to study. Meet Debbie. Debbie is from Florida. Her parents didn't go to college  and neither did any of her siblings. Debbie has worked all her life  pays taxes  supports herself month to month  proud of the American dream  a dream that just won't be complete without higher education. But Debbie doesn't have the savings for higher education. She can't pay the tuition. Neither could she leave work. Meet Wael. Wael is from Syria. He's firsthand experiencing the misery  fear and failure imposed on his country. He's a big believer in education. He knew that if he would find an opportunity for higher education  an opportunity to get ahead of the rest  he has a better chance to survive in a world turned upside down. The higher education system failed Patrick  Debbie and Wael  exactly as it is failing millions of potential students  millions that graduate high school  millions that are qualified for higher education  millions that want to study yet cannot access for various reasons. First  financial. Universities are expensive. We all know it. In large parts of the world  higher education is unattainable for an average citizen. This is probably the biggest problem facing our society. Higher education stopped being a right for all and became a privilege for the few. Second  cultural. Students who are qualified for higher education  can afford  want to study  cannot because it is not decent  it is not a place for a woman. This is the story of countless women in Africa  for example  prevented from higher education because of cultural barriers. And here comes the third reason  UNESCO stated that in           million students will be deprived from higher education simply because there will not be enough seats to accommodate them  to meet the demand. They will take a placement test  they will pass it  but they still won't have access because there are no places available. These are the reasons I founded University of the People  a nonprofit  tuition free  degree granting university to give an alternative  to create an alternative to those who have no other  an alternative that will be affordable and scalable  an alternative that will disrupt the current education system  open the gates to higher education for every qualified student regardless of what they earn  where they live  or what society says about them. Patrick  Debbie and Wael are only three examples out of the       accepted students from     countries. We    Applause    Thank you. We didn't need to reinvent the wheel. We just looked at what wasn't working and used the amazing power of the Internet to get around it. We set out to build a model that will cut down almost entirely the cost of higher education  and that's how we did it. First  bricks and mortar cost money. Universities have expenses that virtual universities don't. We don't need to pass these expenses onto our students. They don't exist. We also don't need to worry about capacity. There are no limits of seats in virtual university. Actually  nobody needs to stand at the back of the lecture hall. Textbooks is also something our students don't need to buy. By using open educational resources and the generosity of professors who are putting their material free and accessible  we don't need to send our students to buy textbooks. All of our materials come free. Even professors  the most expensive line in any university balance sheet  come free to our students  over       of them  including presidents  vice chancellors  professors and academic advisors from top universities such as NYU  Yale  Berkeley and Oxford  came on board to help our students. Finally  it's our belief in peer to peer learning. We use this sound pedagogical model to encourage our students from all over the world to interact and study together and also to reduce the time our professors need to labor over class assignments. If the Internet has made us a global village  this model can develop its future leadership. Look how we do it. We only offer two programs  business administration and computer science  the two programs that are most in demand worldwide  the two programs that are likeliest to help our students find a job. When our students are accepted  they are placed in a small classroom of    to    students to ensure that those who need personalized attention get it. Moreover  for every nine weeks' course  they meet a new peer  a whole new set of students from all over the world. Every week  when they go into the classroom  they find the lecture notes of the week  the reading assignment  the homework assignment  and the discussion question  which is the core of our studies. Every week  every student must contribute to the class discussion and also must comment on the contribution of others. This way  we open our students' minds  we develop a positive shift in attitude toward different cultures. By the end of each week  the students take a quiz  hand in their homework  which are assessed by their peers under the supervision of the instructors  get a grade  move to the next week. By the end of the course  they take the final exam  get a grade  and follow to the next course. We opened the gates for higher education for every qualified student. Every student with a high school diploma  sufficient English and Internet connection can study with us. We don't use audio. We don't use video. Broadband is not necessary. Any student from any part of the world with any Internet connection can study with us. We are tuition free. All we ask our students to cover is the cost of their exams      dollars per exam. A full time bachelor degree student taking    courses  will pay       dollars a year        dollars for the entire degree  and for those who cannot afford even this  we offer them a variety of scholarships. It is our mission that nobody will be left behind for financial reasons. With       students in       this model is financially sustainable. Five years ago  it was a vision. Today  it is a reality. Last month  we got the ultimate academic endorsement to our model. University of the People is now fully accredited. Thank you. With this accreditation  it's our time now to scale up. We have demonstrated that our model works. I invite universities and  even more important  developing countries' governments  to replicate this model to ensure that the gates of higher education will open widely. A new era is coming  an era that will witness the disruption of the higher education model as we know it today  from being a privilege for the few to becoming a basic right  affordable and accessible for all. Thank you. What do you think of when I say the word  design   You probably think of things like this  finely crafted objects that you can hold in your hand  or maybe logos and posters and maps that visually explain things  classic icons of timeless design. But I'm not here to talk about that kind of design. I want to talk about the kind that you probably use every day and may not give much thought to  designs that change all the time and that live inside your pocket. I'm talking about the design of digital experiences and specifically the design of systems that are so big that their scale can be hard to comprehend. Consider the fact that Google processes over one billion search queries every day  that every minute  over     hours of footage are uploaded to YouTube. That's more in a single day than all three major U.S. networks broadcast in the last five years combined. And Facebook transmitting the photos  messages and stories of over  .   billion people. That's almost half of the Internet population  and a sixth of humanity. These are some of the products that I've helped design over the course of my career  and their scale is so massive that they've produced unprecedented design challenges. But what is really hard about designing at scale is this  It's hard in part because it requires a combination of two things  audacity and humility   audacity to believe that the thing that you're making is something that the entire world wants and needs  and humility to understand that as a designer  it's not about you or your portfolio  it's about the people that you're designing for  and how your work just might help them live better lives. Now  unfortunately  there's no school that offers the course Designing for Humanity    . I and the other designers who work on these kinds of products have had to invent it as we go along  and we are teaching ourselves the emerging best practices of designing at scale  and today I'd like share some of the things that we've learned over the years. Now  the first thing that you need to know about designing at scale is that the little things really matter. Here's a really good example of how a very tiny design element can make a big impact. The team at Facebook that manages the Facebook  Like  button decided that it needed to be redesigned. The button had kind of gotten out of sync with the evolution of our brand and it needed to be modernized. Now you might think  well  it's a tiny little button  it probably is a pretty straightforward  easy design assignment  but it wasn't. Turns out  there were all kinds of constraints for the design of this button. You had to work within specific height and width parameters. You had to be careful to make it work in a bunch of different languages  and be careful about using fancy gradients or borders because it has to degrade gracefully in old web browsers. The truth is  designing this tiny little button was a huge pain in the butt. Now  this is the new version of the button  and the designer who led this project estimates that he spent over     hours redesigning this button over the course of months. Now  why would we spend so much time on something so small  It's because when you're designing at scale  there's no such thing as a small detail. This innocent little button is seen on average    billion times a day and on over  .  million websites. It's one of the single most viewed design elements ever created. Now that's a lot of pressure for a little button and the designer behind it  but with these kinds of products  you need to get even the tiny things right. Now  the next thing that you need to understand is how to design with data. Now  when you're working on products like this  you have incredible amounts of information about how people are using your product that you can then use to influence your design decisions  but it's not just as simple as following the numbers. Let me give you an example so that you can understand what I mean. Facebook has had a tool for a long time that allowed people to report photos that may be in violation of our community standards  things like spam and abuse. And there were a ton of photos reported  but as it turns out  only a small percentage were actually in violation of those community standards. Most of them were just your typical party photo. Now  to give you a specific hypothetical example  let's say my friend Laura hypothetically uploads a picture of me from a drunken night of karaoke. This is purely hypothetical  I can assure you. Now  incidentally  you know how some people are kind of worried that their boss or employee is going to discover embarrassing photos of them on Facebook  Do you know how hard that is to avoid when you actually work at Facebook  So anyway  there are lots of these photos being erroneously reported as spam and abuse  and one of the engineers on the team had a hunch. He really thought there was something else going on and he was right  because when he looked through a bunch of the cases  he found that most of them were from people who were requesting the takedown of a photo of themselves. Now this was a scenario that the team never even took into account before. So they added a new feature that allowed people to message their friend to ask them to take the photo down. But it didn't work. Only    percent of people sent the message to their friend. So the team went back at it. They consulted with experts in conflict resolution. They even studied the universal principles of polite language  which I didn't even actually know existed until this research happened. And they found something really interesting. They had to go beyond just helping people ask their friend to take the photo down. They had to help people express to their friend how the photo made them feel. Here's how the experience works today. So I find this hypothetical photo of myself  and it's not spam  it's not abuse  but I really wish it weren't on the site. So I report it and I say   I'm in this photo and I don't like it   and then we dig deeper. Why don't you like this photo of yourself  And I select  It's embarrassing.  And then I'm encouraged to message my friend  but here's the critical difference. I'm provided specific suggested language that helps me communicate to Laura how the photo makes me feel. Now the team found that this relatively small change had a huge impact. Before  only    percent of people were sending the message  and now    percent were  and surveys showed that people on both sides of the conversation felt better as a result. That same survey showed that    percent of your friends want to know if they've done something to upset you. Now I don't know who the other    percent are  but maybe that's where our  Unfriend  feature can come in handy. So as you can see  these decisions are highly nuanced. Of course we use a lot of data to inform our decisions  but we also rely very heavily on iteration  research  testing  intuition  human empathy. It's both art and science. Now  sometimes the designers who work on these products are called  data driven   which is a term that totally drives us bonkers. The fact is  it would be irresponsible of us not to rigorously test our designs when so many people are counting on us to get it right  but data analytics will never be a substitute for design intuition. Data can help you make a good design great  but it will never made a bad design good. The next thing that you need to understand as a principle is that when you introduce change  you need to do it extraordinarily carefully. Now I often have joked that I spend almost as much time designing the introduction of change as I do the change itself  and I'm sure that we can all relate to that when something that we use a lot changes and then we have to adjust. The fact is  people can become very efficient at using bad design  and so even if the change is good for them in the long run  it's still incredibly frustrating when it happens  and this is particularly true with user generated content platforms  because people can rightfully claim a sense of ownership. It is  after all  their content. Now  years ago  when I was working at YouTube  we were looking for ways to encourage more people to rate videos  and it was interesting because when we looked into the data  we found that almost everyone was exclusively using the highest five star rating  a handful of people were using the lowest one star  and virtually no one was using two  three or four stars. So we decided to simplify into an up down kind of voting binary model. It's going to be much easier for people to engage with. But people were very attached to the five star rating system. Video creators really loved their ratings. Millions and millions of people were accustomed to the old design. So in order to help people prepare themselves for change and acclimate to the new design more quickly  we actually published the data graph sharing with the community the rationale for what we were going to do  and it even engaged the larger industry in a conversation  which resulted in my favorite TechCrunch headline of all time   YouTube Comes to a   Star Realization  Its Ratings Are Useless.  Now  it's impossible to completely avoid change aversion when you're making changes to products that so many people use. Even though we tried to do all the right things  we still received our customary flood of video protests and angry emails and even a package that had to be scanned by security  but we have to remember people care intensely about this stuff  and it's because these products  this work  really  really matters to them. Now  we know that we have to be careful about paying attention to the details  we have to be cognizant about how we use data in our design process  and we have to introduce change very  very carefully. Now  these things are all really useful. They're good best practices for designing at scale. But they don't mean anything if you don't understand something much more fundamental. You have to understand who you are designing for. Now  when you set a goal to design for the entire human race  and you start to engage in that goal in earnest  at some point you run into the walls of the bubble that you're living in. Now  in San Francisco  we get a little miffed when we hit a dead cell zone because we can't use our phones to navigate to the new hipster coffee shop. But what if you had to drive four hours to charge your phone because you had no reliable source of electricity  What if you had no access to public libraries  What if your country had no free press  What would these products start to mean to you  This is what Google  YouTube and Facebook look like to most of the world  and it's what they'll look like to most of the next five billion people to come online. Designing for low end cell phones is not glamorous design work  but if you want to design for the whole world  you have to design for where people are  and not where you are. So how do we keep this big  big picture in mind  We try to travel outside of our bubble to see  hear and understand the people we're designing for. We use our products in non English languages to make sure that they work just as well. And we try to use one of these phones from time to time to keep in touch with their reality. So what does it mean to design at a global scale  It means difficult and sometimes exasperating work to try to improve and evolve products. Finding the audacity and the humility to do right by them can be pretty exhausting  and the humility part  it's a little tough on the design ego. Because these products are always changing  everything that I've designed in my career is pretty much gone  and everything that I will design will fade away. But here's what remains  the never ending thrill of being a part of something that is so big  you can hardly get your head around it  and the promise that it just might change the world. Thank you. This year  Germany is celebrating the   th anniversary of the peaceful revolution in East Germany. In       the Communist regime was moved away  the Berlin Wall came down  and one year later  the German Democratic Republic  the GDR  in the East was unified with the Federal Republic of Germany in the West to found today's Germany. Among many other things  Germany inherited the archives of the East German secret police  known as the Stasi. Only two years after its dissolution  its documents were opened to the public  and historians such as me started to study these documents to learn more about how the GDR surveillance state functioned. Perhaps you have watched the movie  The Lives of Others.  This movie made the Stasi known worldwide  and as we live in an age where words such as  surveillance  or  wiretapping  are on the front pages of newspapers  I would like to speak about how the Stasi really worked. At the beginning  let's have a short look at the history of the Stasi  because it's really important for understanding its self conception. Its origins are located in Russia. In       the Russian Communists founded the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter Revolution and Sabotage  shortly Cheka. It was led by Felix Dzerzhinsky. The Cheka was an instrument of the Communists to establish their regime by terrorizing the population and executing their enemies. It evolved later into the well known KGB. The Cheka was the idol of the Stasi officers. They called themselves Chekists  and even the emblem was very similar  as you can see here. In fact  the secret police of Russia was the creator and instructor of the Stasi. When the Red Army occupied East Germany in       it immediately expanded there  and soon it started to train the German Communists to build up their own secret police. By the way  in this hall where we are now  the ruling party of the GDR was founded in     . Five years later  the Stasi was established  and step by step  the dirty job of oppression was handed over to it. For instance  the central jail for political prisoners  which was established by the Russians  was taken over by the Stasi and used until the end of Communism. You see it here. At the beginning  every important step took place under the attendance of the Russians. But the Germans are known to be very effective  so the Stasi grew very quickly  and already in       it had more employees than the Gestapo had  the secret police of Nazi Germany. The number doubled in each decade. In       more than        employees worked for the Stasi. This meant that one employee was responsible for     inhabitants  which was really unique in the world. At the top of this tremendous apparatus  there was one man  Erich Mielke. He ruled the Ministry of State Security for more than    years. He was a scrupulous functionary   in his past  he killed two policemen not far away from here   who in fact personalized the Stasi. But what was so exceptional about the Stasi  Foremost  it was its enormous power  because it united different functions in one organization. First of all  the Stasi was an intelligence service. It used all the imaginable instruments for getting information secretly  such as informers  or tapping phones  as you can see it on the picture here. And it was not only active in East Germany  but all over the world. Secondly  the Stasi was a secret police. It could stop people on the street and arrest them in its own prisons. Thirdly  the Stasi worked as a kind of public prosecutor. It had the right to open preliminary investigations and to interrogate people officially. Last but not least  the Stasi had its own armed forces. More than        soldiers were serving in its so called Guards Regiment. It was founded to crash down protests and uprisings. Due to this concentration of power  the Stasi was called a state in the state. But let's look in more and more detail at the tools of the Stasi. Please keep in mind that at that time the web and smartphones were not yet invented. Of course  the Stasi used all kinds of technical instruments to survey people. Telephones were wiretapped  including the phone of the German chancellor in the West  and often also the apartments. Every day         letters were being opened by these machines. The Stasi also shadowed tens of thousands of people using specially trained agents and secret cameras to document every step one took. In this picture  you can see me as a young man just in front of this building where we are now  photographed by a Stasi agent. The Stasi even collected the smell of people. It stored samples of it in closed jars which were found after the peaceful revolution. For all these tasks  highly specialized departments were responsible. The one which was tapping phone calls was completely separated from the one which controlled the letters  for good reasons  because if one agent quit the Stasi  his knowledge was very small. Contrast that with Snowden  for example. But the vertical specialization was also important to prevent all kinds of empathy with the object of observation. The agent who shadowed me didn't know who I was or why I was surveyed. In fact  I smuggled forbidden books from West to East Germany. But what was even more typical for the Stasi was the use of human intelligence  people who reported secretly to the Stasi. For the Minister of State Security  these so called unofficial employees were the most important tools. From      on  nearly         people collaborated constantly with the Stasi  more than one percent of the population. And in a way  the minister was right  because technical instruments can only register what people are doing  but agents and spies can also report what people are planning to do and what they are thinking. Therefore  the Stasi recruited so many informants. The system of how to get them and how to educate them  as it was called  was very sophisticated. The Stasi had its own university  not far away from here  where the methods were explored and taught to the officers. This guideline gave a detailed description of every step you have to take if you want to convince human beings to betray their fellow citizens. Sometimes it's said that informants were pressured to becoming one  but that's mostly not true  because a forced informant is a bad informant. Only someone who wants to give you the information you need is an effective whistleblower. The main reasons why people cooperated with the Stasi were political conviction and material benefits. The officers also tried to create a personal bond between themselves and the informant  and to be honest  the example of the Stasi shows that it's not so difficult to win someone in order to betray others. Even some of the top dissidents in East Germany collaborated with the Stasi  as for instance Ibrahim B hme. In       he was the leader of the peaceful revolution and he nearly became the first freely elected Prime Minister of the GDR until it came out that he was an informant. The net of spies was really broad. In nearly every institution  even in the churches or in West Germany  there were many of them. I remember telling a leading Stasi officer   If you had sent an informant to me  I would surely have recognized him.  His answer was   We didn't send anyone. We took those who were around you.  And in fact  two of my best friends reported about me to the Stasi. Not only in my case  informers were very close. For example  Vera Lengsfeld  another leading dissident  in her case it was her husband who spied on her. A famous writer was betrayed by his brother. This reminds me of the novel        by George Orwell  where the only apparently trustable person was an informer. But why did the Stasi collect all this information in its archives  The main purpose was to control the society. In nearly every speech  the Stasi minister gave the order to find out who is who  which meant who thinks what. He didn't want to wait until somebody tried to act against the regime. He wanted to know in advance what people were thinking and planning. The East Germans knew  of course  that they were surrounded by informers  in a totalitarian regime that created mistrust and a state of widespread fear  the most important tools to oppress people in any dictatorship. That's why not many East Germans tried to fight against the Communist regime. If yes  the Stasi often used a method which was really diabolic. It was called Zersetzung  and it's described in another guideline. The word is difficult to translate because it means originally  biodegradation.  But actually  it's a quite accurate description. The goal was to destroy secretly the self confidence of people  for example by damaging their reputation  by organizing failures in their work  and by destroying their personal relationships. Considering this  East Germany was a very modern dictatorship. The Stasi didn't try to arrest every dissident. It preferred to paralyze them  and it could do so because it had access to so much personal information and to so many institutions. Detaining someone was used only as a last resort. For this  the Stasi owned    remand prisons  one in every district. Here  the Stasi also developed quite modern methods of detention. Normally  the interrogation officer didn't torture the prisoner. Instead  he used a sophisticated system of psychological pressure in which strict isolation was central. Nearly no prisoner resisted without giving a testimony. If you have the occasion  do visit the former Stasi prison in Berlin and attend a guided tour with a former political prisoner who will explain to you how this worked. One more question needs to be answered  If the Stasi were so well organized  why did the Communist regime collapse  First  in       the leadership in East Germany was uncertain what to do against the growing protest of people. It was especially confused because in the mother country of socialism  the Soviet Union  a more liberal policy took place. In addition  the regime was dependent on the loans from the West. Therefore  no order to crash down the uprising was given to the Stasi. Secondly  in the Communist ideology  there's no place for criticism. Instead  the leadership stuck to the belief that socialism is a perfect system  and the Stasi had to confirm that  of course. The consequence was that despite all the information  the regime couldn't analyze its real problems  and therefore it couldn't solve them. In the end  the Stasi died because of the structures that it was charged with protecting. The ending of the Stasi was something tragic  because these officers were kept busy during the peaceful revolution with only one thing  to destroy the documents they had produced during decades. Fortunately  they had been stopped by human rights activists. That's why today we can use the files to get a better understanding of how a surveillance state functions. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you. Thank you very much. So Hubertus  I want to ask you a couple of questions because I have here Der Spiegel from last week.  Mein Nachbar NSA.  My neighbor  the NSA. And you just told us about my neighbor  the spies and the informant from East Germany. So there is a direct link between these two stories or there isn't  What's your reaction as a historian when you see this  Hubertus Knabe  I think there are several aspects to mention. At first  I think there's a difference of why you are collecting this data. Are you doing that for protecting your people against terrorist attacks  or are you doing that for oppressing your people  So that makes a fundamental difference. But on the other hand  also in a democracy  these instruments can be abused  and that is something where we really have to be aware to stop that  and that also the intelligence services are respecting the rules we have. The third point  probably  we really can be happy that we live in a democracy  because you can be sure that Russia and China are doing the same  but nobody speaks about that because nobody could do that. BG  When the story came out first  last July  last year  you filed a criminal complaint with a German tribunal. Why  HK  Yeah  I did so because of the second point I mentioned  that I think especially in a democracy  the rules are for everybody. They are made for everybody  so it's not allowed that any institution doesn't respect the rules. In the criminal code of Germany  it's written that it's not allowed to tap somebody without the permission of the judge. Fortunately  it's written in the criminal code of Germany  so if it's not respected  then I think an investigation is necessary  and it took a very long time that the public prosecutor of Germany started this  and he started it only in the case of Angela Merkel  and not in the case of all the other people living in Germany. BG  That doesn't surprise me because   because of the story you told. Seen from the outside  I live outside of Germany  and I expected the Germans to react much more strongly  immediately. And instead  the reaction really came only when Chancellor Merkel was revealed as being wiretapped. Why so  HK  I take it as a good sign  because people feel secure in this democracy. They aren't afraid that they will be arrested  and if you leave this hall after the conference  nobody has to be afraid that the secret police is standing out and is arresting you. So that's a good sign  I think. People are not really scared  as they could be. But of course  I think  the institutions are responsible to stop illegal actions in Germany or wherever they happen. BG  A personal question  and this is the last one. There has been a debate in Germany about granting asylum to Edward Snowden. Would you be in favor or against  HK  Oh  that's a difficult question  but if you ask me  and if I answer honestly  I would give him the asylum  because I think it was really brave what he did  and he destroyed his whole life and his family and everything. So I think  for these people  we should do something  and especially if you see the German history  where so many people had to escape and they asked for asylum in other countries and they didn't get it  so it would be a good sign to give him asylum. BG  Hubertus  thank you very much. Take a look at this drawing. Can you tell what it is  I'm a molecular biologist by training  and I've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings. They're usually referred to as a model figure  a drawing that shows how we think a cellular or molecular process occurs. This particular drawing is of a process called clathrin mediated endocytosis. It's a process by which a molecule can get from the outside of the cell to the inside by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle that then gets internalized by the cell. There's a problem with this drawing  though  and it's mainly in what it doesn't show. From lots of experiments  from lots of different scientists  we know a lot about what these molecules look like  how they move around in the cell  and that this is all taking place in an incredibly dynamic environment. So in collaboration with a clathrin expert Tomas Kirchhausen  we decided to create a new kind of model figure that showed all of that. So we start outside of the cell. Now we're looking inside. Clathrin are these three legged molecules that can self assemble into soccer ball like shapes. Through connections with a membrane  clathrin is able to deform the membrane and form this sort of a cup that forms this sort of a bubble  or a vesicle  that's now capturing some of the proteins that were outside of the cell. Proteins are coming in now that basically pinch off this vesicle  making it separate from the rest of the membrane  and now clathrin is basically done with its job  and so proteins are coming in now   we've covered them yellow and orange   that are responsible for taking apart this clathrin cage. And so all of these proteins can get basically recycled and used all over again. These processes are too small to be seen directly  even with the best microscopes  so animations like this provide a really powerful way of visualizing a hypothesis. Here's another illustration  and this is a drawing of how a researcher might think that the HIV virus gets into and out of cells. And again  this is a vast oversimplification and doesn't begin to show what we actually know about these processes. You might be surprised to know that these simple drawings are the only way that most biologists visualize their molecular hypotheses. Why  Because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really hard. I spent months in Hollywood learning  D animation software  and I spend months on each animation  and that's just time that most researchers can't afford. The payoffs can be huge  though. Molecular animations are unparalleled in their ability to convey a great deal of information to broad audiences with extreme accuracy. And I'm working on a new project now called  The Science of HIV  where I'll be animating the entire life cycle of the HIV virus as accurately as possible and all in molecular detail. The animation will feature data from thousands of researchers collected over decades  data on what this virus looks like  how it's able to infect cells in our body  and how therapeutics are helping to combat infection. Over the years  I found that animations aren't just useful for communicating an idea  but they're also really useful for exploring a hypothesis. Biologists for the most part are still using a paper and pencil to visualize the processes they study  and with the data we have now  that's just not good enough anymore. The process of creating an animation can act as a catalyst that allows researchers to crystalize and refine their own ideas. One researcher I worked with who works on the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases came up with experiments that were related directly to the animation that she and I worked on together  and in this way  animation can feed back into the research process. I believe that animation can change biology. It can change the way that we communicate with one another  how we explore our data and how we teach our students. But for that change to happen  we need more researchers creating animations  and toward that end  I brought together a team of biologists  animators and programmers to create a new  free  open source software   we call it Molecular Flipbook   that's created just for biologists just to create molecular animations. From our testing  we've found that it only takes    minutes for a biologist who has never touched animation software before to create her first molecular animation of her own hypothesis. We're also building an online database where anyone can view  download and contribute their own animations. We're really excited to announce that the beta version of the molecular animation software toolkit will be available for download today. We are really excited to see what biologists will create with it and what new insights they're able to gain from finally being able to animate their own model figures. Thank you. I didn't know when I agreed to do this whether I was expected to talk or to sing. But when I was told that the topic was language  I felt that I had to speak about something for a moment. I have a problem. It's not the worst thing in the world. I'm fine. I'm not on fire. I know that other people in the world have far worse things to deal with  but for me  language and music are inextricably linked through this one thing. And the thing is that I have a stutter. It might seem curious given that I spend a lot of my life on the stage. One would assume that I'm comfortable in the public sphere and comfortable here  speaking to you guys. But the truth is that I've spent my life up until this point and including this point  living in mortal dread of public speaking. Public singing  whole different thing.  Laughter  But we'll get to that in a moment. I've never really talked about it before so explicitly. I think that that's because I've always lived in hope that when I was a grown up  I wouldn't have one. I sort of lived with this idea that when I'm grown  I'll have learned to speak French  and when I'm grown  I'll learn how to manage my money  and when I'm grown  I won't have a stutter  and then I'll be able to public speak and maybe be the prime minister and anything's possible and  you know. So I can talk about it now because I've reached this point  where   I mean  I'm   . I'm pretty sure that I'm grown now. And I'm an adult woman who spends her life as a performer  with a speech impediment. So  I might as well come clean about it. There are some interesting angles to having a stutter. For me  the worst thing that can happen is meeting another stutterer. This happened to me in Hamburg  when this guy  we met and he said   Hello  m m m my name is Joe   and I said   Oh  hello  m m m my name is Meg.  Imagine my horror when I realized he thought I was making fun of him. People think I'm drunk all the time. People think that I've forgotten their name when I hesitate before saying it. And it is a very weird thing  because proper nouns are the worst. If I'm going to use the word  Wednesday  in a sentence  and I'm coming up to the word  and I can feel that I'm going to stutter or something  I can change the word to  tomorrow   or  the day after Tuesday   or something else. It's clunky  but you can get away with it  because over time I've developed this loophole method of using speech where right at the last minute you change the thing and you trick your brain. But with people's names  you can't change them. When I was singing a lot of jazz  I worked a lot with a pianist whose name was Steve. As you can probably gather  S's and T's  together or independently  are my kryptonite. But I would have to introduce the band over this rolling vamp  and when I got around to Steve  I'd often find myself stuck on the  St.  And it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable  and it totally kills the vibe. So after a few instances of this  Steve happily became  Seve   and we got through it that way.  Laughter  I've had a lot of therapy  and a common form of treatment is to use this technique that's called smooth speech  which is where you almost sing everything that you say. You kind of join everything together in this very singsong  kindergarten teacher way  and it makes you sound very serene  like you've had lots of Valium  and everything is calm.  Laughter  That's not actually me. And I do use that. I do. I use it when I have to be on panel shows  or when I have to do radio interviews  when the economy of airtime is paramount. I get through it that way for my job. But as an artist who feels that their work is based solely on a platform of honesty and being real  that feels often like cheating. Which is why before I sing  I wanted to tell you what singing means to me. It's more than making nice sounds  and it's more than making nice songs. It's more than feeling known  or understood. It's more than making you feel the things that I feel. It's not about mythology  or mythologizing myself to you. Somehow  through some miraculous synaptic function of the human brain  it's impossible to stutter when you sing. And when I was younger  that was a method of treatment that worked very well for me  singing  so I did it a lot. And that's why I'm here today. Thank you. Singing for me is sweet relief. It is the only time when I feel fluent. It is the only time when what comes out of my mouth is comprehensively exactly what I intended. So I know that this is a TED Talk  but now i'm going to TED sing. This is a song that I wrote last year. Thank you very much. Thank you.   I would be a beauty     but my nose     is slightly too big     for my face     And I would be a dreamer     but my dream     is slightly too big     for this space     And I would be an angel     but my halo     it pales in the glow     of your grace     And I would be a joker     but that card looks silly when you play     your ace     I'd like to know     Are there stars in hell      And I'd like to know     know if you can tell     that you make me lose everything I know     That I cannot choose to or not let go     And I'd stay forever     but my home     is slightly too far     from this place     And I swear I tried to     slow it down     when I am walking at your pace     But all I could think     idling through the cities     do I look pretty in the rain      And I don't know how someone     quite so lovely     makes me feel ugly     So much shame     And I'd like to know     Are there stars in hell      And I'd like to know     know if you can tell     that you make me lose everything I know     that I cannot choose to or not let go   Thank you very much.  Applause  As a kid I always loved information that I could get from data and the stories that could be told with numbers. I remember  growing up  I'd be frustrated at how my own parents would lie to me using numbers.  Talithia  if I've told you once  I've told you a thousand times.  No dad  you've only told me    times and twice it wasn't my fault.  Laughter  I think that is one of the reasons I got a Ph.D. in statistics. I always wanted to know  what are people trying to hide with numbers  As a statistician  I want people to show me the data so I can decide for myself. Donald and I were pregnant with our third child and we were at about    and a half weeks  what some of you may refer to as being overdue. Statisticians  we call that being within the    percent confidence interval. And at this point in the process we had to come in every couple of days to do a stress test on the baby  and this is just routine  it tests whether or not the baby  is feeling any type of undue stress. And you are rarely  if ever  seen by your actual doctor  just whoever happens to be  working at the hospital that day. So we go in for a stress test and after    minutes the doctor comes out and he says   Your baby is under stress  we need to induce you.  Now  as a statistician  what's my response  Show me the data  So then he proceeds to tell us the baby's heart rate trace went from    minutes  the baby's heart rate was in the normal zone and for two minutes it was in what appeared to be my heart rate zone and I said   Is it possible that maybe this was my heart rate  I was moving around a little bit  it's hard to lay still on your back     weeks pregnant for    minutes. Maybe it was shifting around.  He said   Well  we don't want to take any chances.  I said okay. I said   What if I was at    weeks with this same data  Would your decision be to induce    Well  no  I would wait until you were at least    weeks  but you are almost     there is no reason to leave that baby inside  let's get you a room.  I said   Well  why don't we just do it again  We can collect more data. I can try to be really still for    minutes. We can average the two and see what that means.  Laughter  And he goes   Ma'am  I just don't want you to have a miscarriage.  That makes three of us. And then he says   Your chances of having a miscarriage double when you go past your due date. Let's get you a room.  Wow. So now as a statistician  what's my response  Show me the data  Dude  you're talking chances  I do chances all day long  tell me all about chances. Let's talk chances.  Laughter  Let's talk chances. So I say   Okay  great. Do I go from a    percent  chance to a    percent chance  Where are we here with this miscarriage thing  And he goes   Not quite  but it doubles  and we really just want what's best for the baby.  Undaunted  I try a different angle. I said   Okay  out of       full term pregnant women  how many of them are going to miscarry just before their due date  And then he looks at me and looks at Donald  and he goes  about one in      . I said   Okay  so of those       women  how many are going to miscarry just after their due date    About two.   Laughter  I said   Okay  so you are telling me that my chances go from a  .  percent chance to a  .  percent chance.  Okay  so at this point the data is not convincing us that we need to be induced  and so then we proceed to have a conversation about how inductions lead to a higher rate of Cesarean sections  and if at all  possible we'd like to avoid that. And then I said   And I really don't think my due date is accurate.  And so this really stunned him and he looked sort of puzzled and I said   You may not know this  but pregnancy due dates are calculated assuming that you have a standard    day cycle  and my cycle ranges   sometimes it's     sometimes it's up to      and I have been collecting the data to prove it. And so we ended up leaving the hospital  that day without being induced. We actually had to sign a waiver  to walk out of the hospital. And I'm not advocating that you not listen to your doctors  because even with our first child  we were induced at    weeks  cervical fluid was low. I'm not anti medical intervention. But why were confident to leave that day  Well  we had data that told a different story. We had been collecting data for six years. I had this temperature data  and it told a different story. In fact  we could probably pretty  accurately estimate conception. Yeah  that's a story you want to tell at your kid's wedding reception.  Laughter  I remember like it was yesterday. My temperature was a sizzling   .  degrees as I stared into your father's eyes.  Laughter  Oh  yeah. Twenty two more years  we're telling that story. But we were confident to leave  because we had been collecting data. Now  what does that data look like  Here's a standard chart of a woman's waking body temperature during the course of a cycle. So from the beginning of the menstrual cycle till the beginning of the next. You'll see that the temperature is not random. Clearly there is a low pattern at the beginning of her cycle and then you see this jump and then a higher set of temperatures at the end of her cycle. So what's happening here  What is that data telling you  Well  ladies  at the beginning of our cycle  the hormone estrogen is dominant and that estrogen causes a suppression of your body temperature. And at ovulation  your body releases an egg and progesterone takes over  pro gestation. And so your body heats up in anticipation of housing this new little fertilized egg. So why this temperature jump  Well  think about when a bird sits on her eggs. Why is she sitting on them  She wants to keep them warm  protect them and keep them warm. Ladies  this is exactly what our bodies do every month  they heat up in anticipation of keeping a new little life warm. And if nothing happens  if you are not pregnant  then estrogen takes back over and  that cycle starts all over again. But if you do get pregnant  sometimes you actually see another shift in your temperatures and it stays elevated for those whole nine months. That's why you see those pregnant  women just sweating and hot  because their temperatures are high. Here's a chart that we had about three or four years ago. We were really very excited about this chart. You'll see the low temperature level and then a shift and for about five days  that's about the time it takes for the egg to travel down the fallopian tube and implant  and then you see those temperatures  start to go up a little bit. And in fact  we had a second temperature shift  confirmed with a pregnancy test  that were indeed pregnant with our first child  very exciting. Until a couple of days later I saw some spotting and then I noticed heavy blood flow  and we had in fact had an early stage miscarriage. Had I not been taking my temperature I really would have just thought  my period was late that month  but we actually had data to show that we had miscarried this baby  and even though this data revealed a really unfortunate event in our lives  it was information that we could then take to our doctor. So if there was a fertility issue or some problem  I had data to show  Look  we got pregnant  our temperature shifted  we somehow lost this baby. What is it that we can do to help prevent this problem  And it's not just about temperatures and it's not just about fertility  we can use data about our bodies to tell us a lot of things. For instance  did you know that taking  your temperature can tell you a lot about the condition of your thyroid  So  your thyroid works a lot like  the thermostat in your house. There is an optimal temperature  that you want in your house  you set your thermostat. When it gets too cold in the house  your thermostat kicks in and says   Hey  we need to blow some heat around.  Or if it gets too hot  your thermostat registers   Turn the A.C. on. Cool us off.  That's exactly how your thyroid works in your body. Your thyroid tries to keep an optimal temperature for your body. If it gets too cold  your thyroid  says   Hey  we need to heat up.  If it gets too hot  your thyroid cools you down. But what happens when your  thyroid is not functioning well  When it doesn't function  then it shows up in your body temperatures  they tend to be lower than normal or very erratic. And so by collecting this data you can find out information about your thyroid. Now  what is it  if you had a thyroid  problem and you went to the doctor  your doctor would actually test the amount of thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood. Fine. But the problem with that test is it doesn't tell you how active the hormone is in your body. So you might have a lot of hormone present  but it might not be actively working to regulate your body temperature. So just by collecting your temperature every day  you get information about the condition of your thyroid. So  what if you don't want to take  your temperature every day  I advocate that you do  but there are tons of other things you could take. You could take your blood pressure   you could take your weight   yeah  who's excited about taking their weight every day   Laughter  Early on in our marriage  Donald had a stuffy nose and he had been taking a slew of medications to try to relieve his stuffy nose  to no avail. And so  that night he comes and  he wakes me up and he says   Honey  I can't breath out of my nose.  And I roll over and I look  and I said    Well  can you breath out of your mouth   And he goes   Yes  but I can't breath out of my nose   And so like any good wife  I rush him to the emergency room at   o'clock in the morning. And the whole time I'm driving and I'm thinking  you can't die on me now. We just got married  people will think I killed you   Laughter  And so  we get to the emergency  room  and the nurse sees us  and he can't breath out of his nose  and so she brings us to the back and the doctor says   What seems to be the problem   and  he goes   I can't breath out of my nose.  And he said   You can't breath out of your nose  No  but he can breath out of his mouth.  Laughter  He takes a step back and he looks at both of us and he says  Sir  I think I know the problem. You're having a heart attack. I'm going to order an EKG and a CAT scan for you immediately.  And we are thinking  no  no  no. It's not a heart attack. He can breathe  just out of his mouth. No  no  no  no  no. And so we go back and forth with this doctor because we think this is the incorrect diagnosis  and he's like   No really  it'll be fine  just calm down.  And I'm thinking  how do you calm down   But I don't think he's having a heart attack. And so fortunately for us  this  doctor was at the end of the shift. So this new doctor comes in  he sees us clearly distraught  with a husband who can't breath out of his nose.  Laughter  And he starts asking us questions. He says   Well  do you two exercise   We ride our bikes  we go to the gym occasionally. We move around. And he says   What were you doing  just before you came here   I'm thinking  I was sleeping  honestly. But okay  what was Donald doing just before  So Donald goes into this slew  of medications he was taking. He lists   I took this decongestant  and then I took this nasal spray   and then all of a sudden a lightbulb goes off and he says   Oh  You should never mix this  decongestant with this nasal spray. Clogs you up every time. Here  take this one instead.  He gives us a prescription. We're looking at each other  and I looked at the doctor  and I said   Why is it that it seems like you were able to accurately diagnose his condition  but this previous doctor wanted to order an EKG and a CAT scan   And he looks at us and says   Well  when a     pound man walks in the  emergency room and says he can't breath  you assume he's having a heart attack and you ask questions later.  Now  emergency room doctors are  trained to make decisions quickly  but not always accurately. And so had we had some information about our heart health to share with him  maybe we would have gotten a  better diagnosis the first time. I want you to consider the following chart  of systolic blood pressure measurements from October      to July     . You'll see that these measurements start in the prehypertension hypertension zone  but over about the course of a year and a half they move into the normal zone. This is about the heart rate of a healthy    year old. What story is this data telling you  Obviously it's the data from someone who's made a drastic transformation  and fortunately for us  that person  happens to be here today. So that     pound guy that walked  into the emergency room with me is now an even sexier and healthier     pound guy  and that's his blood pressure trace. So over the course of that year and a half Donald's eating changed and our exercise regimen changed  and his heart rate responded  his blood pressure responded to that change that he made in his body. So what's the take home message that I want you to leave with today  By taking ownership of your data just like we've done  just by taking this daily measurements about yourself  you become the expert on your body. You become the authority. It's not hard to do. You don't have to have a Ph.D. in statistics to be an expert in yourself. You don't have to have a medical degree to be your body's expert. Medical doctors  they're experts on the population  but you are the expert on yourself. And so when two of you come together  when two experts come together  the two of you are able to make a better decision than just your doctor alone. Now that you understand the power of information that you can get through personal data collection  I'd like you all to stand and raise your right hand. Yes  get it up. I challenge you to take ownership of your data. And today  I hereby confer upon you a TEDx associate's degree in elementary statistics with a concentration in time dependent data analysis with all the rights and privileges appertaining thereto. And so the next time you are in your doctor's office  as newly inducted statisticians  what should always be your response  Audience  Show me the data   Talithia Williams  I can't hear you  Audience  Show me the data  TW  One more time  Audience  Show me the data  TW  Show me the data. Thank you. You probably don't know me  but I am one of those .   percenters that you hear about and read about  and I am by any reasonable definition a plutocrat. And tonight  what I would like to do is speak directly to other plutocrats  to my people  because it feels like it's time for us all to have a chat. Like most plutocrats  I too am a proud and unapologetic capitalist. I have founded  cofounded or funded over    companies across a range of industries. I was the first non family investor in Amazon.com. I cofounded a company called aQuantive that we sold to Microsoft for  .  billion dollars. My friends and I  we own a bank. I tell you this    Laughter    unbelievable  right  I tell you this to show that my life is like most plutocrats. I have a broad perspective on capitalism and business  and I have been rewarded obscenely for that with a life that most of you all can't even imagine  multiple homes  a yacht  my own plane  etc.  etc.  etc. But let's be honest  I am not the smartest person you've ever met. I am certainly not the hardest working. I was a mediocre student. I'm not technical at all. I can't write a word of code. Truly  my success is the consequence of spectacular luck  of birth  of circumstance and of timing. But I am actually pretty good at a couple of things. One  I have an unusually high tolerance for risk  and the other is I have a good sense  a good intuition about what will happen in the future  and I think that that intuition about the future is the essence of good entrepreneurship. So what do I see in our future today  you ask  I see pitchforks  as in angry mobs with pitchforks  because while people like us plutocrats are living beyond the dreams of avarice  the other    percent of our fellow citizens are falling farther and farther behind. In       the top one percent of Americans shared about eight percent of national  income   while the bottom    percent of Americans shared    percent. Thirty years later  today  the top one percent shares over    percent of national  income   while the bottom    percent of Americans share    or   . If the trend continues  the top one percent will share over    percent of national  income  in another    years  while the bottom    percent of Americans will share just six. You see  the problem isn't that we have some inequality. Some inequality is necessary for a high functioning capitalist democracy. The problem is that inequality is at historic highs today and it's getting worse every day. And if wealth  power  and income continue to concentrate at the very tippy top  our society will change from a capitalist democracy to a neo feudalist rentier society like   th century France. That was France before the revolution and the mobs with the pitchforks. So I have a message for my fellow plutocrats and zillionaires and for anyone who lives in a gated bubble world  Wake up. Wake up. It cannot last. Because if we do not do something to fix the glaring economic inequities in our society  the pitchforks will come for us  for no free and open society can long sustain this kind of rising economic inequality. It has never happened. There are no examples. You show me a highly unequal society  and I will show you a police state or an uprising. The pitchforks will come for us if we do not address this. It's not a matter of if  it's when. And it will be terrible when they come for everyone  but particularly for people like us plutocrats. I know I must sound like some liberal do gooder. I'm not. I'm not making a moral argument that economic inequality is wrong. What I am arguing is that rising economic inequality is stupid and ultimately self defeating. Rising inequality doesn't just increase our risks from pitchforks  but it's also terrible for business too. So the model for us rich guys should be Henry Ford. When Ford famously introduced the    day  which was twice the prevailing wage at the time  he didn't just increase the productivity of his factories  he converted exploited autoworkers who were poor into a thriving middle class who could now afford to buy the products that they made. Ford intuited what we now know is true  that an economy is best understood as an ecosystem and characterized by the same kinds of feedback loops you find in a natural ecosystem  a feedback loop between customers and businesses. Raising wages increases demand  which increases hiring  which in turn increases wages and demand and profits  and that virtuous cycle of increasing prosperity is precisely what is missing from today's economic recovery. And this is why we need to put behind us the trickle down policies that so dominate both political parties and embrace something I call middle out economics. Middle out economics rejects the neoclassical economic idea that economies are efficient  linear  mechanistic  that they tend towards equilibrium and fairness  and instead embraces the   st century idea that economies are complex  adaptive  ecosystemic  that they tend away from equilibrium and toward inequality  that they're not efficient at all but are effective if well managed. This   st century perspective allows you to clearly see that capitalism does not work by  efficiently  allocating existing resources. It works by  efficiently  creating new solutions to human problems. The genius of capitalism is that it is an evolutionary solution finding system. It rewards people for solving other people's problems. The difference between a poor society and a rich society  obviously  is the degree to which that society has generated solutions in the form of products for its citizens. The sum of the solutions that we have in our society really is our prosperity  and this explains why companies like Google and Amazon and Microsoft and Apple and the entrepreneurs who created those companies have contributed so much to our nation's prosperity. This   st century perspective also makes clear that what we think of as economic growth is best understood as the rate at which we solve problems. But that rate is totally dependent upon how many problem solvers   diverse  able problem solvers   we have  and thus how many of our fellow citizens actively participate  both as entrepreneurs who can offer solutions  and as customers who consume them. But this maximizing participation thing doesn't happen by accident. It doesn't happen by itself. It requires effort and investment  which is why all highly prosperous capitalist democracies are characterized by massive investments in the middle class and the infrastructure that they depend on. We plutocrats need to get this trickle down economics thing behind us  this idea that the better we do  the better everyone else will do. It's not true. How could it be  I earn       times the median wage  but I do not buy       times as much stuff  do I  I actually bought two pairs of these pants  what my partner Mike calls my manager pants. I could have bought       pairs  but what would I do with them   Laughter  How many haircuts can I get  How often can I go out to dinner  No matter how wealthy a few plutocrats get  we can never drive a great national economy. Only a thriving middle class can do that. There's nothing to be done  my plutocrat friends might say. Henry Ford was in a different time. Maybe we can't do some things. Maybe we can do some things. June           Bloomberg published an article I wrote called  The Capitalist s Case for a     Minimum Wage.  The good people at Forbes magazine  among my biggest admirers  called it  Nick Hanauer's near insane proposal.  And yet  just     days after that article was published  Seattle's Mayor Ed Murray signed into law an ordinance raising the minimum wage in Seattle to    dollars an hour  more than double what the prevailing federal   .   rate is. How did this happen  reasonable people might ask. It happened because a group of us reminded the middle class that they are the source of growth and prosperity in capitalist economies. We reminded them that when workers have more money  businesses have more customers  and need more employees. We reminded them that when businesses pay workers a living wage  taxpayers are relieved of the burden of funding the poverty programs like food stamps and medical assistance and rent assistance that those workers need. We reminded them that low wage workers make terrible taxpayers  and that when you raise the minimum wage for all businesses  all businesses benefit yet all can compete. Now the orthodox reaction  of course  is raising the minimum wage costs jobs. Right  Your politician's always echoing that trickle down idea by saying things like   Well  if you raise the price of employment  guess what happens  You get less of it.  Are you sure  Because there's some contravening evidence. Since       the wages of CEOs in our country have gone from about    times the median wage to     times. That's raising the price of employment. And yet  to my knowledge  I have never seen a company outsource its CEO's job  automate their job  export the job to China. In fact  we appear to be employing more CEOs and senior managers than ever before. So too for technology workers and financial services workers  who earn multiples of the median wage and yet we employ more and more of them  so clearly you can raise the price of employment and get more of it. I know that most people think that the     minimum wage is this insane  risky economic experiment. We disagree. We believe that the     minimum wage in Seattle is actually the continuation of a logical economic policy. It is allowing our city to kick your city's ass. Because  you see  Washington state already has the highest minimum wage of any state in the nation. We pay all workers   .    which is almost    percent more than the federal minimum of  .    but crucially      percent more than the federal tipped minimum of  .  . If trickle down thinkers were right  then Washington state should have massive unemployment. Seattle should be sliding into the ocean. And yet  Seattle is the fastest growing big city in the country. Washington state is generating small business jobs at a higher rate than any other major state in the nation. The restaurant business in Seattle  Booming. Why  Because the fundamental law of capitalism is  when workers have more money  businesses have more customers and need more workers. When restaurants pay restaurant workers enough so that even they can afford to eat in restaurants  that's not bad for the restaurant business. That's good for it  despite what some restaurateurs may tell you. Is it more complicated than I'm making out  Of course it is. There are a lot of dynamics at play. But can we please stop insisting that if low wage workers earn a little bit more  unemployment will skyrocket and the economy will collapse  There is no evidence for it. The most insidious thing about trickle down economics is not the claim that if the rich get richer  everyone is better off. It is the claim made by those who oppose any increase in the minimum wage that if the poor get richer  that will be bad for the economy. This is nonsense. So can we please dispense with this rhetoric that says that rich guys like me and my plutocrat friends made our country  We plutocrats know  even if we don't like to admit it in public  that if we had been born somewhere else  not here in the United States  we might very well be just some dude standing barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit. It's not that they don't have good entrepreneurs in other places  even very  very poor places. It's just that that's all that those entrepreneurs' customers can afford. So here's an idea for a new kind of economics  a new kind of politics that I call new capitalism. Let's acknowledge that capitalism beats the alternatives  but also that the more people we include  both as entrepreneurs and as customers  the better it works. Let's by all means shrink the size of government  but not by slashing the poverty programs  but by ensuring that workers are paid enough so that they actually don't need those programs. Let's invest enough in the middle class to make our economy fairer and more inclusive  and by fairer  more truly competitive  and by more truly competitive  more able to generate the solutions to human problems that are the true drivers of growth and prosperity. Capitalism is the greatest social technology ever invented for creating prosperity in human societies  if it is well managed  but capitalism  because of the fundamental multiplicative dynamics of complex systems  tends towards  inexorably  inequality  concentration and collapse. The work of democracies is to maximize the inclusion of the many in order to create prosperity  not to enable the few to accumulate money. Government does create prosperity and growth  by creating the conditions that allow both entrepreneurs and their customers to thrive. Balancing the power of capitalists like me and workers isn't bad for capitalism. It's essential to it. Programs like a reasonable minimum wage  affordable healthcare  paid sick leave  and the progressive taxation necessary to pay for the important infrastructure necessary for the middle class like education  R and D  these are indispensable tools shrewd capitalists should embrace to drive growth  because no one benefits from it like us. Many economists would have you believe that their field is an objective science. I disagree  and I think that it is equally a tool that humans use to enforce and encode our social and moral preferences and prejudices about status and power  which is why plutocrats like me have always needed to find persuasive stories to tell everyone else about why our relative positions are morally righteous and good for everyone  like  we are indispensable  the job creators  and you are not  like  tax cuts for us create growth  but investments in you will balloon our debt and bankrupt our great country  that we matter  that you don't. For thousands of years  these stories were called divine right. Today  we have trickle down economics. How obviously  transparently self serving all of this is. We plutocrats need to see that the United States of America made us  not the other way around  that a thriving middle class is the source of prosperity in capitalist economies  not a consequence of it. And we should never forget that even the best of us in the worst of circumstances are barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit. Fellow plutocrats  I think it may be time for us to recommit to our country  to commit to a new kind of capitalism which is both more inclusive and more effective  a capitalism that will ensure that America's economy remains the most dynamic and prosperous in the world. Let's secure the future for ourselves  our children and their children. Or alternatively  we could do nothing  hide in our gated communities and private schools  enjoy our planes and yachts   they're fun   and wait for the pitchforks. Thank you. We're seen as the organization that is the bucket for failed social policy. I can't define who comes to us or how long they stay. We get the people for whom nothing else has worked  people who have fallen through all of the other social safety nets. They can't contain them  so we must. That's our job  contain them  control them. Over the years  as a prison system  as a nation  and as a society  we've become very good at that  but that shouldn't make you happy. Today we incarcerate more people per capita than any other country in the world. We have more black men in prison today than were under slavery in     . We house the parents of almost three million of our community's children  and we've become the new asylum  the largest mental health provider in this nation. When we lock someone up  that is no small thing. And yet  we are called the Department of Corrections. Today I want to talk about changing the way we think about corrections. I believe  and my experience tells me  that when we change the way we think  we create new possibilities  or futures  and prisons need a different future. I've spent my entire career in corrections  over    years. I followed my dad into this field. He was a Vietnam veteran. Corrections suited him. He was strong  steady  disciplined. I was not so much any of those things  and I'm sure that worried him about me. Eventually I decided  if I was going to end up in prison  I'd better end up on the right side of the bars  so I thought I'd check it out  take a tour of the place my dad worked  the McNeil Island Penitentiary. Now this was the early '  s  and prisons weren't quite what you see on TV or in the movies. In many ways  it was worse. I walked into a cell house that was five tiers high. There were eight men to a cell. there were     men in that living unit. And just in case you wondered  they shared one toilet in those small confines. An officer put a key in a lockbox  and hundreds of men streamed out of their cells. Hundreds of men streamed out of their cells. I walked away as fast as I could. Eventually I went back and I started as an officer there. My job was to run one of those cell blocks and to control those hundreds of men. When I went to work at our receptions center  I could actually hear the inmates  roiling from the parking lot  shaking cell doors  yelling  tearing up their cells. Take hundreds of volatile people and lock them up  and what you get is chaos. Contain and control   that was our job. One way we learned to do this more effectively was a new type of housing unit called the Intensive Management Unit  IMU  a modern version of a  hole.  We put inmates in cells behind solid steel doors with cuff ports so we could restrain them and feed them. Guess what  It got quieter. Disturbances died down in the general population. Places became safer because those inmates who were most violent or disruptive could now be isolated. But isolation isn't good. Deprive people of social contact and they deteriorate. It was hard getting them out of IMU  for them and for us. Even in prison  it's no small thing to lock someone up. My next assignment was to one of the state's deep end prisons where some of our more violent or disruptive inmates are housed. By then  the industry had advanced a lot  and we had different tools and techniques to manage disruptive behavior. We had beanbag guns and pepper spray and plexiglass shields  flash bangs  emergency response teams. We met violence with force and chaos with chaos. We were pretty good at putting out fires. While I was there  I met two experienced correctional workers who were also researchers  an anthropologist and a sociologist. One day  one of them commented to me and said   You know  you're pretty good at putting out fires. Have you ever thought about how to prevent them   I was patient with them  explaining our brute force approach to making prisons safer. They were patient with me. Out of those conversations grew some new ideas and we started some small experiments. First  we started training our officers in teams rather than sending them one or two at a time to the state training academy. Instead of four weeks of training  we gave them   . Then we experimented with an apprenticeship model where we paired new staff with veteran staff. They both got better at the work. Second  we added verbal de escalation skills into the training continuum and made it part of the use of force continuum. It was the non force use of force. And then we did something even more radical. We trained the inmates on those same skills. We changed the skill set  reducing violence  not just responding to it. Third  when we expanded our facility   we tried a new type of design. Now the biggest and most controversial component of this design  of course  was the toilet. There were no toilets. Now that might not sound significant to you here today  but at the time  it was huge. No one had ever heard of a cell without a toilet. We all thought it was dangerous and crazy. Even eight men to a cell had a toilet. That small detail changed the way we worked. Inmates and staff started interacting more often and openly and developing a rapport. It was easier to detect conflict and intervene before it escalated. The unit was cleaner  quieter  safer and more humane. This was more effective at keeping the peace than any intimidation technique I'd seen to that point. Interacting changes the way you behave  both for the officer and the inmate. We changed the environment and we changed the behavior. Now  just in case I hadn't learned this lesson  they assigned me to headquarters next  and that's where I ran straight up against system change. Now  many things work against system change  politics and politicians  bills and laws  courts and lawsuits  internal politics. System change is difficult and slow  and oftentimes it doesn't take you where you want to go. It's no small thing to change a prison system. So what I did do is I reflected on my earlier experiences and I remembered that when we interacted with offenders  the heat went down. When we changed the environment  the behavior changed. And these were not huge system changes. These were small changes  and these changes created new possibilities. So next  I got reassigned as superintendent of a small prison. And at the same time  I was working on my degree at the Evergreen State College. I interacted with a lot of people who were not like me  people who had different ideas and came from different backgrounds. One of them was a rainforest ecologist. She looked at my small prison and what she saw was a laboratory. We talked and discovered how prisons and inmates could actually help advance science by helping them complete projects they couldn't complete on their own  like repopulating endangered species  frogs  butterflies  endangered prairie plants. At the same time  we found ways to make our operation more efficient through the addition of solar power  rainwater catchment  organic gardening  recycling. This initiative has led to many projects that have had huge system wide impact  not just in our system  but in  other state systems as well  small experiments making a big difference to science  to the community. The way we think about our work changes our work. The project just made my job more interesting and exciting. I was excited. Staff were excited. Officers were excited. Inmates were excited. They were inspired. Everybody wanted to be part of this. They were making a contribution  a difference  one they thought was meaningful and important. Let me be clear on what's going on here  though. Inmates are highly adaptive. They have to be. Oftentimes  they know more about our own systems than the people who run them. And they're here for a reason. I don't see my job as to punish them or forgive them  but I do think they can have decent and meaningful lives even in prison. So that was the question  Could inmates live decent and meaningful lives  and if so  what difference would that make  So I took that question back to the deep end  where some of our most violent offenders are housed. Remember  IMUs are for punishment. You don't get perks there  like programming. That was how we thought. But then we started to realize that if any inmates needed programming  it was these particular inmates. In fact  they needed intensive programming. So we changed our thinking     degrees  and we started looking for new possibilities. What we found was a new kind of chair. Instead of using the chair for punishment  we put it in classrooms. Okay  we didn't forget our responsibility to control  but now inmates could interact safely  face to face with other inmates and staff  and because control was no longer an issue  everybody could focus on other things  like learning. Behavior changed. We changed our thinking  and we changed  what was possible  and this gives me hope. Now  I can't tell you that any of this stuff will work. What I can tell you  though  it is working. Our prisons are getting safer for both staff and inmates  and when our prisons are safe  we can put our energies into a lot more than just controlling. Reducing recidivism may be our ultimate goal  but it's not our only goal. To be honest with you  preventing crime takes so much more from so many more people and institutions. If we rely on just prisons to reduce crime  I'm afraid we'll never get there. But prisons can do some things we never thought they could do. Prisons can be the source of innovation and sustainability  repopulating endangered species and environmental restoration. Inmates can be scientists and beekeepers  dog rescuers. Prisons can be the source of meaningful work and opportunity for staff and the inmates who live there. We can contain and control and provide humane environments. These are not opposing qualities. We can't wait    to    years to find out if this is worth doing. Our strategy is not massive system change. Our strategy is hundreds of small changes that take place in days or months  not years. We need more small pilots where we learn as we go  pilots that change the range of possibility. We need new and better ways to measure impacts on engagement  on interaction  on safe environments. We need more opportunities to participate in and contribute to our communities  your communities. Prisons need to be secure  yes  safe  yes. We can do that. Prisons need to provide humane environments where people can participate  contribute  and learn meaningful lives. We're learning how to do that. That's why I'm hopeful. We don't have to stay stuck in old ideas about prison. We can define that. We can create that. And when we do that thoughtfully and with humanity  prisons can be more than the bucket for failed social policy. Maybe finally  we will earn our title  a department of corrections. Thank you. I'm a teacher and a practitioner of civics in America. Now  I will kindly ask those of you who have just fallen asleep to please wake up.  Laughter  Why is it that the very word  civics  has such a soporific   even a narcoleptic effect on us  I think it's because the very  word signifies something exceedingly virtuous   exceedingly important  and exceedingly boring. Well  I think it's the responsibility of people like us  people who show up for gatherings like this in person or online  in any way we can  to make civics sexy again  as sexy as it was during the American Revolution  as sexy as it was during the Civil Rights Movement. And I believe the way we make civics sexy again is to make explicitly about the teaching of power. The way we do that  I believe  is at the level of the city. This is what I want to talk about today  and I want to start by defining some terms and then I want to describe the scale of the problem I think we face and then suggest the ways that I believe cities can be the seat of the solution. So let me start with some definitions. By civics  I simply mean the art of being a pro social  problem solving contributor in a self governing community. Civics is the art of citizenship  what Bill Gates Sr. calls simply showing up for life  and it encompasses three things  a foundation of values  an understanding of the systems that make the world go round  and a set of skills that allow you to pursue goals and to have others join in that pursuit. And that brings me to my definition of power  which is simply this  the capacity to make others do what you would have them do. It sounds menacing  doesn't it  We don't like to talk about power. We find it scary. We find it somehow evil. We feel uncomfortable naming it. In the culture and mythology of democracy  power resides with the people. Period. End of story. Any further inquiry not necessary and not really that welcome. Power has a negative moral valence. It sounds Machiavellian inherently. It seems inherently evil. But in fact power is no more inherently good or evil than fire or physics. It just is. And power governs how any form of government operates  whether a democracy or a dictatorship. And the problem we face today  here in America in particular  but all around the world  is that far too many people  are profoundly illiterate in power   what it is  who has it  how it operates  how it flows  what part of it is visible   what part of it is not  why some people have it   why that's compounded. And as a result of this illiteracy  those few who do understand how power operates in civic life  those who understand how a bill becomes a law  yes  but also how a friendship  becomes a subsidy  or how a bias becomes a policy  or how a slogan becomes a movement  the people who understand those things wield disproportionate influence  and they're perfectly happy to fill the vacuum created by the ignorance of the great majority. This is why it is so fundamental for us right now to grab hold of this idea of power and to democratize it. One of the things that is so profoundly exciting and challenging about this moment is that as a result of this power illiteracy that is so pervasive  there is a concentration of knowledge  of understanding  of clout. I mean  think about it  How does a friendship become a subsidy  Seamlessly  when a senior government official decides to leave government and become a lobbyist for a private interest and convert his or her relationships into capital for their new masters. How does a bias become a policy  Insidiously  just the way that stop and frisk  for instance  became over time a bureaucratic numbers game. How does a slogan become a movement  Virally  in the way that the Tea Party  for instance  was able to take the  Don't Tread on Me  flag from the American Revolution  or how  on the other side  a band of activists could take a magazine headline   Occupy Wall Street   and turn that into a global meme and movement. The thing is  though  most people aren't looking for and don't want to see these realities. So much of this ignorance  this civic illiteracy  is willful. There are some millennials  for instance  who think the whole business is just sordid. They don't want to have anything to do with politics. They'd rather just opt out and engage in volunteerism. There are some techies out there who believe that the cure all for any power imbalance or power abuse is simply more data  more transparency. There are some on the left who think power resides only with corporations  and some on the right who think power resides only with government  each side blinded by their selective outrage. There are the naive who believe that good things just happen and the cynical who believe that bad things just happen  the fortunate and unfortunate alike who think that their lot is simply what they deserve rather than the eminently alterable result of a prior arrangement  an inherited allocation  of power. As a result of all of this creeping fatalism in public life  we here  particularly in America today  have depressingly low levels of civic knowledge  civic engagement  participation  awareness. The whole business of politics has been effectively subcontracted out to a band of professionals  money people  outreach people  message people  research people. The rest of us are meant to feel like amateurs in the sense of suckers. We become demotivated to learn more about how things work. We begin to opt out. Well  this problem  this challenge  is a thing that we must now confront  and I believe that when you have this kind of disengagement  this willful ignorance  it becomes both a cause and a consequence of this concentration of opportunity of wealth and clout that I was describing a moment ago  this profound civic inequality. This is why it is so important in our time right now to reimagine civics as the teaching of power. Perhaps it's never been more important at any time in our lifetimes. If people don't learn power  people don't wake up  and if they don't wake up  they get left out. Now  part of the art of practicing power means being awake and having a voice  but it also is about having an arena where you can plausibly practice deciding. All of civics boils down to the simple question of who decides  and you have to play that out in a place  in an arena. And this brings me to the third point that I want to make today  which is simply that there is no better arena in our time for the practicing of power than the city. Think about the city where you live  where you're from. Think about a problem in the common life of your city. It can be something small  like where a street lamp should go  or something medium like which library should have its hours extended or cut  or maybe something bigger  like whether a dilapidated waterfront should be turned into a highway or a greenway  or whether all the businesses in your town should be required to pay a living wage. Think about the change that you want in your city  and then think about how you would get it  how you would make it happen. Take an inventory of all the forms of power that are at play in your city's situation  money  of course  people  yes  ideas  information  misinformation  the threat of force  the force of norms. All of these form of power are at play. Now think about how you would activate or perhaps neutralize these various forms of power. This is not some Game of Thrones empire level set of questions. These are questions that play out in every single place on the planet. I'll just tell you quickly about two stories drawn from recent headlines. In Boulder  Colorado  voters not too long ago approved a process to replace the private power company  literally the power company  the electric company Xcel  with a publicly owned utility that would forego profits and attend far more to climate change. Well  Xcel fought back  and Xcel has now put in play a ballot measure that would undermine or undo this municipalization. And so the citizen activists in Boulder who have been pushing this now literally have to fight the power in order to fight for power. In Tuscaloosa  at the University of Alabama  there's an organization on campus called  kind of menacingly  the Machine  and it draws from largely white sororities and fraternities on campus  and for decades  the Machine has dominated student government elections. Well now  recently  the Machine has started to get involved in actual city politics  and they've engineered the election of a former Machine member  a young  pro business recent graduate to the Tuscaloosa city school board. Now  as I say  these are just two examples drawn almost at random from the headlines. Every day  there are thousands more like them. And you may like or dislike the efforts I'm describing here in Boulder or in Tuscaloosa  but you cannot help but admire the power literacy of the players involved  their skill. You cannot help but reckon with and recognize the command they have of the elemental questions of civic power   what objective  what strategy  what tactics  what is the terrain  who are your enemies  who are your allies  Now I want you to return to thinking about that problem or that opportunity or that challenge in your city  and the thing it was that you want to fix or create in your city  and ask yourself  do you have command of these elemental questions of power  Could you put into practice effectively what it is that you know  This is the challenge and the opportunity for us. We live in a time right now where in spite of globalization or perhaps because of globalization  all citizenship is ever more resonantly  powerfully local. Indeed  power in our time is flowing ever faster to the city. Here in the United States  the national government has tied itself up in partisan knots. Civic imagination and innovation and creativity are emerging from local ecosystems now and radiating outward  and this great innovation  this great wave of localism that's now arriving  and you see it in how people eat and work and share and buy and move and live their everyday lives  this isn't some precious parochialism  this isn't some retreat into insularity  no. This is emergent. The localism of our time is networked powerfully. And so  for instance  consider the ways that strategies for making cities more bike friendly have spread so rapidly from Copenhagen to New York to Austin to Boston to Seattle. Think about how experiments in participatory budgeting  where everyday citizens get a chance to allocate and decide upon the allocation of city funds. Those experiments have spread from Porto Alegre  Brazil to here in New York City   to the wards of Chicago. Migrant workers from Rome to Los Angeles and many cities between are now organizing to stage strikes to remind the people who live in their cities what a day without immigrants would look like. In China  all across that country  members of the New Citizens' Movement are beginning to activate and organize to fight official corruption and graft  and they're drawing the ire of officials there  but they're also drawing the attention of anti corruption activists all around the world. In Seattle  where I'm from  we've become part of a great global array of cities that are now working together bypassing government altogether  national government altogether  in order to try to meet the carbon reduction goals of the Kyoto Protocol. All of these citizens  united  are forming a web  a great archipelago of power that allows us to bypass brokenness and monopolies of control. And our task now is to accelerate this work. Our task now is to bring more and more people into the fold of this work. That's why my organization  Citizen University  has undertaken a project now to create an everyman's curriculum in civic power. And this curriculum starts with this triad that I described earlier of values  systems and skills. And what I'd like to do is to invite all of you to help create this curriculum with the stories and the experiences and the challenges that each of you lives and faces  to create something powerfully collective. And I want to invite you in particular to try a simple exercise drawn from the early frameworks of this curriculum. I want you to write a narrative  a narrative from the future of your city  and you can date it  set it out one year from now  five years from now  a decade from now  a generation from now  and write it as a case study looking back  looking back at the change that you wanted in your city  looking back at the cause that you were championing  and describing the ways that that change and that cause came  in fact  to succeed. Describe the values of your fellow citizens that you activated  and the sense of moral purpose that you were able to stir. Recount all the different ways that you engaged the systems of government  of the marketplace  of social institutions  of faith organizations  of the media. Catalog all the skills you had to deploy  how to negotiate  how to advocate  how to frame issues  how to navigate diversity in conflict  all those skills that enabled you to bring folks on board and to overcome resistance. What you'll be doing when you write that narrative is you'll be discovering how to read power  and in the process  how to write power. So share what you write  do you what you write  and then share what you do. I invite you to literally share the narratives that you create on our Facebook page for Citizen University. But even beyond that  it's in the conversations that we have today all around the world in the simultaneous gatherings that are happening on this topic at this moment  and to think about how we can become one another's teachers and students in power. If we do that  then together we can make civics sexy again. Together  we can democratize democracy and make it safe again for amateurs. Together  we can create a great network of city that will be the most powerful collective laboratory for self government this planet has ever seen. We have the power to do that. Thank you very much. Dr. Martin Luther King  Jr.  in a      speech where he reflects upon the Civil Rights Movement  states   In the end  we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends.  As a teacher  I've internalized this message. Every day  all around us  we see the consequences of silence manifest themselves in the form of discrimination  violence  genocide and war. In the classroom  I challenge my students to explore the silences in their own lives through poetry. We work together to fill those spaces  to recognize them  to name them  to understand that they don't have to be sources of shame. In an effort to create a culture within my classroom where students feel safe sharing the intimacies of their own silences  I have four core principles posted on the board that sits in the front of my class  which every student signs at the beginning of the year  read critically  write consciously  speak clearly  tell your truth. And I find myself thinking a lot about that last point  tell your truth. And I realized that if I was going to ask my students to speak up  I was going to have to tell my truth and be honest with them about the times where I failed to do so. So I tell them that growing up  as a kid in a Catholic family in New Orleans  during Lent I was always taught that the most meaningful thing one could do was to give something up  sacrifice something you typically indulge in to prove to God you understand his sanctity. I've given up soda  McDonald's  French fries  French kisses  and everything in between. But one year  I gave up speaking. I figured the most valuable thing I could sacrifice was my own voice  but it was like I hadn't realized that I had given that up a long time ago. I spent so much of my life telling people the things they wanted to hear instead of the things they needed to  told myself I wasn't meant to be anyone's conscience because I still had to figure out being my own  so sometimes I just wouldn't say anything  appeasing ignorance with my silence  unaware that validation doesn't need words to endorse its existence. When Christian was beat up for being gay  I put my hands in my pocket and walked with my head down as if I didn't even notice. I couldn't use my locker for weeks because the bolt on the lock reminded me of the one I had put on my lips when the homeless man on the corner looked at me with eyes up merely searching for an affirmation that he was worth seeing. I was more concerned with touching the screen on my Apple than actually feeding him one. When the woman at the fundraising gala said  I'm so proud of you. It must be so hard teaching those poor  unintelligent kids   I bit my lip  because apparently we needed her money more than my students needed their dignity. We spend so much time listening to the things people are saying that we rarely pay attention to the things they don't. Silence is the residue of fear. It is feeling your flaws gut wrench guillotine your tongue. It is the air retreating from your chest because it doesn't feel safe in your lungs. Silence is Rwandan genocide. Silence is Katrina. It is what you hear when there aren't enough body bags left. It is the sound after the noose is already tied. It is charring. It is chains. It is privilege. It is pain. There is no time to pick your battles when your battles have already picked you. I will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision. I will tell Christian that he is a lion  a sanctuary of bravery and brilliance. I will ask that homeless man what his name is and how his day was  because sometimes all people want to be is human. I will tell that woman that my students can talk about transcendentalism like their last name was Thoreau  and just because you watched one episode of  The Wire  doesn't mean you know anything about my kids. So this year  instead of giving something up  I will live every day as if there were a microphone tucked under my tongue  a stage on the underside of my inhibition. Because who has to have a soapbox when all you've ever needed is your voice  Thank you. TED is   . The world wide web is celebrating this month its   th anniversary. So I've got a question for you. Let's talk about the journey  mainly about the future. Let's talk about the state. Let's talk about what sort of a web we want. So    years ago  then  I was working at CERN. I got permission in the end after about a year to basically do it as a side project. I wrote the code. I was I suppose the first user. There was a lot of concern that people didn't want to pick it up because it would be too complicated. A lot of persuasion  a lot of wonderful collaboration with other people  and bit by bit  it worked. It took off. It was pretty cool. And in fact  a few years later in       five percent of the world population were using the world wide web. In       seven years later     percent. In       we formed the World Wide Web Foundation partly to look at that and worry about that figure. And now here we are in       and    percent of the world are using the world wide web  and counting. Obviously it's increasing. I want you to think about both sides of that. Okay  obviously to anybody here at TED  the first question you ask is  what can we do to get the other    percent on board as quickly as possible  Lots of important things. Obviously it's going to be around mobile. But also  I want you to think about the    percent  because if you're sitting there yourself sort of with a web enabled life  you don't remember things anymore  you just look them up  then you may feel that it's been a success and we can all sit back. But in fact  yeah  it's been a success  there's lots of things  Khan Academy for crying out loud  there's Wikipedia  there's a huge number of free e books that you can read online  lots of wonderful things for education  things in many areas. Online commerce has in some cases completely turned upside down the way commerce works altogether  made types of commerce available which weren't available at all before. Commerce has been almost universally affected. Government  not universally affected  but very affected  and on a good day  lots of open data  lots of e government  so lots of things which are visible happening on the web. Also  lots of things which are less visible. The healthcare  late at night when they're worried about what sort of cancer somebody they care about might have  when they just talk across the Internet to somebody who they care about very much in another country. Those sorts of things are not  they're not out there  and in fact they've acquired a certain amount of privacy. So we cannot assume that part of the web  part of the deal with the web  is when I use the web  it's just a transparent  neutral medium. I can talk to you over it without worrying about what we in fact now know is happening  without worrying about the fact that not only will surveillance be happening but it'll be done by people who may abuse the data. So in fact  something we realized  we can't just use the web  we have to worry about what the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing  is it in fact of a quality that we need  We revel in the fact that we have this wonderful free speech. We can tweet  and oh  lots and lots of people can see our tweets  except when they can't  except when actually Twitter is blocked from their country  or in some way the way we try to express ourselves has put some information about the state of ourselves  the state of the country we live in  which isn't available to anybody else. So we must protest and make sure that censorship is cut down  that the web is opened up where there is censorship. We love the fact that the web is open. It allows us to talk. Anybody can talk to anybody. It doesn't matter who we are. And then we join these big social networking companies which are in fact effectively built as silos  so that it's much easier to talk to somebody in the same social network than it is to talk to somebody in a different one  so in fact we're sometimes limiting ourselves. And we also have  if you've read the book about the filter bubble  the filter bubble phenomenon is that we love to use machines which help us find stuff we like. So we love it when we're bathed in what things we like to click on  and so the machine automatically feeds us the stuff that we like and we end up with this rose colored spectacles view of the world called a filter bubble. So here are some of the things which maybe threaten the social web we have. What sort of web do you want  I want one which is not fragmented into lots of pieces  as some countries have been suggesting they should do in reaction to recent surveillance. I want a web which has got  for example  is a really good basis for democracy. I want a web where I can use healthcare with privacy and where there's a lot of health data  clinical data is available to scientists to do research. I want a web where the other    percent get on board as fast as possible. I want a web which is such a powerful basis for innovation that when something nasty happens  some disaster strikes  that we can respond by building stuff to respond to it very quickly. So this is just some of the things that I want  from a big list  obviously it's longer. You have your list. I want us to use this   th anniversary to think about what sort of a web we want. You can go to webat  .org and find some links. There are lots of sites where people have started to put together a Magna Carta  a bill of rights for the web. How about we do that  How about we decide  these are  in a way  becoming fundamental rights  the right to communicate with whom I want. What would be on your list for that Magna Carta  Let's crowdsource a Magna Carta for the web. Let's do that this year. Let's use the energy from the   th anniversary to crowdsource a Magna Carta to the web.  Applause  Thank you. And do me a favor  will you  Fight for it for me. Okay  Thanks. I would like to share with you today a project that has changed how I approach and practice architecture  the Fez River Rehabilitation Project. My hometown of Fez  Morocco  boasts one of the largest walled medieval cities in the world  called the medina  nestled in a river valley. The entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since the     s  as the population of the medina grew  basic urban infrastructure such as green open spaces and sewage quickly changed and got highly stressed. One of the biggest casualties of the situation was the Fez River  which bisects the medina in its middle and has been considered for many centuries as the city's very soul. In fact  one can witness the presence of the river's extensive water network all throughout the city  in places such as private and public fountains. Unfortunately  because of the pollution of the river  it has been covered little by little by concrete slabs since     . This process of erasure was coupled with the destruction of many houses along the river banks to be able to make machineries enter the narrow pedestrian network of the medina. Those urban voids quickly became illegal parking or trash yards. Actually  the state of the river before entering the medina is pretty healthy. Then pollution takes its toll  mainly due to untreated sewage and chemical dumping from crafts such as tanning. At some point  I couldn't bear the desecration of the river  such an important part of my city  and I decided to take action  especially after I heard that the city received a grant to divert sewage water and to treat it. With clean water  suddenly the uncovering of the river became possible  and with luck and actually a lot of pushing  my partner Takako Tajima and I were commissioned by the city to work with a team of engineers to uncover the river. However  we were sneaky  and we proposed more  to convert riverbanks into pedestrian pathways  and then to connect these pathways back to the city fabric  and finally to convert the urban voids along the riverbanks into public spaces that are lacking in the Medina of Fez. I will show you briefly now two of these public spaces. The first one is the Rcif Plaza  which sits actually right on top of the river  which you can see here in dotted lines. This plaza used to be a chaotic transportation hub that actually compromised the urban integrity of the medina  that has the largest pedestrian network in the world. And right beyond the historic bridge that you can see here  right next to the plaza  you can see that the river looked like a river of trash. Instead  what we proposed is to make the plaza entirely pedestrian  to cover it with recycled leather canopies  and to connect it to the banks of the river. The second site of intervention is also an urban void along the river banks  and it used to be an illegal parking  and we proposed to transform it into the first playground in the medina. The playground is constructed using recycled tires and also is coupled with a constructed wetland that not only cleans the water of the river but also retains it when floods occur. As the project progressed and received several design awards  new stakeholders intervened and changed the project goals and design. The only way for us to be able to bring the main goals of the project ahead was for us to do something very unusual that usually architects don't do. It was for us to take our design ego and our sense of authorship and put it in the backseat and to focus mainly on being activists and on trying to coalesce all of the agendas of stakeholders and focus on the main goals of the project  that is  to uncover the river  treat its water  and provide public spaces for all. We were actually very lucky  and many of those goals happened or are in the process of happening. Like  you can see here in the Rcif Plaza. This is how it looked like about six years ago. This is how it looks like today. It's still under construction  but actually it is heavily used by the local population. And finally  this is how the Rcif Plaza will look like when the project is completed. This is the river  covered  used as a trash yard. Then after many years of work  the river with clean water  uncovered. And finally  you can see here the river when the project will be completed. So for sure  the Fez River Rehabilitation will keep on changing and adapting to the sociopolitical landscape of the city  but we strongly believe that by reimagining the role and the agency of the architect  we have set up the core idea of the project into motion  that is  to transform the river from sewage to public space for all  thereby making sure that the city of Fez will remain a living city for its inhabitants rather than a mummified heritage. Thank you very much. When my first children's book was published in       I returned to my old elementary school to talk to the students about being an author and an illustrator  and when I was setting up my slide projector in the cafetorium  I looked across the room  and there she was  my old lunch lady. She was still there at the school and she was busily preparing lunches for the day. So I approached her to say hello  and I said   Hi  Jeannie  How are you   And she looked at me  and I could tell that she recognized me  but she couldn't quite place me  and she looked at me and she said   Stephen Krosoczka   And I was amazed that she knew I was a Krosoczka  but Stephen is my uncle who is    years older than I am  and she had been his lunch lady when he was a kid. And she started telling me about her grandkids  and that blew my mind. My lunch lady had grandkids  and therefore kids  and therefore left school at the end of the day  I thought she lived in the cafeteria with the serving spoons. I had never thought about any of that before. Well  that chance encounter inspired my imagination  and I created the Lunch Lady graphic novel series  a series of comics about a lunch lady who uses her fish stick nunchucks to fight off evil cyborg substitutes  a school bus monster  and mutant mathletes  and the end of every book  they get the bad guy with their hairnet  and they proclaim   Justice is served   And it's been amazing  because the series was so welcomed into the reading lives of children  and they sent me the most amazing letters and cards and artwork. And I would notice as I would visit schools  the lunch staff would be involved in the programming in a very meaningful way. And coast to coast  all of the lunch ladies told me the same thing   Thank you for making a superhero in our likeness.  Because the lunch lady has not been treated very kindly in popular culture over time. But it meant the most to Jeannie. When the books were first published  I invited her to the book launch party  and in front of everyone there  everyone she had fed over the years  I gave her a piece of artwork and some books. And two years after this photo was taken  she passed away  and I attended her wake  and nothing could have prepared me for what I saw there  because next to her casket was this painting  and her husband told me it meant so much to her that I had acknowledged her hard work  I had validated what she did. And that inspired me to create a day where we could recreate that feeling in cafeterias across the country  School Lunch Hero Day  a day where kids can make creative projects for their lunch staff. And I partnered with the School Nutrition Association  and did you know that a little over    million kids participate in school lunch programs every day. That equals up to a little over five billion lunches made every school year. And the stories of heroism go well beyond just a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets on their lunch tray. There is Ms. Brenda in California  who keeps a close eye on every student that comes through her line and then reports back to the guidance counselor if anything is amiss. There are the lunch ladies in Kentucky who realized that    percent of their students relied on those meals every day  and they were going without food over the summer  so they retrofitted a school bus to create a mobile feeding unit  and they traveled around the neighborhoods feedings     kids a day during the summer. And kids made the most amazing projects. I knew they would. Kids made hamburger cards that were made out of construction paper. They took photos of their lunch lady's head and plastered it onto my cartoon lunch lady and fixed that to a milk carton and presented them with flowers. And they made their own comics  starring the cartoon lunch lady alongside their actual lunch ladies. And they made thank you pizzas  where every kid signed a different topping of a construction paper pizza. For me  I was so moved by the response that came from the lunch ladies  because one woman said to me  she said   Before this day  I felt like I was at the end of the planet at this school. I didn't think that anyone noticed us down here.  Another woman said to me   You know  what I got out of this is that what I do is important.  And of course what she does is important. What they all do is important. They're feeding our children every single day  and before a child can learn  their belly needs to be full  and these women and men are working on the front lines to create an educated society. So I hope that you don't wait for School Lunch Hero Day to say thank you to your lunch staff  and I hope that you remember how powerful a thank you can be. A thank you can change a life. It changes the life of the person who receives it  and it changes the life of the person who expresses it. Thank you. Oliver was an extremely dashing  handsome  charming and largely unstable male that I completely lost my heart to. He was a Bernese mountain dog  and my ex husband and I adopted him  and about six months in  we realized that he was a mess. He had such paralyzing separation anxiety that we couldn't leave him alone. Once  he jumped out of our third floor apartment. He ate fabric. He ate things  recyclables. He hunted flies that didn't exist. He suffered from hallucinations. He was diagnosed with a canine compulsive disorder and that's really just the tip of the iceberg. But like with humans  sometimes it's six months in before you realize that the person that you love has some issues. And most of us do not take the person we're dating back to the bar where we met them or give them back to the friend that introduced us  or sign them back up on Match.com. We love them anyway  and we stick to it  and that is what I did with my dog. And I was a   I'd studied biology. I have a Ph.D. in history of science from MIT  and had you asked me    years ago if a dog I loved  or just dogs generally  had emotions  I would have said yes  but I'm not sure that I would have told you that they can also wind up with an anxiety disorder  a Prozac prescription and a therapist. But then  I fell in love  and I realized that they can  and actually trying to help my own dog overcome his panic and his anxiety  it just changed my life. It cracked open my world. And I spent the last seven years  actually  looking into this topic of mental illness in other animals. Can they be mentally ill like people  and if so  what does it mean about us  And what I discovered is that I do believe they can suffer from mental illness  and actually looking and trying to identify mental illness in them often helps us be better friends to them and also can help us better understand ourselves. So let's talk about diagnosis for a minute. Many of us think that we can't know what another animal is thinking  and that is true  but any of you in relationships   at least this is my case   just because you ask someone that you're with or your parent or your child how they feel doesn't mean that they can tell you. They may not have words to explain what it is that they're feeling  and they may not know. It's actually a pretty recent phenomenon that we feel that we have to talk to someone to understand their emotional distress. Before the early   th century  physicians often diagnosed emotional distress in their patients just by observation. It also turns out that thinking about mental illness in other animals isn't actually that much of a stretch. Most mental disorders in the United States are fear and anxiety disorders  and when you think about it  fear and anxiety are actually really extremely helpful animal emotions. Usually we feel fear and anxiety in situations that are dangerous  and once we feel them  we then are motivated to move away from whatever is dangerous. The problem is when we begin to feel fear and anxiety in situations that don't call for it. Mood disorders  too  may actually just be the unfortunate downside of being a feeling animal  and obsessive compulsive disorders also are often manifestations of a really healthy animal thing which is keeping yourself clean and groomed. This tips into the territory of mental illness when you do things like compulsively over wash your hands or paws  or you develop a ritual that's so extreme that you can't sit down to a bowl of food unless you engage in that ritual. So for humans  we have the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual   which is basically an atlas of the currently agreed upon mental disorders. In other animals  we have YouTube. This is just one search I did for  OCD dog  but I encourage all of you to look at  OCD cat.  You will be shocked by what you see. I'm going to show you just a couple examples. This is an example of shadow chasing. I know  and it's funny and in some ways it's cute. The issue  though  is that dogs can develop compulsions like this that they then engage in all day. So they won't go for a walk  they won't hang out with their friends  they won't eat. They'll develop fixations like chasing their tails compulsively. Here's an example of a cat named Gizmo. He looks like he's on a stakeout but he does this for many  many  many hours a day. He just sits there and he will paw and paw and paw at the screen. This is another example of what's considered a stereotypic behavior. This is a sun bear at the Oakland Zoo named Ting Ting. And if you just sort of happened upon this scene  you might think that Ting Ting is just playing with a stick  but Ting Ting does this all day  and if you pay close attention and if I showed you guys the full half hour of this clip  you'd see that he does the exact same thing in the exact same order  and he spins the stick in the exact same way every time. Other super common behaviors that you may see  particularly in captive animals  are pacing stereotypies or swaying stereotypies  and actually  humans do this too  and in us  we'll sway  we'll move from side to side. Many of us do this  and sometimes it's an effort to soothe ourselves  and I think in other animals that is often the case too. But it's not just stereotypic behaviors that other animals engage in. This is Gigi. She's a gorilla that lives at the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston. She actually has a Harvard psychiatrist  and she's been treated for a mood disorder among other things. Many animals develop mood disorders. Lots of creatures   this horse is just one example   develop self destructive behaviors. They'll gnaw on things or do other things that may also soothe them  even if they're self destructive  which could be considered similar to the ways that some humans cut themselves. Plucking. Turns out  if you have fur or feathers or skin  you can pluck yourself compulsively  and some parrots actually have been studied to better understand trichotillomania  or compulsive plucking in humans  something that affects    million Americans right now. Lab rats pluck themselves too. In them  it's called barbering. Canine veterans of conflicts of Iraq and Afghanistan are coming back with what's considered canine PTSD  and they're having a hard time reentering civilian life when they come back from deployments. They can be too scared to approach men with beards or to hop into cars. I want to be careful and be clear  though. I do not think that canine PTSD is the same as human PTSD. But I also do not think that my PTSD is like your PTSD  or that my anxiety or that my sadness is like yours. We are all different. We also all have very different susceptibilities. So two dogs  raised in the same household  exposed to the very same things  one may develop  say  a debilitating fear of motorcycles  or a phobia of the beep of the microwave  and another one is going to be just fine. So one thing that people ask me pretty frequently  Is this just an instance of humans driving other animals crazy  Or  is animal mental illness just a result of mistreatment or abuse  And it turns out we're actually so much more complicated than that. So one great thing that has happened to me is recently I published a book on this  and every day now that I open my email or when I go to a reading or even when I go to a cocktail party  people tell me their stories of the animals that they have met. And recently  I did a reading in California  and a woman raised her hand after the talk and she said   Dr. Braitman  I think my cat has PTSD.  And I said   Well  why  Tell me a little bit about it.  So  Ping is her cat. She was a rescue  and she used to live with an elderly man  and one day the man was vacuuming and he suffered a heart attack  and he died. A week later  Ping was discovered in the apartment alongside the body of her owner  and the vacuum had been running the entire time. For many months  up to I think two years after that incident  she was so scared she couldn't be in the house when anyone was cleaning. She was quite literally a scaredy cat. She would hide in the closet. She was un self confident and shaky  but with the loving support of her family  a lot of a time  and their patience  now  three years later  she's actually a happy  confident cat. Another story of trauma and recovery that I came across was actually a few years ago. I was in Thailand to do some research. I met a monkey named Boonlua  and when Boonlua was a baby  he was attacked by a pack of dogs  and they ripped off both of his legs and one arm  and Boonlua dragged himself to a monastery  where the monks took him in. They called in a veterinarian  who treated his wounds. Eventually  Boonlua wound up at an elephant facility  and the keepers really decided to take him under their wing  and they figured out what he liked  which  it turned out  was mint Mentos and Rhinoceros beetles and eggs. But they worried  because he was social  that he was lonely  and they didn't want to put him in with another monkey  because they thought with just one arm  he wouldn't be able to defend himself or even play. And so they gave him a rabbit  and Boonlua was immediately a different monkey. He was extremely happy to be with this rabbit. They groomed each other  they become close friends  and then the rabbit had bunnies  and Boonlua was even happier than he was before  and it had in a way given him a reason to wake up in the morning  and in fact it gave him such a reason to wake up that he decided not to sleep. He became extremely protective of these bunnies  and he stopped sleeping  and he would sort of nod off while trying to take care of them. In fact  he was so protective and so affectionate with these babies that the sanctuary eventually had to take them away from him because he was so protective  he was worried that their mother might hurt them. So after they were taken away  the sanctuary staff worried that he would fall into a depression  and so to avoid that  they gave him another rabbit friend. My official opinion is that he does not look depressed. So one thing that I would really like people to feel is that you really should feel empowered to make some assumptions about the creatures that you know well. So when it comes to your dog or your cat or maybe your one armed monkey that you happen to know  if you think that they are traumatized or depressed  you're probably right. This is extremely anthropomorphic  or the assignation of human characteristics onto non human animals or things. I don't think  though  that that's a problem. I don't think that we can not anthropomorphize. It's not as if you can take your human brain out of your head and put it in a jar and then use it to think about another animal thinking. We will always be one animal wondering about the emotional experience of another animal. So then the choice becomes  how do you anthropomorphize well  Or do you anthropomorphize poorly  And anthropomorphizing poorly is all too common. It may include dressing your corgis up and throwing them a wedding  or getting too close to exotic wildlife because you believe that you had a spiritual connection. There's all manner of things. Anthropomorphizing well  however  I believe is based on accepting our animal similarities with other species and using them to make assumptions that are informed about other  animals' minds and experiences  and there's actually an entire industry that is in some ways based on anthropomorphizing well  and that is the psychopharmaceutical industry. One in five Americans is currently taking a psychopharmaceutical drug  from the antidepressants and antianxiety medications to the antipsychotics. It turns out that we owe this entire psychopharmaceutical arsenal to other animals. These drugs were tested in non human animals first  and not just for toxicity but for behavioral effects. The very popular antipsychotic Thorazine first relaxed rats before it relaxed people. The antianxiety medication Librium was given to cats selected for their meanness in the     s and made them into peaceable felines. And even antidepressants were first tested in rabbits. Today  however  we are not just giving these drugs to other animals as test subjects  but they're giving them these drugs as patients  both in ethical and much less ethical ways. SeaWorld gives mother orcas antianxiety medications when their calves are taken away. Many zoo gorillas have been given antipsychotics and antianxiety medications. But dogs like my own Oliver are given antidepressants and some antianxiety medications to keep them from jumping out of buildings or jumping into traffic. Just recently  actually  a study came out in  Science  that showed that even crawdads responded to antianxiety medication. It made them braver  less skittish  and more likely to explore their environment. It's hard to know how many animals are on these drugs  but I can tell you that the animal pharmaceutical industry is immense and growing  from seven billion dollars in      to a projected  .   billion by the year     . Some animals are on these drugs indefinitely. Others  like one bonobo who lives in Milwaukee at the zoo there was on them until he started to save his Paxil prescription and then distribute it among the other bonobos. More than psychopharmaceuticals  though  there are many  many  many other therapeutic interventions that help other creatures. And here is a place where I think actually that veterinary medicine can teach something to human medicine  which is  if you take your dog  who is  say  compulsively chasing his tail  into the veterinary behaviorist  their first action isn't to reach for the prescription pad  it's to ask you about your dog's life. They want to know how often your dog gets outside. They want to know how much exercise your dog is getting. They want to know how much social time with other dogs and other humans. They want to talk to you about what sorts of therapies  largely behavior therapies  you've tried with that animal. Those are the things that often tend to help the most  especially when combined with psychopharmaceuticals. The thing  though  I believe  that helps the most  particularly with social animals  is time with other social animals. In many ways  I feel like I became a service animal to my own dog  and I have seen parrots do it for people and people do it for parrots and dogs do it for elephants and elephants do it for other elephants. I don't know about you  I get a lot of Internet forwards of unlikely animal friendships. I also think it's a huge part of Facebook  the monkey that adopts the cat or the great dane who adopted the orphaned fawn  or the cow that makes friends with the pig  and had you asked me eight  nine years ago  about these  I would have told you that they were hopelessly sentimental and maybe too anthropomorphic in the wrong way and maybe even staged  and what I can tell you now is that there is actually something to this. This is legit. In fact  some interesting studies have pointed to oxytocin levels  which are a kind of bonding hormone that we release when we're having sex or nursing or around someone that we care for extremely  oxytocin levels raising in both humans and dogs who care about each other or who enjoy each other's company  and beyond that  other studies show that oxytocin raised even in other pairs of animals  so  say  in goats and dogs who were friends and played with each other  their levels spiked afterwards. I have a friend who really showed me that mental health is in fact a two way street. His name is Lonnie Hodge  and he's a veteran of Vietnam. When he returned  he started working with survivors of genocide and a lot of people who had gone through war trauma. And he had PTSD and also a fear of heights  because in Vietnam  he had been rappelling backwards out of helicopters over the skids  and he was givena service dog named Gander  a labradoodle  to help him with PTSD and his fear of heights. This is them actually on the first day that they met  which is amazing  and since then  they've spent a lot of time together visiting with other veterans suffering from similar issues. But what's so interesting to me about Lonnie and Gander's relationship is about a few months in  Gander actually developed a fear of heights  probably because he was watching Lonnie so closely. What's pretty great about this  though  is that he's still a fantastic service dog  because now  when they're both at a great height  Lonnie is so concerned with Gander's well being that he forgets to be scared of the heights himself. Since I've spent so much time with these stories  digging into archives  I literally spent years doing this research  and it's changed me. I no longer look at animals at the species level. I look at them as individuals  and I think about them as creatures with their own individual weather systems guiding their behavior and informing how they respond to the world. And I really believe that this has made me a more curious and a more empathetic person  both to the animals that share my bed and occasionally wind up on my plate  but also to the people that I know who are suffering from anxiety and from phobias and all manner of other things  and I really do believe that even though you can't know exactly what's going on in the mind of a pig or your pug or your partner  that that shouldn't stop you from empathizing with them. The best thing that we could do for our loved ones is  perhaps  to anthropomorphize them. Charles Darwin's father once told him that everybody could lose their mind at some point. Thankfully  we can often find them again  but only with each other's help. Thank you. These are simple objects  clocks  keys  combs  glasses. They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey. We are all familiar with these mundane  everyday objects. The fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them. Usually  they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war. These items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland  and as we speak  forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves     years after the war. And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered. During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '  s  approximately        citizens  mainly civilians  went missing  presumed killed  and another         were killed during combat operations. Most of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the hostilities  when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica fell into the hands of the Serb army. The international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide. Genocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial  political  religious or ethnic group. As much as genocide is about killing. It is also about destroying their property  their cultural heritage  and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed. Genocide is not only about the killing  it is about the denied identity. There are always traces   no such thing as a perfect crime. There are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them. These items are recovered from numerous mass graves  and the main goal of this collection of the items is a unique process of identifying those who disappeared in the killings  the first act of genocide on European soil since the Holocaust. Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified. Once recovered  these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned  analyzed  catalogued and stored. Thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on CSI. These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims  but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials. Survivors are occasionally called to try to identify these items physically  but physical browsing is extremely difficult  an ineffective and painful process. Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers are done with these objects  they become orphans of the narrative. Many of them get destroyed  believe it or not  or they get simply shelved  out of sight and out of mind. I decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse. As a storyteller  I like to give back to the community. I like to move beyond raising awareness. And in this case  someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent  unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened. Photography is about empathy  and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy. In this case  I am merely a tool  a forensic  if you like  and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document. Once all the missing persons are identified  only decaying bodies in their graves and these everyday items will remain. In all their simplicity  these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims  the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed. Thank you very much. Ten years ago  I wrote a book which I entitled  Our Final Century   Question mark. My publishers cut out the question mark.  Laughter  The American publishers changed our title to  Our Final Hour.  Americans like instant gratification and the reverse. And my theme was this  Our Earth has existed for    million centuries  but this one is special   it's the first where one species  ours  has the planet's future in its hands. Over nearly all of Earth's history  threats have come from nature   disease  earthquakes  asteroids and so forth   but from now on  the worst dangers come from us. And it's now not just the nuclear threat  in our interconnected world  network breakdowns can cascade globally  air travel can spread pandemics worldwide within days  and social media can spread panic and rumor literally at the speed of light. We fret too much about minor hazards   improbable air crashes  carcinogens in food  low radiation doses  and so forth   but we and our political masters are in denial about catastrophic scenarios. The worst have thankfully not yet happened. Indeed  they probably won't. But if an event is potentially devastating  it's worth paying a substantial premium to safeguard against it  even if it's unlikely  just as we take out fire insurance on our house. And as science offers greater power and promise  the downside gets scarier too. We get ever more vulnerable. Within a few decades  millions will have the capability to misuse rapidly advancing biotech  just as they misuse cybertech today. Freeman Dyson  in a TED Talk  foresaw that children will design and create new organisms just as routinely as his generation played with chemistry sets. Well  this may be on the science fiction fringe  but were even part of his scenario to come about  our ecology and even our species would surely not survive long unscathed. For instance  there are some eco extremists who think that it would be better for the planet  for Gaia  if there were far fewer humans. What happens when such people have mastered synthetic biology techniques that will be widespread by       And by then  other science fiction nightmares may transition to reality  dumb robots going rogue  or a network that develops a mind of its own threatens us all. Well  can we guard against such risks by regulation  We must surely try  but these enterprises are so competitive  so globalized  and so driven by commercial pressure  that anything that can be done will be done somewhere  whatever the regulations say. It's like the drug laws   we try to regulate  but can't. And the global village will have its village idiots  and they'll have a global range. So as I said in my book  we'll have a bumpy ride through this century. There may be setbacks to our society   indeed  a    percent chance of a severe setback. But are there conceivable events that could be even worse  events that could snuff out all life  When a new particle accelerator came online  some people anxiously asked  could it destroy the Earth or  even worse  rip apart the fabric of space  Well luckily  reassurance could be offered. I and others pointed out that nature has done the same experiments zillions of times already  via cosmic ray collisions. But scientists should surely be precautionary about experiments that generate conditions without precedent in the natural world. Biologists should avoid release of potentially devastating genetically modified pathogens. And by the way  our special aversion to the risk of truly existential disasters depends on a philosophical and ethical question  and it's this  Consider two scenarios. Scenario A wipes out    percent of humanity. Scenario B wipes out     percent. How much worse is B than A  Some would say    percent worse. The body count is    percent higher. But I claim that B is incomparably worse. As an astronomer  I can't believe that humans are the end of the story. It is five billion years before the sun flares up  and the universe may go on forever  so post human evolution  here on Earth and far beyond  could be as prolonged as the Darwinian process that's led to us  and even more wonderful. And indeed  future evolution will happen much faster  on a technological timescale  not a natural selection timescale. So we surely  in view of those immense stakes  shouldn't accept even a one in a billion risk that human extinction would foreclose this immense potential. Some scenarios that have been envisaged may indeed be science fiction  but others may be disquietingly real. It's an important maxim that the unfamiliar is not the same as the improbable  and in fact  that's why we at Cambridge University are setting up a center to study how to mitigate these existential risks. It seems it's worthwhile just for a few people to think about these potential disasters. And we need all the help we can get from others  because we are stewards of a precious pale blue dot in a vast cosmos  a planet with    million centuries ahead of it. And so let's not jeopardize that future. And I'd like to finish with a quote from a great scientist called Peter Medawar. I quote   The bells that toll for mankind are like the bells of Alpine cattle. They are attached to our own necks  and it must be our fault if they do not make a tuneful and melodious sound.  Thank you very much. In Kenya       is known as the year of the cup  or the goro goro. The goro goro is a cup used to measure two kilograms of maize flower on the market  and the maize flower is used to make ugali  a polenta like cake that is eaten together with vegetables. Both the maize and the vegetables are grown on most Kenyan farms  which means that most families can feed themselves from their own farm. One goro goro can feed three meals for an average family  and in       the whole harvest could fit in one goro goro. It was and still is one of the worst droughts in living memory. Now today  I insure farmers against droughts like those in the year of the cup  or to be more specific  I insure the rains. I come from a family of missionaries who built hospitals in Indonesia  and my father built a psychiatric hospital in Tanzania. This is me  age five  in front of that hospital. I don't think they thought I'd grow up to sell insurance.  Laughter  So let me tell you how that happened. In       I was working for the Ministry of Agriculture of Rwanda  and my boss had just been promoted to become the minister. She launched an ambitious plan to start a green revolution in her country  and before we knew it  we were importing tons of fertilizer and seed and telling farmers how to apply that fertilizer and plant. A couple of weeks later  the International Monetary Fund visited us  and asked my minister   Minister  it's great that you want to help farmers reach food security  but what if it doesn't rain   My minister answered proudly and somewhat defiantly   I am going to pray for rain.  That ended the discussion. On the way back to the ministry in the car  she turned around to me and said   Rose  you've always been interested in finance. Go find us some insurance.  It's been six years since  and last year I was fortunate enough to be part of a team that insured over         farmers in Kenya and Rwanda against drought. They owned an average of half an acre and paid on average two Euros in premium. It's microinsurance. Now  traditional insurance doesn't work with two to three Euros of premium  because traditional insurance relies on farm visits. A farmer here in Germany would be visited for the start of the season  halfway through  and at the end  and again if there was a loss  to estimate the damages. For a small scale farmer in the middle of Africa  the maths of doing those visits simply don't add up. So instead  we rely on technology and data. This satellite measures whether there were clouds or not  because think about it  If there are clouds  then you might have some rain  but if there are no clouds  then it's actually impossible for it to rain. These images show the onset of the rains this season in Kenya. You see that around March    the clouds move in and then disappear  and then around the March     the clouds really move in. That  and those clouds  were the onset of the rains this year. This satellite covers the whole of Africa and goes back as far as       and that's important  because if you know how many times a place has had a drought in the last    years  you can make a pretty good estimate what the chances are of drought in the future  and that means that you can put a price tag on the risk of drought. The data alone isn't enough. We devise agronomic algorithms which tell us how much rainfall a crop needs and when. For example  for maize at planting  you need to have two days of rain for farmers to plant  and then it needs to rain once every two weeks for the crop to properly germinate. After that  you need rain every three weeks for the crop to form its leaves  whereas at flowering  you need it to rain more frequently  about once every    days for the crop to form its cob. At the end of the season  you actually don't want it to rain  because rains then can damage the crop. Devising such a cover is difficult  but it turned out the real challenge was selling insurance. We set ourselves a modest target of     farmers insured after our first season. After a couple of months' intense marketing  we had signed up the grand total of     farmers. I was disappointed and confounded. Everybody kept telling me that farmers wanted insurance  but our prime customers simply weren't buying. They were waiting to see what would happen  didn't trust insurance companies  or thought   I've managed for so many years. Why would I buy insurance now   Now many of you know microcredit  the method of providing small loans to poor people pioneered by Muhammad Yunus  who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the Grameen Bank. Turns out  selling microcredit isn't the same as selling insurance. For credit  a farmer needs to earn the trust of a bank  and if it succeeds  the bank will advance him money. That's an attractive proposition. For insurance  the farmer needs to trust the insurance company  and needs to advance the insurance company money. It's a very different value proposition. And so the uptick of insurance has been slow  with so far only  .  percent of Africans taking up insurance in       and half of that number is in one country  South Africa. We tried for some years selling insurance directly to farmers  with very high marketing cost and very limited success. Then we realized that there were many organizations working with farmers  seed companies  microfinance institutions  mobile phone companies  government agencies. They were all providing loans to farmers  and often  just before they'd finalize the loan  the farmer would say   But what if it doesn't rain  How do you expect me to repay my loan   Many of these organizations were taking on the risk themselves  simply hoping that that year  the worst wouldn't happen. Most of the organizations  however  were limiting their growth in agriculture. They couldn't take on this kind of risk. These organizations became our customers  and when combining credit and insurance  interesting things can happen. Let me tell you one more story. At the start of February      in western Kenya  the rains started  and they started early  and when rains start early  farmers are encouraged  because it usually means that the season is going to be good. So they took out loans and planted. For the next three weeks  there wasn't a single drop of rain  and the crops that had germinated so well shriveled and died. We'd insured the loans of a microfinance institution that had provided those loans to about       farmers in that area  and we called them up and said   Look  we know about the drought. We've got you. We'll give you         Euros at the end of the season.  They said   Wow  that's great  but that'll be late. Could you give us the money now  Then these farmers can still replant and can get a harvest this season.  So we convinced our insurance partners  and later that April  these farmers replanted. We took the idea of replanting to a seed company and convinced them to price the cost of insurance into every bag of seed  and in every bag  we packed a card that had a number on it  and when the farmers would open the card  they'd text in that number  and that number would actually help us to locate the farmer and allocate them to a satellite pixel. A satellite would then measure the rainfall for the next three weeks  and if it didn't rain  we'd replace their seed. One of the first   One of the first beneficiaries of this replanting guarantee was Bosco Mwinyi. We visited his farm later that August  and I wish I could show you the smile on his face when he showed us his harvest  because it warmed my heart and it made me realize why selling insurance can be a good thing. But you know  he insisted that we get his whole harvest in the picture  so we had to zoom out a lot. Insurance secured his harvest that season  and I believe that today  we have all the tools to enable African farmers to take control of their own destiny. No more years of the cup. Instead  I am looking forward to  at least somehow  the year of the insurance  or the year of the great harvest. Thank you. Talking about empowerment is odd  because when we talk about empowerment  what affects us most are the stories. So I want to begin with an everyday story. What is it really like to be a young woman in India  Now  I've spent the last    years of my life in India  lived in three small towns  two major cities  and I've had several experiences. When I was seven  a private tutor who used to come home to teach me mathematics molested me. He would put his hand up my skirt. He put his hand up my skirt and told me he knew how to make me feel good. At     a boy from my high school circulated an email detailing all the sexually aggressive things he could do to me because I didn't pay attention to him. At     I helped a friend whose parents had forcefully married her to an older man escape an abusive marriage. At     when my friend and I were walking down the road one afternoon  a man pulled down his pants and masturbated in front of us. We called people for help  and nobody came. At     when I was walking home one evening  two men on a motorcycle attacked me. I spent two nights in the hospital recovering from trauma and injuries. So throughout my life  I've seen women   family  friends  colleagues   live through these experiences  and they seldom talk about it. So in simple words  life in India is not easy. But today I'm not going to talk to you about this fear. I'm going to talk to you about an interesting path of learning that this fear took me on. So  what happened one night in December      changed my life. So a young girl  a    year old student  boarded a bus in Delhi with her male friend. There were six men on the bus  young men who you might encounter every day in India  and the chilling account of what followed was played over and over again in the Indian and international media. This girl was raped repeatedly  forcefully penetrated with a blunt rod  beaten  bitten  and left to die. Her friend was gagged  attacked  and knocked unconscious. She died on the   th of December. And at a time when most of us here were preparing to welcome the new year  India plunged into darkness. For the first time in our history  men and women in Indian cities woke up to the horrific truth about the true state of women in the country. Now  like many other young women  I was absolutely terrified. I couldn't believe that something like this could happen in a national capital. I was angry and I was frustrated  but most of all  I felt utterly  completely helpless. But really  what do you do  right  Some write blogs  some ignore it  some join protests. I did all of it. In fact  that was what everyone was doing two years ago. So the media was filled with stories about all the horrific deeds that Indian men are capable of. They were compared to animals  sexually repressed beasts. In fact  so alien and unthinkable was this event in an Indian mind that the response from the Indian media  public and politicians proved one point  No one knew what to do. And no one wanted to be responsible for it. In fact  these were a few insensitive comments which were made in the media by prominent people in response to sexual violence against women in general. So the first one is made by a member of parliament  the second one is made by a spiritual leader  and the third one was actually the defendants' lawyer when the girl was fighting for her life and she passed away. Now  as a woman watching this day after day  I was tired. So as a writer and gender activist  I have written extensively on women  but this time  I realized it was different  because a part of me realized I was a part of that young woman too  and I decided I wanted to change this. So I did something spontaneous  hasty. I logged on to a citizen journalism platform called iReport  and I recorded a video talking about what the scene was like in Bangalore. I talked about how I felt  I talked about the ground realities  and I talked about the frustrations of living in India. In a few hours  the blog was shared widely  and comments and thoughts poured in from across the world. In that moment  a few things occurred to me. One  technology was always at hand for many young women like me. Two  like me  most young women hardly use it to express their views. Three  I realized for the first time that my voice mattered. So in the months that followed  I covered a trail of events in Bangalore which had no space in the mainstream news. In Cubbon Park  which is a big park in Bangalore  I gathered with over     others when groups of young men came forward to wear skirts to prove that clothing does not invite rape. When I reported about these events  I felt I had charge  I felt like I had a channel to release all the emotions I had inside me. I attended the town hall march when students held up signs saying  Kill them  hang them.   You wouldn't do this to your mothers or sisters.  I went to a candlelight vigil where citizens gathered together to talk about the issue of sexual violence openly  and I recorded a lot of blogs in response to how worrying the situation was in India at that point.   I am born with sisters and cousin who now live in cities and abroad but they never talk to me or complain about their daily difficulties like you say   Now  the reactions confused me. While supportive comments poured in from across the world  as did vicious ones. So some called me a hypocrite. Some called me a victim  a rape apologist. Some even said I had a political motive. But this one comment kind of describes what we are discussing here today. But I was soon to learn that this was not all. As empowered as I felt with the new liberty that this citizen journalism channel gave me  I found myself in an unfamiliar situation. So sometime last August  I logged onto Facebook and I was looking through my news feed  and I noticed there was a link that was being shared by my friends. I clicked on the link  it led me back to a report uploaded by an American girl called Michaela Cross. The report was titled   India  The story you never wanted to hear.  And in this report  she recounted her firsthand account of facing sexual harassment in India. She wrote   There is no way to prepare for the eyes  the eyes that every day stared with such entitlement at my body  with no change of expression whether I met their gaze or not. Walking to the fruit seller's or the tailor's  I got stares so sharp that they sliced away bits of me piece by piece.  She called India a traveler's heaven and a woman's hell. She said she was stalked  groped  and masturbated at. Now  late that evening  the report went viral. It was on news channels across the world. Everyone was discussing it. It had over a million views  a thousand comments and shares  and I found myself witnessing a very similar thing. The media was caught in this vicious cycle of opinion and outburst and no outcome whatsoever. So that night  as I sat wondering how I should respond  I found myself filled with doubt. You see  as a writer  I approached this issue as an observer  as an Indian  I felt embarrassment and disbelief  and as an activist  I looked at it as a defender of rights  but as a citizen journalist  I suddenly felt very vulnerable. I mean  here she was  a young woman who was using a channel to talk about her experience just as I was  and yet I felt unsettled. You see  no one ever tells you that true empowerment comes from giving yourself the permission to think and act. Empowerment is often made to sound as if it's an ideal  it's a wonderful outcome. When we talk about empowerment  we often talk about giving people access to materials  giving them access to tools. But the thing is  empowerment is an emotion. It's a feeling. The first step to empowerment is to give yourself the authority  the key to independent will  and for women everywhere  no matter who we are or where we come from  that is the most difficult step. We fear the sound of our own voice  for it means admission  but it is this that gives us the power to change our environment. Now in this situation where I was faced with so many different kinds of realities  I was unsure how to judge  because I didn't know what it would mean for me. I feared to judge because I didn't know what it would be if I didn't support the same view as this girl. I didn't know what it would mean for me if I was challenging someone else's truth. But yet  it was simple. I had to make a decision  Should I speak up or should I stay quiet  So after a lot of thought  I recorded a video blog in response  and I told Michaela  well  there are different sides to India  and I also tried to explain that things would be okay and I expressed my regret for what she had faced. And a few days later  I was invited to talk on air with her  and for the first time  I reached out to this girl who I had never met  who was so far away  but yet I felt so close to. Since this report came to light  more young people than ever were discussing sexual harassment on the campus  and the university that Michaela belonged to gave her the assistance she needed. The university even took measures to train its students to equip them with the skills that they need to confront challenges such as harassment  and for the first the time  I felt I wasn't alone. You see  if there's anything that I've learned as an active citizen journalist over the past few years  it is our dire lack as a society to actively find avenues where our voices can be heard. We don't realize that when we are standing up  we are not just standing up as individuals  we are standing up for our communities  our friends  our peers. Most of us say that women are denied their rights  but the truth is  oftentimes  women deny themselves these rights. In a recent survey in India     percent of the women who work in I.T.  aviation  hospitality and call centers  said they didn't feel safe returning home alone after work in the late hours or in the evening. In Bangalore  where I come from  this number is    percent. In rural areas in India  if anything is to go by the recent gang rapes in Badaun and acid attacks in Odisha and Aligarh are supposed to go by  we need to act really soon. Don't get me wrong  the challenges that women will face in telling their stories is real  but we need to start pursuing and trying to identify mediums to participate in our system and not just pursue the media blindly. Today  more women than ever are standing up and questioning the government in India  and this is a result of that courage. There is a sixfold increase in women reporting harassment  and the government passed the Criminal Law  Amendment  Act in      to protect women against sexual assault. As I end this talk  I just want to say that I know a lot of us in this room have our secrets  but let us speak up. Let us fight the shame and talk about it. It could be a platform  a community  your loved one  whoever or whatever you choose  but let us speak up. The truth is  the end to this problem begins with us. Thank you. So recently  some white guys and some black women swapped Twitter avatars  or pictures online. They didn't change their content  they kept tweeting the same as usual  but suddenly  the white guys noticed they were getting called the n word all the time and they were getting the worst kind of online abuse  whereas the black women all of a sudden noticed things got a lot more pleasant for them. Now  if you're my five year old  your Internet consists mostly of puppies and fairies and occasionally fairies riding puppies. That's a thing. Google it. But the rest of us know that the Internet can be a really ugly place. I'm not talking about the kind of colorful debates that I think are healthy for our democracy. I'm talking about nasty personal attacks. Maybe it's happened to you  but it's at least twice as likely to happen  and be worse  if you're a woman  a person of color  or gay  or more than one at the same time. In fact  just as I was writing this talk  I found a Twitter account called  SallyKohnSucks. The bio says that I'm a  man hater and a bull dyke and the only thing I've ever accomplished with my career is spreading my perverse sexuality.  Which  incidentally  is only a third correct. I mean  lies   Laughter  But seriously  we all say we hate this crap. The question is whether you're willing to make a personal sacrifice to change it. I don't mean giving up the Internet. I mean changing the way you click  because clicking is a public act. It's no longer the case that a few powerful elites control all the media and the rest of us are just passive receivers. Increasingly  we're all the media. I used to think  oh  okay  I get dressed up  I put on a lot of makeup  I go on television  I talk about the news. That is a public act of making media. And then I go home and I browse the web and I'm reading Twitter  and that's a private act of consuming media. I mean  of course it is. I'm in my pajamas. Wrong. Everything we blog  everything we Tweet  and everything we click is a public act of making media. We are the new editors. We decide what gets attention based on what we give our attention to. That's how the media works now. There's all these hidden algorithms that decide what you see more of and what we all see more of based on what you click on  and that in turn shapes our whole culture. Over three out of five Americans think we have a major incivility problem in our country right now  but I'm going to guess that at least three out of five Americans are clicking on the same insult oriented  rumor mongering trash that feeds the nastiest impulses in our society. In an increasingly noisy media landscape  the incentive is to make more noise to be heard  and that tyranny of the loud encourages the tyranny of the nasty. It does not have to be that way. It does not. We can change the incentive. For starters  there are two things we can all do. First  don't just stand by the sidelines when you see someone getting hurt. If someone is being abused online  do something. Be a hero. This is your chance. Speak up. Speak out. Be a good person. Drown out the negative with the positive. And second  we've got to stop clicking on the lowest common denominator  bottom feeding linkbait. If you don't like the      all Kardashian all the time programming  you've got to stop clicking on the stories about Kim Kardashian's sideboob. I know you do it.  Applause  You too  apparently. I mean  really  same example  if you don't like politicians calling each other names  stop clicking on the stories about what one guy in one party called the other guy in the other party. Clicking on a train wreck just pours gasoline on it. It makes it worse  the fire spreads. Our whole culture gets burned. If what gets the most clicks wins  then we have to start shaping the world we want with our clicks  because clicking is a public act. So click responsibly. Thank you. How many times have you used the word  awesome  today  Once  Twice  Seventeen times  Do you remember what you were describing when you used the word  No  I didn't think so  because it's come down to this  people  You're using the word incorrectly  and tonight I hope to show you how to put the  awe  back in  awesome.  Recently  I was dining at an outdoor cafe  and the server came up to our table  and asked us if we had dined there before  and I said   Yes  yes  we have.  And she said   Awesome.  And I thought   Really  Awesome or just merely good that we decided to visit your restaurant again   The other day  one of my coworkers asked me if I could save that file as a PDF  and I said   Well  of course   and he said   Awesome.  Seriously  can saving anything as a PDF be awesome  Sadly  the frequent overuse of the word  awesome  has now replaced words like  great  and  thank you.  So Webster's dictionary defines the word  awesome  as fear mingled with admiration or reverence  a feeling produced by something majestic. Now  with that in mind  was your Quiznos sandwich awesome  How about that parking space  Was that awesome  Or that game the other day  Was that awesome  The answer is no  no and no. A sandwich can be delicious  that parking space can be nearby  and that game can be a blowout  but not everything can be awesome. So when you use the word  awesome  to describe the most mundane of things  you're taking away the very power of the word. This author says   Snowy days or finding money in your pants is awesome.  Um  no  it is not  and we need to raise the bar for this poor schmuck.  Laughter  So in other words  if you have everything  you value nothing. It's a lot like drinking from a firehose like this jackass right here. There's no dynamic  there's no highs or lows  if everything is awesome. Ladies and gentlemen  here are    things that are truly awesome. Imagine  if you will  having to schlep everything on your back. Wouldn't this be easier for me if I could roll this home  Yes  so I think I'll invent the wheel. The wheel  ladies and gentlemen. Is the wheel awesome  Say it with me. Yes  the wheel is awesome  The Great Pyramids were the tallest man made structure in the world for       years. Pharaoh had his slaves move millions of blocks just to this site to erect a big freaking headstone. Were the Great Pyramids awesome  Yes  the pyramids were awesome. The Grand Canyon. Come on. It's almost    million years old. Is the Grand Canyon awesome  Yes  the Grand Canyon is. Louis Daguerre invented photography in       and earlier today  when you whipped out your smartphone and you took a shot of your awesome sandwich  and you know who you are   wasn't that easier than exposing the image to copper plates coated with iodized silver  I mean  come on. Is photography awesome  Yes  photography is awesome. D Day  June          the Allied invasion of Normandy  the largest amphibious invasion in world history. Was D Day awesome  Yes  it was awesome. Did you eat food today  Did you eat  Then you can thank the honeybee  that's the one  because if crops aren't pollinated  we can't grow food  and then we're all going to die. It's just like that. But it's not like a flower can just get up and have sex with another flower  although that would be awesome. Bees are awesome. Are you kidding me  Landing on the moon  Come on  Apollo   . Are you kidding me  Sixty six years after the Wright Brothers took off from Kitty Hawk  North Carolina  Neil Armstrong was         miles away. That's like from here to the moon. That's one small step for a man  one giant leap for awesome  You're damn right  it was. Woodstock        Rolling Stone Magazine said this changed the history of rock and roll. Tickets were only    dollars back then. You can't even buy a freaking t shirt for that now. Jimi Hendrix's version of  The Star Spangled Banner  was the most iconic. Was Woodstock awesome  Yes  it was awesome. Sharks  They're at the top of the food chain. Sharks have multiple rows of teeth that grow in their jaw and they move forward like a conveyor belt. Some sharks can lose        teeth in their lifetime. Does awesome inspire fear  Oh  hell yeah  sharks are awesome  The Internet was born in      and it instantly took over global communication  and later tonight  when all these PowerPoints are uplifted to the Internet so that a guy in Siberia can get drunk and watch this crap  the Internet is awesome. And finally  finally some of you can't wait to come up and tell me how awesome my PowerPoint was. I will save you the time. It was not awesome  but it was true  and I hope it was entertaining  and out of all the audiences I've ever had  y'all are the most recent. Thank you and good night.
