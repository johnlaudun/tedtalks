You will understand nothing with my type of English. It's good for you because you can have a break after all these fantastic people. I must tell you I am like that  not very comfortable  because usually  in life  I think my job is absolutely useless. I mean  I feel useless. Now after Carolyn  and all the other guys  I feel like shit. And definitively  I don't know why I am here  but    you know the nightmare you can have  like you are an impostor  you arrive at the opera  and they push you   You must sing   I don't know.  Laughter  So  so  because I have nothing to show  nothing to say  we shall try to speak about something else. We can start  if you want  by understanding    it's just to start  it's not interesting  but    how I work. When somebody comes to me and ask for what I am known  I mean  yes  lemon squeezer  toilet brush  toothpick  beautiful toilet seats  and why not    a toothbrush  I don't try to design the toothbrush. I don't try to say   Oh  that will be a beautiful object   or something like that. That doesn't interest me. Because there is different types of design. The one  we can call it the cynical design  that means the design invented by Raymond Loewy in the '  s  who said  what is ugly is a bad sale  la laideur se vend mal  which is terrible. It means the design must be just the weapon for marketing  for producer to make product more sexy  like that  they sell more  it's shit  it's obsolete  it's ridiculous. I call that the cynical design. After  there is the narcissistic design  it's a fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers.  Laughter  After  there is people like me  who try to deserve to exist  and who are so ashamed to make this useless job  who try to do it in another way  and they try  I try  to not make the object for the object but for the result  for the profit for the human being  the person who will use it. If we take the toothbrush    I don't think about the toothbrush. I think   What will be the effect of the brush in the mouth   And to understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth  I must imagine  Who owns this mouth  What is the life of the owner of this mouth  In what society  does  this guy live  What civilization creates this society  What animal species creates this civilization  When I arrive    and I take one minute  I am not so intelligent    when I arrive at the level of animal species  that becomes real interesting. Me  I have strictly no power to change anything. But when I come back  I can understand why I shall not do it  because today to not do it  it's more positive than do it  or how I shall do it. But to come back  where I am at the animal species  there is things to see. There is things to see  there is the big challenge. The big challenge in front of us. Because there is not a human production which exists outside of what I call  the big image.  The big image is our story  our poetry  our romanticism. Our poetry is our mutation  our life. We must remember  and we can see that in any book of my son of    years old  that life appears four billion years ago  around    four billion point two  Voice offstage  Four point five. Yes  point five  OK  OK  OK   Laughter  I'm a designer  that's all  of Christmas gifts. And before  there was this soup  called  soupe primordiale   this first soup    bloop bloop bloop    sort of dirty mud  no life  nothing. So then    pshoo shoo    lightning    pshoo    arrive    pshoo shoo    makes life    bloop bloop    and that dies. Some million years after    pshoo shoo  bloop bloop    ah  wake up  At the end  finally  that succeeds  and life appears. We was so  so stupid. The most stupid bacteria. Even  I think  we copy our way to reproduce  you know what I mean  and something of    oh no  forget it. After  we become a fish  after  we become a frog  after  we become a monkey  after  we become what we are today  a super monkey  and the fun is  the super monkey we are today  is at half of the story. Can you imagine  From that stupid bacteria to us  with a microphone  with a computer  with an iPod  four billion years. And we know  and especially Carolyn knows  that when the sun will implode  the earth will burn  explode  I don't know what  and this is scheduled for four  four billion years  Yes  she said  something like that. OK  that means we are at half of the story. Fantastic  It's a beauty  Can you imagine  It's very symbolic. Because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today. And today  we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years. And this territory is fantastic. That is our poetry. That is our beautiful story. It's our romanticism. Mu ta tion. We are mutants. And if we don't deeply understand  if we don't integrate that we are mutants  we completely miss the story. Because every generation thinks we are the final one. We have a way to look at Earth like that  you know   I am the man. The final man. You know  we mutate during four billion years before  but now  because it's me  we stop. Fin.  Laughter  For the end  for the eternity  it is one with a red jacket.  Something like that. I am not sure of that.  Laughter  Because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that. There is so many things to do  it's so fresh. And here is something  nobody is obliged to be a genius  but everybody is obliged to participate. And to participate  for a mutant  there is a minimum of exercise  a minimum of sport. We can say that. The first  if you want    there is so many    but one which is very easy to do  is the duty of vision. I can explain you. I shall try. If you walk like that  it's OK  it's OK  you can walk  but perhaps  because you walk with the eyes like that  you will not see  oh  there is a hole. And you will fall  and you will die. Dangerous. That's why  perhaps  you will try to have this angle of vision. OK  I can see  if I found something  up  up  and they continue  up up up. I raise the angle of vision  but it's still very    selfish  selfish  egoiste    yes  selfish. You  you survive. It's OK. If you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go   I see you  oh my God you are here  how are you  I can help you  I can design for you a new toothbrush  new toilet brush   something like that. I live in society  I live in community. It's OK. You start to be in the territory of intelligence  we can say. From this level  the more you can raise this angle of view  the more you will be important for the society. The more you will rise  the more you will be important for the civilization. The more you will rise  to see far and high  like that  the more you will be important for the story of our mutation. That means intelligent people are in this angle. That is intelligence. From this to here  that  it's genius. Ptolemy  Eratosthenes  Einstein  things like that. Nobody's obliged to be a genius. It's better  but nobody. Take care  in this training  to be a good mutant. There is some danger  there is some trap. One trap  the vertical. Because at the vertical of us  if you look like that   Ah  my God  there is God. Ah  God   God is a trap. God is the answer when we don't know the answer. That means  when your brain is not enough big  when you don't understand  you go   Ah  it's God  it's God.  That's ridiculous. That's why    jump  like that  No  don't jump. Come back. Because  after  there is another trap. If you look like that  you look to the past  or you look inside if you are very flexible  inside yourself. It's called schizophrenia  and you are dead also. That's why every morning  now  because you are a good mutant  you will raise your angle of view. Out  more of the horizontal. You are an intelligence. Never forget    like that  like that. It's very  very  very important. What  what else we can say about that  Why do that  It's because we    if we look from far  we see our line of evolution. This line of evolution is clearly positive. From far  this line looks very smooth  like that. But if you take a lens  like that  this line is ack  ack  ack  ack  ack. Like that. It's made of light and shadow. We can say light is civilization  shadow is barbaria. And it's very important to know where we are. Because some cycle  there is a spot in the cycle  and you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle. That means  we can imagine    I don't say it was fantastic  but in the '  s  there was not too much war  like that  it was    we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized. In this case  people like me are acceptable. We can say   It's luxurious time.  We have time to think  we have time to I don't know what  speak about art and things like that. It's OK. We are in the light. But sometimes  like today  we fall  we fall so fast  so fast to shadow  we fall so fast to barbaria. With many  many  many  many face of barbaria. Because it's not  the barbaria we have today  it's perhaps not the barbaria we think. There is different type of barbaria. That's why we must adapt. That means  when barbaria is back  forget the beautiful chairs  forget the beautiful hotel  forget design  even    I'm sorry to say    forget art. Forget all that. There is priority  there is urgency. You must go back to politics  you must go back to radicalization  I'm sorry if that's not very English. You must go back to fight  to battle. That's why today I'm so ashamed to make this job. That's why I am here  to try to do it the best possible. But I know that even I do it the best possible    that's why I'm the best    it's nothing. Because it's not the right time. That's why I say that. I say that  because  I repeat  nothing exist if it's not in the good reason  the reason of our beautiful dream  of this civilization. And because we must all work to finish this story. Because the scenario of this civilization    about love  progress  and things like that    it's OK  but there is so many different  other scenarios of other civilizations. This scenario  of this civilization  was about becoming powerful  intelligent  like this idea we have invented  this concept of God. We are God now. We are. It's almost done. We have just to finish the story. That is very  very important. And when you don't understand really what's happened  you cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that. You go to the future back  back  back  back  like that. And you can fall  and it's very dangerous. No  you must really understand that. Because we have almost finished  I'll repeat this story. And the beauty of this  in perhaps    years     years  we can finish completely this civilization  and offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story  a new poetry  a new romanticism. With billions of people who have been born  worked  lived and died before us  these people who have worked so much  we have now bring beautiful things  beautiful gifts  we know so many things. We can say to our children  OK  done  that was our story. That passed. Now you have a duty  invent a new story. Invent a new poetry. The only rule is  we have not to have any idea about the next story. We give you white pages. Invent. We give you the best tools  the best tools  and now  do it. That's why I continue to work  even if it's for toilet brush. Thank you for putting up these pictures of my colleagues over here. Now  I'm going try an experiment. I don't do experiments  normally. I'm a theorist. But I'm going see what happens if I press this button. Sure enough. OK. I used to work in this field of elementary particles. What happens to matter if you chop it up very fine  What is it made of  And the laws of these particles are valid throughout the universe  and they're very much connected with the history of the universe. We know a lot about four forces. There must be a lot more  but those are at very  very small distances  and we haven't really interacted with them very much yet. The main thing I want to talk about is this  that we have this remarkable experience in this field of fundamental physics that beauty is a very successful criterion for choosing the right theory. And why on earth could that be so  Well  here's an example from my own experience. It's fairly dramatic  actually  to have this happen. Three or four of us  in       put forward a partially complete theory of one of these forces  this weak force. And it was in disagreement with seven    seven  count them  seven experiments. Experiments were all wrong. And we published before knowing that  because we figured it was so beautiful  it's gotta be right  The experiments had to be wrong  and they were. Now our friend over there  Albert Einstein  used to pay very little attention when people said   You know  there's a man with an experiment that seems to disagree with special relativity. DC Miller. What about that   And he would say   Aw  that'll go away.   Laughter  Now  why does stuff like that work  That's the question. Now  yeah  what do we mean by beautiful  That's one thing. I'll try to make that clear    partially clear. Why should it work  and is this something to do with human beings  I'll let you in on the answer to the last one that I offer  and that is  it has nothing to do with human beings. Somewhere in some other planet  orbiting some very distant star  maybe in a another galaxy  there could well be entities that are at least as intelligent as we are  and are interested in science. It's not impossible  I think there probably are lots. Very likely  none is close enough to interact with us. But they could be out there  very easily. And suppose they have  you know  very different sensory apparatus  and so on. They have seven tentacles  and they have    little funny looking compound eyes  and a brain shaped like a pretzel. Would they really have different laws  There are lots of people who believe that  and I think it is utter baloney. I think there are laws out there  and we of course don't understand them at any given time very well    but we try. And we try to get closer and closer. And someday  we may actually figure out the fundamental unified theory of the particles and forces  what I call the  fundamental law.  We may not even be terribly far from it. But even if we don't run across it in our lifetimes  we can still think there is one out there  and we're just trying to get closer and closer to it. I think that's the main point to be made. We express these things mathematically. And when the mathematics is very simple    when in terms of some mathematical notation  you can write the theory in a very brief space  without a lot of complication    that's essentially what we mean by beauty or elegance. Here's what I was saying about the laws. They're really there. Newton certainly believed that. And he said  here   It is the business of natural philosophy to find out those laws.  The basic law  let's say    here's an assumption. The assumption is that the basic law really takes the form of a unified theory of all the particles. Now  some people call that a theory of everything. That's wrong because the theory is quantum mechanical. And I won't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it's like  and so on. You've heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway.  Laughter  There are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff. But the main thing here is that it predicts probabilities. Now  sometimes those probabilities are near certainties. And in a lot of familiar cases  they of course are. But other times they're not  and you have only probabilities for different outcomes. So what that means is that the history of the universe is not determined just by the fundamental law. It's the fundamental law and this incredibly long series of accidents  or chance outcomes  that are there in addition. And the fundamental theory doesn't include those chance outcomes  they are in addition. So it's not a theory of everything. And in fact  a huge amount of the information in the universe around us comes from those accidents  and not just from the fundamental laws. Now  it's often said that getting closer and closer to the fundamental laws by examining phenomena at low energies  and then higher energies  and then higher energies  or short distances  and then shorter distances  and then still shorter distances  and so on  is like peeling the skin of an onion. And we keep doing that  and build more powerful machines  accelerators for particles. We look deeper and deeper into the structure of particles  and in that way we get probably closer and closer to this fundamental law. Now  what happens is that as we do that  as we peel these skins of the onion  and we get closer and closer to the underlying law  we see that each skin has something in common with the previous one  and with the next one. We write them out mathematically  and we see they use very similar mathematics. They require very similar mathematics. That is absolutely remarkable  and that is a central feature of what I'm trying to say today. Newton called it    that's Newton  by the way    that one. This one is Albert Einstein. Hi  Al  And anyway  he said   nature conformable to herself     personifying nature as a female. And so what happens is that the new phenomena  the new skins  the inner skins of the slightly smaller skins of the onion that we get to  resemble the slightly larger ones. And the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin is almost the same as what we need for the next skin. And that's why the equations look so simple. Because they use mathematics we already have. A trivial example is this  Newton found the law of gravity  which goes like one over the square of the distance between the things gravitated. Coulomb  in France  found the same law for electric charges. Here's an example of this similarity. You look at gravity  you see a certain law. Then you look at electricity. Sure enough. The same rule. It's a very simple example. There are lots of more sophisticated examples. Symmetry is very important in this discussion. You know what it means. A circle  for example  is symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle. You rotate around the center of the circle  the circle remains unchanged. You take a sphere  in three dimensions  you rotate around the center of the sphere  and all those rotations leave the sphere alone. They are symmetries of the sphere. So we say  in general  that there's a symmetry under certain operations if those operations leave the phenomenon  or its description  unchanged. Maxwell's equations are of course symmetrical under rotations of all of space. Doesn't matter if we turn the whole of space around by some angle  it doesn't leave the    doesn't change the phenomenon of electricity or magnetism. There's a new notation in the   th century that expressed this  and if you use that notation  the equations get a lot simpler. Then Einstein  with his special theory of relativity  looked at a whole set of symmetries of Maxwell's equations  which are called special relativity. And those symmetries  then  make the equations even shorter  and even prettier  therefore. Let's look. You don't have to know what these things mean  doesn't make any difference. But you can just look at the form.  Laughter  You can look at the form. You see above  at the top  a long list of equations with three components for the three directions of space  x  y and z. Then  using vector analysis  you use rotational symmetry  and you get this next set. Then you use the symmetry of special relativity and you get an even simpler set down here  showing that symmetry exhibits better and better. The more and more symmetry you have  the better you exhibit the simplicity and elegance of the theory. The last two  the first equation says that electric charges and currents give rise to all the electric and magnetic fields. The next    second    equation says that there is no magnetism other than that. The only magnetism comes from electric charges and currents. Someday we may find some slight hole in that argument. But for the moment  that's the case. Now  here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of. They should have heard of it  but it's a little tricky to explain in technical detail  so I won't do it. I'll just mention it.  Laughter  But Chen Ning Yang  called by us  Frank  Yang     Laughter     and Bob Mills put forward     years ago  this generalization of Maxwell's equations  with a new symmetry. A whole new symmetry. Mathematics very similar  but there was a whole new symmetry. They hoped that this would contribute somehow to particle physics    didn't. It didn't  by itself  contribute to particle physics. But then some of us generalized it further. And then it did  And it gave a very beautiful description of the strong force and of the weak force. So here we say  again  what we said before  that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins. So the mathematics for the adjoining skins is very similar to what we need for the new one. And therefore it looks beautiful because we already know how to write it in a lovely  concise way. So here are the themes. We believe there is a unified theory underlying all the regularities. Steps toward unification exhibit the simplicity. Symmetry exhibits the simplicity. And then there is self similarity across the scales    in other words  from one skin of the onion to another one. Proximate self similarity. And that accounts for this phenomenon. That will account for why beauty is a successful criterion for selecting the right theory. Here's what Newton himself said   Nature is very consonant and conformable to her self.  One thing he was thinking of is something that most of us take for granted today  but in his day it wasn't taken for granted. There's the story  which is not absolutely certain to be right  but a lot of people told it. Four sources told it. That when they had the plague in Cambridge  and he went down to his mother's farm    because the university was closed    he saw an apple fall from a tree  or on his head or something. And he realized suddenly that the force that drew the apple down to the earth could be the same as the force regulating the motions of the planets and the moon. That was a big unification for those days  although today we take it for granted. It's the same theory of gravity. So he said that this principle of nature  consonance   This principle of nature being very remote from the conceptions of philosophers  I forbore to describe it in that book  lest I should be accounted an extravagant freak ...   That's what we all have to watch out for   Laughter  especially at this meeting.   ... and so prejudice my readers against all those things which were the main design of the book.  Now  who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind  That the force that causes the apple to fall to the ground is the same force that causes the planets and the moon to move around  and so on  Everybody knows that. It's a property of gravitation. It's not something in the human mind. The human mind can  of course  appreciate it and enjoy it  use it  but it's not    it doesn't stem from the human mind. It stems from the character of gravity. And that's true of all the things we're talking about. They are properties of the fundamental law. The fundamental law is such that the different skins of the onion resemble one another  and therefore the math for one skin allows you to express beautifully and simply the phenomenon of the next skin. I say here that Newton did a lot of things that year  gravity  the laws of motion  the calculus  white light composed of all the colors of the rainbow. And he could have written quite an essay on  What I Did Over My Summer Vacation.  So we don't have to assume these principles as separate metaphysical postulates. They follow from the fundamental theory. They are what we call emergent properties. You don't need    you don't need something more to get something more. That's what emergence means. Life can emerge from physics and chemistry  plus a lot of accidents. The human mind can arise from neurobiology and a lot of accidents  the way the chemical bond arises from physics and certain accidents. It doesn't diminish the importance of these subjects to know that they follow from more fundamental things  plus accidents. That's a general rule  and it's critically important to realize that. You don't need something more in order to get something more. People keep asking that when they read my book   The Quark and the Jaguar   and they say   Isn't there something more beyond what you have there   Presumably  they mean something supernatural. Anyway  there isn't.  Laughter  You don't need something more to explain something more. Thank you very much.  Applause  The old story about climate protection is that it's costly  or it would have been done already. So government needs to make us do something painful to fix it. The new story about climate protection is that it's not costly  but profitable. This was a simple sign error  because it's cheaper to save fuel than to buy fuel  as is well known to companies that do it all the time    for example  Dupont  SD micro electronics. Many other firms    IBM    are reducing their energy intensity routinely six percent a year by fixing up their plants  and they get their money back in two or three years. That's called a profit. Now  similarly  the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it  it would be expensive  or we would have done it already  because markets are essentially perfect. If  of course  that were true  there would be no innovation  and nobody could make any money. But the new story about oil is the government doesn't have to force us to do painful things to get off oil    not just incrementally  but completely    quite the contrary. The United States  for example  can completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy at the same time  led by business for profit  because it's so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil than to keep on buying it. This process will also be catalyzed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict  particularly over oil. This thesis is set out in a book called  Winning the Oil Endgame  that four colleagues and I wrote and have posted for free at Oilendgame.com    about         downloads so far. And it was co sponsored by the Pentagon    it's independent  it's peer reviewed and all of the backup calculations are transparently posted for your perusal. Now  a bit of economic history  I think  may be helpful here. Around       one of the biggest U.S. industries was whaling. And whale oil lit practically every building. But in the nine years before Drake struck oil  in       at least five sixths of that whale oil illuminating market disappeared  thanks to fatal competitors  chiefly oil and gas made from coal  to which the whalers had not been paying attention. So  very unexpectedly  they ran out of customers before they ran out of whales. The remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators and profit maximizing capitalists. And it's funny    it feels a bit like this now for oil. We've been spending the last few decades accumulating a very powerful backlog of technologies for saving and substituting for oil  and no one had bothered to add them up before. So when we did  we found some very surprising things. Now  there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil. Both national competitiveness and national security are at risk. On the competitiveness front  we all know that Toyota has more market cap than the big three put together. And serious competition from Europe  from Korea  and next is China  which will soon be a major net exporter of cars. How long do you think it will take before you can drive home your new wally badged Shanghai automotive super efficient car  Maybe a decade  according to my friends in Detroit. China has an energy policy based on radical energy efficiency and leap frog technology. They're not going to export your uncle's Buick. And after that comes India. The point here is  these cars are going to be made super efficient. The question is  who will make them  Will we in the United States continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil  or will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars  That seems to make more sense. The more we keep on using the oil  particularly the imported oil  the more we face a very obvious array of problems. Our analysis assumes that they all cost nothing  but nothing is not the right number. It could well be enough to double the oil price  for example. And one of the worst of these is what it does to our standing in the world if other countries think that everything we do is about oil  if we have to treat countries that have oil differently than countries that don't have oil. And our military get quite unhappy with having to stand guard on pipelines in Far off istan when what they actually signed up for was to protect American citizens. They don't like fighting over oil  they don't like being in the sands and they don't like where the oil money goes and what sort of instability it creates. Now  in order to avoid these problems  whatever you think they're worth  it's actually not that complicated. We can save half the oil by using it more efficiently  at a cost of    dollars per saved barrel. And then we can replace the other half with a combination of advanced bio fuels and safe natural gas. And that costs on average under    dollars a barrel. And compared with the official forecast  that oil will cost    dollars a barrel in       which is half of what we've been paying lately  that will save    billion dollars a year  starting quite soon. Now  in order to do this we need to invest about     billion dollars  half of it to retool the car  truck and plane industries  half of it to build the advanced bio fuel industry. In the process  we will gain about a million good jobs  mainly rural. And protect another million jobs now at risk  mainly in auto making. And we'll also get returns over     billion dollars a year. So that's a very handsome return. It's financeable in the private capital market. But if you want it for the reasons I just mentioned  to happen sooner and with higher confidence  then    and also to expand choice and manage risk    then you might like some light handed public policies that support rather than distorting or opposing the business logic. And these policies work fine without taxes  subsidies or mandates. They make a little net money for the treasury. They have a broad trans ideological appeal  and because we want them actually to happen  we figured out ways to do them that do not require much  if any  federal legislation  and can  indeed  be done administratively or at a state level. Just to illustrate what to do about the nub of the problem  namely  light vehicles  here are four ultra light carbon composite concept cars with low drag  and all but the one at the upper left have hybrid drive. You can sort of have it all with these things. For example  this Opel two seater does     miles an hour at    miles a gallon. This muscle car from Toyota      horsepower in an ultra light that does zero to    in well under four seconds  and still gets    miles a gallon. I'll say more later about this. And in the upper left  a pioneering effort    years ago by GM       miles a gallon without even using a hybrid  in a four seater. Well  saving that fuel     percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about    cents per saved gallon. But it's even a better deal for heavy trucks  where you save a similar amount at    cents a gallon  with better aerodynamics and tires and engines  and so on  and taking out weight so you can put it into payload. So you can double efficiency with a    percent internal rate of return. Then you can go even further  almost tripling efficiency with some operational improvements  double the big haulers' margins. And we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull  and flip the market. In the airplane business  it's again a similar story where the first    percent fuel saving is free  as Boeing is now demonstrating in its new Dreamliner. But then the next generation of planes saves about half. Again  much cheaper than buying the fuel. And if you go over the next    years or so to a blended wing body  kind of a flying wing with internal engines  then you get about a factor three efficiency improvement at comparable or lower cost. Let me focus a minute on the light vehicles  the cars and light trucks  because we all know the most about those  probably everybody here drives one. And yet we may not realize that in a standard sedan  of all the fuel energy you feed into the car  seven eighths never gets to the wheels  it's lost first in the engine  idling at zero miles a gallon  the power train and accessories. So then of the energy that does get to the wheels  only an eighth of it  half of that  goes to heat the tires on the road  or to heat the air the car pushes aside. And only this little bit  only six percent actually ends up accelerating the car and then heating the brakes when you stop. In fact  since    percent of the weight you're moving is the car not the driver  less than one percent of the fuel energy ends up moving the driver. This is not very gratifying after more than a century of devoted engineering effort. Moreover  three fourths of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car. And it's obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels is going to avoid wasting another seven units of energy getting that energy to the wheels. So there's huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter. And the reason this has not been very seriously examined before is there was a common assumption in the industry that    well  then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car  and it would cost a lot more to make  because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium. But these objections are now vanishing through advances in materials. For example  we use a lot of carbon fiber composites in sporting goods. And it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety. Here's a handmade McLaren SLR carbon car that got t boned by a Golf. The Golf was totaled. The McLaren just popped off and scratched the side panel. They'll pop it back on and fix the scratch later. But if this McLaren were to run into a wall at    miles an hour  the entire crash energy would be absorbed by a couple of woven carbon fiber composite cones  weighing a total of    pounds  hidden in the front end. Because these materials could actually absorb six to    times as much energy per pound as steel  and do so a lot more smoothly. And this means we've just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight. We could make cars bigger  which is protective  but make them light. Whereas if we made them heavy  they'd be both hostile and inefficient. And when you make them light in the right way  that can be simpler and cheaper to make. You can end up saving money  and lives  and oil  all at the same time. I showed here two years ago a little bit about a design of your basic  uncompromised  quintupled efficiency suburban assault vehicle       and this is a complete virtual design that is production costed manufacturable. And the process needed to make it is actually coming toward the market quite nicely. We figured out a kind of a digital inkjet printer for this very stiff  strong  carbon composite material  and then ways to thermoform it  because it's a combination of carbon and nylon  into whatever complex shapes you want  like the one just shown at the auto show by one of the tier one suppliers. And the manufacturing you can do this way gets radically simplified. Because the auto body has only  say     parts  instead of         . Each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set  instead of four expensive ones for stamping steel. Each of the parts can be easily lifted with no hoist. They snap together like a kid's toy. So you got rid of the body shop. And if you want  you can lay color in the mold  and get rid of the paint shop. Those are the two hardest and costliest parts of making a car. So you end up with at least two fifths lower capital intensity than the leanest plant in the industry  which GM has in Lansing. The plant also gets smaller. Now  when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil  including buildings  industry  feedstocks and so on  you find that of the    million barrels a day the government says we will need in       well  about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then  with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over  at an average cost of only    bucks a barrel  instead of    for buying the oil. And then another six can be made robustly  competitively  from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio diesel  without interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production. There is a huge amount of gas to be saved  about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price. And here are some no brainer substitutions of it  with lots left over. So much  in fact  that after you've handled the domestic oil forecast from areas already approved  you have only this little bit left  and let's see how we can meet that  because there's a pretty flexible menu of ways. We could  of course  buy more efficiency. Maybe you ought to buy efficiency at    bucks instead of   . Or wait to capture the second half of it. Or we could  of course  just get this little bit by continuing to import some Canadian and Mexican oil  or the ethanol the Brazilians would love to sell us. But they'll sell it to Japan and China instead  because we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers  and they don't. Or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance  or if we used it as hydrogen  which is more profitable and efficient  we'd get rid of the domestic oil too. And that doesn't even count  for example  that available land in the Dakotas can cost effectively make enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country. So we have lots of options. And the choice of menu and timing is quite flexible. Now  to make this happen quicker and with higher confidence  there is a few ways government could help. For example  fee bates  a combination of a fee and a rebate in any size class of vehicle you want  can increase the price of inefficient vehicles and correspondingly pay you a rebate for efficient vehicles. You're not paid to change size class. You are paid to pick efficiency within a size class  in a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years of life cycle fuel savings rather than just the first two or three. This expands choice rapidly in the market  and actually makes more money for automakers as well. I'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country by making it very cheaply possible for low income families to get efficient  reliable  warranted new cars that they could otherwise never get. And for each car so financed  scrap almost one clunker  preferably the dirtiest ones. This creates a new million car a year market for Detroit from customers they weren't going to get otherwise  because they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car. And Detroit will make money on every unit. It turns out that if  say  African American and white households had the same car ownership  it would cut employment disparity about in half by providing better access to job opportunities. So this is a huge social win  too. Governments buy hundreds of thousands of cars a year. There are smart ways to buy them and to aggregate that purchasing power to bring very efficient vehicles into the market faster. And we could even do an X Prize style golden carrot that's worth stretching further for. For example  a billion dollar prize for the first U.S. automaker to sell         really advanced vehicles  like some you saw earlier. Then the legacy airlines can't afford to buy the efficient new planes they desperately need to cut their fuel bills  but if you felt philosophically you wanted to do anything about that  there are ways to finance it. And at the same time to scrap inefficient old planes  so that if they were otherwise to come back in the air  they would waste more oil  and block the uptake of efficient  new planes. Those part inefficient planes are worth more to society dead than alive. We ought to take them out back and shoot them  and put bounty hunters after them. Then there's an important military role. That in creating the move to high volume  low cost commercial production of these kinds of materials  or for that matter  ultra light steels that are a good backup technology  the military can do the trick it did in turning DARPAnet into the Internet. Just turn it over to the private sector  and we have an Internet. The same for GPS. The same for the modern semi conductor industry. That is  military science and technology that they need can create the advanced materials industrial cluster that transforms its civilian economy and gets the country off oil  which would be a huge contribution to eliminating conflict over oil and advancing national and global security. Then we need to retool the car industry and do retraining  and shift the convergence of the energy and ag value chains to shift faster from hydrocarbons to carbohydrates  and get out of our own way in other ways. And make the transition to more efficient vehicles go faster. But here's how the whole thing fits together. Instead of official forecasts of oil use and oil imports going forever up  they can turn down with the    dollars a barrel efficiency  down steeply by adding the supply side substitutions at    bucks  all implemented at slower rates than we've done before when we paid attention. And if we start adding tranches of hydrogen in there  we are rapidly off imports and completely off oil in the     s. And the one thing I'd like to point out here is that we've done this before. In this eight year period       to     when we last paid attention  the economy grew    percent  oil use fell    percent  oil imports fell    percent  oil imports from the Persian Gulf fell    percent. They would have been gone if we'd kept that up one more year. Well  that was with very old technologies and delivery methods. We could rerun that play a lot better now. And yet what we proved then is the U.S. has more market power than OPEC. Ours is on the demand side. We are the Saudi Arabia of  nega barrels.   Laughter  We can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil. Whatever your reason for wanting to do this  whether you're concerned about national security or price volatility       or jobs  or the planet  or your grand kids  it seems to me that this is an oil endgame that we should all be playing to win. Please download your copy  and thank you very much. Good morning  ladies and gentlemen. My name is Art Benjamin  and I am a  mathemagician.  What that means is  I combine my loves of math and magic to do something I call  mathemagics.  But before I get started  I have a quick question for the audience. By any chance  did anyone happen to bring with them this morning a calculator  Seriously  if you have a calculator with you  raise your hand. Raise your hand. Did your hand go up  Now bring it out  bring it out. Anybody else  I see  I see one way in the back. You sir  that's three. And anybody on this side here  OK  over there on the aisle. Would the four of you please bring out your calculators  then join me up on stage. Let's give them a nice round of applause. That's right. Now  since I haven't had the chance to work with these calculators  I need to make sure that they are all working properly. Would somebody get us started by giving us a two digit number  please  How about a two digit number  Audience    . AB    . And another two digit number  sir  Audience    . AB  Multiply    times     make sure you get        or the calculators are not working. Do all of you get               Volunteer  No. AB     . Let's give three of them a nice round of applause there. Would you like to try a more standard calculator  just in case  OK  great. What I'm going to try and do then    I notice it took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer. That's OK. I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator. There is something called the square of a number  which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself. For instance  five squared would be  Audience    . AB    . The way we can square on most calculators    let me demonstrate with this one    is by taking the number  such as five  hitting  times  and then  equals   and on most calculators that will give you the square. On some of these ancient RPN calculators  you've got an  x squared  button on it  will allow you to do the calculation even faster. What I'm going to try and do now is to square  in my head  four two digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators  even using the shortcut method. What I'll use is the second row this time  and I'll get four of you to each yell out a two digit number  and if you would square the first number  and if you would square the second  the third and the fourth  I will try and race you to the answer. OK  So quickly  a two digit number please. Audience    . Arthur Benjamin     squared  OK. Audience    . AB     squared  OK. Audience    . AB     squared  OK  and finally  Audience    . AB     squared. Would you call out your answers  please  Volunteer      . AB      . Volunteer     . AB     . Volunteer      . AB      . Volunteer      . AB  Thank you very much. Let me try to take this one step further. I'm going to try to square some three digit numbers this time. I won't even write these down    I'll just call them out as they're called out to me. Anyone I point to  call out a three digit number. Anyone on our panel  verify the answer. Just give some indication if it's right. A three digit number  sir  yes  Audience     . AB      squared is        . AB  Yes  Good. Another three digit       another three digit number  sir  Audience     . AB      squared is        .          AB  Yes  OK  another  another three digit number  sir  Audience     . AB      is        .        . Yes  One more three digit number please. Audience  Oh     . AB      is      that's a harder one. Is that          Volunteer  Yes. AB  Yes  Oh  one more  one more three digit number please. Audience     .     squared is       . Volunteer  Yes. Thank you very much. Let me try to take this one step further. I'm going to try to square a four digit number this time. You can all take your time on this  I will not beat you to the answer on this one  but I will try to get the answer right. To make this a little bit more random  let's take the fourth row this time  let's say  one  two  three  four. If each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine  that will be the four digit number that I'll square. Nine. Seven. Five. Eight.        this will take me a little bit of time  so bear with me.    million             Volunteer  Yes  AB  Thank you very much. Now  I would attempt to square a five digit number    and I can    but unfortunately  most calculators cannot. Eight digit capacity    don't you hate that  So  since we've reached the limits of our calculators    what's that  Does yours go higher  Volunteer  I don't know. AB  Oh  yours does  Volunteer  I can probably do it. AB  I'll talk to you later. In the meanwhile  let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier. Let's take the largest number on the board here      . Would you each enter that on your calculator  And instead of squaring it this time  I want you to take that number and multiply it by any three digit number that you want  but don't tell me what you're multiplying by    just multiply it by any random three digit number. So you should have as an answer either a six digit or probably a seven digit number. How many digits do you have  six or seven  Seven  and yours  Seven  Seven  And  uncertain. Seven. Is there any possible way that I could know what seven digit numbers you have  Say  No.  Good  then I shall attempt the impossible    or at least the improbable. What I'd like each of you to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits  any six of them  in any order you'd like. One digit at a time  I shall try and determine the digit you've left out. Starting with your seven digit number  call out any six of them please. Volunteer                  . AB  Did you leave out the number    Good  OK  that's one. You have a seven digit number  call out any six of them please. Volunteer               . I think I only heard five numbers. I    wait             did you leave out the number    Same as she did  OK. You've got a seven digit number    call out any six of them loud and clear. Volunteer                  . I think you left out the number    AB  That's three. The odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in            to the fourth power. OK  any six of them. Really scramble them up this time  please. Volunteer                  . Did you leave out the number    And let's give all four of these people a nice round of applause. Thank you very much. For my next number    while I mentally recharge my batteries  I have one more question for the audience. By any chance  does anybody here happen to know the day of the week that they were born on  If you think you know your birth day  raise your hand. Let's see  starting with    let's start with a gentleman first. What year was it  first of all  That's why I pick a gentleman first. Audience      .       and the month  November what    rd    was that a Monday  Audience  Yes. Good. Somebody else  I haven't seen any women's hands up. OK  how about you  what year        and the month  October what  Fifth    was that a Wednesday  Yes  I'll go way to the back right now  how about you  Yell it out  what year  Audience      .       OK    and the month  Audience  February. February what  Sixth    was that a Friday  Audience  Yes. Good  how about the person behind her  Call out  what year was it  Audience      . AB        and the month  Audience  May. AB  May what  Seventh    would that be a Wednesday  Audience  Yes. AB  Thank you very much. Anybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born  We can do it that way. Of course  I could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know  so I come prepared for that. I brought with me a book of calendars. It goes as far back into the past as       because you never know. I didn't mean to look at you  sir    you were just sitting there. Anyway  Chris  you can help me out here  if you wouldn't mind. This is a book of calendars. Who wanted to know their birth day  What year was it  first of all  Audience      .       turn to the calendar with     . And what month  Audience  April. AB  April what  Audience    th. I believe that was a Sunday. Can you confirm  Chris  Chris Anderson  Yes. AB  I'll tell you what  Chris  as long as you have that book in front of you  do me a favor  turn to a year outside of the     s  either into the     s or way into the     s    that'll be a much greater challenge for me. AB  What year would you like  CA      . AB        OK. AB  And what month  CA  June. AB  June what  CA  Sixth. AB  Was that a Sunday  CA  It was. AB  And it was cloudy. Good  thank you very much. But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation. There was a gentleman up here who had a    digit calculator. Where is he  would you stand up     digit guy  OK  stand up for me just for a second  so I can see where you are. You have a    digit calculator  sir  as well  OK  what I'm going to try and do  is to square in my head a five digit number requiring a    digit calculator. But to make my job more interesting for you  as well as for me  I'm going to do this problem thinking out loud. So you can actually  honestly hear what's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size. Now  I have to apologize to our magician friend Lennart Green. I know as a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets  but I'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week  so    I think we're OK. So  let's see  let's take a different row of people  starting with you. I'll get five digits  one  two  three  four. Oh  I did this row already. Let's do the row before you  starting with you  one  two  three  four  five. Call out a single digit    that will be the five digit number that I will try to square  go ahead. Five. Seven. Six. Eight. Three.           squared. Yuck. Let me explain to you how I'm going to attempt this problem. I'm going to break the problem down into three parts. I'll do        squared  plus     squared  plus        times     times two. Add all those numbers together  and with any luck  arrive at the answer. Now  let me recap. Thank you. While I explain something else       I know  that you can use  right  While I do these calculations  you might hear certain words  as opposed to numbers  creep into the calculation. Let me explain what that is. This is a phonetic code  a mnemonic device that I use  that allows me to convert numbers into words. I store them as words  and later on retrieve them as numbers. I know it sounds complicated  it's not. I don't want you to think you're seeing something out of  Rain Man.  There's definitely a method to my madness    definitely  definitely. Sorry. If you want to talk to me about ADHD afterwards  you can talk to me then. By the way  one last instruction  for my judges with the calculators    you know who you are    there is at least a    percent chance that I will make a mistake here. If I do  don't tell me what the mistake is  just say   you're close   or something like that  and I'll try and figure out the answer    which could be pretty entertaining in itself. If  however  I am right  whatever you do  don't keep it to yourself  OK  Make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right  because this is my big finish  OK. So  without any more stalling  here we go. I'll start the problem in the middle  with    times    .    times    is        plus     is       that's        plus             plus     is       .         double that to get       .        becomes cookie fission  cookie fission is       . That seems right  I'll go on. Cookie fission  OK. Next  I do    squared  which is        so I can say  three billion. Take the      add that to cookie       oops  but I see a carry coming           add that to cookie      plus     is     million    fission  fission  OK  finally  we do     squared  that's     times      plus    squared is          rev up if I need it  rev up  take the      add that to fission  to get  oh gee           . Audience  Yeah  AB  Good. Thank you very much. I hope you enjoyed mathemagics. Thank you. You know  I'm struck by how one of the implicit themes of TED is compassion  these very moving demonstrations we've just seen  HIV in Africa  President Clinton last night. And I'd like to do a little collateral thinking  if you will  about compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal. I'm a psychologist  but rest assured  I will not bring it to the scrotal. There was a very important study done a while ago at Princeton Theological Seminary that speaks to why it is that when all of us have so many opportunities to help  we do sometimes  and we don't other times. A group of divinity students at the Princeton Theological Seminary were told that they were going to give a practice sermon and they were each given a sermon topic. Half of those students were given  as a topic  the parable of the Good Samaritan  the man who stopped the stranger in    to help the stranger in need by the side of the road. Half were given random Bible topics. Then one by one  they were told they had to go to another building and give their sermon. As they went from the first building to the second  each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning  clearly in need. The question is  Did they stop to help  The more interesting question is  Did it matter they were contemplating the parable of the Good Samaritan  Answer  No  not at all. What turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry they thought they were in    were they feeling they were late  or were they absorbed in what they were going to talk about. And this is  I think  the predicament of our lives  that we don't take every opportunity to help because our focus is in the wrong direction. There's a new field in brain science  social neuroscience. This studies the circuitry in two people's brains that activates while they interact. And the new thinking about compassion from social neuroscience is that our default wiring is to help. That is to say  if we attend to the other person  we automatically empathize  we automatically feel with them. There are these newly identified neurons  mirror neurons  that act like a neuro Wi Fi  activating in our brain exactly the areas activated in theirs. We feel  with  automatically. And if that person is in need  if that person is suffering  we're automatically prepared to help. At least that's the argument. But then the question is  Why don't we  And I think this speaks to a spectrum that goes from complete self absorption  to noticing  to empathy and to compassion. And the simple fact is  if we are focused on ourselves  if we're preoccupied  as we so often are throughout the day  we don't really fully notice the other. And this difference between the self and the other focus can be very subtle. I was doing my taxes the other day  and I got to the point where I was listing all of the donations I gave  and I had an epiphany  it was    I came to my check to the Seva Foundation and I noticed that I thought  boy  my friend Larry Brilliant would really be happy that I gave money to Seva. Then I realized that what I was getting from giving was a narcissistic hit    that I felt good about myself. Then I started to think about the people in the Himalayas whose cataracts would be helped  and I realized that I went from this kind of narcissistic self focus to altruistic joy  to feeling good for the people that were being helped. I think that's a motivator. But this distinction between focusing on ourselves and focusing on others is one that I encourage us all to pay attention to. You can see it at a gross level in the world of dating. I was at a sushi restaurant a while back and I overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman  who was in the singles scene. And this woman says   My brother is having trouble getting dates  so he's trying speed dating.  I don't know if you know speed dating  Women sit at tables and men go from table to table  and there's a clock and a bell  and at five minutes  bingo  the conversation ends and the woman can decide whether to give her card or her email address to the man for follow up. And this woman says   My brother's never gotten a card  and I know exactly why. The moment he sits down  he starts talking non stop about himself  he never asks about the woman.  And I was doing some research in the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times  looking at the back stories of marriages    because they're very interesting    and I came to the marriage of Alice Charney Epstein. And she said that when she was in the dating scene  she had a simple test she put people to. The test was  from the moment they got together  how long it would take the guy to ask her a question with the word  you  in it. And apparently Epstein aced the test  therefore the article. Now this is a    it's a little test I encourage you to try out at a party. Here at TED there are great opportunities. The Harvard Business Review recently had an article called  The Human Moment   about how to make real contact with a person at work. And they said  well  the fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your BlackBerry  close your laptop  end your daydream and pay full attention to the person. There is a newly coined word in the English language for the moment when the person we're with whips out their BlackBerry or answers that cell phone  and all of a sudden we don't exist. The word is  pizzled   it's a combination of puzzled and pissed off. I think it's quite apt. It's our empathy  it's our tuning in which separates us from Machiavellians or sociopaths. I have a brother in law who's an expert on horror and terror    he wrote the Annotated Dracula  the Essential Frankenstein    he was trained as a Chaucer scholar  but he was born in Transylvania and I think it affected him a little bit. At any rate  at one point my brother in law  Leonard  decided to write a book about a serial killer. This is a man who terrorized the very vicinity we're in many years ago. He was known as the Santa Cruz strangler. And before he was arrested  he had murdered his grandparents  his mother and five co eds at UC Santa Cruz. So my brother in law goes to interview this killer and he realizes when he meets him that this guy is absolutely terrifying. For one thing  he's almost seven feet tall. But that's not the most terrifying thing about him. The scariest thing is that his IQ is      a certified genius. But there is zero correlation between IQ and emotional empathy  feeling with the other person. They're controlled by different parts of the brain. So at one point  my brother in law gets up the courage to ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to  and that is  how could you have done it  Didn't you feel any pity for your victims  These were very intimate murders    he strangled his victims. And the strangler says very matter of factly   Oh no. If I'd felt the distress  I could not have done it. I had to turn that part of me off. I had to turn that part of me off.  And I think that that is very troubling  and in a sense  I've been reflecting on turning that part of us off. When we focus on ourselves in any activity  we do turn that part of ourselves off if there's another person. Think about going shopping and think about the possibilities of a compassionate consumerism. Right now  as Bill McDonough has pointed out  the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences. We're all unwitting victims of a collective blind spot. We don't notice and don't notice that we don't notice the toxic molecules emitted by a carpet or by the fabric on the seats. Or we don't know if that fabric is a technological or manufacturing nutrient  it can be reused or does it just end up at landfill  In other words  we're oblivious to the ecological and public health and social and economic justice consequences of the things we buy and use. In a sense  the room itself is the elephant in the room  but we don't see it. And we've become victims of a system that points us elsewhere. Consider this. There's a wonderful book called Stuff  The Hidden Life of Everyday Objects. And it talks about the back story of something like a t shirt. And it talks about where the cotton was grown and the fertilizers that were used and the consequences for soil of that fertilizer. And it mentions  for instance  that cotton is very resistant to textile dye  about    percent washes off into wastewater. And it's well known by epidemiologists that kids who live near textile works tend to have high rates of leukemia. There's a company  Bennett and Company  that supplies Polo.com  Victoria's Secret    they  because of their CEO  who's aware of this  in China formed a joint venture with their dye works to make sure that the wastewater would be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater. Right now  we don't have the option to choose the virtuous t shirt over the non virtuous one. So what would it take to do that  Well  I've been thinking. For one thing  there's a new electronic tagging technology that allows any store to know the entire history of any item on the shelves in that store. You can track it back to the factory. Once you can track it back to the factory  you can look at the manufacturing processes that were used to make it  and if it's virtuous  you can label it that way. Or if it's not so virtuous  you can go into    today  go into any store  put your scanner on a palm onto a barcode  which will take you to a website. They have it for people with allergies to peanuts. That website could tell you things about that object. In other words  at point of purchase  we might be able to make a compassionate choice. There's a saying in the world of information science  ultimately everybody will know everything. And the question is  will it make a difference  Some time ago when I was working for The New York Times  it was in the '  s  I did an article on what was then a new problem in New York    it was homeless people on the streets. And I spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless. And I realized seeing the homeless through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go. They had a diagnosis. It made me    what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where  when we see  when we're passing someone who's homeless in the periphery of our vision  it stays on the periphery. We don't notice and therefore we don't act. One day soon after that    it was a Friday    at the end of the day  I went down    I was going down to the subway. It was rush hour and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs. And all of a sudden as I was going down the stairs I noticed that there was a man slumped to the side  shirtless  not moving  and people were just stepping over him    hundreds and hundreds of people. And because my urban trance had been somehow weakened  I found myself stopping to find out what was wrong. The moment I stopped  half a dozen other people immediately ringed the same guy. And we found out that he was Hispanic  he didn't speak any English  he had no money  he'd been wandering the streets for days  starving  and he'd fainted from hunger. Immediately someone went to get orange juice  someone brought a hotdog  someone brought a subway cop. This guy was back on his feet immediately. But all it took was that simple act of noticing  and so I'm optimistic. Thank you very much. So I thought   I will talk about death.  Seemed to be the passion today. Actually  it's not about death. It's inevitable  terrible  but really what I want to talk about is  I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die. That's what I want to talk about. So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died  saying   Hi  I'm Art Buchwald  and I just died.  And Mike  who I met at Galapagos  a trip which I won at TED  is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer. And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook. In the last two years of his life  when he was sick  he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me. He wrote about my strengths  weaknesses  and gentle suggestions for improvement  quoting specific incidents  and held a mirror to my life. After he died  I realized that no one writes to me anymore. Handwriting is a disappearing art. I'm all for email and thinking while typing  but why give up old habits for new  Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives  There are times when I want to trade all those years that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him  and trade all those years for one hug. But too late. But that's when I take out his letters and I read them  and the paper that touched his hand is in mine  and I feel connected to him. So maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy  and not a financial one. A value for things with a personal touch    an autograph book  a soul searching letter. If a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper    John  it'll be a recycled one    and write a beautiful letter to someone they love  we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes. So what do I plan to leave for my son  I collect autograph books  and those of you authors in the audience know I hound you for them    and CDs too  Tracy. I plan to publish my own notebook. As I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire  I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote. I have no idea how I'm going to do it  but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book  and leave that published book for my son. I'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote at my father's cremation. And those linguists  please pardon the grammar  because I've not looked at it in the last    years. I took it out for the first time to come here.  Picture in a frame  ashes in a bottle  boundless energy confined in the bottle  forcing me to deal with reality  forcing me to deal with being grown up. I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong  but right now  I am being sucked down  surrounded and suffocated by these raging emotional waters  craving to cleanse my soul  trying to emerge on a firm footing one more time  to keep on fighting and flourishing just as you taught me. Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair  holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity  to live again and to love again.  Thank you. Welcome to  Five Dangerous Things You Should Let Your Children Do.  I don't have children. I borrow my friends' children  so    take all this advice with a grain of salt. I'm Gever Tulley. I'm a contract computer scientist by trade  but I'm the founder of something called the Tinkering School. It's a summer program which aims to help kids learn how to build the things that they think of. So we build a lot of things  and I do put power tools into the hands of second graders. So if you're thinking about sending your kid to Tinkering School  they do come back bruised  scraped and bloody. You know  we live in a world that's subjected to ever more stringent child safety regulations. There doesn't seem to be any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get. We put suffocation warnings on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States  or for sale with an item in the United States. We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot. And we seem to think that any item sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of   . So where does this trend stop  When we round every corner and eliminate every sharp object  every pokey bit in the world  then the first time that kids come in contact with anything sharp  or not made out of round plastic  they'll hurt themselves with it. So  as the boundaries of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller  we cut off our children from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact with the world around them. And despite all of our best efforts and intentions  kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous thing they can  in whatever environment they can. So despite the provocative title  this presentation is really about safety  and about some simple things that we can do to raise our kids to be creative  confident and in control of the environment around them. And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress. The book is called     Dangerous Things.  This is  Five Dangerous Things.  Thing number one  Play with fire. Learning to control one of the most elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment in any child's personal history. Whether we remember it or not  it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things. These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity to play with it. So  playing with fire. This is like one of the great things we ever discovered  fire. From playing with it  they learn some basic principles about fire  about intake  combustion  exhaust. These are the three working elements of fire that you have to have for a good  controlled fire. And you can think of the open pit fire as a laboratory. You don't know what they're going to learn from playing with it. Let them fool around with it on their own terms and trust me  they're going to learn things that you can't get out of playing with Dora the Explorer toys. Number two  Own a pocketknife. Pocketknives are kind of drifting out of our cultural consciousness  which I think is a terrible thing. Your first pocketknife is like the first universal tool that you're given. You know  it's a spatula  it's a pry bar  it's a screwdriver and it's a blade  yeah. And it's a powerful and empowering tool. And in a lot of cultures they give knives    like  as soon as they're toddlers  they have knives. These are Inuit children cutting whale blubber. I first saw this in a Canadian Film Board film when I was     and it left a lasting impression  to see babies playing with knives. And it shows that kids can develop an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age. You lay down a couple of very simple rules    always cut away from your body  keep the blade sharp  never force it    and these are things kids can understand and practice with. And yeah  they're going to cut themselves. I have some terrible scars on my legs from where I stabbed myself. But you know  they're young. They heal fast. Number three  Throw a spear. It turns out that our brains are actually wired for throwing things  and like muscles  if you don't use parts of your brain  they tend to atrophy over time. But when you exercise them  any given muscle adds strength to the whole system  and that applies to your brain  too. So practicing throwing things has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes  which have to do with visual acuity   D understanding  and structural problem solving  so it helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability. And throwing is a combination of analytical and physical skill  so it's very good for that kind of whole body training. These kinds of target based practices also help kids develop attention and concentration skills  so those are great. Number  four   Deconstruct appliances. There is a world of interesting things inside your dishwasher. Next time you're about to throw out an appliance  don't throw it out. Take it apart with your kid  or send him to my school  and we'll take it apart with them. Even if you don't know what the parts are  puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense that they can take things apart  and no matter how complex they are  they can understand parts of them. And that means that eventually  they can understand all of them. It's a sense of knowability  that something is knowable. So these black boxes that we live with and take for granted are actually complex things made by other people  and you can understand them. Number five  Two parter. Break the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit how we can interact with the things that we own    in this case  digital media. It's a very simple exercise  Buy a song on iTunes  write it to a CD  then rip the CD to an MP   and play it on your very same computer. You've just broken a law. Technically  the RIAA could come and prosecute you. It's an important lesson for kids to understand  that some of these laws get broken by accident  and that laws have to be interpreted. That's something we often talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things and breaking them open  and taking them apart and using them for other things. And also when we go out and drive a car. Driving a car is a really empowering act for a young child  so this is the alternate    For those of you who aren't comfortable actually breaking the law  you can drive a car with your child. This is a great stage for a kid. This happens about the same time that they get latched onto things like dinosaurs  these big things in the outside world  that they're trying to get a grip on. A car is a similar object  and they can get in a car and drive it. And that really gives them a handle on a world in a way that they don't often have access to. And it's perfectly legal. Find a big empty lot  make sure there's nothing in it  and that it's on private property  and let them drive your car. It's very safe actually. And it's fun for the whole family. Let's see  I think that's it. That's number five and a half. OK.
