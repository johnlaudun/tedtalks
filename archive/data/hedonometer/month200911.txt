I believe that there are new  hidden tensions that are actually happening between people and institutions    institutions that are the institutions that people inhabit in their daily life  schools  hospitals  workplaces  factories  offices  etc. And something that I see happening is something that I would like to call a sort of  democratization of intimacy.  And what do I mean by that  I mean that what people are doing is  in fact  they are sort of  with their communication channels  they are breaking an imposed isolation that these institutions are imposing on them. How are they doing this  They're doing it in a very simple way  by calling their mom from work  by IMing from their office to their friends  by texting under the desk. The pictures that you're seeing behind me are people that I visited in the last few months. And I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most. And somebody brought a boyfriend  somebody a father. One young woman brought her grandfather. For    years  I've been looking at how people use channels such as email  the mobile phone  texting  etc. What we're actually going to see is that  fundamentally  people are communicating on a regular basis with five  six  seven of their most intimate sphere. Now  lets take some data. Facebook. Recently some sociologists from Facebook    Facebook is the channel that you would expect is the most enlargening of all channels. And an average user  said Cameron Marlow  from Facebook  has about     friends. But he actually talks to  has two way exchanges with  about four to six people on a regular base  depending on his gender. Academic research on instant messaging also shows     people on buddy lists  but fundamentally people chat with two  three  four    anyway  less than five. My own research on cellphones and voice calls shows that    percent of the calls are actually made to four people.    percent. And when you go to Skype  it's down to two people. A lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed. I mean  I've been a bit disappointed sometimes when I saw this data and all this deployment  just for five people. And some sociologists actually feel that it's a closure  it's a cocooning  that we're disengaging from the public. And I would actually  I would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it  and from where they're doing it  actually there is an incredible social transformation. There are three stories that I think are quite good examples. The first gentleman  he's a baker. And so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in the morning. And around eight o'clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven  cleans his hands from the flour and calls his wife. He just wants to wish her a good day  because that's the start of her day. And I've heard this story a number of times. A young factory worker who works night shifts  who manages to sneak away from the factory floor  where there is CCTV by the way  and find a corner  where at    o'clock at night he can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight. Or a mother who  at four o'clock  suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet to check that her children are safely home. Then there is another couple  there is a Brazilian couple. They've lived in Italy for a number of years. They Skype with their families a few times a week. But once a fortnight  they actually put the computer on their dining table  pull out the webcam and actually have dinner with their family in Sao Paulo. And they have a big event of it. And I heard this story the first time a couple of years ago from a very modest family of immigrants from Kosovo in Switzerland. They had set up a big screen in their living room  and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother. But Danny Miller  who is a very good anthropologist who is working on Filipina migrant women who leave their children back in the Philippines  was telling me about how much parenting is going on through Skype  and how much these mothers are engaged with their children through Skype. And then there is the third couple. They are two friends. They chat to each other every day  a few times a day actually. And finally  finally  they've managed to put instant messaging on their computers at work. And now  obviously  they have it open. Whenever they have a moment they chat to each other. And this is exactly what we've been seeing with teenagers and kids doing it in school  under the table  and texting under the table to their friends. So  none of these cases are unique. I mean  I could tell you hundreds of them. But what is really exceptional is the setting. So  think of the three settings I've talked to you about  factory  migration  office. But it could be in a school  it could be an administration  it could be a hospital. Three settings that  if we just step back    years  if you just think back    years  when you clocked in  when you clocked in to an office  when you clocked in to a factory  there was no contact for the whole duration of the time  there was no contact with your private sphere. If you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere. If you were in management  oh  that was a different story. Maybe you had a direct line. If you were not  you maybe had to go through an operator. But basically  when you walked into those buildings  the private sphere was left behind you. And this has become such a norm of our professional lives  such a norm and such an expectation. And it had nothing to do with technical capability. The phones were there. But the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand  fully to the people around you. That was where the focus had to be. And this has become such a cultural norm that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage. If you think nursery  kindergarten  first years of school are just dedicated to take away the children  to make them used to staying long hours away from their family. And then the school enacts perfectly well. It mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices  rituals of entry  rituals of exit  the schedules  the uniforms in this country  things that identify you  team building activities  team building that will allow you to basically be with a random group of kids  or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time. And of course  the major thing  learn to pay attention  to concentrate and focus your attention. This only started about     years ago. It only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy  and of industrial revolution. When people basically had to go somewhere else to work and carry out the work. And when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach  where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere. So  until then  basically people were living on top of their trades. They were living on top of the land they were laboring. They were living on top of the workshops where they were working. And if you think  it's permeated our whole culture  even our cities. If you think of medieval cities  medieval cities the boroughs all have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there. Now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas. And actually  over these     years  there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged. So the lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out  the more removed he would be from his personal sphere. People have taken this amazing possibility of actually being in contact all through the day or in all types of situations. And they are doing it massively. The Pew Institute  which produces good data on a regular basis on  for instance  in the States  says that    and I think that this number is conservative       percent of anybody with email access at work is actually doing private email from his office. I really think that the number is conservative. In my own research  we saw that the peak for private email is actually    o'clock in the morning  whatever the country.    percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on their mobile phones.     percent are using text. The point is that this re appropriation of the personal sphere is not terribly successful with all institutions. I'm always surprised the U.S. Army sociologists are discussing of the impact for instance  of soldiers in Iraq having daily contact with their families. But there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access. And every day  every single day  I read news that makes me cringe  like a     fine to kids in Texas  for using  every time they take out their mobile phone in school. Immediate dismissal to bus drivers in New York  if seen with a mobile phone in a hand. Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook. Behind issues of security and safety  which have always been the arguments for social control  in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who  in fact  has a right to self determine their attention  to decide  whether they should  or not  be isolated. And they are actually trying to block  in a certain sense  this movement of a greater possibility of intimacy. A few years ago  my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry. In       young Qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps. And since then I've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights. In the last six months  more than     skyscrapers in the UAE have been put on hold or canceled. Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the often indentured construction worker.  .  million of them. Mainly Indian  Pakistani  Sri Lankan and Nepalese  these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home. They pay a middle man thousands of dollars to be there. And when they arrive  they find themselves in labor camps with no water  no air conditioning  and their passports taken away. While it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities     percent of these people are hired by the private sector  and so therefore we're equally  if not more  accountable. Groups like Buildsafe UAE have emerged  but the numbers are simply overwhelming. In August       UAE public officials noted that    percent of the country's       labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations. And last summer  more than        workers protested for the non payment of wages  for the poor quality of food  and inadequate housing. And then the financial collapse happened. When the contractors have gone bust  as they've been overleveraged like everyone else  the difference is everything goes missing  documentation  passports  and tickets home for these workers. Currently  right now  thousands of workers are abandoned. There is no way back home. And there is no way  and no proof of arrival. These are the boom and bust refugees. The question is  as a building professional  as an architect  an engineer  as a developer  if you know this is going on  as we go to the sights every single week  are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations  So let's forget your environmental footprint. Let's think about your ethical footprint. What good is it to build a zero carbon  energy efficient complex  when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best  Now  recently I've been told I've been taking the high road. But  quite frankly  on this issue  there is no other road. So let's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse. And that as we worry about our next job in the office  the next design that we can get  to keep our workers. Let's not forget these men  who are truly dying to work. Thank you. I'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper. Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change  and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog. They are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science. Recently the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  or IPCC  put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system. That report was written by     scientists from    countries. They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic. And all of those pages were reviewed by another     plus scientists and reviewers  from     countries. It's a big community. It's such a big community  in fact  that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world. Over        scientists go to San Francisco every year for that. And every one of those scientists is in a research group  and every research group studies a wide variety of topics. For us at Cambridge  it's as varied as the El Ni o oscillation  which affects weather and climate  to the assimilation of satellite data  to emissions from crops that produce biofuels  which is what I happen to study. And in each one of these research areas  of which there are even more  there are PhD students  like me  and we study incredibly narrow topics  things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules. And one of the molecules I study is called isoprene  which is here. It's a small organic molecule. You've probably never heard of it. The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to     zeta illion       to the   st    molecules of isoprene. But despite its very small weight  enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet. It's a huge amount of stuff. It's equal to the weight of methane. And because it's so much stuff  it's really important for the atmospheric system. Because it's important to the atmospheric system  we go to all lengths to study this thing. We blow it up and look at the pieces. This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain. Atmospheric explosions  or full combustion  takes about        times longer than what happens in your car. But still  we look at the pieces. We run enormous models on supercomputers  this is what I happen to do. Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each  on minute timescales. And it takes weeks to perform our integrations. And we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what's happening. We also fly all over the world looking for this thing. I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia. There are others. We found a global atmospheric watchtower there  in the middle of the rainforest  and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of scientific equipment off this tower  to look for isoprene  and of course  other things while we were there. This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest  from above. And this is the tower from below. And on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us. And this plane  the model  BA     which was run by FAAM  normally flies     to     people. So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today. But we didn't just fly it. We were flying at     meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule    incredibly dangerous stuff. We have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements. We hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering. We have to get special flight clearance. And as you come around the banks in these valleys  the forces can get up to two Gs. And the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while they're on board. So  as you can imagine  the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane you would take on vacation. It's a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule. We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule. And when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule  they write one scientific paper on the subject. And out of that field campaign we'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules. And as a body of knowledge builds up  it will form one subsection  or one sub subsection of an assessment like the IPCC  although we have others. And each one of the    chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections. So you can imagine the scale of the effort. In each one of those assessments that we write  we always tag on a summary  and the summary is written for a non scientific audience. And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers  in order to make headlines like these. Thank you very much. I started my journey    years ago. And I worked in mines. And I realized that this was a world unseen. And I wanted  through color and large format cameras and very large prints  to make a body of work that somehow became symbols of our use of the landscape  how we use the land. And to me this was a key component that somehow  through this medium of photography  which allows us to contemplate these landscapes  that I thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work. And after    years of photographing large industrial landscapes  it occurred to me that oil is underpinning the scale and speed. Because that is what has changed  is the speed at which we're taking all our resources. And so then I went out to develop a whole series on the landscape of oil. And what I want to do is to kind of map an arc that there is extraction  where we're taking it from the ground  refinement. And that's one chapter. The other chapter that I wanted to look at was how we use it    our cities  our cars  our motorcultures  where people gather around the vehicle as a celebration. And then the third one is this idea of the end of oil  this entropic end  where all of our parts of cars  our tires  oil filters  helicopters  planes    where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up  And to me  again  photography was a way in which I could explore and research the world  and find those places. And another idea that I had as well  that was brought forward by an ecologist    he basically did a calculation where he took one liter of gas and said  well  how much carbon it would take  and how much organic material  It was    metric tons for one liter. So whenever I fill up my gas  I think of that liter  and how much carbon. And I know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton  but he did the calculations for our Earth and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy. From the photosynthetic growth  it would take     years of that growth to produce what we use  the    billion barrels we use per year. And that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society. Looking at    billion per year  we look at our two largest suppliers  Saudi Arabia and now Canada  with its dirty oil. And together they only form about    years of supply. The whole world  at  .  trillion estimated reserves  only gives us about    years. So  it's not a question of if  but a question of when peak oil will come upon us. So  to me  using photography    and I feel that all of us need to now begin to really take the task of using our talents  our ways of thinking  to begin to deal with what I think is probably one of the most challenging issues of our time  how to deal with our energy crisis. And I would like to say that  on the other side of it         years from now  the children that I have  I can look at them and say   We did everything we possibly  humanly could do  to begin to mitigate this  what I feel is one of the most important and critical moments in our time. Thank you. I'd like to ask you  what do these three people have in common  Well  you probably recognize the first person. I'm sure you're all avid  American Idol  watchers. But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani  who is a contestant  indeed a finalist  in the Poet of the Millions competition  which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi  and seen throughout the Arab world. In this contest people have to write and recite original poetry  in the Nabati form of poetry  which is the traditional Bedouin form. And Lima Sahar was a finalist in the Afghan Star singing competition. Now  before I go any further  yes  I know it all began with  Britain's Got Talent.  But my point in discussing this is to show you    I hope I'll be able to show you how these merit based competitions  with equal access to everyone  with the winner selected via voting by SMS  are changing tribal societies. And I'm going to focus on Afghanistan and the Arab world with the UAE  how they're changing tribal societies  not by introducing Western ideas  but by being integrated into the language in those places. It all begins with enjoyment. Video  We are late to watch  Afghan Star.  We are going to watch  Afghan Star.  We are late. We are running late. We must go to watch  Afghan Star.  Cynthia Schneider  These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society. In Afghanistan  people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program. And you don't necessarily have to have your own TV set. People watch it all over the country also in public places. But it goes beyond watching  because also  part of this is campaigning. People become so engaged that they have volunteers  just like political volunteers anyway  who fan out over the countryside  campaigning for their candidate. Contestants also put themselves forward. Now  of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance  but not entirely. Because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group. This has opened up the door  particularly for women. And in the last season there were two women in the finalists. One of them  Lima Sahar  is a Pashtun from Kandahar  a very conservative part of the country. And here she relates  in the documentary film  Afghan Star   how her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy. But she also confides that she knows that members of the Taliban are actually SMS ing votes in for her. Aydah Al Jahnani also took risks and put herself out  to compete in the Poet of the Millions competition. I have to say  her husband backed her from the start. But her tribe and family urged her not to compete and were very much against it. But  once she started to win  then they got behind her again. It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value. And she's out there. Her poetry is about women  and the life of women in society. So just by presenting herself and being in competition with men    this shows the voting on the program    it sets a very important example for young women    these are young women in the audience of the program    in Abu Dhabi  but also people in the viewing audience. Now you'd think that  American Idol  would introduce a measure of Americanization. But actually  just the opposite is happening. By using this engaging popular format for traditional  local culture  it actually  in the Gulf  is precipitating a revival of interest in Nabati poetry  also in traditional dress and dance and music. And for Afghanistan  where the Taliban banned music for many years  it is reintroducing their traditional music. They don't sing pop songs  they sing Afghan music. And they also have learned how to lose gracefully  without avenging the winner. No small thing. And the final  sort of  formulation of this  American Idol  format  which has just appeared in Afghanistan  is a new program called  The Candidate.  And in this program  people present policy platforms that are then voted on. Many of them are too young to run for president  but by putting the issues out there  they are influencing the presidential race. So for me  the substance of things unseen is how reality TV is driving reality. Thank you. We grew up interacting with the physical objects around us. There are an enormous number of them that we use every day. Unlike most of our computing devices  these objects are much more fun to use. When you talk about objects  one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing  and that is gestures  how we manipulate these objects  how we use these objects in everyday life. We use gestures not only to interact with these objects  but we also use them to interact with each other. A gesture of  Namaste    maybe  to respect someone  or maybe  in India I don't need to teach a kid that this means  four runs  in cricket. It comes as a part of our everyday learning. So  I am very interested  from the beginning  how our knowledge about everyday objects and gestures  and how we use these objects  can be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world. Rather than using a keyboard and mouse  why can I not use my computer in the same way that I interact in the physical world  So  I started this exploration around eight years back  and it literally started with a mouse on my desk. Rather than using it for my computer  I actually opened it. Most of you might be aware that  in those days  the mouse used to come with a ball inside  and there were two rollers that actually guide the computer where the ball is moving  and  accordingly  where the mouse is moving. So  I was interested in these two rollers  and I actually wanted more  so I borrowed another mouse from a friend    never returned to him    and I now had four rollers. Interestingly  what I did with these rollers is  basically  I took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line. It had some strings and pulleys and some springs. What I got is basically a gesture interface device that actually acts as a motion sensing device made for two dollars. So  here  whatever movement I do in my physical world is actually replicated inside the digital world just using this small device that I made  around eight years back  in     . Because I was interested in integrating these two worlds  I thought of sticky notes. I thought   Why can I not connect the normal interface of a physical sticky note to the digital world   A message written on a sticky note to my mom  on paper  can come to an SMS  or maybe a meeting reminder automatically syncs with my digital calendar    a to do list that automatically syncs with you. But you can also search in the digital world  or maybe you can write a query  saying   What is Dr. Smith's address   and this small system actually prints it out    so it actually acts like a paper input output system  just made out of paper. In another exploration  I thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions. So  I implemented this pen that can help designers and architects not only think in three dimensions  but they can actually draw  so that it's more intuitive to use that way. Then I thought   Why not make a Google Map  but in the physical world   Rather than typing a keyword to find something  I put my objects on top of it. If I put a boarding pass  it will show me where the flight gate is. A coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee  or where you can trash the cup. So  these were some of the earlier explorations I did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly. Among all these experiments  there was one thing in common  I was trying to bring a part of the physical world to the digital world. I was taking some part of the objects  or any of the intuitiveness of real life  and bringing them to the digital world  because the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive. But then I realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing. What we are interested in is information. We want to know about things. We want to know about dynamic things going around. So I thought  around last year    in the beginning of the last year    I started thinking   Why can I not take this approach in the reverse way   Maybe   How about I take my digital world and paint the physical world with that digital information   Because pixels are actually  right now  confined in these rectangular devices that fit in our pockets. Why can I not remove this confine and take that to my everyday objects  everyday life so that I don't need to learn the new language for interacting with those pixels  So  in order to realize this dream  I actually thought of putting a big size projector on my head. I think that's why this is called a head mounted projector  isn't it  I took it very literally  and took my bike helmet  put a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely. So now  what I can do    I can augment the world around me with this digital information. But later  I realized that I actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels  also. So I put a small camera over there that acts as a digital eye. Later  we moved to a much better  consumer oriented pendant version of that  that many of you now know as the SixthSense device. But the most interesting thing about this particular technology is that you can carry your digital world with you wherever you go. You can start using any surface  any wall around you  as an interface. The camera is actually tracking all your gestures. Whatever you're doing with your hands  it's understanding that gesture. And  actually  if you see  there are some color markers that in the beginning version we are using with it. You can start painting on any wall. You stop by a wall  and start painting on that wall. But we are not only tracking one finger  here. We are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands  so you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out of a map just by pinching all present. The camera is actually doing    just  getting all the images    is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition and so many other small algorithms are going on inside. So  technically  it's a little bit complex  but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use  in some sense. But I'm more excited that you can actually take it outside. Rather than getting your camera out of your pocket  you can just do the gesture of taking a photo  and it takes a photo for you. Thank you. And later I can find a wall  anywhere  and start browsing those photos or maybe   OK  I want to modify this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend.  So  we are looking for an era where computing will actually merge with the physical world. And  of course  if you don't have any surface  you can start using your palm for simple operations. Here  I'm dialing a phone number just using my hand. The camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements  but  interestingly  is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand. For example  in this case  the book cover is matched with so many thousands  or maybe millions of books online  and checking out which book it is. Once it has that information  it finds out more reviews about that  or maybe New York Times has a sound overview on that  so you can actually hear  on a physical book  a review as sound. This was Obama's visit last week to MIT. Pranav Mistry  So  I was seeing the live  video  of his talk  outside  on just a newspaper. Your newspaper will show you live weather information rather than having it updated. You have to check your computer in order to do that  right  When I'm going back  I can just use my boarding pass to check how much my flight has been delayed  because at that particular time  I'm not feeling like opening my iPhone  and checking out a particular icon. And I think this technology will not only change the way    Yes. It will change the way we interact with people  also  not only the physical world. The fun part is  I'm going to the Boston metro  and playing a pong game inside the train on the ground  right  And I think the imagination is the only limit of what you can think of when this kind of technology merges with real life. But many of you argue  actually  that all of our work is not only about physical objects. We actually do lots of accounting and paper editing and all those kinds of things  what about that  And many of you are excited about the next generation tablet computers to come out in the market. So  rather than waiting for that  I actually made my own  just using a piece of paper. So  what I did here is remove the camera    All the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera. I removed the microphone from that  and then just pinched that    like I just made a clip out of the microphone    and clipped that to a piece of paper  any paper that you found around. So now the sound of the touch is getting me when exactly I'm touching the paper. But the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving. You can of course watch movies. and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe   .  PM  And you can of course play games. Here  the camera is actually understanding how you're holding the paper and playing a car racing game. Many of you already must have thought  OK  you can browse. Yeah. Of course you can browse to any websites or you can do all sorts of computing on a piece of paper wherever you need it. So  more interestingly  I'm interested in how we can take that in a more dynamic way. When I come back to my desk  I can just pinch that information back to my desktop so I can use my full size computer. And why only computers  We can just play with papers. Paper world is interesting to play with. Here  I'm taking a part of a document  and putting over here a second part from a second place  and I'm actually modifying the information that I have over there. Yeah. And I say   OK  this looks nice  let me print it out  that thing.  So I now have a print out of that thing. So the workflow is more intuitive  the way we used to do it maybe    years back  rather than now switching between these two worlds. So  as a last thought  I think that integrating information to everyday objects will not only help us to get rid of the digital divide  the gap between these two worlds  but will also help us  in some way  to stay human  to be more connected to our physical world. And it will actually help us not end up being machines sitting in front of other machines. That's all. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson  So  Pranav  first of all  you're a genius. This is incredible  really. What are you doing with this  Is there a company being planned  Or is this research forever  or what  Pranav Mistry  So  there are lots of companies  sponsor companies of Media Lab interested in taking this ahead in one or another way. Companies like mobile phone operators want to take this in a different way than the NGOs in India  thinking   Why can we only have 'Sixth Sense'  We should have a 'Fifth Sense' for missing sense people who cannot speak. This technology can be used for them to speak out in a different way maybe a speaker system.  CA  What are your own plans  Are you staying at MIT  or are you going to do something with this  PM  I'm trying to make this more available to people so that anyone can develop their own SixthSense device  because the hardware is actually not that hard to manufacture or hard to make your own. We will provide all the open source software for them  maybe starting next month. CA  Open source  Wow. CA  Are you going to come back to India with some of this  at some point  PM  Yeah. Yes  yes  of course. CA  What are your plans  MIT  India  How are you going to split your time going forward  PM  There is a lot of energy here. Lots of learning. All of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in India. And now  if you see  it's more about the cost effectiveness  this system costs you      compared to the         surface tables  or anything like that. Or maybe even the    mouse gesture system at that time was costing around         I showed that  at a conference  to President Abdul Kalam  at that time  and then he said   OK  we should use this in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre for some use of that.  So I'm excited about how I can bring the technology to the masses rather than just keeping that technology in the lab environment. CA  Based on the people we've seen at TED  I would say you're truly one of the two or three best inventors in the world right now. It's an honor to have you at TED. Thank you so much. That's fantastic. One morning  in the year       the neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield saw himself like this  a weird freak with huge hands  huge mouth  and a tiny bottom. Actually this creature is the result of the Penfield research. He named it homunculus. Basically the homunculus is the visualization of a human being where each part of the body is proportional to the surface it takes in the brain. So  of course  homunculus is definitely not a freak. It's you. It's me. It's our invisible reality. This visualization could explain  for example  why newborns  or smokers  put  instinctively  their fingers in the mouth. Unfortunately it doesn't explain why so many designers remain mainly interested in designing chairs. So anyway  even if I do not understand science entirely  for my design I essentially refer to it. I'm fascinated by its ability to deeply investigate the human being  its way of working  its way of feeling. And it really helps me to understand how we see  how we hear  how we breathe  how our brain can inform or mislead us. It's a great tool for me to understand what could be our real needs. Marketing people have never been able to do that. Marketing reduces things. Marketing simplifies. Marketing creates user groups. And scientists  amidst complexity  amidst fluctuation and uniqueness. What could be our real needs  Maybe the silence. In our daily life we are continuously disturbed by aggressive sounds. And you know all those kind of sound puts us in a kind of stressful state  and prevent us from being quiet and focused. So I wanted to create a kind of sound filter  able to preserve ourselves from noise pollution. But I didn't want it to make it by isolating people  without any earmuffs or those kind of things. Or neither with including complex technology. I just wanted to  using the complexity and the technology of the brain  of the human brain. So I worked with white noise. dB is basically    dB is the name of the product  basically a white noise diffuser. This is white noise. The white noise is the sum of all frequencies that are audible by the human being  brought to the same intensity. And this noise is like a  shhhhhhhhhhhhh   like that. And this noise is the most neutral. It is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain. So when you hear this sound you feel like a kind of shelter  preserved from noise pollution. And when you hear the white noise  your brain is immediately focused on it. And do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound. It seems to be magic. But it is just physiology. It's just in your brain. And in mine  I hope. So in order to make this white noise a little bit active and reactive  I create a ball  a rolling ball able to analyze and find where does aggressive sound come from  and roll  at home or at work  towards aggressive noise  and emits white noise in order to neutralize it. It works. You feel the effect of the white noise  It's too in silence. If you make some noise you can feel the effect. So even if this object  even if this product includes some technology  it includes some speakers  it includes some microphones and some electronic devices  this object is not a very smart object. And I don't want to make a very smart object. I don't want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot. I want to create an object like you and me. So  definitely not perfect. So imagine  for instance  you are at home. A loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend. You shout. You say   Blah blah blah  Blah blah blah. Who is this guy   And dB will probably roll toward you. And turning around you is  shhhhhhh   like that. Definitely not perfect. So you would probably shut it  at this point. Anyway  in this same kind of approach  I designed K. K is a daylight receiver transmitter. So this object is supposed to be displayed on your desk  or on your piano  where you are supposed to spend most of your time in the day. And this object will be able to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day  and able to give you the quantity of light you need. This object is completely covered by fiber opticals. And the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object  for sure  but creates the idea of an eye sensibility of the object. I want  by this design feel  when you see it  you see  instinctively  this object seems to be very sensitive  very reactive. And this object knows  better than you and probably before you  what you really need. You have to know that the lack of daylight can provoke some problem of energy  or problem of libido. So  a huge problem. Most of the projects I work on    I live in collaboration with scientists. I'm just a designer. So I need them. So there can be some biologists  psychiatrists  mathematicians  and so on. And I submit them  my intuitions  my hypothesis  my first ideas. And they react. They told me what is possible  what is impossible. And together we improve the original concept. And we build the project to the end. And this kind of relationship between designer and scientist started when I was at school. Indeed in my studies I was a guinea pig for a pharmaceutical industry. And the irony for me was of course  I didn't do that for the sake of science progress. I just do that to make money. Anyway  this project  or this experience  make me start a new project on the design of medicine. You have to know that today  roughly one or two every drug pills is not taken correctly. So even if the active constituents in pharmaceuticals made constant progress in terms of chemistry  target of stability  the behavior of the patients goes more and more unstable. So we took too many of them. We took irregular dosage. We do not follow instructions. And so on. So I wanted to create a new kind of medicine  in order to create a new kind of relationship between the patient and the treatment. So I turned traditional pills into this. I'm going to give you some example. This one is an antibiotic. And its purpose is to help patient to go to the end of the treatment. And the concept is to create a kind of onion  a kind of structure in layers. So  you start with the darkest one. And you are helped to visualize the duration of the treatment. And you are helped to visualize the decrease of the infection. So the first day  this is the big one. And you have to peel and eat one layer a day. And your antibiotic goes smaller and clearer. And you're waiting for recovery as you were waiting for the Christmas day. And you follow the treatment like that  to the end of the treatment. And here you can get the white core. And it means  right  you are in the recovery. This one is a  third lung   a pharmaceutical device for long term asthma treatment. I designed it to help kids to follow the treatment. So the idea of this one is to create a relationship between the patient of the treatment but a relationship of dependency. But in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient. This is  the kids will feel the therapeutic object needs him. So the idea is  all night long the elastic skin of the third lung will slowly inflate itself  including air and molecules  for sure. And when the kids wake up  he can see the object needs him. And he take him to his mouth  and breathe the air it contains. So by this way  the kid  to take care of himself  is to take care of this living object. And he does not feel anymore it's relies on asthma treatment  as the asthma treatment needs him. In this guise of living object approach  I like the idea of a kind of invisible design  as if the function of the object exists in a kind of invisible field just around the objects themselves. We could talk about a kind of soul  of a ghost accompanying them. And almost a kind of poltergeist effect. So when a passive object like this one seems to be alive  because it is    woosh    starting to move. And I remember an exhibition design I made for John Maeda  and for the Fondation Cartier in Paris. And John Maeda was supposed to show several graphic animations in this exhibition. And my idea for this exhibition design was to create a real pong game  like this one. And the idea was to create some self moving benches in the main exhibition room. So the living benches would be exactly like the ball. And John was so excited by this idea. He said to me   Okay let's go.  I remember the day of the opening. I was a little bit late. When I bring the    living and self moving benches in the exhibition room  John was just beside me  and was like   Hmm. Hmm.  And he told me  after a long silence   I wonder  Mathieu  if people won't be more fascinated by your benches than by my videos.  It would be a great honor  a great compliment for me  if he hadn't decided to take all them off two hours before the opening. So  huge tragedy. I guess you won't be surprised if I tell you that Pinocchio is one of my great influences. Pinocchio is probably one of my best design products  my favorite one. Because it is a kind of object with a conscience  able to be modified by its surroundings  and able to modify it as well. The other great influence is the mine's canary. In coal mines  this canary was supposed to be close to the miners. And it was singing all day long. And when it stops it means that it just died. So this canary was a living alarm  and a very efficient one. A very natural technology  in order to say to the miners   The air is too bad. You have to go. It's an emergency.  So it's  for me  a great product. And I tried to design a kind of canary. Andrea is one. Andrea is a living air filter that absorbs toxic gasses from air  contaminated indoor air. So it uses some plants to do this job  selected for their gas filtering ability. You have to know  or you probably already know  that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one. So while I'm talking to you  the seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas. Sorry for that.  Laughter  So you are currently breathing formaldehyde. It's the same for me with the carpet. And this is exactly the same at home. Because all the product we get constantly give away the volatile component of which they're made of. So let's have a look at your home. So your sofa  your plastic chair  your kid's toys give their own invisible reality. And this one is very toxic. This is the reason why I created  with David Edward  a scientist of Harvard University  an object able to absorb the toxic elements using those kind of plants. But the idea is to force the air to go in the effective part of the plants. Because the roots of the plant are not very effective. Bill Wolverton from NASA analyzed it cleverly in the '  s. So the idea is to create an object able to force the air  and to be in contact at the right speed at the right place  in all the effective parts of the plant. So this is the final object. It will be launched next September. This one is kind of the same approach because I include  in a product like Andrea  some plants. And in this one  plants are used for the water filtration ability. And it includes some fishes as well. But here  unlike Andrea  here are supposed to be eaten. Indeed  this object is a domestic farm  for fishes and green. So the idea of this object is to be able to get at home very local food. The locavores used to get food taken in a radius of     miles. Local River is able to provide you food directly in your living room. So the principle of this object is to create an ecosystem called aquaponics. And the aquaponics is the dirty water of the fish  by a water pump  feeds the plants above. And the plants will filter  by the roots  the dirty water of the fish. After  it goes back into the fish tank. After that you have two options. Or you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your TV set. Amazing channel. Or you start fishing. And you make some sushis with a fish and the aromatic plants above. Because you can grow some potatoes. No  not potatoes  but tomatoes  aromatic plants and so on. So now we can breathe safely. Now we can eat local food. Now we can be treated by smart medicine. Now we can be well balanced in our biorhythm with daylight. But it was important to create a perfect place  so I tried to  in order to work and create. So I designed  for an American scientist based in Paris  a very stimulative  brain stimulative office. I wanted to create a perfect place where you can work and play  and where your body and your brain can work together. So  in this office  you do not work anymore at your desk  like a politician. Your seat  your sleep and your play on a big geodesic island made of leather. See  like this one  In this office you do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper  but you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave  like a prehistoric scientist. So you  like that  can make some sport during your work. In this office you do not need to go out in order to be in contact with nature. You include  directly  the nature in the floor of the office. You can see it there. This is an inspiration image to lead this project of the office. It really helped me to design it. I never show it to my client. He would be so afraid. Just for my workshop. I guess it may be the revenge of the guinea pig I was. But it's maybe the conviction as monkey and homunculus we are. All of us need to be considered according to our real nature. Thank you very much. I'm going to talk about some of my discoveries around the world through my work. These are not discoveries of planets or new technologies or science. They're discoveries of people and the way people are  and new leadership. This is Benki. Benki is a leader of the Ashaninka Nation. His people live in Brazil and in Peru. Benki comes from a village so remote up in the Amazon that to get there  either you have to fly and land on water  or go by canoe for several days. I met Benki three years ago in Sao Paulo when I'd brought him and other leaders from indigenous peoples to meet with me and leaders from around the world  because we wanted to learn from each other. We wanted to share our stories with each other. The Ashaninka people are known throughout South America for their dignity  their spirit and their resistance  starting with the Incas and continuing through the   th century with the rubber tappers. Today's biggest threat to the Ashaninka people and to Benki comes from illegal logging    the people who come into the beautiful forest and cut down ancient mahogany trees  float them down the river to world markets. Benki knew this. He could see what was happening to his forest  to his environment  because he was taken under his grandfather's wing when he was only two years old to begin to learn about the forest and the way of life of his people. His grandfather died when he was only   . And at that young age     years old  Benki became the paje of his community. Now  in the Ashaninka tradition and culture  the paje is the most important person in the community. This is the person who contains within him all the knowledge  all the wisdom of centuries and centuries of life  and not just about his people  but about everything that his people's survival depended on  the trees  the birds  the water  the soil  the forest. So when he was only    and he became the paje  he began to lead his people. He began to talk to them about the forest that they needed to protect  the way of life they needed to nurture. He explained to them that it was not a question of survival of the fittest  it was a question of understanding what they needed to survive and to protect that. Eight years later  when he was a young man of     Benki left the forest for the first time. He went       miles on an odyssey to Rio to the Earth Summit to tell the world what was happening in his tiny  little corner. And he went because he hoped the world would listen. Some did  not everybody. But if you can imagine this young man with his headdress and his flowing robe  learning a new language  Portuguese  not to mention English  going to Rio  building a bridge to reach out to people he'd never met before    a pretty hostile world. But he wasn't dismayed. Benki came back to his village full of ideas    new technologies  new research  new ways of understanding what was going on. Since that time  he's continued to work with his people  and not only the Ashaninka Nation  but all the peoples of the Amazon and beyond. He's built schools to teach children to care for the forest. Together  he's led the reforestation of over    percent of the land that had been destroyed by the loggers. He's created a cooperative to help people diversify their livelihoods. And he's brought the internet and satellite technology to the forest    both so that people themselves could monitor the deforestation  but also that he could speak from the forest to the rest of the world. If you were to meet Benki and ask him   Why are you doing this  Why are you putting yourself at risk  Why are you making yourself vulnerable to what is often a hostile world   he would tell you  as he told me   I asked myself   he said   What did my grandparents and my great grandparents do to protect the forest for me  And what am I doing   So when I think of that  I wonder what our grandchildren and our great grandchildren  when they ask themselves that question  I wonder how they will answer. For me  the world is veering towards a future we don't much want when we really think about it deep inside. It's a future we don't know the details of  but it's a future that has signs  just like Benki saw the signs around him. We know we are running out of what we need. We're running out of fresh water. We're running out of fossil fuels. We're running out of land. We know climate change is going to affect all of us. We don't know how  but we know it will. And we know that there will be more of us than ever before    five times as many people in    years than    years ago. We are running out of what we need. And we also know that the world has changed in other ways  that since      there are one third as many new countries that exist as independent entities on the planet. Egos  systems of government    figuring it out    massive change. And in addition to that  we know that five other really big countries are going to have a say in the future  a say we haven't even really started to hear yet    China  India  Russia  South Africa and Benki's own Brazil  where Benki got his civil rights only in the      constitution. But you know all that. You know more than Benki knew when he left his forest and went       miles. You also know that we can't just keep doing what we've always done  because we'll get the results we've always gotten. And this reminds me of something I understand Lord Salisbury said to Queen Victoria over a hundred years ago  when she was pressing him   Please change.  He said   Change  Why change  Things are bad enough as they are.  We have to change. It's imperative to me  when I look around the world  that we need to change ourselves. We need new models of what it means to be a leader. We need new models of being a leader and a human in the world. I started life as a banker. Now I don't admit to that to anybody but my very close friends. But for the past eight years  I've done something completely different. My work has taken me around the world  where I've had the real privilege of meeting people like Benki and many others who are making change happen in their communities    people who see the world differently  who are asking different questions  who have different answers  who understand the filters that they wear when they go out into the world. This is Sanghamitra. Sanghamitra comes from Bangalore. I met Sanghamitra eight years ago when I was in Bangalore organizing a workshop with leaders of different NGO's working in some of the hardest aspects of society. Sanghamitra didn't start life as a leader of an NGO  she started her career as university professor  teaching English literature. But she realized that she was much too detached from the world doing that. She loved it  but she was too detached. And so in       a long time ago  she decided to start a new organization called Samraksha focused on one of the hardest areas  one of the hardest issues in India    anywhere in the world at the time    HIV AIDS. Since that time  Samraksha has grown from strength to strength and is now one of the leading health NGO's in India. But if you just think about the state of the world and knowledge of HIV AIDS in         in India at that time it was skyrocketing and nobody understood why  and everyone was actually very  very afraid. Today there are still three million HIV positive people in India. That's the second largest population in the world. When I asked Sanghamitra   How did you get from English literature to HIV AIDS   not an obvious path  she said to me   It's all connected. Literature makes one sensitive  sensitive to people  to their dreams and to their ideas.  Since that time  under her leadership  Samraksha has been a pioneer in all fields related to HIV AIDS. They have respite homes  the first  the first care centers  the first counseling services    and not just in urban    million population Bangalore  but in the hardest to reach villages in the state of Karnataka. Even that wasn't enough. She wanted to change policy at the government level.    of their programs that she pioneered are now government policy and funded by the government. They take care of        odd people today in over       villages around Karnataka. She works with people like Murali Krishna. Murali Krishna comes from one of those villages. He lost his wife to AIDS a couple of years ago  and he's HIV positive. But he saw the work  the care  the compassion that Sanghamitra and her team brought to the village  and he wanted to be part of it. He's a Leaders' Quest fellow  and that helps him with his work. They've pioneered a different approach to villages. Instead of handing out information in pamphlets  as is so often the case  they bring theater troupes  songs  music  dance. And they sit around  and they talk about dreams. Sanghamitra told me just last week    she had just come back from two weeks in the villages  and she had a real breakthrough. They were sitting in a circle  talking about the dreams for the village. And the young women in the village spoke up and said   We've changed our dream. Our dream is for our partners  our husbands  not to be given to us because of a horoscope  but to be given to us because they've been tested for HIV.  If you are lucky enough to meet Sanghamitra and ask her why and how  how have you achieved so much  She would look at you and very quietly  very softly say   It just happened. It's the spirit inside.  This is Dr. Fan Jianchuan. Jianchuan comes from Sichuan Province in southwest China. He was born in       and you can imagine what his childhood looked like and felt like  and what his life has been like over the last    tumultuous years. He's been a soldier  a teacher  a politician  a vice mayor and a business man. But if you sat down and asked him   Who are you really  and what do you do   He would tell you   I'm a collector  and I curate a museum.  I was lucky  I had heard about him for years  and I finally met him earlier this year at his museum in Chengdu. He's been a collector all of his life  starting when he was four or five in the early     's. Now  just think of the early     's in China. Over a lifetime  through everything  through the Cultural Revolution and everything afterward  he's kept collecting  so that he now has over eight million pieces in his museums documenting contemporary Chinese history. These are pieces that you won't find anywhere else in the world  in part because they document parts of history Chinese choose to forget. For example  he's got over one million pieces documenting the Sino Japanese War  a war that's not talked about in China very much and whose heroes are not honored. Why did he do all this  Because he thought a nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past. So  from commissioning slightly larger than life bronze statues of the heroes of the Sino Japanese War  including those Chinese who then fought with each other and left mainland China to go to Taiwan  to commemorating all the unknown  ordinary soldiers who survived  by asking them to take prints of their hands  he is making sure    one man is making sure    that history is not forgotten. But it's not just Chinese heroes he cares about. This building contains the world's largest collection of documents and artifacts commemorating the U.S. role in fighting on the Chinese side in that long war    the Flying Tigers. He has nine other buildings    that are already open to the public    filled to the rafters with artifacts documenting contemporary Chinese history. Two of the most sensitive buildings include a lifetime of collection about the Cultural Revolution  a period that actually most Chinese would prefer to forget. But he doesn't want his nation ever to forget. These people inspire me  and they inspire me because they show us what is possible when you change the way you look at the world  change the way you look at your place in the world. They looked outside  and then they changed what was on the inside. They didn't go to business school. They didn't read a manual   How to Be a Good Leader in    Easy Steps.  But they have qualities we'd all recognize. They have drive  passion  commitment. They've gone away from what they did before  and they've gone to something they didn't know. They've tried to connect worlds they didn't know existed before. They've built bridges  and they've walked across them. They have a sense of the great arc of time and their tiny place in it. They know people have come before them and will follow them. And they know that they're part of a whole  that they depend on other people. It's not about them  they know that  but it has to start with them. And they have humility. It just happens. But we know it doesn't just happen  don't we  We know it takes a lot to make it happen  and we know the direction the world is going in. So I think we need succession planning on a global basis. We can't wait for the next generation  the new joiners  to come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need. I think it has to start with us. And we know  just like they knew  how hard it is. But the good news is that we don't have to figure it out as we go along  we have models  we have examples  like Benki and Sanghamitra and Jianchuan. We can look at what they've done  if we look. We can learn from what they've learned. We can change the way we see ourselves in the world. And if we're lucky  we can change the way our great grandchildren will answer Benki's question. Thank you. To understand the business of mythology and what a Chief Belief Officer is supposed to do  you have to hear a story of Ganesha  the elephant headed god who is the scribe of storytellers  and his brother  the athletic warlord of the gods  Kartikeya. The two brothers one day decided to go on a race  three times around the world. Kartikeya leapt on his peacock and flew around the continents and the mountains and the oceans. He went around once  he went around twice  he went around thrice. But his brother  Ganesha  simply walked around his parents once  twice  thrice  and said   I won.   How come   said Kartikeya. And Ganesha said   You went around 'the world.' I went around 'my world.'  What matters more  If you understand the difference between 'the world' and 'my world ' you understand the difference between logos and mythos. 'The world' is objective  logical  universal  factual  scientific. 'My world' is subjective. It's emotional. It's personal. It's perceptions  thoughts  feelings  dreams. It is the belief system that we carry. It's the myth that we live in. 'The world' tells us how the world functions  how the sun rises  how we are born. 'My world' tells us why the sun rises  why we were born. Every culture is trying to understand itself   Why do we exist   And every culture comes up with its own understanding of life  its own customized version of mythology. Culture is a reaction to nature  and this understanding of our ancestors is transmitted generation from generation in the form of stories  symbols and rituals  which are always indifferent to rationality. And so  when you study it  you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world. Different people see things differently    different viewpoints. There is my world and there is your world  and my world is always better than your world  because my world  you see  is rational and yours is superstition. Yours is faith. Yours is illogical. This is the root of the clash of civilizations. It took place  once  in     B.C. on the banks of a river called the Indus  now in Pakistan. This river lends itself to India's name. India. Indus. Alexander  a young Macedonian  met there what he called a  gymnosophist   which means  the naked  wise man.  We don't know who he was. Perhaps he was a Jain monk  like Bahubali over here  the Gomateshwara Bahubali whose image is not far from Mysore. Or perhaps he was just a yogi who was sitting on a rock  staring at the sky and the sun and the moon. Alexander asked   What are you doing   and the gymnosophist answered   I'm experiencing nothingness.  Then the gymnosophist asked   What are you doing   and Alexander said   I am conquering the world.  And they both laughed. Each one thought that the other was a fool. The gymnosophist said   Why is he conquering the world  It's pointless.  And Alexander thought   Why is he sitting around  doing nothing  What a waste of a life.  To understand this difference in viewpoints  we have to understand the subjective truth of Alexander    his myth  and the mythology that constructed it. Alexander's mother  his parents  his teacher Aristotle told him the story of Homer's  Iliad.  They told him of a great hero called Achilles  who  when he participated in battle  victory was assured  but when he withdrew from the battle  defeat was inevitable.  Achilles was a man who could shape history  a man of destiny  and this is what you should be  Alexander.  That's what he heard.  What should you not be  You should not be Sisyphus  who rolls a rock up a mountain all day only to find the boulder rolled down at night. Don't live a life which is monotonous  mediocre  meaningless. Be spectacular     like the Greek heroes  like Jason  who went across the sea with the Argonauts and fetched the Golden Fleece. Be spectacular like Theseus  who entered the labyrinth and killed the bull headed Minotaur. When you play in a race  win     because when you win  the exhilaration of victory is the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods.  Because  you see  the Greeks believed you live only once  and when you die  you have to cross the River Styx. And if you have lived an extraordinary life  you will be welcomed to Elysium  or what the French call  Champs  lys es     the heaven of the heroes. But these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard. He heard a very different story. He heard of a man called Bharat  after whom India is called Bh rata. Bharat also conquered the world. And then he went to the top most peak of the greatest mountain of the center of the world called Meru. And he wanted to hoist his flag to say   I was here first.  But when he reached the mountain peak  he found the peak covered with countless flags of world conquerors before him  each one claiming  'I was here first' ... that's what I thought until I came here.  And suddenly  in this canvas of infinity  Bharat felt insignificant. This was the mythology of the gymnosophist. You see  he had heroes  like Ram    Raghupati Ram and Krishna  Govinda Hari. But they were not two characters on two different adventures. They were two lifetimes of the same hero. When the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins. When Ram dies  Krishna is born. When Krishna dies  eventually he will be back as Ram. You see  the Indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead. But you don't cross it once. You go to and fro endlessly. It was called the Vaitarani. You go again and again and again. Because  you see  nothing lasts forever in India  not even death. And so  you have these grand rituals where great images of mother goddesses are built and worshiped for    days ... And what do you do at the end of    days  You dunk it in the river. Because it has to end. And next year  she will come back. What goes around always comes around  and this rule applies not just to man  but also the gods. You see  the gods have to come back again and again and again as Ram  as Krishna. Not only do they live infinite lives  but the same life is lived infinite times till you get to the point of it all.  Groundhog Day.  Two different mythologies. Which is right  Two different mythologies  two different ways of looking at the world. One linear  one cyclical. One believes this is the one and only life. The other believes this is one of many lives. And so  the denominator of Alexander's life was one. So  the value of his life was the sum total of his achievements. The denominator of the gymnosophist's life was infinity. So  no matter what he did  it was always zero. And I believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired Indian mathematicians to discover the number zero. Who knows  And that brings us to the mythology of business. If Alexander's belief influenced his behavior  if the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior  then it was bound to influence the business they were in. You see  what is business but the result of how the market behaves and how the organization behaves  And if you look at cultures around the world  all you have to do is understand the mythology and you will see how they behave and how they do business. Take a look. If you live only once  in one life cultures around the world  you will see an obsession with binary logic  absolute truth  standardization  absoluteness  linear patterns in design. But if you look at cultures which have cyclical and based on infinite lives  you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic  with opinion  with contextual thinking  with everything is relative  sort of    mostly. You look at art. Look at the ballerina  how linear she is in her performance. And then look at the Indian classical dancer  the Kuchipudi dancer  the Bharatanatyam dancer  curvaceous. And then look at business. Standard business model  vision  mission  values  processes. Sounds very much like the journey through the wilderness to the promised land  with the commandments held by the leader. And if you comply  you will go to heaven. But in India there is no  the  promised land. There are many promised lands  depending on your station in society  depending on your stage of life. You see  businesses are not run as institutions  by the idiosyncrasies of individuals. It's always about taste. It's always about my taste. You see  Indian music  for example  does not have the concept of harmony. There is no orchestra conductor. There is one performer standing there  and everybody follows. And you can never replicate that performance twice. It is not about documentation and contract. It's about conversation and faith. It's not about compliance. It's about setting  getting the job done  by bending or breaking the rules    just look at your Indian people around here  you'll see them smile  they know what it is. And then look at people who have done business in India  you'll see the exasperation on their faces. You see  this is what India is today. The ground reality is based on a cyclical world view. So  it's rapidly changing  highly diverse  chaotic  ambiguous  unpredictable. And people are okay with it. And then globalization is taking place. The demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in. Which is rooted in one life culture. And a clash is going to take place  like on the banks of the Indus. It is bound to happen. I have personally experienced it. I'm trained as a medical doctor. I did not want to study surgery. Don't ask me why. I love mythology too much. I wanted to learn mythology. But there is nowhere you can study. So  I had to teach it to myself. And mythology does not pay  well  until now. So  I had to take up a job. And I worked in the pharma industry. And I worked in the healthcare industry. And I worked as a marketing guy  and a sales guy  and a knowledge guy  and a content guy  and a training guy. I even was a business consultant  doing strategies and tactics. And I would see the exasperation between my American and European colleagues  when they were dealing with India. Example  Please tell us the process to invoice hospitals. Step A. Step B. Step C. Mostly. How do you parameterize  mostly   How do you put it in a nice little software  You can't. I would give my viewpoints to people. But nobody was interested in listening to it  you see  until I met Kishore Biyani of the Future group. You see  he has established the largest retail chain  called Big Bazaar. And there are more than     formats  across    cities and towns of India. And he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets. And he knew very intuitively  that best practices  developed in Japan and China and Europe and America will not work in India. He knew that institutional thinking doesn't work in India. Individual thinking does. He had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India. So  he had asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer  and said   All I want to do is align belief.  Sounds so simple. But belief is not measurable. You can't measure it. You can't manage it. So  how do you construct belief  How do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indian ness. Even if you are Indian  it is not very explicit  it is not very obvious. So  I tried to work on the standard model of culture  which is  develop stories  symbols and rituals. And I will share one of the rituals with you. You see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan. Hindus don't have the concept of commandments. So  there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life. So  you're not really sure how you stand in front of God. So  when you go to the temple  all you seek is an audience with God. You want to see God. And you want God to see you  and hence the gods have very large eyes  large unblinking eyes  sometimes made of silver  so they look at you. Because you don't know whether you're right or wrong  and so all you seek is divine empathy.  Just know where I came from  why I did the Jugaad.   Why did I do the setting  why I don't care for the processes. Just understand me  please.  And based on this  we created a ritual for leaders. After a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store  we blindfold him  we surround him with the stakeholders  the customer  his family  his team  his boss. You read out his KRA  his KPI  you give him the keys  and then you remove the blindfold. And invariably  you see a tear  because the penny has dropped. He realizes that to succeed  he does not have to be a  professional   he does not have to cut out his emotions  he has to include all these people in his world to succeed  to make them happy  to make the boss happy  to make everyone happy. The customer is happy  because the customer is God. That sensitivity is what we need. Once this belief enters  behavior will happen  business will happen. And it has. So  then we come back to Alexander and to the gymnosophist. And everybody asks me   Which is the better way  this way or that way   And it's a very dangerous question  because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence. So  I will not answer the question. What I will give you is an Indian answer  the Indian head shake. Depending on the context  depending on the outcome  choose your paradigm. You see  because both the paradigms are human constructions. They are cultural creations  not natural phenomena. And so the next time you meet someone  a stranger  one request  Understand that you live in the subjective truth  and so does he. Understand it. And when you understand it you will discover something spectacular. You will discover that within infinite myths lies the eternal truth. Who sees it all  Varuna has but a thousand eyes. Indra  a hundred. You and I  only two. Thank you. Namaste. As technology progresses  and as it advances  many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent  make us smarter and more connected to the world. And what I'd like to argue is that that's not necessarily the case  as progress is simply a word for change  and with change you gain something  but you also lose something. And to really illustrate this point  what I'd like to do is to show you how technology has dealt with a very simple  a very common  an everyday question. And that question is this. What time is it  What time is it  If you glance at your iPhone  it's so simple to tell the time. But  I'd like to ask you  how would you tell the time if you didn't have an iPhone  How would you tell the time  say      years ago  How would you do it  Well  the way you would do it is by using a device that's called an astrolabe. So  an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world. But  at the time  in the   th century  it was the gadget of the day. It was the world's first popular computer. And it was a device that  in fact  is a model of the sky. So  the different parts of the astrolabe  in this particular type  the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars. The plate corresponds to a coordinate system. And the mater has some scales and puts it all together. If you were an educated child  you would know how to not only use the astrolabe  you would also know how to make an astrolabe. And we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe  the first technical manual in the English language  was written by Geoffrey Chaucer. Yes  that Geoffrey Chaucer  in       to his little Lewis  his    year old son. And in this book  little Lewis would know the big idea. And the central idea that makes this computer work is this thing called stereographic projection. And basically  the concept is  how do you represent the three dimensional image of the night sky that surrounds us onto a flat  portable  two dimensional surface. The idea is actually relatively simple. Imagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe  and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere. Each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole  onto a flat surface  where it is then recorded. So the North Star corresponds to the center of the device. The ecliptic  which is the path of the sun  moon  and planets correspond to an offset circle. The bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete. And the altitude corresponds to the plate system. Now  the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection. The real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems so they fit perfectly. There is the position of the sun  moon and planets on the movable rete. And then there is their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate. Okay  So how would you use this device  Well  let me first back up for a moment. This is an astrolabe. Pretty impressive  isn't it  And so  this astrolabe is on loan from us from the Oxford School of    Museum of History. And you can see the different components. This is the mater  the scales on the back. This is the rete. Okay. Do you see that  That's the movable part of the sky. And in the back you can see a spider web pattern. And that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky. This is a rule device. And on the back are some other devices  measuring tools and scales  to be able to make some calculations. Okay  You know  I've always wanted one of these. For my thesis I actually built one of these out of paper. And this one  this is a replica from a   th century device. And it's worth probably about three MacBook Pros. But a real one would cost about as much as my house  and the house next to it  and actually every house on the block  on both sides of the street  maybe a school thrown in  and some    you know  a church. They are just incredibly expensive. But let me show you how to work this device. So let's go to step one. First thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky  if you're telling time at night. So  tonight  if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle. And there is a bright star called Deneb. So let's select Deneb. Second  is you measure the altitude of Deneb. So  step two  I hold the device up  and then I sight its altitude there so I can see it clearly now. And then I measure its altitude. So  it's about    degrees. You can't see it from over there. Step three is identify the star on the front of the device. Deneb is there. I can tell. Step four is I then move the rete  move the sky  so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back. Okay  so when that happens everything lines up. I have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky. Okay  So  it is  in a sense  holding a model of the universe in my hands. And then finally  I take a rule  and move the rule to a date line which then tells me the time here. Right. So  that's how the device is used. So  I know what you're thinking   That's a lot of work  isn't it  Isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time   as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time. But there is a difference between the two  because with your iPod you can tell    or your iPhone  you can tell exactly what the time is  with precision. The way little Lewis would tell the time is by a picture of the sky. He would know where things would fit in the sky. He would not only know what time it was  he would also know where the sun would rise  and how it would move across the sky. He would know what time the sun would rise  and what time it would set. And he would know that for essentially every celestial object in the heavens. So  in computer graphics and computer user interface design  there is a term called affordances. So  affordances are the qualities of an object that allow us to perform an action with it. And what the astrolabe does is it allows us  it affords us  to connect to the night sky  to look up into the night sky and be much more    to see the visible and the invisible together. So  that's just one use. Incredible  there is probably          uses. In fact  there is a text  and that has over a thousand uses of this first computer. On the back there is scales and measurements for terrestrial navigation. You can survey with it. The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it. It can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types. And it would take a full university course to illustrate it. Astrolabes have an incredible history. They are over       years old. The concept of stereographic projection originated in     B.C. And the astrolabes come in many different sizes and shapes and forms. There is portable ones. There is large display ones. And I think what is common to all astrolabes is that they are beautiful works of art. There is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable. Astrolabes  like every technology  do evolve over time. So  the earliest retes  for example  were very simple and primitive. And advancing retes became cultural emblems. This is one from Oxford. And I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical  and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical  or random sky. How cool is that  This is just amazing. So  would little Lewis have an astrolabe  Probably not one made of brass. He would have one made out of wood  or paper. And the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket. So  what does the astrolabe inspire  Well  I think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful people were  our forebears were  years and years ago. It's just an incredible device. Every technology advances. Every technology is transformed and moved by others. And what we gain with a new technology  of course  is precision and accuracy. But what we lose  I think  is an accurate    a felt sense of the sky  a sense of context. Knowing the sky  knowing your relationship with the sky  is the center of the real answer to knowing what time it is. So  it's    I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices. And so  what can you learn from these devices  Well  primarily that there is a subtle knowledge that we can connect with the world. And astrolabes return us to this subtle sense of how things all fit together  and also how we connect to the world. Thanks very much. Once upon a time  at the age of     I was a student at St. John's Medical College in Bangalore. I was a guest student during one month of a public health course. And that changed my mindset forever. The course was good  but it was not the course content in itself that changed the mindset. It was the brutal realization  the first morning  that the Indian students were better than me. You see  I was a study nerd. I loved statistics from a young age. And I studied very much in Sweden. I used to be in the upper quarter of all courses I attended. But in St. John's  I was in the lower quarter. And the fact was that Indian students studied harder than we did in Sweden. They read the textbook twice  or three times or four times. In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying. And that  to me  that personal experience was the first time in my life that the mindset I grew up with was changed. And I realized that perhaps the Western world will not continue to dominate the world forever. And I think many of you have the same sort of personal experience. It's that realization of someone you meet that really made you change your ideas about the world. It's not the statistics  although I tried to make it funny. And I will now  here  onstage  try to predict when that will happen    that Asia will regain its dominant position as the leading part of the world  as it used to be  over thousands of years. And I will do that by trying to predict precisely at what year the average income per person in India  in China  will reach that of the West. And I don't mean the whole economy  because to grow an economy of India to the size of U.K.    that's a piece of cake  with one billion people. But I want to see when will the average pay  the money for each person  per month  in India and China  when will that have reached that of U.K. and the United States  But I will start with a historical background. And you can see my map if I get it up here. You know  I will start at     .      was a year of great technological advancement in the West. That was the year when Queen Victoria was able  for the first time  to communicate with President Buchanan  through the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable. And they were the first to  Twitter  transatlantically. And I've been able  through this wonderful Google and Internet  to find the text of the telegram sent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria. And it ends like this   This telegraph is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion  civilization  liberty and law throughout the world.  Those are nice words. But I got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty  and liberty for whom. And we will think about that when we look at the wider picture of the world in     . Because      was also watershed year in the history of Asia.      was the year when the courageous uprising against the foreign occupation of India was defeated by the British forces. And India was up to    years more of foreign domination.      in China was the victory in the Opium War by the British forces. And that meant that foreigners  as it said in the treaty  were allowed to trade freely in China. It meant paying with opium for Chinese goods. And      in Japan was the year when Japan had to sign the Harris Treaty and accept trade on favorable condition for the U.S. And they were threatened by those black ships there  that had been in Tokyo harbor over the last year. But  Japan  in contrast to India and China  maintained its national sovereignty. And let's see how much difference that can make. And I will do that by bringing these bubbles back to a Gapminder graph here  where you can see each bubble is a country. The size of the bubble here is the population. On this axis  as I used to have income per person in comparable dollar. And on that axis I have life expectancy  the health of people. And I also bring an innovation here. I have transformed the laser beam into an ecological  recyclable version here  in green India. And we will see  you know. Look here        India was here  China was here  Japan was there  United States and United Kingdom was richer over there. And I will start the world like this. India was not always like this level. Actually if we go back into the historical record  there was a time hundreds of years ago when the income per person in India and China was even above that of Europe. But      had already been many  many years of foreign domination  and India had been de industrialized. And you can see that the countries who were growing their economy was United States and United Kingdom. And they were also  by the end of the century  getting healthy  and Japan was starting to catch up. India was trying down here. Can you see how it starts to move there  But really  really natural sovereignty was good for Japan. And Japan is trying to move up there. And it's the new century now. Health is getting better  United Kingdom  United States. But careful now    we are approaching the First World War. And the First World War  you know  we'll see a lot of deaths and economical problems here. United Kingdom is going down. And now comes the Spanish flu also. And then after the First World War  they continue up. Still under foreign domination  and without sovereignty  India and China are down in the corner. Not much has happened. They have grown their population but not much more. In the     's now  you can see that Japan is going to a period of war  with lower life expectancy. And the Second World War was really a terrible event  also economically for Japan. But they did recover quite fast afterwards. And we are moving into the new world. In      India finally gained its independence. And they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation  but in very big difficulties down there. In      we saw the emergence of the modern China in a way which surprised the world. And what happened  What happens in the after independence  You can see that the health started to improve. Children started to go to school. Health services were provided. This is the Great Leap Forward  when China fell down. It was central planning by Mao Tse Tung. China recovered. Then they said   Nevermore  stupid central planning.  But they went up here  and India was trying to follow. And they were catching up indeed. And both countries had the better health  but still a very low economy. And we came to       and Mao Tse Tung died  and a new guy turned up from the left. And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here. And he said   Doesn't matter if a cat is white or black  as long as it catches mice.  Because catching mice is what the two cats wanted to do. And you can see the two cats being here  China and India  wanting to catch the mices over there  you know. And they decided to go not only for health and education  but also starting to grow their economy. And the market reformer was successful there. In '   India follows with a market reform. And they go quite closely together  and you can see that the similarity with India and China  in many ways  are greater than the differences with them. And here they march on. And will they catch up  This is the big question today. There they are today. Now what does it mean that the    the averages there    this is the average of China. If I would split China  look here  Shanghai has already catched up. Shanghai is already there. And it's healthier than the United States. But on the other hand  Guizhou  one of the poorest inland provinces of China  is there. And if I split Guizhou into urban and rural  the rural part of Guizhou goes down there. You see this enormous inequity in China  in the midst of fast economic growth. And if I would also look at India  you have another type of inequity  actually  in India. The geographical  macro geographical difference is not so big. Uttar Pradesh  the biggest of the states here  is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India. Kerala is flying on top there  matching United States in health  but not in economy. And here  Maharashtra  with Mumbai  is forging forward. Now in India  the big inequities are within the state  rather than between the states. And that is not a bad thing  in itself. If you have a lot inequity  macro geographical inequities can be more difficult in the long term to deal with  than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center relatively close to where poor people are living. No  there is one more inequity. Look there  United States. Oh  they broke my frame. Washington  D.C. went out here. My friends at Gapminder wanted me to show this because there is a new leader in Washington who is really concerned about the health system. And I can understand him  because Washington  D.C. is so rich over there but they are not as healthy as Kerala. It's quite interesting  isn't it  I can see a business opportunity for Kerala  helping fix the health system in the United States. Now here we have the whole world. You have the legend down there. And when you see the two giant cats here  pushing forward  you see that in between them and ahead of them  is the whole emerging economies of the world  which Thomas Friedman so correctly called the  flat world.  You can see that in health and education  a large part of the world population is putting forward  but in Africa  and other parts  as in rural Guizhou in China  there is still people with low health and very low economy. We have an enormous disparity in the world. But most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast. Now  back to my projections. When will it catch up  I have to go back to very conventional graph. I will show income per person on this axis instead  poor down here  rich up there. And then time here  from      I start the world. And we shall see what will happen with these countries. You see  China under foreign domination actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here. Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer. And after Second World War  United States is richer than U.K. But independence is coming here. Growth is starting  economic reform. Growth is faster  and with projection from IMF you can see where you expect them to be in     . Now  the question is   When will the catch up take place   Look at  look at the United States. Can you see the bubble  The bubbles  not my bubbles  but the financial bubbles. That's the dot com bubble. This is the Lehman Brothers doorstep there. You see it came down there. And it seems this is another rock coming down there  you know. So they doesn't seem to go this way  these countries. They seem to go in a more humble growth way  you know. And people interested in growth are turning their eyes towards Asia. I can compare to Japan. This is Japan coming up. You see  Japan did it like that. We add Japan to it. And there is no doubt that fast catch up can take place. Can you see here what Japan did  Japan did it like this  until full catch up  and then they follow with the other high income economies. But the real projections for those ones  I would like to give it like this. Can be worse  can be better. It's always difficult to predict  especially about the future. Now  a historian tells me it's even more difficult to predict about the past. I think I'm in a difficult position here. Inequalities in China and India I consider really the big obstacle because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity is what will create a domestic market  what will avoid social instability  and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population. So  social investments in health  education and infrastructure  and electricity is really what is needed in India and China. You know the climate. We have great international experts within India telling us that the climate is changing  and actions has to be taken  otherwise China and India would be the countries most to suffer from climate change. And I consider India and China the best partners in the world in a good global climate policy. But they ain't going to pay for what others  who have more money  have largely created  and I can agree on that. But what I'm really worried about is war. Will the former rich countries really accept a completely changed world economy  and a shift of power away from where it has been the last    to     to     years  back to Asia  And will Asia be able to handle that new position of being in charge of being the most mighty  and the governors of the world  So  always avoid war  because that always pushes human beings backward. Now if these inequalities  climate and war can be avoided  get ready for a world in equity  because this is what seems to be happening. And that vision that I got as a young student        that Indians can be much better than Swedes  is just about to happen. And it will happen precisely the year      in the later part of the summer  in July  more precisely  the   th of July. The   th of July       is my    th birthday. And I expect to speak in the first session of the   th TED India. Get your bookings in time. Thank you very much. As a culture  we tell ourselves lots of stories about the future  and where we might move forward from this point. Some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us. Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling. But I want to tell you a different story here today. Like all stories  it has a beginning. My work  for a long time  has been involved in education  in teaching people practical skills for sustainability  teaching people how to take responsibility for growing some of their own food  how to build buildings using local materials  how to generate their own energy  and so on. I lived in Ireland  built the first straw bale houses in Ireland  and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing. But all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model  and moderating what comes in at one end  and moderating the outputs at the other end. And then I came into contact with a way of looking at things which actually changed that profoundly. And in order to introduce you to that  I've got something here that I'm going to unveil  which is one of the great marvels of the modern age. And it's something so astounding and so astonishing that I think maybe as I remove this cloth a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate. If you could help me with that it would be fantastic. This is a liter of oil. This bottle of oil  distilled over a hundred million years of geological time  ancient sunlight  contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor    equivalent to about    strong people coming round and working for you. We can turn it into a dazzling array of materials  medicine  modern clothing  laptops  a whole range of different things. It gives us an energy return that's unimaginable  historically. We've based the design of our settlements  our business models  our transport plans  even the idea of economic growth  some would argue  on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity. Yet  when we take a step back  and look over the span of history  at what we might call the petroleum interval  it's a short period in history where we've discovered this extraordinary material  and then based a whole way of life around it. But as we straddle the top of this energy mountain  at this stage  we move from a time where our economic success  our sense of individual prowess and well being is directly linked to how much of this we consume  to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency is our degree of vulnerability. And it's increasingly clear that we aren't going to be able to rely on the fact that we're going to have this at our disposal forever. For every four barrels of oil that we consume  we only discover one. And that gap continues to widen. There is also the fact that the amount of energy that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling. In the     s we got     units of energy back for every one that we put in to extract it. Completely unprecedented  historically. Already that's fallen to about   . And that's why  now  the new breakthroughs  the new frontiers in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta  or at the bottom of the oceans. There are    oil producing nations in the world. But of those     have already passed their peak. The moment when the world on average passes this peak  people wonder when that's going to happen. And there is an emerging case that maybe that was what happened last July when the oil prices were so high. But are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side  No. But the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a realistic assessment of where we are. There is also the issue of climate change  is the other thing that underpins this transition approach. But the thing that I notice  as I talk to climate scientists  is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes  as the data that's coming in  which is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about. So the IPCC said that we might see significant breakup of the arctic ice in       in their worst case scenario. Actually  if current trends continue  it could all be gone in five or    years' time. If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms  it would offset all the savings that we need to make  in carbon  over the next    years to avoid runaway climate change. We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization. But I'm always very interested to think about what might the stories be that the generations further down the slope from us are going to tell about us.  The generation that lived at the top of the mountain  that partied so hard  and so abused its inheritance.  And one of the ways I like to do that is to look back at the stories people used to tell before we had cheap oil  before we had fossil fuels  and people relied on their own muscle  animal muscle energy  or a little bit of wind  little bit of water energy. We had stories like  The Seven League Boots   the giant who had these boots  where  once you put them on  with every stride you could cover seven leagues  or    miles  a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal. Stories like The Magic Porridge Pot  where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words  this pot would just make as much food as you liked  without you having to do any work  provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge. Otherwise you'd flood your entire town with warm porridge. There is the story of  The Elves and the Shoemaker.  The people who make shoes go to sleep  wake up in the morning  and all the shoes are magically made for them. It's something that was unimaginable to people then. Now we have the seven league boots in the form of Ryanair and Easyjet. We have the magic porridge pot in the form of Walmart and Tesco. And we have the elves in the form of China. But we don't appreciate what an astonishing thing that has been. And what are the stories that we tell ourselves now  as we look forward about where we're going to go. And I would argue that there are four. There is the idea of business as usual  that the future will be like the present  just more of it. But as we've seen over the last year  I think that's an idea that is increasingly coming into question. And in terms of climate change  is something that is not actually feasible. There is the idea of hitting the wall  that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse. This is a popular story in some places. The third story is the idea that technology can solve everything  that technology can somehow get us through this completely. And it's an idea that I think is very prevalent at these TED Talks  the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound economic and energy crisis  that a move to a knowledge economy can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints  the idea that we'll discover some fabulous new source of energy that will mean we can sweep all concerns about energy security to one side  the idea that we can step off neatly onto a completely renewable world. But the world isn't Second Life. We can't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse. And as we sit  exchanging free ideas with each other  there are still people mining coal in order to power the servers  extracting the minerals to make all of those things. The breakfast that we eat as we sit down to check our email in the morning is still transported at great distances  usually at the expense of the local  more resilient food systems that would have supplied that in the past  which we've so effectively devalued and dismantled. We can be astonishingly inventive and creative. But we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands. Energy and technology are not the same thing. What I'm involved with is the transition response. And this is really about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face  and responding with a creativity and an adaptability and an imagination that we really need. It's something which has spread incredibly fast. And it is something which has several characteristics. It's viral. It seems to spread under the radar very  very quickly. It's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it. It's self organizing. There is no great central organization that pushes this  people just pick up an idea and they run with it  and they implement it where they are. It's solutions focused. It's very much looking at what people can do where they are  to respond to this. It's sensitive to place and to scale. Transitional is completely different. Transition groups in Chile  transition groups in the U.S.  transition groups here  what they're doing looks very different in every place that you go to. It learns very much from its mistakes. And it feels historic. It tries to create a sense that this is a historic opportunity to do something really extraordinary. And it's a process which is really joyful. People have a huge amount of fun doing this  reconnecting with other people as they do it. One of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience. And I think  in many ways  the idea of resilience is a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability. The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology. And it's really about how systems  settlements  withstand shock from the outside. When they encounter shock from the outside that they don't just unravel and fall to pieces. And I think it's a more useful concept than sustainability  as I said. When our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them at any one time  often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in. Looking through the lens of resilience  we really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation that's so vulnerable. Resilience runs much deeper  it's about building modularity into what we do  building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us. This is a photograph of the Bristol and District Market Gardeners Association  in     . This is at a time when the city of Bristol  which is quite close to here  was surrounded by commercial market gardens  which provided a significant amount of the food that was consumed in the town  and created a lot of employment for people  as well. There was a degree of resilience  if you like  at that time  which we can now only look back on with envy. So how does this transition idea work  So basically  you have a group of people who are excited by the idea. They pick up some of the tools that we've developed. They start to run an awareness raising program looking at how this might actually work in the town. They show films  they give talks  and so on. It's a process which is playful and creative and informative. Then they start to form working groups  looking at different aspects of this  and then from that  there emerge a whole lot of projects which then the transition project itself starts to support and enable. So it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland  where I was teaching  and has since spread. There are now over     formal transition projects. And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage. They are mulling whether they're going to take it further. And actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff. But what do they actually do  You know  it's a kind of nice idea  but what do they actually do on the ground  Well  I think it's really important to make the point that actually you know  this isn't something which is going to do everything on its own. We need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on. We need national responses. We need local government responses. But all of those things are going to be much easier if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas and leading from the front  making unelectable policies electable  over the next   to    years. Some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects  like community supported agriculture schemes  urban food production  creating local food directories  and so on. A lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies  community owned energy companies  where the community can invest money into itself  to start putting in place the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need. A lot of places are working with their local schools. Newent in the Forest of Dean  big polytunnel they built for the school  the kids are learning how to grow food. Promoting recycling  things like garden share  that matches up people who don't have a garden who would like to grow food  with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore. Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces. And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies. This is Lewes in Sussex  who have recently launched the Lewes Pound  a currency that you can only spend within the town  as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy. You take it anywhere else  it's not worth anything. But actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively. Another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan  which is basically to develop a plan B for the town. Most of our local authorities  when they sit down to plan for the next five             years of a community  still start by assuming that there will be more energy  more cars  more housing  more jobs  more growth  and so on. What does it look like if that's not the case  And how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody  As a friend of mine says   Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for.  And that's certainly been my experience with transition. From three years ago  it just being an idea  this has become something that has virally swept around the world. We're getting a lot of interest from government. Ed Miliband  the energy minister of this country  was invited to come to our recent conference as a keynote listener. Which he did    and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea. There are now two local authorities in this country who have declared themselves transitional local authorities  Leicestershire and Somerset. And in Stroud  the transition group there  in effect  wrote the local government's food plan. And the head of the council said   If we didn't have Transition Stroud  we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time.  As we see the spread of it  we see national hubs emerging. In Scotland  the Scottish government's climate change fund has funded Transition Scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this. And we see it all over the place as well now. But the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now  but that things are already inevitably changing  and what we need to do is to work creatively with that  based on asking the right questions. I think I'd like to just return at the end to the idea of stories. Because I think stories are vital here. And actually the stories that we tell ourselves  we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here. And one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories out of what people are doing. Stories about the community that's produced its own    pound note  for example  the school that's turned its car park into a food garden  the community that's founded its own energy company. And for me  one of the great stories recently was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House to create a vegetable garden. Because the last time that was done  when Eleanor Roosevelt did it  it led to the creation of    million vegetable gardens across the United States. So the question I'd like to leave you with  really  is    for all aspects of the things that your community needs in order to thrive  how can it be done in such a way that drastically reduces its carbon emissions  while also building resilience  Personally  I feel enormously grateful to have lived through the age of cheap oil. I've been astonishingly lucky  we've been astonishingly lucky. But let us honor what it has bought us  and move forward from this point. Because if we cling to it  and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices  the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable. And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us  and that the Oil Age has done for us  we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient  more nourishing  and in which  we find ourselves fitter  more skilled and more connected to each other. Thank you very much. It's a bit funny to be at a conference dedicated to things not seen  and present my proposal to build a       kilometer long wall across the entire African continent. About the size of the Great Wall of China  this would hardly be an invisible structure. And yet it's made from parts that are invisible  or near invisible  to the naked eye  bacteria and grains of sand. Now  as architects we're trained to solve problems. But I don't really believe in architectural problems  I only believe in opportunities. Which is why I'll show you a threat  and an architectural response. The threat is desertification. My response is a sandstone wall made from bacteria and solidified sand  stretching across the desert. Now  sand is a magical material of beautiful contradictions. It is simple and complex. It is peaceful and violent. It is always the same  never the same  endlessly fascinating. One billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second. That's a cyclical process. As rocks and mountains die  grains of sand are born. Some of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone. And as the sandstone weathers  new grains break free. Some of those grains may then accumulate on a massive scale  into a sand dune. In a way  the static  stone mountain becomes a moving mountain of sand. But  moving mountains can be dangerous. Let me try and explain why. Dry areas cover more than one third of the Earth's land surfaces. Some are already deserts  others are being seriously degraded by the sand. Just south of the Sahara we find the Sahel. The name means  edge of the desert.  And this is the region most closely associated with desertification. It was here in the late '  s and early '  s that major droughts brought three million people to become dependent upon emergency food aid  with about up to         dying. This is a catastrophe waiting to happen again. And it's one that gets very little attention. In our accelerated media culture  desertification is simply too slow to reach the headlines. It's nothing like a tsunami or a Katrina  too few crying children and smashed up houses. And yet desertification is a major threat on all continents  affecting some     countries and about    percent of the world's agricultural drylands. It seriously threatens the livelihoods of millions of people  and especially in Africa and China. And it is largely an issue that we've created for ourselves through unsustainable use of scarce resources. So  we get climate change. We get droughts  increased desertification  crashing food systems  water scarcity  famine  forced migration  political instability  warfare  crisis. That's a potential scenario if we fail to take this seriously. But  how far away is it  I went to Sokoto in northern Nigeria to try and find out how far away it is. The dunes here move southward at a pace of around     meters a year. That's the Sahara eating up almost  two meters  a day of the arable land  physically pushing people away from their homes. Here I am    I'm the second person on the left    with the elders in Gidan Kara  a tiny village outside of Sokoto. They had to move this village in      as a huge dune threatened to swallow it. So  they moved the entire village  hut by hut. This is where the village used to be. It took us about    minutes to climb up to the top of that dune  which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location. That's the kind of forced migration that desertification can lead to. If you happen to live close to the desert border  you can pretty much calculate how long it will be before you have to carry your kids away  and abandon your home and your life as you know it. Now  sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts. And still  those extreme environments are very good places if we want to stop the shifting sands. Four years ago     African countries came together to create the Great Green Wall Sahara. A fantastic project  the initial plan called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted right across the African continent  from Mauritania in the west  all the way to Djibouti in the east. If you want to stop a sand dune from moving  what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains from avalanching over its crest. And a good way of doing that  the most efficient way  is to use some kind of sand catcher. Trees or cacti are good for this. But  one of the problems with planting trees is that the people in these regions are so poor that they chop them down for firewood. Now there is an alternative to just planting trees and hoping that they won't get chopped down. This sandstone wall that I'm proposing essentially does three things. It adds roughness to the dune's surface  to the texture of the dune's surface  binding the grains. It provides a physical support structure for the trees  and it creates physical spaces  habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes. If people live inside of the green barrier they can help support the trees  protect them from humans  and from some of the forces of nature. Inside of the dunes we find shade. We can start harvesting condensation  and start greening the desert from within. Sand dunes are almost like ready made buildings in a way. All we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid  and then excavate the sand  and we have our architecture. We can either excavate it by hand or we can have the wind excavate it for us. So  the wind carries the sand onto the site and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us. But  by now  you're probably asking  how am I planning to solidify a sand dune  How do we glue those grains of sand together  And the answer is  perhaps  that you use these guys  Bacillus pasteurii  a micro organism that is readily available in wetlands and marshes  and does precisely that. It takes a pile of loose sand and it creates sandstone out of it. These images from the American Society for Microbiology show us the process. What happens is  you pour Bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of sand  and it starts filling up the voids in between the grains. A chemical process produces calcite  which is a kind of natural cement that binds the grains together. The whole cementation process takes about    hours. I learned about this from a professor at U.C. Davis called Jason DeJong. He managed to do it in a mere       minutes. Here I am  playing the part of the mad scientist  working with the bugs at UCL in London  trying to solidify them. So  how much would this cost  I'm not an economist  very much not  but I did  quite literally  a back of the envelope calculation       and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete we would have to pay in the region of    dollars. And  after an initial cost of    bucks to buy the bacteria  which you'll never have to pay again  one cubic meter of bacterial sand would be about    dollars. How do we construct something like this  Well  I'll quickly show you two options. The first is to create a kind of balloon structure  fill it with bacteria  then allow the sand to wash over the balloon  pop the balloon  as it were  disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it. Then  a few years afterwards  using permacultural strategies  we green that part of the desert. The second alternative would be to use injection piles. So  we pushed the piles down through the dune  and we create an initial bacterial surface. We then pull the piles up through the dune and we're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand with the sand acting as a mold as we go up. So  we have a way of turning sand into sandstone  and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes. But  what should they look like  Well  I was inspired  for my architectural form  by tafoni  which look a little bit like this  this is a model representation of it. These are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto. And I realized that if I scaled them up  they would provide me with good spatial qualities  for ventilation  for thermal comfort  and for other things. Now  part of the formal control over this structure would be lost to nature  obviously  as the bacteria do their work. And I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually. I think there is really something in that articulation that is quite nice. We see the result  the traces  if you like  of the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert into these habitable environments. Some people believe that this would spread uncontrollably  and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way. That's not true at all. It's a natural process. It goes on in nature today  and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them. So  there it is    architectural anti desertification structures made from the desert itself. Sand stopping devices  made from sand. The world is likely to lose one third of its arable land by the end of the century. In a period of unprecedented population growth and increased food demands  this could prove disastrous. And quite frankly  we're putting our heads in the sand. If nothing else  I would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion. But  if I had something like a TED wish  it would be to actually get it built  to start building this habitable wall  this very  very long  but very narrow city in the desert  built into the dunescape itself. It's not only something that supports trees  but something that connects people and countries together. I would like to conclude by showing you an animation of the structure  and leave you with a sentence by Jorge Luis Borges. Borges said that  nothing is built on stone  everything is built on sand  but we must build as if the sand were stone.  Now  there are many details left to explore in this scheme    political  practical  ethical  financial. My design  as it takes you down the rabbit hole  is fraught with many challenges and difficulties in the real world. But  it's a beginning  it's a vision. As Borges would have it  it's the sand. And I think now is really the time to turn it into stone. Thank you. One day a one eyed monkey came into the forest. Under a tree she saw a woman meditating furiously. The one eyed monkey recognized the woman  a Sekhri. She was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin. To watch her better  the one eyed monkey climbed onto the tree. Just then  with a loud bang  the heavens opened.  Claps  And the god Indra jumped into the clearing. Indra saw the woman  a Sekhri. Ah hah. The woman paid him no heed. So  Indra  attracted  threw her onto the floor  and proceeded to rape her. Then Indra disappeared.  Clap  Clap   And the woman's husband  the Brahmin  appeared. He realized at once what had happened. So  he petitioned the higher gods so that he may have justice. So  the god Vishnu arrived.  Are there any witnesses    Just a one eyed monkey   said the Brahmin. Now  the one eyed monkey really wanted for the woman  a Sekhri  to get justice  so she retold events exactly as they had happened. Vishnu gave his judgment.  The god Indra has sinned  in that he has sinned against ... a Brahmin. May he be called to wash away his sins.  So  Indra arrived  and performed the sacrifice of the horse. And so it transpired that a horse was killed  a god was made sin free  a Brahmin's ego was appeased  a woman ... was ruined  and a one eyed monkey was left ... very confused at what we humans call justice. In India there is a rape every three minutes. In India  only    percent of rapes come to a police station  and of these    percent that come to a police station  convictions are only in four percent of the cases. That's a lot of women who don't get justice. And it's not only about women. Look around you  look at your own countries. There is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes. If you're in Australia  it's mostly aboriginals who are in jail. If you're in India  it's either Muslims or Adivasis  our tribals  the Naxalites. If you're in the U.S.  it's mostly the blacks. There is a trend here. And the Brahmins and the gods  like in my story  always get to tell their truth as The Truth. So  have we all become one eyed    two eyed instead of one eyed    monkeys  Have we stopped seeing injustice  Good morning. You know  I have told this story close to     times  in audiences in    countries  to school students  to black tie dinners at the Smithsonian  and so on and so forth  and every time it hits something. Now  if I were to go into the same crowd and say   I want to lecture you about justice and injustice   they would say   Thank you very much  we have other things to do.  And that is the astonishing power of art. Art can go through where other things can't. You can't have barriers  because it breaks through your prejudices  breaks through everything that you have as your mask  that says   I am this  I am that  I am that.  No. It breaks through those. And it reaches somewhere where other things don't. And in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change  we need a language that reaches through. Hitler knew it  he used Wagner to make all the Nazis feel wonderful and Aryan. And Mr. Berlusconi knows it  as he sits atop this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth. And all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies  and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don't require  they also know the power of the arts. For me it came very early. When I was a young child  my mother  who was a choreographer  came upon a phenomenon that worried her. It was a phenomenon where young brides were committing suicide in rural Gujarat  because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in laws' families. And she created a dance piece which then Prime Minister Nehru saw. He came to talk to her and said   What is this about   She told him and he set out the first inquiry into what today we call Dowry Dance. Imagine a dance piece for the first inquiry into something that even today kills thousands of women. Many years later  when I was working with the director Peter Brook in  The Mahabharata  playing this feisty feminine feminist called Draupadi  I had similar experiences. Big fat black mamas in the Bronx used to come and say   Hey girl  that's it   And then these trendy young things in the Sorbonne would say   Madame Draupadi  on n'est pas feministe  mais  a   a   And then aboriginal women in Africa would come and say   This is it   And I thought   This is what we need  as a language.  We had somebody from public health. And Devdutt also mentioned public health. Well  millions of people around the world die of waterborne disease every year. And that's because there is no clean water to drink  or in countries like India  people don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation. So  what do they do  They drink the water they know is dirty  they get cholera  they get diarrhea  they get jaundice and they die. And governments have not been able to provide clean water. They try and build it. They try and build pipelines  it doesn't happen. And the MNCs give them machines that they cannot afford. So what do you do  Do you let them die  Well  somebody had a great idea. And it was a simple idea. It was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help health in every field. Most houses in Asia and India have a cotton garment. And it was discovered  and WHO endorses this  that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over  can reduce bacteria up to    percent from water sieved through. So  why aren't governments blaring this on television  Why isn't it on every poster across the third world  Because there is no profit in it. Because nobody can get a kickback. But it still needs to get to people. And here is one of the ways we get it to people.  Video  Woman  Then get me one of those fancy water purifiers. Man  You know how expensive those are. I have a solution that requires neither machine  nor wood  nor cooking gas. Woman  What solution  Man  Listen  go fetch that cotton sari you have. Boy  Grand dad  tell me the solution please. Man  I will tell all of you. Just wait. Woman  Here father.  Man  Is it clean   Woman  Yes  of course. Man  Then do as I tell you. Fold the sari into eight folds. Woman  All right  father. Man  And you  you count that she does it right.  Boy  All right  grand dad.  Man  One  two  three  four folds we make. All the germs from the water we take. Chorus  One  two  three  four folds we make. All the germs from the water we take. Five  six  seven  eight folds we make. Our drinking water safe we make. Five  six  seven  eight folds we make. Our drinking water safe we make. Woman  Here  father  your eight times folded cotton sari. Man  So this is the cotton sari. And through this we will have clean water. I think it's safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives. While universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution  and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders  we are surrounded by violence  whether it's road rage  or whether it's domestic violence  whether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing her because she hasn't done her homework  it's everywhere. So  why are we not doing something to actually attend that problem on a day to day basis  What are we doing to try and make children and young people realize that violence is something that we indulge in  that we can stop  and that there are other ways of actually taking violence  taking anger  taking frustrations into different things that do not harm other people. Well  here is one such way. Your parents were peaceful people. Your grandparents were peaceful people. So much peace in one place  How could it be otherwise  But  what if ... Yes. What if ... One little gene in you has been trying to get through  From your beginnings in Africa  through each generation  may be passed on to you  in your creation. It's a secret urge  hiding deep in you. And if it's in you  then it's in me too. Oh  dear. It's what made you smack your baby brother  stamp on a cockroach  scratch your mother. It's the feeling that wells up from deep inside  when your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide. Want to kill that cyclist on the way to work  and string up your cousin 'cause she's such a jerk. Oh  dear. And as for outsiders  white  black or brown  tar and feather them  and whip them out of town. It's that little gene. It's small and it's mean. Too small for detection  it's your built in protection. Adrenaline  kill. It'll give you the will. Yes  you'd better face it 'cause you can't displace it. You're V I O L E N T. Cause you're either a victim  or on top  like me. Goodbye  Abraham Lincoln. Goodbye  Mahatma Gandhi. Goodbye  Martin Luther King. Hello  gangs from this neighborhood killing gangs from that neighborhood. Hello governments of rich countries selling arms to governments of poor countries who can't even afford to give them food. Hello civilization. Hello    st century. Look what we've ... look what they've done. Mainstream art  cinema  has been used across the world to talk about social issues. A few years ago we had a film called Rang De Basanti  which suddenly spawned thousands of young people wanting to volunteer for social change. In Venezuela  one of the most popular soap operas has a heroine called Crystal. And when  onscreen  Crystal got breast cancer         more young women went to have mammographies done. And of course   The Vagina Monologues  we know about. And there are stand up comics who are talking about racial issues  about ethnic issues. So  why is it  that if we think that we all agree that we need a better world  we need a more just world  why is it that we are not using the one language that has consistently showed us that we can break down barriers  that we can reach people  What I need to say to the planners of the world  the governments  the strategists is   You have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake. It needs to be the yeast.  Because  any future planning  if      is when we want to get there  unless the arts are put with the scientists  with the economists  with all those who prepare for the future  badly  we're not going to get there. And unless this is actually internalized  it won't happen. So  what is it that we require  What is it that we need  We need to break down our vision of what planners are  of what the correct way of a path is. And to say all these years of trying to make a better world  and we have failed. There are more people being raped. There are more wars. There are more people dying of simple things. So  something has got to give. And that is what I want. Can I have my last audio track please  Once there was a princess who whistled beautifully. Her father the king said   Don't whistle.  Her mother the queen said   Hai  don't whistle.  But the princess continued whistling. The years went by and the princess grew up into a beautiful young woman  who whistled even more beautifully. Her father the king said   Who will marry a whistling princess   Her mother the queen said   Who will marry a whistling princess   But the king had an idea. He announced a Swayamvara. He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling.  Whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom and her hand in marriage   Soon the palace filled with princes whistling. Some whistled badly. Some whistled well. But nobody could defeat the princess.  Now what shall we do   said the king.  Now what shall we do   said the queen. But the princess said   Father  Mother  don't worry. I have an idea. I am going to go to each of these young men and I am going to ask them if they defeated correctly. And if somebody answers  that shall be my wish.  So she went up to each and said   Do you accept that I have defeated you   And they said   Me  Defeated by a woman  No way  that's impossible  No no no no no  That's not possible.  Till finally one prince said   Princess  I accept  you have defeated me.   Uh huh ...  she said.  Father  mother  this man shall be my wife.  Thank you. As an Indian  and now as a politician and a government minister  I've become rather concerned about the hype we're hearing about our own country  all this talk about India becoming a world leader  even the next superpower. In fact  the American publishers of my book   The Elephant  The Tiger and the Cell Phone   added a gratuitous subtitle saying   India  The next   st century power.  And I just don't think that's what India's all about  or should be all about. Indeed  what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic. It's redolent of James Bond movies and Kipling ballads. After all  what constitutes a world leader  If it's population  we're on course to top the charts. We will overtake China by     . Is it military strength  Well  we have the world's fourth largest army. Is it nuclear capacity  We know we have that. The Americans have even recognized it  in an agreement. Is it the economy  Well  we have now the fifth largest economy in the world in purchasing power parity terms. And we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year  we grew at  .  percent. But  somehow  none of that adds up to me  to what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world  in this part of the   st century. And so I wondered  could what the future beckons for India to be all about be a combination of these things allied to something else  the power of example  the attraction of India's culture  what  in other words  people like to call  soft power.  Soft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic  Joseph Nye  a friend of mine. And  very simply  and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here  it's essentially the ability of a country to attract others because of its culture  its political values  its foreign policies. And  you know  lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States  but we know the Alliance Francaise is all about French soft power  the British Council. The Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power. Americans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships. But  the fact is  in fact  that probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds have done more for American soft power around the world than any specifically government activity. So soft power is something that really emerges partly because of governments  but partly despite governments. And in the information era we all live in today  what we might call the TED age  I'd say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public that's been fed on an incessant diet of Internet news  of televised images  of cellphone videos  of email gossip. In other words  all sorts of communication devices are telling us the stories of countries  whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories. Now  in this age  again  countries with access to multiple channels of communication and information have a particular advantage. And of course they have more influence  sometimes  about how they're seen. India has more all news TV channels than any country in the world  in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together. But  the fact still is that it's not just that. In order to have soft power  you have to be connected. One might argue that India has become an astonishingly connected country. I think you've already heard the figures. We've been selling    million cellphones a month. Currently there are     million cellphones in Indian hands  in India. And that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market. In fact  those    million cellphones are the most connections that any country  including the U.S. and China  has ever established in the history of telecommunications. But  what perhaps some of you don't realize is how far we've come to get there. You know  when I grew up in India  telephones were a rarity. In fact  they were so rare that elected members of Parliament had the right to allocate    telephone lines as a favor to those they deemed worthy. If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman or an influential journalist  or a doctor or something  you might have a telephone. But sometimes it just sat there. I went to high school in Calcutta. And we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer. But half the time we would pick it up with an expectant look on our faces  there would be no dial tone. If there was a dial tone and you dialed a number  the odds were two in three you wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach. In fact the words  wrong number  were more popular than the word  Hello.  If you then wanted to connect to another city  let's say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi  you'd have to book something called a trunk call  and then sit by the phone all day  waiting for it to come through. Or you could pay eight times the going rate for something called a lightning call. But  lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days  so  it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through. In fact  so woeful was our telephone service that a Member of Parliament stood up in      and complained about this. And the Then Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner that in a developing country communications are a luxury  not a right  that the government had no obligation to provide better service  and if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone  could he please return it  since there was an eight year long waiting list for telephones in India. Now  fast forward to today and this is what you see  the    million cell phones a month. But what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones. You know  if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi  on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart that looks like it was designed in the   th century  wielding a coal fired steam iron that might have been invented in the   th century. He's called an isthri wala. But he's carrying a   st century instrument. He's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free  and that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood  to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed. The other day I was in Kerala  my home state  at the country farm of a friend  about    kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban. And it was a hot day and he said   Hey  would you like some fresh coconut water   And it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink on a hot day in the tropics  so I said sure. And he whipped out his cellphone  dialed the number  and a voice said   I'm up here.  And right on top of the nearest coconut tree  with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other  was a local toddy tapper  who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink. Fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones. When they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast to find out where they get the best possible prices. Farmers now  who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor to find out if the market town was open  if the market was on  whether the product they'd harvested could be sold  what price they'd fetch. They'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge to the market town to get that information and come back  then they'd load the cart. Today they're saving half a day's labor with a two minute phone call. So this empowerment of the underclass is the real result of India being connected. And that transformation is part of where India is heading today. But  of course that's not the only thing about India that's spreading. You've got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized in the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump    Mr. Shekhar Kapur  forgive me    and they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio. And the first goat  chewing away  says   You know  this film is not bad.  And the second goat says   No  the book was better.  I usually tend to think that the book is usually better  but  having said that  the fact is that Bollywood is now taking a certain aspect of Indian ness and Indian culture around the globe  not just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K.  but to the screens of Arabs and Africans  of Senegalese and Syrians. I've met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother in a village in Senegal takes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar  just to watch a Bollywood movie. She can't understand the dialogue. She's illiterate  so she can't read the French subtitles. But these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps  and she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action. She goes away with stars in her eyes about India  as a result. And this is happening more and more. Afghanistan  we know what a serious security problem Afghanistan is for so many of us in the world. India doesn't have a military mission there. You know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years  One simple fact  you couldn't try to call an Afghan at      in the evening. Why  Because that was the moment when the Indian television soap opera   Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi   dubbed into Dari  was telecast on Tolo T.V. And it was the most popular television show in Afghan history. Every Afghan family wanted to watch it. They had to suspend functions at     . Weddings were reported to be interrupted so guests could cluster around the T.V. set  and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom. Crime went up at     . I have read a Reuters dispatch    so this is not Indian propaganda  a British news agency    about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif  stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers  its hubcaps  its sideview mirrors  any moving part they could find  at       because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store. And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine   Tulsi Zindabad    Long live Tulsi.  That's soft power. And that is what India is developing through the  E  part of TED  its own entertainment industry. The same is true  of course    we don't have time for too many more examples    but it's true of our music  of our dance  of our art  yoga  ayurveda  even Indian cuisine. I mean  the proliferation of Indian restaurants since I first went abroad as a student  in the mid '  s  and what I see today  you can't go to a mid size town in Europe or North America and not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one. But  today in Britain  for example  Indian restaurants in Britain employ more people than the coal mining  ship building and iron and steel industries combined. So the empire can strike back. But  with this increasing awareness of India  with you and with I  and so on  with tales like Afghanistan  comes something vital in the information era  the sense that in today's world it's not the side of the bigger army that wins  it's the country that tells a better story that prevails. And India is  and must remain  in my view  the land of the better story. Stereotypes are changing. I mean  again  having gone to the U.S. as a student in the mid '  s  I knew what the image of India was then  if there was an image at all. Today  people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere speak of the IITs  the Indian Institutes of Technology with the same reverence they used to accord to MIT. This can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK. I had a friend  a history major like me  who was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam  by an anxiously perspiring European saying   You're Indian  you're Indian  Can you help me fix my laptop   We've gone from the image of India as land of fakirs lying on beds of nails  and snake charmers with the Indian rope trick  to the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses  computer wizards  software gurus. But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world. But  there is something more substantive to that. The story rests on a fundamental platform of political pluralism. It's a civilizational story to begin with. Because India has been an open society for millennia. India gave refuge to the Jews  fleeing the destruction of the first temple by the Babylonians  and said thereafter by the Romans. In fact  legend has is that when Doubting Thomas  the Apostle  Saint Thomas  landed on the shores of Kerala  my home state  somewhere around    A.D.  he was welcomed on shore by a flute playing Jewish girl. And to this day remains the only Jewish diaspora in the history of the Jewish people  which has never encountered a single incident of anti semitism. That's the Indian story. Islam came peacefully to the south  slightly more differently complicated history in the north. But all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India. You know  we just celebrated  this year  our general elections  the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history. And the next one will be even bigger  because our voting population keeps growing by    million a year. But  the fact is that the last elections  five years ago  gave the world extraordinary phenomenon of an election being won by a woman political leader of Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith  Sonia Gandhi  who then made way for a Sikh  Mohan Singh  to be sworn in as Prime Minister by a Muslim  President Abdul Kalam  in a country    percent Hindu. This is India  and of course it's all the more striking because it was four years later that we all applauded the U.S.  the oldest democracy in the modern world  more than     years of free and fair elections  which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president who wasn't white  male or Christian. So  maybe    oh sorry  he is Christian  I beg your pardon    and he is male  but he isn't white. All the others have been all those three. All his predecessors have been all those three  and that's the point I was trying to make. But  the issue is that when I talked about that example  it's not just about talking about India  it's not propaganda. Because ultimately  that electoral outcome had nothing to do with the rest of the world. It was essentially India being itself. And ultimately  it seems to me  that always works better than propaganda. Governments aren't very good at telling stories. But people see a society for what it is  and that  it seems to me  is what ultimately will make a difference in today's information era  in today's TED age. So India now is no longer the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion  because we have every ethnicity known to mankind  practically  we've every religion know to mankind  with the possible exception of Shintoism  though that has some Hindu elements somewhere. We have    official languages that are recognized in our Constitution. And those of you who cashed your money here might be surprised to see how many scripts there are on the rupee note  spelling out the denominations. We've got all of that. We don't even have geography uniting us  because the natural geography of the subcontinent framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked by the partition with Pakistan in     . In fact  you can't even take the name of the country for granted  because the name  India  comes from the river Indus  which flows in Pakistan. But  the whole point is that India is the nationalism of an idea. It's the idea of an ever ever land  emerging from an ancient civilization  united by a shared history  but sustained  above all  by pluralist democracy. That is a   st century story as well as an ancient one. And it's the nationalism of an idea that essentially says you can endure differences of caste  creed  color  culture  cuisine  custom and costume  consonant  for that matter  and still rally around a consensus. And the consensus is of a very simple principle  that in a diverse plural democracy like India you don't really have to agree on everything all the time  so long as you agree on the ground rules of how you will disagree. The great success story of India  a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate  in the '  s and '  s  is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus. Now  that is the India that is emerging into the   st century. And I do want to make the point that if there is anything worth celebrating about India  it isn't military muscle  economic power. All of that is necessary  but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome. Somebody said we are super poor  and we are also super power. We can't really be both of those. We have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the hardware of development  the ports  the roads  the airports  all the infrastructural things we need to do  and the software of development  the human capital  the need for the ordinary person in India to be able to have a couple of square meals a day  to be able to send his or her children to a decent school  and to aspire to work a job that will give them opportunities in their lives that can transform themselves. But  it's all taking place  this great adventure of conquering those challenges  those real challenges which none of us can pretend don't exist. But  it's all taking place in an open society  in a rich and diverse and plural civilization  in one that is determined to liberate and fulfill the creative energies of its people. That's why India belongs at TED  and that's why TED belongs in India. Thank you very much.
