As a scientist  and also as a human being  I've been trying to make myself susceptible to wonder. I think Jason Webley last night called it  conspiring to be part of the magic.  So it's fortunate that my career as a biologist lets me dive deeply into the lives of some truly wondrous creatures that share our planet  fireflies. Now  for many of you  I know that fireflies might conjure up some really great memories  childhood  summertime  even other TED Talks. Maybe something like this. My seduction into the world of fireflies began when I was back in graduate school. One evening  I was sitting out in my backyard in North Carolina  and suddenly  these silent sparks rose up all around me  and I began to wonder  How do these creatures make light  and what's with all this flashing  Are they talking to one another  And what happens after the lights go out  I've been lucky enough to answer some of these questions as I've explored this nocturnal world. Now if you've ever seen or even heard about fireflies  then you'll know how magically they can transform our everyday landscape into something ethereal and otherworldly  and this happens around the globe  like this hillside in the Smoky Mountains that I saw transformed into a living cascade of light by the eerie glows of these blue ghost fireflies  or a roadside river that I visited in Japan as it was giving birth to the slow  floating flashes of these Genji fireflies  or in Malaysia  the mangrove trees that I watched blossom nightly not with flowers but with the lights of a thousand     Bleep  Bleep     fireflies  all blinking together in stunning synchrony. These luminous landscapes still fill me with wonder  and they keep me connected to the magic of the natural world. And I find it amazing that they're created by these tiny insects. In person  fireflies are charming. They're charismatic. They've been celebrated in art and in poetry for centuries. As I've traveled around the world  I've met many thoughtful people who have told me that God put fireflies on Earth for humans to enjoy. Other creatures can enjoy them too. I think these graceful insects are truly miraculous because they so beautifully illuminate the creative improvisation of evolution. They've been shaped by two powerful evolutionary forces  natural selection  the struggle for survival  and sexual selection  the struggle for reproductive opportunity. As a firefly junkie  the past    years have been quite an exciting ride. Together with my students at Tufts University and other colleagues  we've made lots of new discoveries about fireflies  their courtship and sex lives  their treachery and murder. So today I'd like to share with you just a couple of tales that we've brought back from our collective adventures into this hidden world. Fireflies belong to a very beautiful and diverse group of insects  the beetles. Worldwide  there are more than       firefly species  and these have evolved remarkably diverse courtship signals  that is  different ways to find and attract mates. Around     million years ago  the very first fireflies probably looked like this. They flew during the daytime and they didn't light up. Instead  males used their fantastic antennae to sniff out perfumes given off by their females. In other fireflies  it's only the females who light up. They are attractively plump and wingless  so every night  they climb up onto perches and they glow brightly for hours to attract their flying but unlit males. In still other fireflies  both sexes use quick  bright flashes to find their mates. Here in North America  we have more than     different kinds of firefly that have the remarkable ability to shine energy out from their bodies in the form of light. How do they do that  It seems totally magical  but these bioluminescent signals arise from carefully orchestrated chemical reactions that happen inside the firefly lantern. The main star is an enzyme called luciferase  which in the course of evolution has figured out a way to wrap its tiny arms around an even smaller molecule called luciferin  in the process getting it so excited that it actually gives off light. Incredible. But how could these bright lights have benefited some proto firefly  To answer this question  we need to flip back in the family album to some baby pictures. Fireflies completely reinvent their bodies as they grow. They spend the vast majority of their lifetime  up to two years  in this larval form. Their main goal here  like my teenagers  is to eat and grow. And firefly light first originated in these juveniles. Every single firefly larva can light up  even when their adults can't. But what's the point to being so conspicuous  Well  we know that these juveniles make nasty tasting chemicals that help them survive their extended childhood  so we think these lights first evolved as a warning  a neon sign that says   Toxic  Stay away   to any would be predators. It took many millions of years before these bright lights evolved into a smart communication tool that could be used not just to ward off potential predators but to bring in potential mates. Driven now by sexual selection  some adult fireflies like this proud male evolved a shiny new glow in the dark lantern that would let them take courtship to a whole new level. These adults only live a few weeks  and now they're single mindedly focused on sex  that is  on propelling their genes into the next firefly generation. So we can follow this male out into the field as he joins hundreds of other males who are all showing off their new courtship signals. It's amazing to think that the luminous displays we admire here and in fact everywhere around the world are actually the silent love songs of male fireflies. They're flying and flashing their hearts out. I still find it very romantic. But meanwhile  where are all the females  Well  they're lounging down below surveying their options. They have plenty of males to choose from  and these females turn out to be very picky. When a female sees a flash from an especially attractive male  she'll aim her lantern in his direction  and give him a flash back. It's her  come hither  sign. So he flies closer and he flashes again. If she still likes him  they'll strike up a conversation. These creatures speak their love in the language of light. So what exactly do these females consider sexy  We decided to conduct some firefly opinion polls to find out. When we tested females using blinking LED lights  we discovered they prefer males who give longer lasting flashes. I know you're wondering  what gives these males their sex appeal  Now we get to see what happens when the lights go out. The first thing we discovered is that once a male and female hook up like this  they stay together all night long  and when we looked inside to see what might be happening  we discovered a surprising new twist to firefly sex. While they're mating  the male is busy giving the female not just his sperm but also a nutrient filled package called a nuptial gift. We can zoom in to look more closely inside this mating pair. We can actually see the gift   it's shown here in red   as it's being passed from the male to the female. What makes this gift so valuable is that it's packed with protein that the female will use to provision her eggs. So females are keeping their eyes on this prize as they size up potential mates. We discovered that females use male flash signals to try to predict which males have the biggest gifts to offer  because this bling helps the female lay more eggs and ultimately launch more of her own offspring into the next generation. So it's not all sweetness and light. Firefly romance is risky. For the most part  these adult fireflies don't get eaten because like their juveniles they can manufacture toxins that are repellent to birds and other insectivores  but somewhere along the line  one particular group of fireflies somehow lost the metabolic machinery needed to make their own protective toxins. This evolutionary flaw  which was discovered by my colleague Tom Eisner  has driven these fireflies to take their bright lights out into the night with treacherous intent. Dubbed  femme fatales  by Jim Lloyd  another colleague  these females have figured out how to target the males of other firefly species. So the hunt begins with the predator   she's shown here in the lower left   where she's sitting quietly and eavesdropping on the courtship conversation of her intended prey  and here's how it might go. First the prey male flashes   Do you love me   His own female responds   Maybe.  So then he flashes again. But this time  the predator sneaks in a reply that cleverly mimics exactly what the other female just said. She's not looking for love  she's looking for toxins. If she's good  she can lure this male close enough to reach out and grab him  and he's not just a light snack. Over the next hour  she slowly exsanguinates this male leaving behind just some gory remains. Unable to make their own toxins  these females resort to drinking the blood of other fireflies to get these protective chemicals. So a firefly vampire  brought to you by natural selection. We still have a lot to learn about fireflies  but it looks like many stories will remain untold  because around the world  firefly populations are blinking out. The main culprit  habitat loss. Pretty much everywhere  the fields and forests  the mangroves and meadows that fireflies need to survive  are giving way to development and to sprawl. Here's another problem  we've conquered darkness  but in the process  we spill so much extra light out into the night that it disrupts the lives of other creatures  and fireflies are especially sensitive to light pollution because it obscures the signals that they use to find their mates. Do we really need fireflies  After all  they're just one tiny bit of Earth's biodiversity. Yet every time a species is lost  it's like extinguishing a room full of candles one by one. You might not notice when the first few flames flicker out  but in the end  you're left sitting in darkness. As we work together to craft a planetary future  I hope we can find a way to keep these bright lights shining. Thank you. I've been thinking a lot about the world recently and how it's changed over the last            years. Twenty or    years ago  if a chicken caught a cold and sneezed and died in a remote village in East Asia  it would have been a tragedy for the chicken and its closest relatives  but I don't think there was much possibility of us fearing a global pandemic and the deaths of millions. Twenty or    years ago  if a bank in North America lent too much money to some people who couldn't afford to pay it back and the bank went bust  that was bad for the lender and bad for the borrower  but we didn't imagine it would bring the global economic system to its knees for nearly a decade. This is globalization. This is the miracle that has enabled us to transship our bodies and our minds and our words and our pictures and our ideas and our teaching and our learning around the planet ever faster and ever cheaper. It's brought a lot of bad stuff  like the stuff that I just described  but it's also brought a lot of good stuff. A lot of us are not aware of the extraordinary successes of the Millennium Development Goals  several of which have achieved their targets long before the due date. That proves that this species of humanity is capable of achieving extraordinary progress if it really acts together and it really tries hard. But if I had to put it in a nutshell these days  I sort of feel that globalization has taken us by surprise  and we've been slow to respond to it. If you look at the downside of globalization  it really does seem to be sometimes overwhelming. All of the grand challenges that we face today  like climate change and human rights and demographics and terrorism and pandemics and narco trafficking and human slavery and species loss  I could go on  we're not making an awful lot of progress against an awful lot of those challenges. So in a nutshell  that's the challenge that we all face today at this interesting point in history. That's clearly what we've got to do next. We've somehow got to get our act together and we've got to figure out how to globalize the solutions better so that we don't simply become a species which is the victim of the globalization of problems. Why are we so slow at achieving these advances  What's the reason for it  Well  there are  of course  a number of reasons  but perhaps the primary reason is because we're still organized as a species in the same way that we were organized     or     years ago. There's one superpower left on the planet and that is the seven billion people  the seven billion of us who cause all these problems  the same seven billion  by the way  who will resolve them all. But how are those seven billion organized  They're still organized in     or so nation states  and the nations have governments that make rules and cause us to behave in certain ways. And that's a pretty efficient system  but the problem is that the way that those laws are made and the way those governments think is absolutely wrong for the solution of global problems  because it all looks inwards. The politicians that we elect and the politicians we don't elect  on the whole  have minds that microscope. They don't have minds that telescope. They look in. They pretend  they behave  as if they believed that every country was an island that existed quite happily  independently of all the others on its own little planet in its own little solar system. This is the problem  countries competing against each other  countries fighting against each other. This week  as any week you care to look at  you'll find people actually trying to kill each other from country to country  but even when that's not going on  there's competition between countries  each one trying to shaft the next. This is clearly not a good arrangement. We clearly need to change it. We clearly need to find ways of encouraging countries to start working together a little bit better. And why won't they do that  Why is it that our leaders still persist in looking inwards  Well  the first and most obvious reason is because that's what we ask them to do. That's what we tell them to do. When we elect governments or when we tolerate unelected governments  we're effectively telling them that what we want is for them to deliver us in our country a certain number of things. We want them to deliver prosperity  growth  competitiveness  transparency  justice and all of those things. So unless we start asking our governments to think outside a little bit  to consider the global problems that will finish us all if we don't start considering them  then we can hardly blame them if what they carry on doing is looking inwards  if they still have minds that microscope rather than minds that telescope. That's the first reason why things tend not to change. The second reason is that these governments  just like all the rest of us  are cultural psychopaths. I don't mean to be rude  but you know what a psychopath is. A psychopath is a person who  unfortunately for him or her  lacks the ability to really empathize with other human beings. When they look around  they don't see other human beings with deep  rich  three dimensional personal lives and aims and ambitions. What they see is cardboard cutouts  and it's very sad and it's very lonely  and it's very rare  fortunately. But actually  aren't most of us not really so very good at empathy  Oh sure  we're very good at empathy when it's a question of dealing with people who kind of look like us and kind of walk and talk and eat and pray and wear like us  but when it comes to people who don't do that  who don't quite dress like us and don't quite pray like us and don't quite talk like us  do we not also have a tendency to see them ever so slightly as cardboard cutouts too  And this is a question we need to ask ourselves. I think constantly we have to monitor it. Are we and our politicians to a degree cultural psychopaths  The third reason is hardly worth mentioning because it's so silly  but there's a belief amongst governments that the domestic agenda and the international agenda are incompatible and always will be. This is just nonsense. In my day job  I'm a policy adviser. I've spent the last    years or so advising governments around the world  and in all of that time I have never once seen a single domestic policy issue that could not be more imaginatively  effectively and rapidly resolved than by treating it as an international problem  looking at the international context  comparing what others have done  bringing in others  working externally instead of working internally. And so you may say  well  given all of that  why then doesn't it work  Why can we not make our politicians change  Why can't we demand them  Well I  like a lot of us  spend a lot of time complaining about how hard it is to make people change  and I don't think we should fuss about it. I think we should just accept that we are an inherently conservative species. We don't like to change. It exists for very sensible evolutionary reasons. We probably wouldn't still be here today if we weren't so resistant to change. It's very simple  Many thousands of years ago  we discovered that if we carried on doing the same things  we wouldn't die  because the things that we've done before by definition didn't kill us  and therefore as long as we carry on doing them  we'll be okay  and it's very sensible not to do anything new  because it might kill you. But of course  there are exceptions to that. Otherwise  we'd never get anywhere. And one of the exceptions  the interesting exception  is when you can show to people that there might be some self interest in them making that leap of faith and changing a little bit. So I've spent a lot of the last    or    years trying to find out what could be that self interest that would encourage not just politicians but also businesses and general populations  all of us  to start to think a little more outwardly  to think in a bigger picture  not always to look inwards  sometimes to look outwards. And this is where I discovered something quite important. In       I launched a study called the Nation Brands Index. What it is  it's a very large scale study that polls a very large sample of the world's population  a sample that represents about    percent of the planet's population  and I started asking them a series of questions about how they perceive other countries. And the Nation Brands Index over the years has grown to be a very  very large database. It's about     billion data points tracking what ordinary people think about other countries and why. Why did I do this  Well  because the governments that I advise are very  very keen on knowing how they are regarded. They've known  partly because I've encouraged them to realize it  that countries depend enormously on their reputations in order to survive and prosper in the world. If a country has a great  positive image  like Germany has or Sweden or Switzerland  everything is easy and everything is cheap. You get more tourists. You get more investors. You sell your products more expensively. If  on the other hand  you have a country with a very weak or a very negative image  everything is difficult and everything is expensive. So governments care desperately about the image of their country  because it makes a direct difference to how much money they can make  and that's what they've promised their populations they're going to deliver. So a couple of years ago  I thought I would take some time out and speak to that gigantic database and ask it  why do some people prefer one country more than another  And the answer that the database gave me completely staggered me. It was  . . I haven't got time to explain in detail. Basically what it told me was   the kinds of countries we prefer are good countries. We don't admire countries primarily because they're rich  because they're powerful  because they're successful  because they're modern  because they're technologically advanced. We primarily admire countries that are good. What do we mean by good  We mean countries that seem to contribute something to the world in which we live  countries that actually make the world safer or better or richer or fairer. Those are the countries we like. This is a discovery of significant importance   you see where I'm going   because it squares the circle. I can now say  and often do  to any government  in order to do well  you need to do good. If you want to sell more products  if you want to get more investment  if you want to become more competitive  then you need to start behaving  because that's why people will respect you and do business with you  and therefore  the more you collaborate  the more competitive you become. This is quite an important discovery  and as soon as I discovered this  I felt another index coming on. I swear that as I get older  my ideas become simpler and more and more childish. This one is called the Good Country Index  and it does exactly what it says on the tin. It measures  or at least it tries to measure  exactly how much each country on Earth contributes not to its own population but to the rest of humanity. Bizarrely  nobody had ever thought of measuring this before. So my colleague Dr. Robert Govers and I have spent the best part of the last two years  with the help of a large number of very serious and clever people  cramming together all the reliable data in the world we could find about what countries give to the world. And you're waiting for me to tell you which one comes top. And I'm going to tell you  but first of all I want to tell you precisely what I mean when I say a good country. I do not mean morally good. When I say that Country X is the goodest country on Earth  and I mean goodest  I don't mean best. Best is something different. When you're talking about a good country  you can be good  gooder and goodest. It's not the same thing as good  better and best. This is a country which simply gives more to humanity than any other country. I don't talk about how they behave at home because that's measured elsewhere. And the winner is Ireland. According to the data here  no country on Earth  per head of population  per dollar of GDP  contributes more to the world that we live in than Ireland. What does this mean  This means that as we go to sleep at night  all of us in the last    seconds before we drift off to sleep  our final thought should be  godammit  I'm glad that Ireland exists. And that    Applause    In the depths of a very severe economic recession  I think that there's a really important lesson there  that if you can remember your international obligations whilst you are trying to rebuild your own economy  that's really something. Finland ranks pretty much the same. The only reason why it's below Ireland is because its lowest score is lower than Ireland's lowest score. Now the other thing you'll notice about the top    there is  of course  they're all  apart from New Zealand  Western European nations. They're also all rich. This depressed me  because one of the things that I did not want to discover with this index is that it's purely the province of rich countries to help poor countries. This is not what it's all about. And indeed  if you look further down the list  I don't have the slide here  you will see something that made me very happy indeed  that Kenya is in the top     and that demonstrates one very  very important thing. This is not about money. This is about attitude. This is about culture. This is about a government and a people that care about the rest of the world and have the imagination and the courage to think outwards instead of only thinking selfishly. I'm going to whip through the other slides just so you can see some of the lower lying countries. There's Germany at   th  the U.S. comes   st  Mexico comes   th  and then we have some of the big developing countries  like Russia at   th  China at    th. Countries like China and Russia and India  which is down in the same part of the index  well  in some ways  it's not surprising. They've spent a great deal of time over the last decades building their own economy  building their own society and their own polity  but it is to be hoped that the second phase of their growth will be somewhat more outward looking than the first phase has been so far. And then you can break down each country in terms of the actual datasets that build into it. I'll allow you to do that. From midnight tonight it's going to be on goodcountry.org  and you can look at the country. You can look right down to the level of the individual datasets. Now that's the Good Country Index. What's it there for  Well  it's there really because I want to try to introduce this word  or reintroduce this word  into the discourse. I've had enough hearing about competitive countries. I've had enough hearing about prosperous  wealthy  fast growing countries. I've even had enough hearing about happy countries because in the end that's still selfish. That's still about us  and if we carry on thinking about us  we are in deep  deep trouble. I think we all know what it is that we want to hear about. We want to hear about good countries  and so I want to ask you all a favor. I'm not asking a lot. It's something that you might find easy to do and you might even find enjoyable and even helpful to do  and that's simply to start using the word  good  in this context. When you think about your own country  when you think about other people's countries  when you think about companies  when you talk about the world that we live in today  start using that word in the way that I've talked about this evening. Not good  the opposite of bad  because that's an argument that never finishes. Good  the opposite of selfish  good being a country that thinks about all of us. That's what I would like you to do  and I'd like you to use it as a stick with which to beat your politicians. When you elect them  when you reelect them  when you vote for them  when you listen to what they're offering you  use that word   good   and ask yourself   Is that what a good country would do   And if the answer is no  be very suspicious. Ask yourself  is that the behavior of my country  Do I want to come from a country where the government  in my name  is doing things like that  Or do I  on the other hand  prefer the idea of walking around the world with my head held high thinking   Yeah  I'm proud to come from a good country   And everybody will welcome you. And everybody in the last    seconds before they drift off to sleep at night will say   Gosh  I'm glad that person's country exists.  Ultimately  that  I think  is what will make the change. That word   good   and the number  .  and the discovery that's behind it have changed my life. I think they can change your life  and I think we can use it to change the way that our politicians and our companies behave  and in doing so  we can change the world. I've started thinking very differently about my own country since I've been thinking about these things. I used to think that I wanted to live in a rich country  and then I started thinking I wanted to live in a happy country  but I began to realize  it's not enough. I don't want to live in a rich country. I don't want to live in a fast growing or competitive country. I want to live in a good country  and I so  so hope that you do too. Thank you. When we think about prejudice and bias  we tend to think about stupid and evil people doing stupid and evil things. And this idea is nicely summarized by the British critic William Hazlitt  who wrote   Prejudice is the child of ignorance.  I want to try to convince you here that this is mistaken. I want to try to convince you that prejudice and bias are natural  they're often rational  and they're often even moral  and I think that once we understand this  we're in a better position to make sense of them when they go wrong  when they have horrible consequences  and we're in a better position to know what to do when this happens. So  start with stereotypes. You look at me  you know my name  you know certain facts about me  and you could make certain judgments. You could make guesses about my ethnicity  my political affiliation  my religious beliefs. And the thing is  these judgments tend to be accurate. We're very good at this sort of thing. And we're very good at this sort of thing because our ability to stereotype people is not some sort of arbitrary quirk of the mind  but rather it's a specific instance of a more general process  which is that we have experience with things and people in the world that fall into categories  and we can use our experience to make generalizations about novel instances of these categories. So everybody here has a lot of experience with chairs and apples and dogs  and based on this  you could see unfamiliar examples and you could guess  you could sit on the chair  you could eat the apple  the dog will bark. Now we might be wrong. The chair could collapse if you sit on it  the apple might be poison  the dog might not bark  and in fact  this is my dog Tessie  who doesn't bark. But for the most part  we're good at this. For the most part  we make good guesses both in the social domain and the non social domain  and if we weren't able to do so  if we weren't able to make guesses about new instances that we encounter  we wouldn't survive. And in fact  Hazlitt later on in his wonderful essay concedes this. He writes   Without the aid of prejudice and custom  I should not be able to find my way my across the room  nor know how to conduct myself in any circumstances  nor what to feel in any relation of life.  Or take bias. Now sometimes  we break the world up into us versus them  into in group versus out group  and sometimes when we do this  we know we're doing something wrong  and we're kind of ashamed of it. But other times we're proud of it. We openly acknowledge it. And my favorite example of this is a question that came from the audience in a Republican debate prior to the last election. the question in the hall  on foreign aid  Yes  ma'am. Woman  The American people are suffering in our country right now. Why do we continue to send foreign aid to other countries when we need all the help we can get for ourselves  AC  Governor Perry  what about that  Rick Perry  Absolutely  I think it's  Paul Bloom  Each of the people onstage agreed with the premise of her question  which is as Americans  we should care more about Americans than about other people. And in fact  in general  people are often swayed by feelings of solidarity  loyalty  pride  patriotism  towards their country or towards their ethnic group. Regardless of your politics  many people feel proud to be American  and they favor Americans over other countries. Residents of other countries feel the same about their nation  and we feel the same about our ethnicities. Now some of you may reject this. Some of you may be so cosmopolitan that you think that ethnicity and nationality should hold no moral sway. But even you sophisticates accept that there should be some pull towards the in group in the domain of friends and family  of people you're close to  and so even you make a distinction between us versus them. Now  this distinction is natural enough and often moral enough  but it can go awry  and this was part of the research of the great social psychologist Henri Tajfel. Tajfel was born in Poland in     . He left to go to university in France  because as a Jew  he couldn't go to university in Poland  and then he enlisted in the French military in World War II. He was captured and ended up in a prisoner of war camp  and it was a terrifying time for him  because if it was discovered that he was a Jew  he could have been moved to a concentration camp  where he most likely would not have survived. And in fact  when the war ended and he was released  most of his friends and family were dead. He got involved in different pursuits. He helped out the war orphans. But he had a long lasting interest in the science of prejudice  and so when a prestigious British scholarship on stereotypes opened up  he applied for it  and he won it  and then he began this amazing career. And what started his career is an insight that the way most people were thinking about the Holocaust was wrong. Many people  most people at the time  viewed the Holocaust as sort of representing some tragic flaw on the part of the Germans  some genetic taint  some authoritarian personality. And Tajfel rejected this. Tajfel said what we see in the Holocaust is just an exaggeration of normal psychological processes that exist in every one of us. And to explore this  he did a series of classic studies with British adolescents. And in one of his studies  what he did was he asked the British adolescents all sorts of questions  and then based on their answers  he said   I've looked at your answers  and based on the answers  I have determined that you are either    he told half of them    a Kandinsky lover  you love the work of Kandinsky  or a Klee lover  you love the work of Klee.  It was entirely bogus. Their answers had nothing to do with Kandinsky or Klee. They probably hadn't heard of the artists. He just arbitrarily divided them up. But what he found was  these categories mattered  so when he later gave the subjects money  they would prefer to give the money to members of their own group than members of the other group. Worse  they were actually most interested in establishing a difference between their group and other groups  so they would give up money for their own group if by doing so they could give the other group even less. This bias seems to show up very early. So my colleague and wife  Karen Wynn  at Yale has done a series of studies with babies where she exposes babies to puppets  and the puppets have certain food preferences. So one of the puppets might like green beans. The other puppet might like graham crackers. They test the babies own food preferences  and babies typically prefer the graham crackers. But the question is  does this matter to babies in how they treat the puppets  And it matters a lot. They tend to prefer the puppet who has the same food tastes that they have  and worse  they actually prefer puppets who punish the puppet with the different food taste. We see this sort of in group  out group psychology all the time. We see it in political clashes within groups with different ideologies. We see it in its extreme in cases of war  where the out group isn't merely given less  but dehumanized  as in the Nazi perspective of Jews as vermin or lice  or the American perspective of Japanese as rats. Stereotypes can also go awry. So often they're rational and useful  but sometimes they're irrational  they give the wrong answers  and other times they lead to plainly immoral consequences. And the case that's been most studied is the case of race. There was a fascinating study prior to the      election where social psychologists looked at the extent to which the candidates were associated with America  as in an unconscious association with the American flag. And in one of their studies they compared Obama and McCain  and they found McCain is thought of as more American than Obama  and to some extent  people aren't  that surprised by hearing that. McCain is a celebrated war hero  and many people would explicitly say he has more of an American story than Obama. But they also compared Obama to British Prime Minister Tony Blair  and they found that Blair was also thought of as more American than Obama  even though subjects explicitly understood that he's not American at all. But they were responding  of course  to the color of his skin. These stereotypes and biases have real world consequences  both subtle and very important. In one recent study  researchers put ads on eBay for the sale of baseball cards. Some of them were held by white hands  others by black hands. They were the same baseball cards. The ones held by black hands got substantially smaller bids than the ones held by white hands. In research done at Stanford  psychologists explored the case of people sentenced for the murder of a white person. It turns out  holding everything else constant  you are considerably more likely to be executed if you look like the man on the right than the man on the left  and this is in large part because the man on the right looks more prototypically black  more prototypically African American  and this apparently influences people's decisions over what to do about him. So now that we know about this  how do we combat it  And there are different avenues. One avenue is to appeal to people's emotional responses  to appeal to people's empathy  and we often do that through stories. So if you are a liberal parent and you want to encourage your children to believe in the merits of nontraditional families  you might give them a book like this.   Heather Has Two Mommies   If you are conservative and have a different attitude  you might give them a book like this. But in general  stories can turn anonymous strangers into people who matter  and the idea that we care about people when we focus on them as individuals is an idea which has shown up across history. So Stalin apocryphally said   A single death is a tragedy  a million deaths is a statistic   and Mother Teresa said   If I look at the mass  I will never act. If I look at the one  I will.  Psychologists have explored this. For instance  in one study  people were given a list of facts about a crisis  and it was seen how much they would donate to solve this crisis  and another group was given no facts at all but they were told of an individual and given a name and given a face  and it turns out that they gave far more. None of this I think is a secret to the people who are engaged in charity work. People don't tend to deluge people with facts and statistics. Rather  you show them faces  you show them people. It's possible that by extending our sympathies to an individual  they can spread to the group that the individual belongs to. This is Harriet Beecher Stowe. The story  perhaps apocryphal  is that President Lincoln invited her to the White House in the middle of the Civil War and said to her   So you're the little lady who started this great war.  And he was talking about  Uncle Tom's Cabin.   Uncle Tom's Cabin  is not a great book of philosophy or of theology or perhaps not even literature  but it does a great job of getting people to put themselves in the shoes of people they wouldn't otherwise be in the shoes of  put themselves in the shoes of slaves. And that could well have been a catalyst for great social change. More recently  looking at America in the last several decades  there's some reason to believe that shows like  The Cosby Show  radically changed American attitudes towards African Americans  while shows like  Will and Grace  and  Modern Family  changed American attitudes towards gay men and women. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the major catalyst in America for moral change has been a situation comedy. But it's not all emotions  and I want to end by appealing to the power of reason. At some point in his wonderful book  The Better Angels of Our Nature   Steven Pinker says  the Old Testament says love thy neighbor  and the New Testament says love thy enemy  but I don't love either one of them  not really  but I don't want to kill them. I know I have obligations to them  but my moral feelings to them  my moral beliefs about how I should behave towards them  aren't grounded in love. What they're grounded in is the understanding of human rights  a belief that their life is as valuable to them as my life is to me  and to support this  he tells a story by the great philosopher Adam Smith  and I want to tell this story too  though I'm going to modify it a little bit for modern times. So Adam Smith starts by asking you to imagine the death of thousands of people  and imagine that the thousands of people are in a country you are not familiar with. It could be China or India or a country in Africa. And Smith says  how would you respond  And you would say  well that's too bad  and you'd go on to the rest of your life. If you were to open up The New York Times online or something  and discover this  and in fact this happens to us all the time  we go about our lives. But imagine instead  Smith says  you were to learn that tomorrow you were to have your little finger chopped off. Smith says  that would matter a lot. You would not sleep that night wondering about that. So this raises the question  Would you sacrifice thousands of lives to save your little finger  Now answer this in the privacy of your own head  but Smith says  absolutely not  what a horrid thought. And so this raises the question  and so  as Smith puts it   When our passive feelings are almost always so sordid and so selfish  how comes it that our active principles should often be so generous and so noble   And Smith's answer is   It is reason  principle  conscience.  This  calls to us  with a voice capable of astonishing the most presumptuous of our passions  that we are but one of the multitude  in no respect better than any other in it.  And this last part is what is often described as the principle of impartiality. And this principle of impartiality manifests itself in all of the world's religions  in all of the different versions of the golden rule  and in all of the world's moral philosophies  which differ in many ways but share the presupposition that we should judge morality from sort of an impartial point of view. The best articulation of this view is actually  for me  it's not from a theologian or from a philosopher  but from Humphrey Bogart at the end of  Casablanca.  So  spoiler alert  he's telling his lover that they have to separate for the more general good  and he says to her  and I won't do the accent  but he says to her   It doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.  Our reason could cause us to override our passions. Our reason could motivate us to extend our empathy  could motivate us to write a book like  Uncle Tom's Cabin   or read a book like  Uncle Tom's Cabin   and our reason can motivate us to create customs and taboos and laws that will constrain us from acting upon our impulses when  as rational beings  we feel we should be constrained. This is what a constitution is. A constitution is something which was set up in the past that applies now in the present  and what it says is  no matter how much we might to reelect a popular president for a third term  no matter how much white Americans might choose to feel that they want to reinstate the institution of slavery  we can't. We have bound ourselves. And we bind ourselves in other ways as well. We know that when it comes to choosing somebody for a job  for an award  we are strongly biased by their race  we are biased by their gender  we are biased by how attractive they are  and sometimes we might say   Well fine  that's the way it should be.  But other times we say   This is wrong.  And so to combat this  we don't just try harder  but rather what we do is we set up situations where these other sources of information can't bias us  which is why many orchestras audition musicians behind screens  so the only information they have is the information they believe should matter. I think prejudice and bias illustrate a fundamental duality of human nature. We have gut feelings  instincts  emotions  and they affect our judgments and our actions for good and for evil  but we are also capable of rational deliberation and intelligent planning  and we can use these to  in some cases  accelerate and nourish our emotions  and in other cases staunch them. And it's in this way that reason helps us create a better world. Thank you. I'm a veteran of the starship Enterprise. I soared through the galaxy driving a huge starship with a crew made up of people from all over this world  many different races  many different cultures  many different heritages  all working together  and our mission was to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before. Well   I am the grandson of immigrants from Japan who went to America  boldly going to a strange new world  seeking new opportunities. My mother was born in Sacramento  California. My father was a San Franciscan. They met and married in Los Angeles  and I was born there. I was four years old when Pearl Harbor was bombed on December         by Japan  and overnight  the world was plunged into a world war. America suddenly was swept up by hysteria. Japanese Americans  American citizens of Japanese ancestry  were looked on with suspicion and fear and with outright hatred simply because we happened to look like the people that bombed Pearl Harbor. And the hysteria grew and grew until in February       the president of the United States  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  ordered all Japanese Americans on the West Coast of America to be summarily rounded up with no charges  with no trial  with no due process. Due process  this is a core pillar of our justice system. That all disappeared. We were to be rounded up and imprisoned in    barbed wire prison camps in some of the most desolate places in America  the blistering hot desert of Arizona  the sultry swamps of Arkansas  the wastelands of Wyoming  Idaho  Utah  Colorado  and two of the most desolate places in California. On April   th  I celebrated my fifth birthday  and just a few weeks after my birthday  my parents got my younger brother  my baby sister and me up very early one morning  and they dressed us hurriedly. My brother and I were in the living room looking out the front window  and we saw two soldiers marching up our driveway. They carried bayonets on their rifles. They stomped up the front porch and banged on the door. My father answered it  and the soldiers ordered us out of our home. My father gave my brother and me small luggages to carry  and we walked out and stood on the driveway waiting for our mother to come out  and when my mother finally came out  she had our baby sister in one arm  a huge duffel bag in the other  and tears were streaming down both her cheeks. I will never be able to forget that scene. It is burned into my memory. We were taken from our home and loaded on to train cars with other Japanese American families. There were guards stationed at both ends of each car  as if we were criminals. We were taken two thirds of the way across the country  rocking on that train for four days and three nights  to the swamps of Arkansas. I still remember the barbed wire fence that confined me. I remember the tall sentry tower with the machine guns pointed at us. I remember the searchlight that followed me when I made the night runs from my barrack to the latrine. But to five year old me  I thought it was kind of nice that they'd lit the way for me to pee. I was a child  too young to understand the circumstances of my being there. Children are amazingly adaptable. What would be grotesquely abnormal became my normality in the prisoner of war camps. It became routine for me to line up three times a day to eat lousy food in a noisy mess hall. It became normal for me to go with my father to bathe in a mass shower. Being in a prison  a barbed wire prison camp  became my normality. When the war ended  we were released  and given a one way ticket to anywhere in the United States. My parents decided to go back home to Los Angeles  but Los Angeles was not a welcoming place. We were penniless. Everything had been taken from us  and the hostility was intense. Our first home was on Skid Row in the lowest part of our city  living with derelicts  drunkards and crazy people  the stench of urine all over  on the street  in the alley  in the hallway. It was a horrible experience  and for us kids  it was terrorizing. I remember once a drunkard came staggering down  fell down right in front of us  and threw up. My baby sister said   Mama  let's go back home   because behind barbed wires was for us home. My parents worked hard to get back on their feet. We had lost everything. They were at the middle of their lives and starting all over. They worked their fingers to the bone  and ultimately they were able to get the capital together to buy a three bedroom home in a nice neighborhood. And I was a teenager  and I became very curious about my childhood imprisonment. I had read civics books that told me about the ideals of American democracy. All men are created equal  we have an inalienable right to life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness  and I couldn't quite make that fit with what I knew to be my childhood imprisonment. I read history books  and I couldn't find anything about it. And so I engaged my father after dinner in long  sometimes heated conversations. We had many  many conversations like that  and what I got from them was my father's wisdom. He was the one that suffered the most under those conditions of imprisonment  and yet he understood American democracy. He told me that our democracy is a people's democracy  and it can be as great as the people can be  but it is also as fallible as people are. He told me that American democracy is vitally dependent on good people who cherish the ideals of our system and actively engage in the process of making our democracy work. And he took me to a campaign headquarters   the governor of Illinois was running for the presidency   and introduced me to American electoral politics. And he also told me about young Japanese Americans during the Second World War. When Pearl Harbor was bombed  young Japanese Americans  like all young Americans  rushed to their draft board to volunteer to fight for our country. That act of patriotism was answered with a slap in the face. We were denied service  and categorized as enemy non alien. It was outrageous to be called an enemy when you're volunteering to fight for your country  but that was compounded with the word  non alien   which is a word that means  citizen  in the negative. They even took the word  citizen  away from us  and imprisoned them for a whole year. And then the government realized that there's a wartime manpower shortage  and as suddenly as they'd rounded us up  they opened up the military for service by young Japanese Americans. It was totally irrational  but the amazing thing  the astounding thing  is that thousands of young Japanese American men and women again went from behind those barbed wire fences  put on the same uniform as that of our guards  leaving their families in imprisonment  to fight for this country. They said that they were going to fight not only to get their families out from behind those barbed wire fences  but because they cherished the very ideal of what our government stands for  should stand for  and that was being abrogated by what was being done. All men are created equal. And they went to fight for this country. They were put into a segregated all Japanese American unit and sent to the battlefields of Europe  and they threw themselves into it. They fought with amazing  incredible courage and valor. They were sent out on the most dangerous missions and they sustained the highest combat casualty rate of any unit proportionally. There is one battle that illustrates that. It was a battle for the Gothic Line. The Germans were embedded in this mountain hillside  rocky hillside  in impregnable caves  and three allied battalions had been pounding away at it for six months  and they were stalemated. The    nd was called in to add to the fight  but the men of the    nd came up with a unique but dangerous idea  The backside of the mountain was a sheer rock cliff. The Germans thought an attack from the backside would be impossible. The men of the    nd decided to do the impossible. On a dark  moonless night  they began scaling that rock wall  a drop of more than       feet  in full combat gear. They climbed all night long on that sheer cliff. In the darkness  some lost their handhold or their footing and they fell to their deaths in the ravine below. They all fell silently. Not a single one cried out  so as not to give their position away. The men climbed for eight hours straight  and those who made it to the top stayed there until the first break of light  and as soon as light broke  they attacked. The Germans were surprised  and they took the hill and broke the Gothic Line. A six month stalemate was broken by the    nd in    minutes. It was an amazing act  and when the war ended  the    nd returned to the United States as the most decorated unit of the entire Second World War. They were greeted back on the White House Lawn by President Truman  who said to them   You fought not only the enemy but prejudice  and you won.  They are my heroes. They clung to their belief in the shining ideals of this country  and they proved that being an American is not just for some people  that race is not how we define being an American. They expanded what it means to be an American  including Japanese Americans that were feared and suspected and hated. They were change agents  and they left for me a legacy. They are my heroes and my father is my hero  who understood democracy and guided me through it. They gave me a legacy  and with that legacy comes a responsibility  and I am dedicated to making my country an even better America  to making our government an even truer democracy  and because of the heroes that I have and the struggles that we've gone through  I can stand before you as a gay Japanese American  but even more than that  I am a proud American. Thank you very much. On March           I was in Cambridge at the MIT Media Lab meeting with faculty  students and staff  and we were trying to figure out whether I should be the next director. That night  at midnight  a magnitude   earthquake hit off of the Pacific coast of Japan. My wife and family were in Japan  and as the news started to come in  I was panicking. I was looking at the news streams and listening to the press conferences of the government officials and the Tokyo Power Company  and hearing about this explosion at the nuclear reactors and this cloud of fallout that was headed towards our house which was only about     kilometers away. And the people on TV weren't telling us anything that we wanted to hear. I wanted to know what was going on with the reactor  what was going on with the radiation  whether my family was in danger. So I did what instinctively felt like the right thing  which was to go onto the Internet and try to figure out if I could take matters into my own hands. On the Net  I found there were a lot of other people like me trying to figure out what was going on  and together we sort of loosely formed a group and we called it Safecast  and we decided we were going to try to measure the radiation and get the data out to everybody else  because it was clear that the government wasn't going to be doing this for us. Three years later  we have    million data points  we have designed our own Geiger counters that you can download the designs and plug it into the network. We have an app that shows you most of the radiation in Japan and other parts of the world. We are arguably one of the most successful citizen science projects in the world  and we have created the largest open dataset of radiation measurements. And the interesting thing here is how did    Applause    Thank you. How did a bunch of amateurs who really didn't know what we were doing somehow come together and do what NGOs and the government were completely incapable of doing  And I would suggest that this has something to do with the Internet. It's not a fluke. It wasn't luck  and it wasn't because it was us. It helped that it was an event that pulled everybody together  but it was a new way of doing things that was enabled by the Internet and a lot of the other things that were going on  and I want to talk a little bit about what those new principles are. So remember before the Internet   Laughter  I call this B.I. Okay  So  in B.I.  life was simple. Things were Euclidian  Newtonian  somewhat predictable. People actually tried to predict the future  even the economists. And then the Internet happened  and the world became extremely complex  extremely low cost  extremely fast  and those Newtonian laws that we so dearly cherished turned out to be just local ordinances  and what we found was that in this completely unpredictable world that most of the people who were surviving were working with sort of a different set of principles  and I want to talk a little bit about that. Before the Internet  if you remember  when we tried to create services  what you would do is you'd create the hardware layer and the network layer and the software and it would cost millions of dollars to do anything that was substantial. So when it costs millions of dollars to do something substantial  what you would do is you'd get an MBA who would write a plan and get the money from V.C.s or big companies  and then you'd hire the designers and the engineers  and they'd build the thing. This is the Before Internet  B.I.  innovation model. What happened after the Internet was the cost of innovation went down so much because the cost of collaboration  the cost of distribution  the cost of communication  and Moore's Law made it so that the cost of trying a new thing became nearly zero  and so you would have Google  Facebook  Yahoo  students that didn't have permission   permissionless innovation   didn't have permission  didn't have PowerPoints  they just built the thing  then they raised the money  and then they sort of figured out a business plan and maybe later on they hired some MBAs. So the Internet caused innovation  at least in software and services  to go from an MBA driven innovation model to a designer engineer driven innovation model  and it pushed innovation to the edges  to the dorm rooms  to the startups  away from the large institutions  the stodgy old institutions that had the power and the money and the authority. And we all know this. We all know this happened on the Internet. It turns out it's happening in other things  too. Let me give you some examples. So at the Media Lab  we don't just do hardware. We do all kinds of things. We do biology  we do hardware  and Nicholas Negroponte famously said   Demo or die   as opposed to  Publish or perish   which was the traditional academic way of thinking. And he often said  the demo only has to work once  because the primary mode of us impacting the world was through large companies being inspired by us and creating products like the Kindle or Lego Mindstorms. But today  with the ability to deploy things into the real world at such low cost  I'm changing the motto now  and this is the official public statement. I'm officially saying   Deploy or die.  You have to get the stuff into the real world for it to really count  and sometimes it will be large companies  and Nicholas can talk about satellites. Thank you. But we should be getting out there ourselves and not depending on large institutions to do it for us. So last year  we sent a bunch of students to Shenzhen  and they sat on the factory floors with the innovators in Shenzhen  and it was amazing. What was happening there was you would have these manufacturing devices  and they weren't making prototypes or PowerPoints. They were fiddling with the manufacturing equipment and innovating right on the manufacturing equipment. The factory was in the designer  and the designer was literally in the factory. And so what you would do is  you'd go down to the stalls and you would see these cell phones. So instead of starting little websites like the kids in Palo Alto do  the kids in Shenzhen make new cell phones. They make new cell phones like kids in Palo Alto make websites  and so there's a rainforest of innovation going on in the cell phone. What they do is  they make a cell phone  go down to the stall  they sell some  they look at the other kids' stuff  go up  make a couple thousand more  go down. Doesn't this sound like a software thing  It sounds like agile software development  A B testing and iteration  and what we thought you could only do with software kids in Shenzhen are doing this in hardware. My next fellow  I hope  is going to be one of these innovators from Shenzhen. And so what you see is that is pushing innovation to the edges. We talk about  D printers and stuff like that  and that's great  but this is Limor. She is one of our favorite graduates  and she is standing in front of a Samsung Techwin Pick and Place Machine. This thing can put        components per hour onto an electronics board. This is a factory in a box. So what used to take a factory full of workers working by hand in this little box in New York  she's able to have effectively   She doesn't actually have to go to Shenzhen to do this manufacturing. She can buy this box and she can manufacture it. So manufacturing  the cost of innovation  the cost of prototyping  distribution  manufacturing  hardware  is getting so low that innovation is being pushed to the edges and students and startups are being able to build it. This is a recent thing  but this will happen and this will change just like it did with software. Sorona is a DuPont process that uses a genetically engineered microbe to turn corn sugar into polyester. It's    percent more efficient than the fossil fuel method  and it's much better for the environment. Genetic engineering and bioengineering are creating a whole bunch of great new opportunities for chemistry  for computation  for memory. We will probably be doing a lot  obviously doing health things  but we will probably be growing chairs and buildings soon. The problem is  Sorona costs about     million dollars and took seven years to build. It kind of reminds you of the old mainframe days. The thing is  the cost of innovation in bioengineering is also going down. This is desktop gene sequencer. It used to cost millions and millions of dollars to sequence genes. Now you can do it on a desktop like this  and kids can do this in dorm rooms. This is Gen  gene assembler  and so right now when you try to print a gene  what you do is somebody in a factory with pipettes puts the thing together by hand  you have one error per     base pairs  and it takes a long time and costs a lot of money. This new device assembles genes on a chip  and instead of one error per     base pairs  it's one error per        base pairs. In this lab  we will have the world's capacity of gene printing within a year      million base pairs a year. This is kind of like when we went from transistor radios wrapped by hand to the Pentium. This is going to become the Pentium of bioengineering  pushing bioengineering into the hands of dorm rooms and startup companies. So it's happening in software and in hardware and bioengineering  and so this is a fundamental new way of thinking about innovation. It's a bottom up innovation  it's democratic  it's chaotic  it's hard to control. It's not bad  but it's very different  and I think that the traditional rules that we have for institutions don't work anymore  and most of us here operate with a different set of principles. One of my favorite principles is the power of pull  which is the idea of pulling resources from the network as you need them rather than stocking them in the center and controlling everything. So in the case of the Safecast story  I didn't know anything when the earthquake happened  but I was able to find Sean who was the hackerspace community organizer  and Peter  the analog hardware hacker who made our first Geiger counter  and Dan  who built the Three Mile Island monitoring system after the Three Mile Island meltdown. And these people I wouldn't have been able to find beforehand and probably were better that I found them just in time from the network. I'm a three time college dropout  so learning over education is very near and dear to my heart  but to me  education is what people do to you and learning is what you do to yourself. And it feels like  and I'm biased  it feels like they're trying to make you memorize the whole encyclopedia before they let you go out and play  and to me  I've got Wikipedia on my cell phone  and it feels like they assume you're going to be on top of some mountain all by yourself with a number   pencil trying to figure out what to do when in fact you're always going to be connected  you're always going to have friends  and you can pull Wikipedia up whenever you need it  and what you need to learn is how to learn. In the case of Safecast  a bunch of amateurs when we started three years ago  I would argue that we probably as a group know more than any other organization about how to collect data and publish data and do citizen science. Compass over maps. So this one  the idea is that the cost of writing a plan or mapping something is getting so expensive and it's not very accurate or useful. So in the Safecast story  we knew we needed to collect data  we knew we wanted to publish the data  and instead of trying to come up with the exact plan  we first said  oh  let's get Geiger counters. Oh  they've run out. Let's build them. There aren't enough sensors. Okay  then we can make a mobile Geiger counter. We can drive around. We can get volunteers. We don't have enough money. Let's Kickstarter it. We could not have planned this whole thing  but by having a very strong compass  we eventually got to where we were going  and to me it's very similar to agile software development  but this idea of compasses is very important. So I think the good news is that even though the world is extremely complex  what you need to do is very simple. I think it's about stopping this notion that you need to plan everything  you need to stock everything  and you need to be so prepared  and focus on being connected  always learning  fully aware  and super present. So I don't like the word  futurist.  I think we should be now ists  like we are right now. Thank you. which is in play mode  I'm really interested in how you put people and computers together. We will be using the TV screens or their equivalents for electronic books of the future. Very interested in touch sensitive displays  high tech  high touch  not having to pick up your fingers to use them. There is another way where computers touch people  wearing  physically wearing. Suddenly on September   th  the world got bigger. NN  Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. When I was asked to do this  I was also asked to look at all    TED Talks that I had given  chronologically. The first one was actually two hours. The second one was an hour  and then they became half hours  and all I noticed was my bald spot getting bigger. Imagine seeing your life     years of it  go by  and it was  to say the least  for me  quite a shocking experience. So what I'm going to do in my time is try and share with you what happened during the    years  and then also make a prediction  and then tell you a little bit about what I'm doing next. And I put on a slide where TED   happened in my life. And it's rather important because I had done    years of research before it  so I had a backlog  so it was easy. It's not that I was Fidel Castro and I could talk for two hours  or Bucky Fuller. I had    years of stuff  and the Media Lab was about to start. So that was easy. But there are a couple of things about that period and about what happened that are really quite important. One is that it was a period when computers weren't yet for people. And the other thing that sort of happened during that time is that we were considered sissy computer scientists. We weren't considered the real thing. So what I'm going to show you is  in retrospect  a lot more interesting and a lot more accepted than it was at the time. So I'm going to characterize the years and I'm even going to go back to some very early work of mine  and this was the kind of stuff I was doing in the '  s  very direct manipulation  very influenced as I studied architecture by the architect Moshe Safdie  and you can see that we even built robotic things that could build habitat like structures. And this for me was not yet the Media Lab  but was the beginning of what I'll call sensory computing  and I pick fingers partly because everybody thought it was ridiculous. Papers were published about how stupid it was to use fingers. Three reasons  One was they were low resolution. The other is your hand would occlude what you wanted to see  and the third  which was the winner  was that your fingers would get the screen dirty  and hence  fingers would never be a device that you'd use. And this was a device we built in the '  s  which has never even been picked up. It's not just touch sensitive  it's pressure sensitive. NN  Later work  and again this was before TED     Create a large green circle there. Man  Aw  shit. NN    was to sort of do interface concurrently  so when you talked and you pointed and you had  if you will  multiple channels. Entebbe happened.       Air France was hijacked  taken to Entebbe  and the Israelis not only did an extraordinary rescue  they did it partly because they had practiced on a physical model of the airport  because they had built the airport  so they built a model in the desert  and when they arrived at Entebbe  they knew where to go because they had actually been there. The U.S. government asked some of us  '    if we could replicate that computationally  and of course somebody like myself says yes. Immediately  you get a contract  Department of Defense  and we built this truck and this rig. We did sort of a simulation  because you had video discs  and again  this is '  . And then many years later  you get this truck  and so you have Google Maps. Still people thought  no  that was not serious computer science  and it was a man named Jerry Wiesner  who happened to be the president of MIT  who did think it was computer science. And one of the keys for anybody who wants to start something in life  Make sure your president is part of it. So when I was doing the Media Lab  it was like having a gorilla in the front seat. If you were stopped for speeding and the officer looked in the window and saw who was in the passenger seat  then   Oh  continue on  sir.  And so we were able  and this is a cute  actually  device  parenthetically. This was a lenticular photograph of Jerry Wiesner where the only thing that changed in the photograph were the lips. So when you oscillated that little piece of lenticular sheet with his photograph  it would be in lip sync with zero bandwidth. It was a zero bandwidth teleconferencing system at the time. So this was the Media Lab's   this is what we said we'd do  that the world of computers  publishing  and so on would come together. Again  not generally accepted  but very much part of TED in the early days. And this is really where we were headed. And that created the Media Lab. One of the things about age is that I can tell you with great confidence  I've been to the future. I've been there  actually  many times. And the reason I say that is  how many times in my life have I said   Oh  in    years  this will happen   and then    years comes. And then you say   Oh  in five years  this will happen.  And then five years comes. So I say this a little bit with having felt that I'd been there a number of times  and one of the things that is most quoted that I've ever said is that computing is not about computers  and that didn't quite get enough traction  and then it started to. It started to because people caught on that the medium wasn't the message. And the reason I show this car in actually a rather ugly slide is just again to tell you the kind of story that characterized a little bit of my life. This is a student of mine who had done a Ph.D. called  Backseat Driver.  It was in the early days of GPS  the car knew where it was  and it would give audio instructions to the driver  when to turn right   when to turn left and so on. Turns out  there are a lot of things in those instructions that back in that period were pretty challenging  like what does it mean  take the next right  Well  if you're coming up on a street  the next right's probably the one after  and there are lots of issues  and the student did a wonderful thesis  and the MIT patent office said  Don't patent it. It'll never be accepted. The liabilities are too large. There will be insurance issues. Don't patent it.  So we didn't  but it shows you how people  again  at times  don't really look at what's happening. Some work  and I'll just go through these very quickly  a lot of sensory stuff. You might recognize a young Yo Yo Ma and tracking his body for playing the cello or the hypercello. These fellows literally walked  around like that at the time. It's now a little bit more discreet and more commonplace. And then there are at least three heroes I want to quickly mention. Marvin Minsky  who taught me a lot about common sense  and I will talk briefly about Muriel Cooper  who was very important to Ricky Wurman and to TED  and in fact  when she got onstage  she said  the first thing she said was   I introduced Ricky to Nicky.  And nobody calls me Nicky and nobody calls Richard Ricky  so nobody knew who she was talking about. And then  of course  Seymour Papert  who is the person who said   You can't think about thinking unless you think about thinking about something.  And that's actually   you can unpack that later. It's a pretty profound statement. I'm showing some slides that were from TED    a little silly as slides  perhaps. Then I felt television really was about displays. Again  now we're past TED    but just around the time of TED    and what I'd like to mention here is  even though you could imagine intelligence in the device  I look today at some of the work being done about the Internet of Things  and I think it's kind of tragically pathetic  because what has happened is people take the oven panel and put it on your cell phone  or the door key onto your cell phone  just taking it and bringing it to you  and in fact that's actually what you don't want. You want to put a chicken in the oven  and the oven says   Aha  it's a chicken   and it cooks the chicken.  Oh  it's cooking the chicken for Nicholas  and he likes it this way and that way.  So the intelligence  instead of being in the device  we have started today to move it back onto the cell phone or closer to the user  not a particularly enlightened view of the Internet of Things. Television  again  television what I said today  that was back in       and the television of tomorrow would look something like that. Again  people  but they laughed cynically  they didn't laugh with much appreciation. Telecommunications in the     s  George Gilder decided that he would call this diagram the Negroponte switch. I'm probably much less famous than George  so when he called it the Negroponte switch  it stuck  but the idea of things that came in the ground would go in the air and stuff in the air would go into the ground has played itself out. That is the original slide from that year  and it has worked in lockstep obedience. We started Wired magazine. Some people  I remember we shared the reception desk periodically  and some parent called up irate that his son had given up Sports Illustrated to subscribe for Wired  and he said   Are you some porno magazine or something   and couldn't understand why his son would be interested in Wired  at any rate. I will go through this a little quicker. This is my favorite        back page of Newsweek magazine. Okay. Read it.  Laughter    Nicholas Negroponte  director of the MIT Media Lab  predicts that we'll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Internet. Uh  sure.   Clifford Stoll  Newsweek        You must admit that gives you  at least it gives me pleasure when somebody says how dead wrong you are.  Being Digital  came out. For me  it gave me an opportunity to be more in the trade press and get this out to the public  and it also allowed us to build the new Media Lab  which if you haven't been to  visit  because it's a beautiful piece of architecture aside from being a wonderful place to work. So these are the things we were saying in those TEDs.  Today  multimedia is a desktop or living room experience  because the apparatus is so clunky. This will change dramatically with small  bright  thin  high resolution displays.         We came to them. I looked forward to it every year. It was the party that Ricky Wurman never had in the sense that he invited many of his old friends  including myself. And then something for me changed pretty profoundly. I became more involved with computers and learning and influenced by Seymour  but particularly looking at learning as something that is best approximated by computer programming. When you write a computer program  you've got to not just list things out and sort of take an algorithm and translate it into a set of instructions  but when there's a bug  and all programs have bugs  you've got to de bug it. You've got to go in  change it  and then re execute  and you iterate  and that iteration is really a very  very good approximation of learning. So that led to my own work with Seymour in places like Cambodia and the starting of One Laptop per Child. Enough TED Talks on One Laptop per Child  so I'll go through it very fast  but it did give us the chance to do something at a relatively large scale in the area of learning  development and computing. Very few people know that One Laptop per Child was a    billion project  and it was  at least over the seven years I ran it  but even more important  the World Bank contributed zero  USAID zero. It was mostly the countries using their own treasuries  which is very interesting  at least to me it was very interesting in terms of what I plan to do next. So these are the various places it happened. I then tried an experiment  and the experiment happened in Ethiopia. And here's the experiment. The experiment is  can learning happen where there are no schools. And we dropped off tablets with no instructions and let the children figure it out. And in a short period of time  they not only turned them on and were using    apps per child within five days  they were singing  ABC  songs within two weeks  but they hacked Android within six months. And so that seemed sufficiently interesting. This is perhaps the best picture I have. The kid on your right has sort of nominated himself as teacher. Look at the kid on the left  and so on. There are no adults involved in this at all. So I said  well can we do this at a larger scale  And what is it that's missing  The kids are giving a press conference at this point  and sort of writing in the dirt. And the answer is  what is missing  And I'm going to skip over my prediction  actually  because I'm running out of time  and here's the question  is what's going to happen  I think the challenge is to connect the last billion people  and connecting the last billion is very different than connecting the next billion  and the reason it's different is that the next billion are sort of low hanging fruit  but the last billion are rural. Being rural and being poor are very different. Poverty tends to be created by our society  and the people in that community are not poor in the same way at all. They may be primitive  but the way to approach it and to connect them  the history of One Laptop per Child  and the experiment in Ethiopia  lead me to believe that we can in fact do this in a very short period of time. And so my plan  and unfortunately I haven't been able to get my partners at this point to let me announce them  but is to do this with a stationary satellite. There are many reasons that stationary satellites aren't the best things  but there are a lot of reasons why they are  and for two billion dollars  you can connect a lot more than     million people  but the reason I picked two  and I will leave this as my last slide  is two billion dollars is what we were spending in Afghanistan every week. So surely if we can connect Africa and the last billion people for numbers like that  we should be doing it. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Stay up there. Stay up there. NN  You're going to give me extra time  CA  No. That was wickedly clever  wickedly clever. You gamed it beautifully. Nicholas  what is your prediction  NN  Thank you for asking. I'll tell you what my prediction is  and my prediction  and this is a prediction  because it'll be    years. I won't be here. But one of the things about learning how to read  we have been doing a lot of consuming of information going through our eyes  and so that may be a very inefficient channel. So my prediction is that we are  going to ingest information You're going to swallow a pill and know English. You're going to swallow a pill and know Shakespeare. And the way to do it is through the bloodstream. So once it's in your bloodstream  it basically goes through it and gets into the brain  and when it knows that it's in the brain in the different pieces  it deposits it in the right places. So it's ingesting. CA  Have you been hanging out with Ray Kurzweil by any chance  NN  No  but I've been hanging around with Ed Boyden and hanging around with one of the speakers who is here  Hugh Herr  and there are a number of people. This isn't quite as far fetched  so    years from now. CA  We will check it out. We're going to be back and we're going to play this clip    years from now  and then all eat the red pill. Well thank you for that. Nicholas Negroponte. NN  Thank you. When I was preparing for this talk  I went to search for a couple of quotes that I can share with you. Good news  I found three that I particularly liked  the first by Samuel Johnson  who said   When making your choice in life  do not forget to live   the second by Aeschylus  who reminded us that  happiness is a choice that requires effort   and the third is one by Groucho Marx who said   I wouldn't want to choose to belong to any club that would have me as a member.  Now  bad news  I didn't know which one of these quotes to choose and share with you. The sweet anxiety of choice. In today's times of post industrial capitalism  choice  together with individual freedom and the idea of self making  has been elevated to an ideal. Now  together with this  we also have a belief in endless progress. But the underside of this ideology has been an increase of anxiety  feelings of guilt  feelings of being inadequate  feeling that we are failing in our choices. Sadly  this ideology of individual choice has prevented us from thinking about social changes. It appears that this ideology was actually very efficient in pacifying us as political and social thinkers. Instead of making social critiques  we are more and more engaging in self critique  sometimes to the point of self destruction. Now  how come that ideology of choice is still so powerful  even among people who have not many things to choose among  How come that even people who are poor very much still identify with the idea of choice  the kind of rational idea of choice which we embrace  Now  the ideology of choice is very successful in opening for us a space to think about some imagined future. Let me give you an example. My friend Manya  when she was a student at university in California  was earning money by working for a car dealer. Now  Manya  when she encountered the typical customer  would debate with him about his lifestyle  how much he wants to spend  how many children he has  what does he need the car for  They would usually come to a good conclusion what would be a perfect car. Now  before Manya's customer would go home and think things through  she would say to him   The car that you are buying now is perfect  but in a few year's time  when your kids will be already out of the house  when you will have a little bit more money  that other car will be ideal. But what you are buying now is great.  Now  the majority of Manya's customers who came back the next day bought that other car  the car they did not need  the car that cost far too much money. Now  Manya became so successful in selling cars that soon she moved on to selling airplanes. And knowing so much about the psychology of people prepared her well for her current job  which is that of a psychoanalyst. Now  why were Manya's customers so irrational  Manya's success was that she was able to open in their heads an image of an idealized future  an image of themselves when they are already more successful  freer  and for them  choosing that other car was as if they are coming closer to this ideal in which it was as if Manya already saw them. Now  we rarely make really totally rational choices. Choices are influenced by our unconscious  by our community. We're often choosing by guessing  what would other people think about our choice  Also we are choosing by looking at what others are choosing. We're also guessing what is socially acceptable choice. Now  because of this  we actually even after we have already chosen  like bought a car  endlessly read reviews about cars  as if we still want to convince ourselves that we made the right choice. Now  choices are anxiety provoking. They are linked to risks  losses. They are highly unpredictable. Now  because of this  people have now more and more problems that they are not choosing anything. Not long ago  I was at a wedding reception  and I met a young  beautiful woman who immediately started telling me about her anxiety over choice. She said to me   I needed one month to decide which dress to wear.  Then she said   For weeks I was researching which hotel to stay for this one night. And now  I need to choose a sperm donor.  I looked at this woman in shock.  Sperm donor  What's the rush   She said   I'm turning    at the end of this year  and I've been so bad in choosing men in my life.  Now choice  because it's linked to risk  is anxiety provoking  and it was already the famous Danish philosopher S ren Kierkegaard who pointed out that anxiety is linked to the possibility of possibility. Now  we think today that we can prevent these risks. We have endless market analysis  projections of the future earnings. Even with market  which is about chance  randomness  we think we can predict rationally where it's going. Now  chance is actually becoming very traumatic. Last year  my friend Bernard Harcourt at the University of Chicago organized an event  a conference on the idea of chance. He and I were together on the panel  and just before delivering our papers   we didn't know each other's papers   we decided to take chance seriously. So we informed our audience that what they will just now hear will be a random paper  a mixture of the two papers which we didn't know what each was writing. Now  we delivered the conference in such a way. Bernard read his first paragraph  I read my first paragraph  Bernard read his second paragraph  I read my second paragraph  in this way towards the end of our papers. Now  you will be surprised that a majority of our audience did not think that what they'd just listened to was a completely random paper. They couldn't believe that speaking from the position of authority like two professors we were  we would take chance seriously. They thought we prepared the papers together and were just joking that it's random. Now  we live in times with a lot of information  big data  a lot of knowledge about the insides of our bodies. We decoded our genome. We know about our brains more than before. But surprisingly  people are more and more turning a blind eye in front of this knowledge. Ignorance and denial are on the rise. Now  in regard to the current economic crisis  we think that we will just wake up again and everything will be the same as before  and no political or social changes are needed. In regard to ecological crisis  we think nothing needs to be done just now  or others need to act before us. Or even when ecological crisis already happens  like a catastrophe in Fukushima  often we have people living in the same environment with the same amount of information  and half of them will be anxious about radiation and half of them will ignore it. Now  psychoanalysts know very well that people surprisingly don't have passion for knowledge but passion for ignorance. Now  what does that mean  Let's say when we are facing a life threatening illness  a lot of people don't want to know that. They'd rather prefer denying the illness  which is why it's not so wise to inform them if they don't ask. Surprisingly  research shows that sometimes people who deny their illness live longer than those who are rationally choosing the best treatment. Now  this ignorance  however  is not very helpful on the level of the social. When we are ignorant about where we are heading  a lot of social damage can be caused. Now  on top of facing ignorance  we are also facing today some kind of an obviousness. Now  it was French philosopher Louis Althusser who pointed out that ideology functions in such a way that it creates a veil of obviousness. Before we do any social critique  it is necessary really to lift that veil of obviousness and to think through a little bit differently. If we go back to this ideology of individual  rational choice we often embrace  it's necessary precisely here to lift this obviousness and to think a little bit differently. Now for me  a question often is why we still embrace this idea of a self made man on which capitalism relied from its beginning  Why do we think that we are really such masters of our lives that we can rationally make the best ideal choices  that we don't accept losses and risks  And for me  it's very shocking to see sometimes very poor people  for example  not supporting the idea of the rich being taxed more. Quite often here they still identify with a certain kind of a lottery mentality. Okay  maybe they don't think that they will make it in the future  but maybe they think  my son might become the next Bill Gates. And who would want to tax one's son  Or  a question for me is also  why would people who have no health insurance not embrace universal healthcare  Sometimes they don't embrace it  again identifying with the idea of choice  but they have nothing to choose from. Now  Margaret Thatcher famously said that there is nothing like a society. Society doesn't exist  it is only individuals and their families. Sadly  this ideology still functions very well  which is why people who are poor might feel ashamed for their poverty. We might endlessly feel guilty that we are not making the right choices  and that's why we didn't succeed. We are anxious that we are not good enough. That's why we work very hard  long hours at the workplace and equally long hours on remaking ourselves. Now  when we are anxious over choices  sometimes we easily give our power of choice away. We identify with the guru who tells us what to do  self help therapist  or we embrace a totalitarian leader who appears to have no doubts about choices  who sort of knows. Now  often people ask me   What did you learn by studying choice   And there is an important message that I did learn. When thinking about choices  I stopped taking choices too seriously  personally. First  I realized a lot of choice I make is not rational. It's linked to my unconscious  my guesses of what others are choosing  or what is a socially embraced choice. I also embrace the idea that we should go beyond thinking about individual choices  that it's very important to rethink social choices  since this ideology of individual choice has pacified us. It really prevented us to think about social change. We spend so much time choosing things for ourselves and barely reflect on communal choices we can make. Now  we should not forget that choice is always linked to change. We can make individual changes  but we can make social changes. We can choose to have more wolves. We can choose to change our environment to have more bees. We can choose to have different rating agencies. We can choose to control corporations instead of allowing corporations to control us. We have a possibility to make changes. Now  I started with a quote from Samuel Johnson  who said that when we make choice in life  we shouldn't forget to live. Finally  you can see I did have a choice to choose one of the three quotes with which I wanted to start my lecture. I did have a choice  such as nations  as people  we have choices too to rethink in what kind of society we want to live in the future. Thank you. Could I protect my father from the Armed Islamic Group with a paring knife  That was the question I faced one Tuesday morning in June of       when I was a law student. I woke up early that morning in Dad's apartment on the outskirts of Algiers  Algeria  to an unrelenting pounding on the front door. It was a season as described by a local paper when every Tuesday a scholar fell to the bullets of fundamentalist assassins. My father's university teaching of Darwin had already provoked a classroom visit from the head of the so called Islamic Salvation Front  who denounced Dad as an advocate of biologism before Dad had ejected the man  and now whoever was outside would neither identify himself nor go away. So my father tried to get the police on the phone  but perhaps terrified by the rising tide of armed extremism that had already claimed the lives of so many Algerian officers  they didn't even answer. And that was when I went to the kitchen  got out a paring knife  and took up a position inside the entryway. It was a ridiculous thing to do  really  but I couldn't think of anything else  and so there I stood. When I look back now  I think that that was the moment that set me on the path was to writing a book called  Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here  Untold Stories from the Fight Against Muslim Fundamentalism.  The title comes from a Pakistani play. I think it was actually that moment that sent me on the journey to interview     people of Muslim heritage from nearly    countries  from Afghanistan to Mali  to find out how they fought fundamentalism peacefully like my father did  and how they coped with the attendant risks. Luckily  back in June of       our unidentified visitor went away  but other families were so much less lucky  and that was the thought that motivated my research. In any case  someone would return a few months later and leave a note on Dad's kitchen table  which simply said   Consider yourself dead.  Subsequently  Algeria's fundamentalist armed groups would murder as many as         civilians in what came to be known as the dark decade of the     s  including every single one of the women that you see here. In its harsh counterterrorist response  the state resorted to torture and to forced disappearances  and as terrible as all of these events became  the international community largely ignored them. Finally  my father  an Algerian peasant's son turned professor  was forced to stop teaching at the university and to flee his apartment  but what I will never forget about Mahfoud Bennoune  my dad  was that like so many other Algerian intellectuals  he refused to leave the country and he continued to publish pointed criticisms  both of the fundamentalists and sometimes of the government they battled. For example  in a November      series in the newspaper El Watan entitled  How Fundamentalism Produced a Terrorism without Precedent   he denounced what he called the terrorists' radical break with the true Islam as it was lived by our ancestors. These were words that could get you killed. My father's country taught me in that dark decade of the     s that the popular struggle against Muslim fundamentalism is one of the most important and overlooked human rights struggles in the world. This remains true today  nearly    years later. You see  in every country where you hear about armed jihadis targeting civilians  there are also unarmed people defying those militants that you don't hear about  and those people need our support to succeed. In the West  it's often assumed that Muslims generally condone terrorism. Some on the right think this because they view Muslim culture as inherently violent  and some on the left imagine this because they view Muslim violence  fundamentalist violence  solely as a product of legitimate grievances. But both views are dead wrong. In fact  many people of Muslim heritage around the world are staunch opponents both of fundamentalism and of terrorism  and often for very good reason. You see  they're much more likely to be victims of this violence than its perpetrators. Let me just give you one example. According to a      survey of Arabic language media resources  between      and       no more than    percent of al Qaeda's victims were Westerners. That's a terrible toll  but the vast majority were people of Muslim heritage  killed by Muslim fundamentalists. Now I've been talking for the last five minutes about fundamentalism  and you have a right to know exactly what I mean. I cite the definition given by the Algerian sociologist Marieme Helie Lucas  and she says that fundamentalisms  note the  s   so within all of the world's great religious traditions   fundamentalisms are political movements of the extreme right which in a context of globalization manipulate religion in order to achieve their political aims.  Sadia Abbas has called this the radical politicization of theology. Now I want to avoid projecting the notion that there's sort of a monolith out there called Muslim fundamentalism that is the same everywhere  because these movements also have their diversities. Some use and advocate violence. Some do not  though they're often interrelated. They take different forms. Some may be non governmental organizations  even here in Britain like Cageprisoners. Some may become political parties  like the Muslim Brotherhood  and some may be openly armed groups like the Taliban. But in any case  these are all radical projects. They're not conservative or traditional approaches. They're most often about changing people's relationship with Islam rather than preserving it. What I am talking about is the Muslim extreme right  and the fact that its adherents are or purport to be Muslim makes them no less offensive than the extreme right anywhere else. So in my view  if we consider ourselves liberal or left wing  human rights loving or feminist  we must oppose these movements and support their grassroots opponents. Now let me be clear that I support an effective struggle against fundamentalism  but also a struggle that must itself respect international law  so nothing I am saying should be taken as a justification for refusals to democratize  and here I send out a shout out of support to the pro democracy movement  in Algeria today  Barakat. Nor should anything I say be taken as a justification of violations of human rights  like the mass death sentences handed out in Egypt earlier this week. But what I am saying is that we must challenge these Muslim fundamentalist movements because they threaten human rights across Muslim majority contexts  and they do this in a range of ways  most obviously with the direct attacks on civilians by the armed groups that carry those out. But that violence is just the tip of the iceberg. These movements as a whole purvey discrimination against religious minorities and sexual minorities. They seek to curtail the freedom of religion of everyone who either practices in a different way or chooses not to practice. And most definingly  they lead an all out war on the rights of women. Now  faced with these movements in recent years  Western discourse has most often offered two flawed responses. The first that one sometimes finds on the right suggests that most Muslims are fundamentalist or something about Islam is inherently fundamentalist  and this is just offensive and wrong  but unfortunately on the left one sometimes encounters a discourse that is too politically correct to acknowledge the problem of Muslim fundamentalism at all or  even worse  apologizes for it  and this is unacceptable as well. So what I'm seeking is a new way of talking about this all together  which is grounded in the lived experiences and the hope of the people on the front lines. I'm painfully aware that there has been an increase in discrimination against Muslims in recent years in countries like the U.K. and the U.S.  and that too is a matter of grave concern  but I firmly believe that telling these counter stereotypical stories of people of Muslim heritage who have confronted the fundamentalists and been their primary victims is also a great way of countering that discrimination. So now let me introduce you to four people whose stories I had the great honor of telling. Faizan Peerzada and the Rafi Peer Theatre workshop named for his father have for years promoted the performing arts in Pakistan. With the rise of jihadist violence  they began to receive threats to call off their events  which they refused to heed. And so a bomber struck their      eighth world performing arts festival in Lahore  producing rain of glass that fell into the venue injuring nine people  and later that same night  the Peerzadas made a very difficult decision  they announced that their festival would continue as planned the next day. As Faizan said at the time  if we bow down to the Islamists  we'll just be sitting in a dark corner. But they didn't know what would happen. Would anyone come  In fact  thousands of people came out the next day to support the performing arts in Lahore  and this simultaneously thrilled and terrified Faizan  and he ran up to a woman who had come in with her two small children  and he said   You do know there was a bomb here yesterday  and you do know there's a threat here today.  And she said   I know that  but I came to your festival with my mother when I was their age  and I still have those images in my mind. We have to be here.  With stalwart audiences like this  the Peerzadas were able to conclude their festival on schedule. And then the next year  they lost all of their sponsors due to the security risk. So when I met them in       they were in the middle of the first subsequent event that they were able to have in the same venue  and this was the ninth youth performing arts festival held in Lahore in a year when that city had already experienced    terror attacks. This was a time when the Pakistani Taliban had commenced their systematic targeting of girls' schools that would culminate in the attack on Malala Yousafzai. What did the Peerzadas do in that environment  They staged girls' school theater. So I had the privilege of watching  Naang Wal   which was a musical in the Punjabi language  and the girls of Lahore Grammar School played all the parts. They sang and danced  they played the mice and the water buffalo  and I held my breath  wondering  would we get to the end of this amazing show  And when we did  the whole audience collectively exhaled  and a few people actually wept  and then they filled the auditorium with the peaceful boom of their applause. And I remember thinking in that moment that the bombers made headlines here two years before but this night and these people are as important a story. Maria Bashir is the first and only woman chief prosecutor in Afghanistan. She's been in the post since      and actually opened an office to investigate cases of violence against women  which she says is the most important area in her mandate. When I meet her in her office in Herat  she enters surrounded by four large men with four huge guns. In fact  she now has    bodyguards  because she has weathered bomb attacks that nearly killed her kids  and it took the leg off of one of her guards. Why does she continue  She says with a smile that that is the question that everyone asks  as she puts it   Why you risk not living   And it is simply that for her  a better future for all the Maria Bashirs to come is worth the risk  and she knows that if people like her do not take the risk  there will be no better future. Later on in our interview  Prosecutor Bashir tells me how worried she is about the possible outcome of government negotiations with the Taliban  the people who have been trying to kill her.  If we give them a place in the government   she asks   Who will protect women's rights   And she urges the international community not to forget its promise about women because now they want peace with Taliban. A few weeks after I leave Afghanistan  I see a headline on the Internet. An Afghan prosecutor has been assassinated. I google desperately  and thankfully that day I find out that Maria was not the victim  though sadly  another Afghan prosecutor was gunned down on his way to work. And when I hear headlines like that now  I think that as international troops leave Afghanistan this year and beyond  we must continue to care about what happens to people there  to all of the Maria Bashirs. Sometimes I still hear her voice in my head saying  with no bravado whatsoever   The situation of the women of Afghanistan will be better someday. We should prepare the ground for this  even if we are killed.  There are no words adequate to denounce the al Shabaab terrorists who attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi on the same day as a children's cooking competition in September of     . They killed     including poets and pregnant women. Far away in the American Midwest  I had the good fortune of meeting Somali Americans who were working to counter the efforts of al Shabaab to recruit a small number of young people from their city of Minneapolis to take part in atrocities like Westgate. Abdirizak Bihi's studious    year old nephew Burhan Hassan was recruited here in       spirited to Somalia  and then killed when he tried to come home. Since that time  Mr. Bihi  who directs the no budget Somali Education and Advocacy Center  has been vocally denouncing the recruitment and the failures of government and Somali American institutions like the Abubakar As Saddique Islamic Center where he believes his nephew was radicalized during a youth program. But he doesn't just criticize the mosque. He also takes on the government for its failure to do more to prevent poverty in his community. Given his own lack of financial resources  Mr. Bihi has had to be creative. To counter the efforts of al Shabaab to sway more disaffected youth  in the wake of the group's      attack on World Cup viewers in Uganda  he organized a Ramadan basketball tournament in Minneapolis in response. Scores of Somali American kids came out to embrace sport despite the fatwa against it. They played basketball as Burhan Hassan never would again. For his efforts  Mr. Bihi has been ostracized by the leadership of the Abubakar As Saddique Islamic Center  with which he used to have good relations. He told me   One day we saw the imam on TV calling us infidels and saying  'These families are trying to destroy the mosque.'  This is at complete odds with how Abdirizak Bihi understands what he is trying to do by exposing al Shabaab recruitment  which is to save the religion I love from a small number of extremists. Now I want to tell one last story  that of a    year old law student in Algeria named Amel Zenoune Zouani who had the same dreams of a legal career that I did back in the '  s. She refused to give up her studies  despite the fact that the fundamentalists battling the Algerian state back then threatened all who continued their education. On January           Amel boarded the bus in Algiers where she was studying to go home and spend a Ramadan evening with her family  and would never finish law school. When the bus reached the outskirts of her hometown  it was stopped at a checkpoint manned by men from the Armed Islamic Group. Carrying her schoolbag  Amel was taken off the bus and killed in the street. The men who cut her throat then told everyone else   If you go to university  the day will come when we will kill all of you just like this.  Amel died at exactly      p.m.  which we know because when she fell in the street  her watch broke. Her mother showed me the watch with the second hand still aimed optimistically upward towards a      that would never come. Shortly before her death  Amel had said to her mother of herself and her sisters   Nothing will happen to us  Inshallah  God willing  but if something happens  you must know that we are dead for knowledge. You and father must keep your heads held high.  The loss of such a young woman is unfathomable  and so as I did my research I found myself searching for Amel's hope again and her name even means  hope  in Arabic. I think I found it in two places. The first is in the strength of her family and all the other families to continue telling their stories and to go on with their lives despite the terrorism. In fact  Amel's sister Lamia overcame her grief  went to law school  and practices as a lawyer in Algiers today  something which is only possible because the armed fundamentalists were largely defeated in the country. And the second place I found Amel's hope was everywhere that women and men continue to defy the jihadis. We must support all of those in honor of Amel who continue this human rights struggle today  like the Network of Women Living Under Muslim Laws. It is not enough  as the victims rights advocate Cherifa Kheddar told me in Algiers  it is not enough just to battle terrorism. We must also challenge fundamentalism  because fundamentalism is the ideology that makes the bed of this terrorism. Why is it that people like her  like all of them are not more well known  Why is it that everyone knows who Osama bin Laden was and so few know of all of those standing up to the bin Ladens in their own contexts. We must change that  and so I ask you to please help share these stories through your networks. Look again at Amel Zenoune's watch  forever frozen  and now please look at your own watch and decide this is the moment that you commit to supporting people like Amel. We don't have the right to be silent about them because it is easier or because Western policy is flawed as well  because      is still coming to too many Amel Zenounes in places like northern Nigeria  where jihadis still kill students. The time to speak up in support of all of those who peacefully challenge fundamentalism and terrorism in their own communities is now. Thank you. Puzzles and magic. I work in what most people think are two distinct fields  but I believe they are the same. I am both a magician and a New York Times crossword puzzle constructor  which basically means I've taken the world's two nerdiest hobbies and combined them into one career. And I believe that magic and puzzles are the same because they both key into one of the most important human drives  the urge to solve. Human beings are wired to solve  to make order out of chaos. It's certainly true for me. I've been solving my whole life. High school consisted of epic Scrabble matches in the cafeteria and not really talking to girls  and then at about that time I started learning magic tricks and definitely not talking to girls. There's nothing like starting a conversation with   Hey  did you know that 'prestidigitation' is worth    points in Scrabble   But back then  I noticed an intersection between puzzles and illusion. When you do the crossword puzzle or when you watch a magic show  you become a solver  and your goal is to try to find the order in the chaos  the chaos of  say  a black and white puzzle grid  a mixed up bag of Scrabble tiles  or a shuffled pack of playing cards. And today  as a cruciverbalist      points   and an illusion designer  I create that chaos. I test your ability to solve. Now  it turns out research tells us that solving is as primal as eating and sleeping. From birth  we are wired to solve. In one UCLA study  newborns still in the hospital were shown patterns  patterns like this  circle  cross  circle  cross. And then the pattern was changed  triangle  square. And by tracking an infant's gaze  we know that newborns as young as a day old can notice and respond to disruptions in order. It's remarkable. So from infancy through old age  the urge to solve unites us all  and I even found this photo on Instagram of pop star Katy Perry solving a crossword puzzle with her morning coffee. Like. Now  solving exists across all cultures. The American invention is the crossword puzzle  and this year we are celebrating the    th anniversary of the crossword puzzle  first published in The New York World. But many other cultures have their signature puzzles as well. China gives us tangrams  which would test solvers' abilities to form shapes from the jumbled pieces. Chaos. Order. Order. And order. That one's my favorite  let's hear it again. Okay. And how about this puzzle invented in   th century England  the jigsaw puzzle. Is this not making order out of chaos  So as you can see  we are always solving. We are always trying to decode our world. It's an eternal quest. It's just like the one Cervantes wrote about in  Don Quixote   which by the way is the root of the word  quixotry   the highest scoring Scrabble word of all time      points. But anyway   Don Quixote  is an important book. You guys have read  Don Quixote   yes  I'm seeing some heads nod. Come on guys  really  Who's read  Don Quixote   Let's do this. Raise your hands if you've read  Don Quixote.  There we go. Smart audience. Who's read  Don Quixote   Get them up. Okay  good  because I need somebody smart here because now I'm going to demonstrate with the help of one of you just how deeply rooted your urge to solve is  just how wired to solve all of you really are  so I'm going to come into the audience and find somebody to help me. Let's see. Everybody's looking away all of a sudden. Can I  Would you  What is your name  Gwen. I'm not a mind reader  I can see your name tag. Come with me  Gwen. Everyone give her  a round of applause  make her feel welcome. Gwen  after you. Are you so excited  Did you know that your name is worth eight points in Scrabble  Okay  stand right here  Gwen  right here. Now  Gwen  before we begin  I'd like to point out a piece of the puzzle  which is here in this envelope  and I will not go near it. Okay  And over here we have a drawing of some farm animals. You can see we have an owl  we have a horse  a donkey  a rooster  an ox  and a sheep  and then here  Gwen  we have some fancy art store markers  colors like  can you see that word right there  Gwen  Cobalt. David Kwong  Cobalt  yes. Cobalt. But we have a silver  a red  an emerald  and an amber marker  and Gwen  you are going to color this drawing just like you were five years old  one marker at a time. It's going to be a lot of fun. But I'm going to go over here. I don't want to see what you're doing. Okay  so don't start yet. Wait for me to get over here and close my eyes. Now Gwen  are you ready  Pick up just one marker  pick up just one marker  and why don't you color in the horse for me  Color in the horse   big  big  big scribbles  broad strokes  don't worry about staying in the lines. All right. Great. And why don't you take that marker and recap it and place it on the table for me. Okay  and pick up another marker out of the cup and take off the cap and color in the donkey for me  color in the donkey. Big scribbles. Okay  cool  and re cap that marker and place it on the table. And pick up another marker for me and take off the cap. Isn't this fun  And color in the owl for me. Color in the owl. Okay  and recap that marker and pick up another marker out of the cup and color in the rooster for me  color in the rooster. Good  good  good  good  good. Big  big  big strokes. Good  good. Pick up another marker out of the cup and color in the ox for me. Color in the ox. Okay  good. A lot of color on that  and recap  and place it on the table  and pick up another marker out of the cup. Oh  I'm out  Okay  I'm going to turn around. Did I forget  Oh  I forgot my purple marker. This is still going to work  though. I think this is still going to work  mostly. So Gwen  I'm going to hand you this envelope. Don't open it yet. Do not open it yet  but I am going to write down your choices so that everybody can see the choices that you made. Okay  great. So we have a cobalt horse  amber owl  a silver ox  yes  okay  a red donkey  and what was the emerald color  A rooster. An emerald rooster. Okay. Now for the moment of truth  Gwen  we're going to take a look in that envelope. Why don't you open it up and remove the one piece of paper from inside and hand it to me  and we will see if it matches your choices. Yes  I think it does. We have a cobalt horse  we have a red donkey  we have an amber owl  we have an emerald rooster  a silver ox  I forgot my purple marker so we have a blank sheep  but that's a pretty amazing coincidence  don't you think  Gwen  well done. That's beautiful.  Applause  I'll take that back from you. So ladies and gentlemen  how is this possible  How is this possible  Well  could it be that Gwen's brain is so wired to solve that she decoded hidden messages  Well this is the puzzle I present to you. Could there be order in the chaos that I created  Let's take a closer look. Do you recall when I showed you these puzzle pieces  What image did it ultimately become  A cobalt horse. The plot thickens. And then we played a game of tangrams with an emerald rooster. That one's my favorite. And then we had an experiment with a silver ox. And Katy Perry drinks her morning coffee out of an amber owl. Thank you  Katy  for taking that photo for me. Oh  and there's one more  there's one more. I believe you colored a red donkey  Gwen. Ladies and gentlemen  could you raise your hands for me if you've read  Don Quixote   Who's read  Don Quixote    Laughter  But wait  but wait  wait  wait  wait  there's more. There's more. Gwen  I was so confident that you were going to make these choices that I made another prediction  and I put it in an even more indelible place  and it's right here. Ladies and gentlemen  we have today's New York Times. The date is March   th      . Many of you in the first couple of rows have it underneath your seats as well. Really dig. We hid them under there. See if you can fish out the newspaper and open up to the arts section and you will find the crossword puzzle  and the crossword puzzle today was written by yours truly. You can see my name above the grid. I'm going to give this to you  Gwen  to take a look. And I will also put it up on the screen. Now let's take a look at another piece of the puzzle. If you look at the first clue for   across  it starts with the letter C  for corrupt  and just below that we have an O  for outfielder  and if you keep reading the first letters of the clues down  you get cobalt horse  amber owl  silver ox  red donkey  and emerald rooster. That's pretty cool  right  It's The New York Times. But wait  wait  wait  wait. Wait. Oh  Gwen  do you recall how I forgot my purple marker  and you were unable to color the sheep  Well  if you keep reading starting with    down  it says   Oh  by the way  the sheep can be left blank.  But wait  wait  wait  there's one more thing  there's one more thing  there's one final piece of the puzzle. Gwen  I am so grateful for your choices because if we take a look at the first letters of your combinations  we get  C H A O S  for chaos and  O R D E R  for order. That's chaos and order. We've all made order out of chaos. So ladies and gentlemen  the next time you find yourself with a puzzle  whether it's in your life or in your work  or maybe it's at the Sunday morning breakfast table with The New York Times  remember  you are all wired to solve. Thank you. Right now you have a movie playing inside your head. It's an amazing multi track movie. It has  D vision and surround sound for what you're seeing and hearing right now  but that's just the start of it. Your movie has smell and taste and touch. It has a sense of your body  pain  hunger  orgasms. It has emotions  anger and happiness. It has memories  like scenes from your childhood playing before you. And it has this constant voiceover narrative in your stream of conscious thinking. At the heart of this movie is you experiencing all this directly. This movie is your stream of consciousness  the subject of experience of the mind and the world. Consciousness is one of the fundamental facts of human existence. Each of us is conscious. We all have our own inner movie  you and you and you. There's nothing we know about more directly. At least  I know about my consciousness directly. I can't be certain that you guys are conscious. Consciousness also is what makes life worth living. If we weren't conscious  nothing in our lives would have meaning or value. But at the same time  it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe. Why are we conscious  Why do we have these inner movies  Why aren't we just robots who process all this input  produce all that output  without experiencing the inner movie at all  Right now  nobody knows the answers to those questions. I'm going to suggest that to integrate consciousness into science  some radical ideas may be needed. Some people say a science of consciousness is impossible. Science  by its nature  is objective. Consciousness  by its nature  is subjective. So there can never be a science of consciousness. For much of the   th century  that view held sway. Psychologists studied behavior objectively  neuroscientists studied the brain objectively  and nobody even mentioned consciousness. Even    years ago  when TED got started  there was very little scientific work on consciousness. Now  about    years ago  all that began to change. Neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Penrose said now is the time for science to attack consciousness. And since then  there's been a real explosion  a flowering of scientific work on consciousness. And this work has been wonderful. It's been great. But it also has some fundamental limitations so far. The centerpiece of the science of consciousness in recent years has been the search for correlations  correlations between certain areas of the brain and certain states of consciousness. We saw some of this kind of work from Nancy Kanwisher and the wonderful work she presented just a few minutes ago. Now we understand much better  for example  the kinds of brain areas that go along with the conscious experience of seeing faces or of feeling pain or of feeling happy. But this is still a science of correlations. It's not a science of explanations. We know that these brain areas go along with certain kinds of conscious experience  but we don't know why they do. I like to put this by saying that this kind of work from neuroscience is answering some of the questions we want answered about consciousness  the questions about what certain brain areas do and what they correlate with. But in a certain sense  those are the easy problems. No knock on the neuroscientists. There are no truly easy problems with consciousness. But it doesn't address the real mystery at the core of this subject  why is it that all that physical processing in a brain should be accompanied by consciousness at all  Why is there this inner subjective movie  Right now  we don't really have a bead on that. And you might say  let's just give neuroscience a few years. It'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon like traffic jams  like hurricanes  like life  and we'll figure it out. The classical cases of emergence are all cases of emergent behavior  how a traffic jam behaves  how a hurricane functions  how a living organism reproduces and adapts and metabolizes  all questions about objective functioning. You could apply that to the human brain in explaining some of the behaviors and the functions of the human brain as emergent phenomena  how we walk  how we talk  how we play chess  all these questions about behavior. But when it comes to consciousness  questions about behavior are among the easy problems. When it comes to the hard problem  that's the question of why is it that all this behavior is accompanied by subjective experience  And here  the standard paradigm of emergence  even the standard paradigms of neuroscience  don't really  so far  have that much to say. Now  I'm a scientific materialist at heart. I want a scientific theory of consciousness that works  and for a long time  I banged my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in purely physical terms that would work. But I eventually came to the conclusion that that just didn't work for systematic reasons. It's a long story  but the core idea is just that what you get from purely reductionist explanations in physical terms  in brain based terms  is stories about the functioning of a system  its structure  its dynamics  the behavior it produces  great for solving the easy problems   how we behave  how we function   but when it comes to subjective experience   why does all this feel like something from the inside    that's something fundamentally new  and it's always a further question. So I think we're at a kind of impasse here. We've got this wonderful  great chain of explanation  we're used to it  where physics explains chemistry  chemistry explains biology  biology explains parts of psychology. But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this picture. On the one hand  it's a datum that we're conscious. On the other hand  we don't know how to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world. So I think consciousness right now is a kind of anomaly  one that we need to integrate into our view of the world  but we don't yet see how. Faced with an anomaly like this  radical ideas may be needed  and I think that we may need one or two ideas that initially seem crazy before we can come to grips with consciousness scientifically. Now  there are a few candidates for what those crazy ideas might be. My friend Dan Dennett  who's here today  has one. His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness. The whole idea of the inner subjective movie involves a kind of illusion or confusion. Actually  all we've got to do is explain the objective functions  the behaviors of the brain  and then we've explained everything that needs to be explained. Well I say  more power to him. That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if you want to have a purely reductionist brain based theory of consciousness. At the same time  for me and for many other people  that view is a bit too close to simply denying the datum of consciousness to be satisfactory. So I go in a different direction. In the time remaining  I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think may have some promise. The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental. Physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental building blocks  space and time and mass. They postulate fundamental laws governing them  like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics. These fundamental properties and laws aren't explained in terms of anything more basic. Rather  they're taken as primitive  and you build up the world from there. Now sometimes  the list of fundamentals expands. In the   th century  Maxwell figured out that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of the existing fundamentals   space  time  mass  Newton's laws   so he postulated fundamental laws of electromagnetism and postulated electric charge as a fundamental element that those laws govern. I think that's the situation we're in with consciousness. If you can't explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundamentals   space  time  mass  charge   then as a matter of logic  you need to expand the list. The natural thing to do is to postulate consciousness itself as something fundamental  a fundamental building block of nature. This doesn't mean you suddenly can't do science with it. This opens up the way for you to do science with it. What we then need is to study the fundamental laws governing consciousness  the laws that connect consciousness to other fundamentals  space  time  mass  physical processes. Physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we could write them on the front of a t shirt. Well I think something like that is the situation we're in with consciousness. We want to find fundamental laws so simple we could write them on the front of a t shirt. We don't know what those laws are yet  but that's what we're after. The second crazy idea is that consciousness might be universal. Every system might have some degree of consciousness. This view is sometimes called panpsychism  pan for all  psych for mind  every system is conscious  not just humans  dogs  mice  flies  but even Rob Knight's microbes  elementary particles. Even a photon has some degree of consciousness. The idea is not that photons are intelligent or thinking. It's not that a photon is wracked with angst because it's thinking   Aww  I'm always buzzing around near the speed of light. I never get to slow down and smell the roses.  No  not like that. But the thought is maybe photons might have some element of raw  subjective feeling  some primitive precursor to consciousness. This may sound a bit kooky to you. I mean  why would anyone think such a crazy thing  Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea  that consciousness is fundamental. If it's fundamental  like space and time and mass  it's natural to suppose that it might be universal too  the way they are. It's also worth noting that although the idea seems counterintuitive to us  it's much less counterintuitive to people from different cultures  where the human mind is seen as much more continuous with nature. A deeper motivation comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness to physical processing is to link consciousness to information. Wherever there's information processing  there's consciousness. Complex information processing  like in a human  complex consciousness. Simple information processing  simple consciousness. A really exciting thing is in recent years a neuroscientist  Giulio Tononi  has taken this kind of theory and developed it rigorously with a mathematical theory. He has a mathematical measure of information integration which he calls phi  measuring the amount of information integrated in a system. And he supposes that phi goes along with consciousness. So in a human brain  incredibly large amount of information integration  high degree of phi  a whole lot of consciousness. In a mouse  medium degree of information integration  still pretty significant  pretty serious amount of consciousness. But as you go down to worms  microbes  particles  the amount of phi falls off. The amount of information integration falls off  but it's still non zero. On Tononi's theory  there's still going to be a non zero degree of consciousness. In effect  he's proposing a fundamental law of consciousness  high phi  high consciousness. Now  I don't know if this theory is right  but it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now in the science of consciousness  and it's been used to integrate a whole range of scientific data  and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough you can write it on the front of a t shirt. Another final motivation is that panpsychism might help us to integrate consciousness into the physical world. Physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract. It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations  but it doesn't tell us about the reality that underlies it. As Stephen Hawking puts it  what puts the fire into the equations  Well  on the panpsychist view  you can leave the equations of physics as they are  but you can take them to be describing the flux of consciousness. That's what physics really is ultimately doing  describing the flux of consciousness. On this view  it's consciousness that puts the fire into the equations. On that view  consciousness doesn't dangle outside the physical world as some kind of extra. It's there right at its heart. This view  I think  the panpsychist view  has the potential to transfigure our relationship to nature  and it may have some pretty serious social and ethical consequences. Some of these may be counterintuitive. I used to think I shouldn't eat anything which is conscious  so therefore I should be vegetarian. Now  if you're a panpsychist and you take that view  you're going to go very hungry. So I think when you think about it  this tends to transfigure your views  whereas what matters for ethical purposes and moral considerations  not so much the fact of consciousness  but the degree and the complexity of consciousness. It's also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems  like computers. What about the artificially intelligent system in the movie  Her   Samantha  Is she conscious  Well  if you take the informational  panpsychist view  she certainly has complicated information processing and integration  so the answer is very likely yes  she is conscious. If that's right  it raises pretty serious ethical issues about both the ethics of developing intelligent computer systems and the ethics of turning them off. Finally  you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups  the planet. Does Canada have its own consciousness  Or at a more local level  does an integrated group like the audience at a TED conference  are we right now having a collective TED consciousness  an inner movie for this collective TED group which is distinct from the inner movies of each of our parts  I don't know the answer to that question  but I think it's at least one worth taking seriously. Okay  so this panpsychist vision  it is a radical one  and I don't know that it's correct. I'm actually more confident about the first crazy idea  that consciousness is fundamental  than about the second one  that it's universal. I mean  the view raises any number of questions  has any number of challenges  like how do those little bits of consciousness add up to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love. If we can answer those questions  then I think we're going to be well on our way to a serious theory of consciousness. If not  well  this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosophy. We can't expect to solve it overnight. But I do think we're going to figure it out eventually. Understanding consciousness is a real key  I think  both to understanding the universe and to understanding ourselves. It may just take the right crazy idea. Thank you. The first time I stood in the operating room and watched a real surgery  I had no idea what to expect. I was a college student in engineering. I thought it was going to be like on TV. Ominous music playing in the background  beads of sweat pouring down the surgeon's face. But it wasn't like that at all. There was music playing on this day  I think it was Madonna's greatest hits.  Laughter  And there was plenty of conversation  not just about the patient's heart rate  but about sports and weekend plans. And since then  the more surgeries I watched  the more I realized this is how it is. In some weird way  it's just another day at the office. But every so often the music gets turned down  everyone stops talking  and stares at exactly the same thing. And that's when you know that something absolutely critical and dangerous is happening. The first time I saw that I was watching a type of surgery called laparoscopic surgery And for those of you who are unfamiliar  laparoscopic surgery  instead of the large open incision you might be used to with surgery  a laparoscopic surgery is where the surgeon creates these three or more small incisions in the patient. And then inserts these long  thin instruments and a camera  and actually does the procedure inside the patient. This is great because there's much less risk of infection  much less pain  shorter recovery time. But there is a trade off  because these incisions are created with a long  pointed device called a trocar. And the way the surgeon uses this device is that he takes it and he presses it into the abdomen until it punctures through. And now the reason why  everyone in the operating room was staring at that device on that day was because he had to be absolutely careful not to plunge it through and puncture it into the organs  and blood vessels below. But this problem should seem  pretty familiar to all of you because I'm pretty sure  you've seen it somewhere else. Remember this  You knew that at any second that straw was going to plunge through  and you didn't know if it was  going to go out the other side and straight into your hand  or if you were going to get juice everywhere  but you were terrified. Right  Every single time you did this  you experienced the same fundamental physics that I was watching in the operating room that day. And it turns out it really is a problem. In       the FDA actually came out and said that trocar incisions might  be the most dangerous step in minimally invasive surgery. Again in       we see a paper that says that trocars account for over half of all major complications in laparoscopic surgery. And  oh by the way  this hasn't changed for    years. So when I got to graduate school  this is what I wanted to work on. I was trying to explain to a friend of mine what exactly I was spending my time doing  and I said   It's like when you're drilling through a wall to hang something in your apartment. There's that moment when the drill first punctures through the wall and there's this plunge. Right  And he looked at me and he said   You mean like when they drill  into people's brains   And I said   Excuse me    Laughter  And then I looked it up and they do drill into people's brains. A lot of neurosurgical procedures actually start with a drill incision through the skull. And if the surgeon isn't careful  he can plunge directly into the brain. So this is the moment when I started thinking  okay  cranial drilling  laparoscopic surgery  why not other areas of medicine  Because think about it  when was the last time you went to the doctor and you didn't get stuck with something  Right  So the truth is in medicine puncture is everywhere. And here are just a couple of the procedures that I've found that involve some tissue puncture step. And if we take just three of them   laparoscopic surgery   epidurals  and cranial drilling   these procedures account  for over        complications every year in this country alone. I call that a problem worth solving. So let's take a look at some of the devices that are used in these types of procedures. I mentioned epidurals. This is an epidural needle. It's used to puncture through  the ligaments in the spine and deliver anesthesia during childbirth. Here's a set of bone marrow biopsy tools. These are actually used to burrow into the bone and collect bone marrow or sample bone lesions. Here's a bayonette from the Civil War. If I had told you it was a  medical puncture device you probably would have believed me. Because what's the difference  So  the more I did this research the more I thought there has to be a better way to do this. And for me the key to this problem is that all these different puncture devices share a common set of fundamental physics. So what are those physics  Let's go back to drilling through a wall. So you're applying a force  on a drill towards the wall. And Newton says the wall is going to apply force back  equal and opposite. So  as you drill through the wall  those forces balance. But then there's that moment when the drill first punctures through the other side of the wall  and right at that moment  the wall can't push back anymore. But your brain hasn't reacted  to that change in force. So for that millisecond  or however long it takes you  to react  you're still pushing  and that unbalanced force  causes an acceleration  and that is the plunge. But what if right at the moment of puncture you could pull that tip back  actually oppose the forward acceleration  That's what I set out to do. So imagine you have a device and it's got some kind of sharp tip  to cut through tissue. What's the simplest way  you could pull that tip back  I chose a spring. So when you extend that spring   you extend that tip out so it's ready to puncture tissue  the spring wants to pull the tip back. How do you keep the tip in place until the moment of puncture  I used this mechanism. When the tip of the device is pressed against tissue  the mechanism expands outwards  and wedges in place against the wall. And the friction that's generated locks it in place and prevents the spring from retracting the tip. But right at the moment of puncture  the tissue can't push back on the tip anymore. So the mechanism unlocks  and the spring retracts the tip. Let me show you that  happening in slow motion. This is about       frames a second  and I'd like you to notice the tip that's right there on the bottom   about to puncture through tissue. And you'll see that  right at the moment of puncture  right there  the mechanism unlocks  and retracts that tip back. I want to show it to you again  a little closer up. You're going to see the sharp bladed tip  and right when it punctures  that rubber membrane it's going to disappear into this white blunt sheath. Right there. That happens within four    ths  of a second after puncture. And because this device is designed to address the physics of puncture and not the specifics of cranial drilling or laparoscopic surgery   or another procedure  it's applicable across these different medical disciplines and across different length scales. But it didn't always look like this. This was my first prototype. Yes  those are popsicle sticks  and there's a rubber band at the top. It took about    minutes to do this  but it worked. And it proved to me that my idea worked and it justified the next couple years of work on this project. I worked on this because this problem really fascinated me. It kept me up at night. But I think it should fascinate you too  because I said puncture is everywhere. That means at some point  it's going to be your problem too. That first day in the operating room I never expected to find myself  on the other end of a trocar. But last year  I got appendicitis  when I was visiting Greece. So I was in the hospital in Athens  and the surgeon was telling me he was going to perform  a laparoscopic surgery. He was going to remove my appendix  through these tiny incisions  and he was talking about what I could expect for the recovery  and what was going to happen. He said   Do you have any questions   And I said   Just one  doc. What kind of trocar do you use   So my favorite quote  about laparoscopic surgery comes from a Doctor H. C. Jacobaeus   It is puncture itself that causes risk.  That's my favorite quote  because H.C. Jacobaeus was the first person to ever perform  laparoscopic surgery on humans  and he wrote that in     . This is a problem that's been injuring and even killing people for over     years. So it's easy to think that for every major problem out there there's some team of experts  working around the clock to solve it. The truth is that's not always the case. We have to be better at finding those problems and finding ways to solve them. So if you come across a problem that grabs you  let it keep you up at night. Allow yourself to be fascinated  because there are so many lives to save. I was born in Taiwan. I grew up surrounded by different types of hardware stores  and I like going to night markets. I love the energy of the night markets  the colors  the lights  the toys  and all the unexpected things I find every time I go  things like watermelon with straw antennas or puppies with mohawks. When I was growing up  I liked taking toys apart  any kind of toys I'd find around the house  like my brother's BB gun when he's not home. I also liked to make environments for people to explore and play. In these early installations  I would take plastic sheets  plastic bags  and things I would find in the hardware store or around the house. I would take things like highlighter pen  mix it with water  pump it through plastic tubing  creating these glowing circulatory systems for people to walk through and enjoy. I like these materials because of the way they look  the way they feel  and they're very affordable. I also liked to make devices that work with body parts. I would take camera LED lights and a bungee cord and strap it on my waist and I would videotape my belly button  get a different perspective  and see what it does. I also like to modify household appliances. This is an automatic night light. Some of you might have them at home. I would cut out the light sensor  add an extension line  and use modeling clay  stick it onto the television  and then I would videotape my eye  and using the dark part of my eye tricking the sensor into thinking it's night time  so you turn on the lightbulb. The white of the eye and the eyelid will trick the sensor into thinking it's daytime  and it will shut off the light. I wanted to collect more different types of eyes  so I built this device using bicycle helmets  some lightbulbs and television sets. It would be easier for other people to wear the helmet and record their eyes. This device allows me to symbolically extract other people's eyes  so I have a diversity of eyes to use for my other sculptures. This sculpture has four eyes. Each eye is controlling a different device. This eye is turning itself around in a television. This eye is inflating a plastic tube. This eye is watching a video of another piece being made. And these two eyes are activating glowing water. Many of these pieces are later on shown in museums  biennials  triennial exhibitions around the world. I love science and biology. In       I was doing a research fellowship at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum looking at bioluminous organisms in the oean. I love these creatures. I love the way they look  the way they feel. They're soft  they're slimy  and I was fascinated by the way they use light in their environment  either to attract mates  for self defense  or to attract food. This research inspired my work in many different ways  things like movement or different light patterns. So I started gathering a lot of different types of material in my studio and just experimenting and trying this out  trying that out  and seeing what types of creatures I can come up with. I used a lot of computer cooling fans and just kind of put them together and see what happens. This is an       square foot installation composed of many different creatures  some hanging from the ceiling and some resting on the floor. From afar  they look alien like  but when you look closer  they're all made out of black garbage bags or Tupperware containers. I'd like to share with you how ordinary things can become something magical and wondrous. Thank you. I'd like to introduce you to an organism  a slime mold  Physarum polycephalum. It's a mold with an identity crisis  because it's not a mold  so let's get that straight to start with. It is one of     known slime molds belonging to the kingdom of the amoeba. It is a single celled organism  a cell  that joins together with other cells to form a mass super cell to maximize its resources. So within a slime mold you might find thousands or millions of nuclei  all sharing a cell wall  all operating as one entity. In its natural habitat  you might find the slime mold foraging in woodlands  eating rotting vegetation  but you might equally find it in research laboratories  classrooms  and even artists' studios. I first came across the slime mold about five years ago. A microbiologist friend of mine gave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it and told me to go home and play with it. The only instructions I was given  that it likes it dark and damp and its favorite food is porridge oats. I'm an artist who's worked for many years with biology  with scientific processes  so living material is not uncommon for me. I've worked with plants  bacteria  cuttlefish  fruit flies. So I was keen to get my new collaborator home to see what it could do. So I took it home and I watched. I fed it a varied diet. I observed as it networked. It formed a connection between food sources. I watched it leave a trail behind it  indicating where it had been. And I noticed that when it was fed up with one petri dish  it would escape and find a better home. I captured my observations through time lapse photography. Slime mold grows at about one centimeter an hour  so it's not really ideal for live viewing unless there's some form of really extreme meditation  but through the time lapse  I could observe some really interesting behaviors. For instance  having fed on a nice pile of oats  the slime mold goes off to explore new territories in different directions simultaneously. When it meets itself  it knows it's already there  it recognizes it's there  and instead retreats back and grows in other directions. I was quite impressed by this feat  at how what was essentially just a bag of cellular slime could somehow map its territory  know itself  and move with seeming intention. I found countless scientific studies  research papers  journal articles  all citing incredible work with this one organism  and I'm going to share a few of those with you. For example  a team in Hokkaido University in Japan filled a maze with slime mold. It joined together and formed a mass cell. They introduced food at two points  oats of course  and it formed a connection between the food. It retracted from empty areas and dead ends. There are four possible routes through this maze  yet time and time again  the slime mold established the shortest and the most efficient route. Quite clever. The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold had a primitive form of intelligence. Another study exposed cold air at regular intervals to the slime mold. It didn't like it. It doesn't like it cold. It doesn't like it dry. They did this at repeat intervals  and each time  the slime mold slowed down its growth in response. However  at the next interval  the researchers didn't put the cold air on  yet the slime mold slowed down in anticipation of it happening. It somehow knew that it was about the time for the cold air that it didn't like. The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold was able to learn. A third experiment  the slime mold was invited to explore a territory covered in oats. It fans out in a branching pattern. As it goes  each food node it finds  it forms a network  a connection to  and keeps foraging. After    hours  it established quite a firm network between the different oats. Now there's nothing remarkable in this until you learn that the center oat that it started from represents the city of Tokyo  and the surrounding oats are suburban railway stations. The slime mold had replicated the Tokyo transport network    Laughter    a complex system developed over time by community dwellings  civil engineering  urban planning. What had taken us well over     years took the slime mold just over a day. The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold can form efficient networks and solve the traveling salesman problem. It is a biological computer. As such  it has been mathematically modeled  algorithmically analyzed. It's been sonified  replicated  simulated. World over  teams of researchers are decoding its biological principles to understand its computational rules and applying that learning to the fields of electronics  programming and robotics. So the question is  how does this thing work  It doesn't have a central nervous system. It doesn't have a brain  yet it can perform behaviors that we associate with brain function. It can learn  it can remember  it can solve problems  it can make decisions. So where does that intelligence lie  So this is a microscopy  a video I shot  and it's about     times magnification  sped up about    times  and inside the slime mold  there is a rhythmic pulsing flow  a vein like structure carrying cellular material  nutrients and chemical information through the cell  streaming first in one direction and then back in another. And it is this continuous  synchronous oscillation within the cell that allows it to form quite a complex understanding of its environment  but without any large scale control center. This is where its intelligence lies. So it's not just academic researchers in universities that are interested in this organism. A few years ago  I set up SliMoCo  the Slime Mould Collective. It's an online  open  democratic network for slime mold researchers and enthusiasts to share knowledge and experimentation across disciplinary divides and across academic divides. The Slime Mould Collective membership is self selecting. People have found the collective as the slime mold finds the oats. And it comprises of scientists and computer scientists and researchers but also artists like me  architects  designers  writers  activists  you name it. It's a very interesting  eclectic membership. Just a few examples  an artist who paints with fluorescent Physarum  a collaborative team who are combining biological and electronic design with  D printing technologies in a workshop  another artist who is using the slime mold as a way of engaging a community to map their area. Here  the slime mold is being used directly as a biological tool  but metaphorically as a symbol for ways of talking about social cohesion  communication and cooperation. Other public engagement activities  I run lots of slime mold workshops  a creative way of engaging with the organism. So people are invited to come and learn about what amazing things it can do  and they design their own petri dish experiment  an environment for the slime mold to navigate so they can test its properties. Everybody takes home a new pet and is invited to post their results on the Slime Mould Collective. And the collective has enabled me to form collaborations with a whole array of interesting people. I've been working with filmmakers on a feature length slime mold documentary  and I stress feature length  which is in the final stages of edit and will be hitting your cinema screens very soon. It's also enabled me to conduct what I think is the world's first human slime mold experiment. This is part of an exhibition in Rotterdam last year. We invited people to become slime mold for half an hour. So we essentially tied people together so they were a giant cell  and invited them to follow slime mold rules. You have to communicate through oscillations  no speaking. You have to operate as one entity  one mass cell  no egos  and the motivation for moving and then exploring the environment is in search of food. So a chaotic shuffle ensued as this bunch of strangers tied together with yellow ropes wearing  Being Slime Mold  t shirts wandered through the museum park. When they met trees  they had to reshape their connections and reform as a mass cell through not speaking. This is a ludicrous experiment in many  many ways. This isn't hypothesis driven. We're not trying to prove  demonstrate anything. But what it did provide us was a way of engaging a broad section of the public with ideas of intelligence  agency  autonomy  and provide a playful platform for discussions about the things that ensued. One of the most exciting things about this experiment was the conversation that happened afterwards. An entirely spontaneous symposium happened in the park. People talked about the human psychology  of how difficult it was to let go of their individual personalities and egos. Other people talked about bacterial communication. Each person brought in their own individual interpretation  and our conclusion from this experiment was that the people of Rotterdam were highly cooperative  especially when given beer. We didn't just give them oats. We gave them beer as well. But they weren't as efficient as the slime mold  and the slime mold  for me  is a fascinating subject matter. It's biologically fascinating  it's computationally interesting  but it's also a symbol  a way of engaging with ideas of community  collective behavior  cooperation. A lot of my work draws on the scientific research  so this pays homage to the maze experiment but in a different way. And the slime mold is also my working material. It's a coproducer of photographs  prints  animations  participatory events. Whilst the slime mold doesn't choose to work with me  exactly  it is a collaboration of sorts. I can predict certain behaviors by understanding how it operates  but I can't control it. The slime mold has the final say in the creative process. And after all  it has its own internal aesthetics. These branching patterns that we see we see across all forms  scales of nature  from river deltas to lightning strikes  from our own blood vessels to neural networks. There's clearly significant rules at play in this simple yet complex organism  and no matter what our disciplinary perspective or our mode of inquiry  there's a great deal that we can learn from observing and engaging with this beautiful  brainless blob.
