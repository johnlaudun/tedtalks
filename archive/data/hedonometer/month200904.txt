I started with paragliding. Paragliding is taking off from mountains with a paraglider  with the possibility to fly cross country  distance  just with the use of thermals to soar. Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider. From there I started with skydiving. In this picture you can see there is a four way skydive  four people flying together  and on the left hand side it's the camera flier with the camera mounted to his helmet so he can film the whole jump  for the film itself and also for the judging. From regular  relative skydiving I went on to freeflying. Freeflying is more the three dimensional skydiving. You can see the skydiver with the red suit  he's in a stand up position. The one with the yellow green suit  he's flying head down. And that's me in the background  carving around the whole formation in freefall also  with the helmet cam to film this jump. From freeflying I went on to skysurfing. Skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet. You can imagine with this big surface of a skysurfing board  there is a lot of force  a lot of power. Of course I can use this power for example for nice spinning    we call it  helicopter moves.  From there I went on to wingsuit flying. Wingsuit flying is a suit  that I can make fly  just only with my body. If I put some tension on my body  tension on my suit  I can make it fly. And as you see the fall rate is much much slower because of the bigger surface. With a proper body position I'm able to really move forward to gain quite some distance. This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro. You can see the Copacabana on the left hand side. From there with all the skills and knowledge from paragliding and all the different disciplines in skydiving  I went on to BASE jumping. BASE jumping is skydiving from fixed objects  like buildings  antennae  bridges and earth    meaning mountains  cliffs. It's for sure    for me    it's the ultimate feeling of being in free fall  with all the visual references. So my goal soon was to discover new places that nobody had jumped before. So in summer      I was the first to BASE jump the Eiger North Face in Switzerland. Two years after this  I was the first to BASE jump from Matterhorn  a very famous mountain that probably everybody knows in here.      I did a BASE jump from the Eiger  from the Monk and from the Jungfrau  three very famous mountains in Switzerland. The special thing on these three jumps were  I hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day. In      I jumped the Eiffel Tower in Paris. So with all this knowledge  I also wanted to get into stunts. So with some friends we started to do different tricks  like for example this jump here  I jumped from a paraglider. Or here    everybody was freezing  pretty much  except me  because it was very cold in Austria where we did this filming. Everybody sitting in a basket  and I was on top of the balloon  ready to slide down with my skysurf board. Or this jump  from a moving truck on the highway. Extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step  if you really work hard on your skills and on your knowledge. Of course you need to be in physical  very good  condition  so I'm training a lot. You need to have the best possible equipment. And probably the most important is you have to work on your mental skills  mental preparation. And all this to come as close as possible to the human dream of being able to fly. So for       I'm training hard for my two new projects. The first one  I want to set a world record in flying from a cliff with my wingsuit. And I want to set a new record  with the longest distance ever flown. For my second project  I have a sensational idea of a jump that never has been done before. So now  on the following movie you will see that I'm much better in flying a wingsuit than speaking in English. Enjoy  and thank you very much. June Cohen  I have some questions. I think we all might have some questions. Question one  so does that actually feel the way the flying dream does  Because it looks like it might. Ueli Gegenschatz  Pretty much. I believe this is probably the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly. JC  I know the answer to this  but how do you land  UE  Parachute. We have to open a parachute just seconds before  I would say  impact. It's not possible to land a wingsuit yet. JC  Yet. But people are trying. Are you among those    you're not going to commit    are you among those trying to do it  UE  It's a dream. It's a dream. Yeah. We're still working on it and we're developing the wingsuits to get better performance  to get more knowledge. And I believe soon. JC  All right. Well we will watch this space. But I have two more questions. What is the    there was exhaust coming out of the back of the wingsuit. Was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing  UE  Nope. It's just smoke. JC  Coming off of you  UE  Hopefully not. JC  That seems dangerous. UE  No  smoke is for two reasons  you can see the speed  you can see the way where I was flying. That's reason number one. And reason number two  it's much easier for the camera guy to film If I'm using smoke. JC  Ah  I see. So the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke so that you can be tracked. One more question. What do you do to to cover your face  Because I just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards. Are you in a helmet  Are you in goggles  UE  The purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles. JC  And is that how you usually fly  UE  Usually I'm wearing a helmet. In the mountains I'm always wearing a helmet because of landings    usually it's difficult    it's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings. So you have to be prepared. JC  Right. Now is there anything you don't do  Do people come to you with projects and say   We want you to do this   and do you ever say   No  no I'm not going to.  UE  Oh of course  of course. Some people have crazy ideas and    JC  ...a round of applause... UE  Thank you very much. I was asked by Wilsonart International  a plastic laminate company  which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world    they asked me to design a trade show booth for exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York  in     . So looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design  interiors and furniture  we came up with the solution of taking an old Airstream trailer and gutting it  and trying to portray laminate  and a trailer  in kind of a fresh  new contemporary look. When this trailer showed up at my shop in Berkeley  I'd actually never stepped foot in an Airstream trailer  or any other trailer. So I can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if I can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion. I decided I had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of Airstream. What I discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces. In that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight  modern  futuristic  high tech pod for hurtling down the freeway  and the interiors were completely out of sync with that. In fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin. That seemed really like a crisis to me  that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape  and about travel  and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell. We really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an Airstream trailer  and what feels like it has true purpose and utility. We stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell. We took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing. I literally drew on the walls of the trailer  mocked it up in cardboard  we'd come in and cut  decide things were wrong  pull it out  put it back in. The main goal was to smooth out the interior  and begin to speak about motion  and mobility  and independence. The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer. There's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together  where you can change materials and shapes. So that became a challenge. Compounding that  the material of choice  laminate  that I was trying to highlight  only bends in two dimensions. It's a compound curve interior. What I had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell. What I came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell. And what I was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space  so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way  and that the casework wouldn't break up the space. They also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin  so they function as an electrical chase. That's the trailer  pretty much finished. That trailer led to another commission  to participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block. Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo  in October. Teruo Kurosaki  who owns a furniture company called Idee  he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo. He said one he would like to make a real trailer  functioning  and we would sell that one. Trailer number two  you have a blank slate  you can to anything you want. We came up with a fantasy scenario of a DJ traveling around the States  that would collect records and go on tours. This trailer housed two turntables  mixer  wet bar  fridge  integrated sound system. It's got a huge couch  fits quite a few people  and basically we'd had a great time with this. And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel  and escape  in an idiosyncratic sense. A lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for Airstream. This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream. They came to me and said   Well  what can we do to freshen this thing up  And do you think kids  you know  skateboarders  surfers  rock climbers  would use these things   And I said   Well  not in that interior.  Anyway  I went out to Airstream about six times during the process of building this prototype  and it's called the Bambi prototype. I thought   Finally  oh yeah great  big company  I'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding.  And I walked in their prototype facility  and it's exactly like my shop  only bigger    same tools  same things. So the problem became    and they set this dilemma to me    that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology  and there's no money for tooling or molding. The trailers themselves are actually hand built. All the casework is hand scribed in  uniquely  so you can't just cut     parts for     trailers  you have to cut them big  and every single one is hand fit. They didn't want to go to a componentized system. And there it is  that's the Bambi   . I thought I'd begin with a scene of war. There was little to warn of the danger ahead. The Iraqi insurgent had placed the IED  an Improvised Explosive Device  along the side of the road with great care. By       there were more than       of these attacks every single month  and they were the leading cause of casualties among American soldiers and Iraqi civilians. The team that was hunting for this IED is called an EOD team  Explosives Ordinance Disposal and they're the pointy end of the spear in the American effort to suppress these roadside bombs. Each EOD team goes out on about     of these bomb calls every year  defusing about two bombs a day. Perhaps the best sign of how valuable they are to the war effort  is that the Iraqi insurgents put a         bounty on the head of a single EOD soldier. Unfortunately  this particular call would not end well. By the time the soldier advanced close enough to see the telltale wires of the bomb  it exploded in a wave of flame. Now  depending how close you are and how much explosive has been packed into that bomb  it can cause death or injury. You have to be as far as    yards away to escape that. The blast is so strong it can even break your limbs  even if you're not hit. That soldier had been on top of the bomb. And so when the rest of the team advanced they found little left. And that night the unit's commander did a sad duty  and he wrote a condolence letter back to the United States  and he talked about how hard the loss had been on his unit  about the fact that they had lost their bravest soldier  a soldier who had saved their lives many a time. And he apologized for not being able to bring them home. But then he talked up the silver lining that he took away from the loss.  At least   as he wrote   when a robot dies  you don't have to write a letter to its mother.  That scene sounds like science fiction  but is battlefield reality already. The soldier in that case was a    pound robot called a PackBot. The chief's letter went  not to some farmhouse in Iowa like you see in the old war movies  but went to the iRobot Company  which is named after the Asimov novel and the not so great Will Smith movie  and... um...  Laughter ... if you remember that in that fictional world  robots started out carrying out mundane chores  and then they started taking on life and death decisions. That's a reality we face today. What we're going to do is actually just flash a series of photos behind me that show you the reality of robots used in war right now or already at the prototype stage. It's just to give you a taste. Another way of putting it is you're not going to see anything that's powered by Vulcan technology  or teenage wizard hormones or anything like that. This is all real. So why don't we go ahead and start those pictures. Something big is going on in war today  and maybe even the history of humanity itself. The U.S. military went into Iraq with a handful of drones in the air. We now have      . We went in with zero unmanned ground systems. We now have       . And the tech term  killer application  takes on new meaning in this space. And we need to remember that we're talking about the Model T Fords  the Wright Flyers  compared to what's coming soon. That's where we're at right now. One of the people that I recently met with was an Air Force three star general  and he said basically  where we're headed very soon is tens of thousands of robots operating in our conflicts  and these numbers matter  because we're not just talking about tens of thousands of today's robots  but tens of thousands of these prototypes and tomorrow's robots  because of course  one of the things that's operating in technology is Moore's Law  that you can pack in more and more computing power into those robots  and so flash forward around    years  if Moore's Law holds true  those robots will be close to a billion times more powerful in their computing than today. And so what that means is the kind of things that we used to only talk about at science fiction conventions like Comic Con have to be talked about in the halls of power and places like the Pentagon. A robots revolution is upon us. Now  I need to be clear here. I'm not talking about a revolution where you have to worry about the Governor of California showing up at your door  a la the Terminator.  Laughter  When historians look at this period  they're going to conclude that we're in a different type of revolution  a revolution in war  like the invention of the atomic bomb. But it may be even bigger than that  because our unmanned systems don't just affect the  how  of war fighting  they affect the  who  of fighting at its most fundamental level. That is  every previous revolution in war  be it the machine gun  be it the atomic bomb  was about a system that either shot faster  went further  had a bigger boom. That's certainly the case with robotics  but they also change the experience of the warrior and even the very identity of the warrior. Another way of putting this is that mankind's       year old monopoly on the fighting of war is breaking down in our very lifetime. I've spent the last several years going around meeting with all the players in this field  from the robot scientists to the science fiction authors who inspired them to the    year old drone pilots who are fighting from Nevada  to the four star generals who command them  to even the Iraqi insurgents who they are targeting and what they think about our systems  and what I found interesting is not just their stories  but how their experiences point to these ripple effects that are going outwards in our society  in our law and our ethics  etc. And so what I'd like to do with my remaining time is basically flesh out a couple of these. So the first is that the future of war  even a robotics one  is not going to be purely an American one. The U.S. is currently ahead in military robotics right now  but we know that in technology there's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage. In a quick show of hands  how many people in this room still use Wang Computers   Laughter  It's the same thing in war. The British and the French invented the tank. The Germans figured out how to use it right  and so what we have to think about for the U.S. is that we are ahead right now  but you have    other countries out there working on military robotics  and they include all the interesting countries like Russia  China  Pakistan  Iran. And this raises a bigger worry for me. How do we move forward in this revolution given the state of our manufacturing and the state of our science and mathematics training in our schools  Or another way of thinking about this is  what does it mean to go to war increasingly with soldiers whose hardware is made in China and software is written in India  But just as software has gone open source  so has warfare. Unlike an aircraft carrier or an atomic bomb  you don't need a massive manufacturing system to build robotics. A lot of it is off the shelf. A lot of it's even do it yourself. One of those things you just saw flashed before you was a raven drone  the handheld tossed one. For about a thousand dollars  you can build one yourself  equivalent to what the soldiers use in Iraq. That raises another wrinkle when it comes to war and conflict. Good guys might play around and work on these as hobby kits  but so might bad guys. This cross between robotics and things like terrorism is going to be fascinating and even disturbing  and we've already seen it start. During the war between Israel  a state  and Hezbollah  a non state actor  the non state actor flew four different drones against Israel. There's already a jihadi website that you can go on and remotely detonate an IED in Iraq while sitting at your home computer. And so I think what we're going to see is two trends take place with this. First is  you're going to reinforce the power of individuals against governments  but then the second is that we are going to see an expansion in the realm of terrorism. The future of it may be a cross between al Qaeda  .  and the next generation of the Unabomber. And another way of thinking about this is the fact that  remember  you don't have to convince a robot that they're gonna receive    virgins after they die to convince them to blow themselves up. But the ripple effects of this are going to go out into our politics. One of the people that I met with was a former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Ronald Reagan  and he put it this way   I like these systems because they save American lives  but I worry about more marketization of wars  more shock and awe talk  to defray discussion of the costs. People are more likely to support the use of force if they view it as costless.  Robots for me take certain trends that are already in play in our body politic  and maybe take them to their logical ending point. We don't have a draft. We don't have declarations of war anymore. We don't buy war bonds anymore. And now we have the fact that we're converting more and more of our American soldiers that we would send into harm's way into machines  and so we may take those already lowering bars to war and drop them to the ground. But the future of war is also going to be a YouTube war. That is  our new technologies don't merely remove humans from risk. They also record everything that they see. So they don't just delink the public  they reshape its relationship with war. There's already several thousand video clips of combat footage from Iraq on YouTube right now  most of it gathered by drones. Now  this could be a good thing. It could be building connections between the home front and the war front as never before. But remember  this is taking place in our strange  weird world  and so inevitably the ability to download these video clips to  you know  your iPod or your Zune gives you the ability to turn it into entertainment. Soldiers have a name for these clips. They call it war porn. The typical one that I was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a Predator strike taking out an enemy site. Missile hits  bodies burst into the air with the explosion. It was set to music. It was set to the pop song  I Just Want To Fly  by Sugar Ray. This ability to watch more but experience less creates a wrinkle in the public's relationship with war. I think about this with a sports parallel. It's like the difference between watching an NBA game  a professional basketball game on TV  where the athletes are tiny figures on the screen  and being at that basketball game in person and realizing what someone seven feet really does look like. But we have to remember  these are just the clips. These are just the ESPN SportsCenter version of the game. They lose the context. They lose the strategy. They lose the humanity. War just becomes slam dunks and smart bombs. Now the irony of all this is that while the future of war may involve more and more machines  it's our human psychology that's driving all of this  it's our human failings that are leading to these wars. So one example of this that has big resonance in the policy realm is how this plays out on our very real war of ideas that we're fighting against radical groups. What is the message that we think we are sending with these machines versus what is being received in terms of the message. So one of the people that I met was a senior Bush Administration official  who had this to say about our unmanning of war   It plays to our strength. The thing that scares people is our technology.  But when you go out and meet with people  for example in Lebanon  it's a very different story. One of the people I met with there was a news editor  and we're talking as a drone is flying above him  and this is what he had to say.  This is just another sign of the coldhearted cruel Israelis and Americans  who are cowards because they send out machines to fight us. They don't want to fight us like real men  but they're afraid to fight  so we just have to kill a few of their soldiers to defeat them.  The future of war also is featuring a new type of warrior  and it's actually redefining the experience of going to war. You can call this a cubicle warrior. This is what one Predator drone pilot described of his experience fighting in the Iraq War while never leaving Nevada.  You're going to war for    hours  shooting weapons at targets  directing kills on enemy combatants  and then you get in the car and you drive home and within    minutes  you're sitting at the dinner table talking to your kids about their homework.  Now  the psychological balancing of those experiences is incredibly tough  and in fact those drone pilots have higher rates of PTSD than many of the units physically in Iraq. But some have worries that this disconnection will lead to something else  that it might make the contemplation of war crimes a lot easier when you have this distance.  It's like a video game   is what one young pilot described to me of taking out enemy troops from afar. As anyone who's played Grand Theft Auto knows  we do things in the video world that we wouldn't do face to face. So much of what you're hearing from me is that there's another side to technologic revolutions  and that it's shaping our present and maybe will shape our future of war. Moore's Law is operative  but so's Murphy's Law. The fog of war isn't being lifted. The enemy has a vote. We're gaining incredible new capabilities  but we're also seeing and experiencing new human dilemmas. Now  sometimes these are just  oops  moments  which is what the head of a robotics company described it  you just have  oops  moments. Well  what are  oops  moments with robots in war  Well  sometimes they're funny. Sometimes  they're like that scene from the Eddie Murphy movie  Best Defense   playing out in reality  where they tested out a machine gun armed robot  and during the demonstration it started spinning in a circle and pointed its machine gun at the reviewing stand of VIPs. Fortunately the weapon wasn't loaded and no one was hurt  but other times  oops  moments are tragic  such as last year in South Africa  where an anti aircraft cannon had a  software glitch   and actually did turn on and fired  and nine soldiers were killed. We have new wrinkles in the laws of war and accountability. What do we do with things like unmanned slaughter  What is unmanned slaughter  We've already had three instances of Predator drone strikes where we thought we got bin Laden  and it turned out not to be the case. And this is where we're at right now. This is not even talking about armed  autonomous systems with full authority to use force. And do not believe that that isn't coming. During my research I came across four different Pentagon projects on different aspects of that. And so you have this question  what does this lead to issues like war crimes  Robots are emotionless  so they don't get upset if their buddy is killed. They don't commit crimes of rage and revenge. But robots are emotionless. They see an    year old grandmother in a wheelchair the same way they see a T    tank  they're both just a series of zeroes and ones. And so we have this question to figure out  How do we catch up our   th century laws of war  that are so old right now that they could qualify for Medicare  to these   st century technologies  And so  in conclusion  I've talked about what seems the future of war  but notice that I've only used real world examples and you've only seen real world pictures and videos. And so this sets a great challenge for all of us that we have to worry about well before you have to worry about your Roomba sucking the life away from you. Are we going to let the fact that what's unveiling itself right now in war sounds like science fiction and therefore keeps us in denial  Are we going to face the reality of   st century war  Is our generation going to make the same mistake that a past generation did with atomic weaponry  and not deal with the issues that surround it until Pandora's box is already opened up  Now  I could be wrong on this  and one Pentagon robot scientist told me that I was. He said   There's no real social  ethical  moral issues when it comes to robots. That is   he added   unless the machine kills the wrong people repeatedly. Then it's just a product recall issue.  And so the ending point for this is that actually  we can turn to Hollywood. A few years ago  Hollywood gathered all the top characters and created a list of the top     heroes and top     villains of all of Hollywood history  the characters that represented the best and worst of humanity. Only one character made it onto both lists  The Terminator  a robot killing machine. And so that points to the fact that our machines can be used for both good and evil  but for me it points to the fact that there's a duality of humans as well. This week is a celebration of our creativity. Our creativity has taken our species to the stars. Our creativity has created works of arts and literature to express our love. And now  we're using our creativity in a certain direction  to build fantastic machines with incredible capabilities  maybe even one day an entirely new species. But one of the main reasons that we're doing that is because of our drive to destroy each other  and so the question we all should ask  is it our machines  or is it us that's wired for war  Thank you.  Applause  One thing I wanted to say about film making is    about this film    in thinking about some of the wonderful talks we've heard here  Michael Moschen  and some of the talks about music  this idea that there is a narrative line  and that music exists in time. A film also exists in time  it's an experience that you should go through emotionally. And in making this film I felt that so many of the documentaries I've seen were all about learning something  or knowledge  or driven by talking heads  and driven by ideas. And I wanted this film to be driven by emotions  and really to follow my journey. So instead of doing the talking head thing  instead it's composed of scenes  and we meet people along the way. We only meet them once. They don't come back several times  so it really chronicles a journey. It's something like life  that once you get in it you can't get out. There are two clips I want to show you  the first one is a kind of hodgepodge  its just three little moments  four little moments with three of the people who are here tonight. It's not the way they occur in the film  because they are part of much larger scenes. They play off each other in a wonderful way. And that ends with a little clip of my father  of Lou  talking about something that is very dear to him  which is the accidents of life. I think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental  and perhaps not planned at all. And those three clips will be followed by a scene of perhaps what  to me  is really his greatest building which is a building in Dhaka  Bangladesh. He built the capital over there. And I think you'll enjoy this building  it's never been seen    it's been still photographed  but never photographed by a film crew. We were the first film crew in there. So you'll see images of this remarkable building. A couple of things to keep in mind when you see it  it was built entirely by hand  I think they got a crane the last year. It was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding  people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads  dumping them in the forms. It is the capital of the country  and it took    years to build  which is something they seem to be very proud of over there. It took as long as the Taj Mahal. Unfortunately it took so long that Lou never saw it finished. He died in     . The building was finished in     . So it continued on for many years after he died. Think about that when you see that building  that sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished. And that really struck me about my father  in the sense that he had such belief that somehow  doing these things giving in the way that he gave  that something good would come out of it  even in the middle of a war  there was a war with Pakistan at one point  and the construction stopped totally and he kept working  because he felt   Well when the war is done they'll need this building.  So  those are the two clips I'm going to show. Roll that tape. Richard Saul Wurman  I remember hearing him talk at Penn. And I came home and I said to my father and mother   I just met this man  doesn't have much work  and he's sort of ugly  funny voice  and he's a teacher at school. I know you've never heard of him  but just mark this day that someday you will hear of him  because he's really an amazing man.  Frank Gehry  I heard he had some kind of a fling with Ingrid Bergman. Is that true  Nathaniel Kahn  If he did he was a very lucky man. NK  Did you hear that  really  FG  Yeah  when he was in Rome. Moshe Safdie  He was a real nomad. And you know  when I knew him when I was in the office  he would come in from a trip  and he would be in the office for two or three days intensely  and he would pack up and go. You know he'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him. I mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station  it was so consistent with his life  you know  I mean I often think I'm going to die in a plane  or I'm going to die in an airport  or die jogging without an identification on me. I don't know why I sort of carry that from that memory of the way he died. But he was a sort of a nomad at heart. Louis Kahn  How accidental our existences are really and how full of influence by circumstance. Man  We are the morning workers who come  all the time  here and enjoy the walking  city's beauty and the atmosphere and this is the nicest place of Bangladesh. We are proud of it. NK  You're proud of it  Man  Yes  it is the national image of Bangladesh. NK  Do you know anything about the architect  Man  Architect  I've heard about him  he's a top ranking architect. NK  Well actually I'm here because I'm the architect's son  he was my father. Man  Oh  Dad is Louis Farrakhan  NK  Yeah. No not Louis Farrakhan  Louis Kahn. Man  Louis Kahn  yes  Man  Your father  is he alive  NK  No  he's been dead for    years. Man  Very pleased to welcome you back. NK  Thank you. NK  He never saw it finished  Pop. No  he never saw this. Shamsul Wares  It was almost impossible  building for a country like ours. In        years back  it was nothing  only paddy fields  and since we invited him here  he felt that he has got a responsibility. He wanted to be a Moses here  he gave us democracy. He is not a political man  but in this guise he has given us the institution for democracy  from where we can rise. In that way it is so relevant. He didn't care for how much money this country has  or whether he would be able to ever finish this building  but somehow he has been able to do it  build it  here. And this is the largest project he has got in here  the poorest country in the world. NK  It cost him his life. SW  Yeah  he paid. He paid his life for this  and that is why he is great and we'll remember him. But he was also human. Now his failure to satisfy the family life  is an inevitable association of great people. But I think his son will understand this  and will have no sense of grudge  or sense of being neglected  I think. He cared in a very different manner  but it takes a lot of time to understand that. In social aspect of his life he was just like a child  he was not at all matured. He could not say no to anything  and that is why  that he cannot say no to things  we got this building today. You see  only that way you can be able to understand him. There is no other shortcut  no other way to really understand him. But I think he has given us this building and we feel all the time for him  that's why  he has given love for us. He could not probably give the right kind of love for you  but for us  he has given the people the right kind of love  that is important. You have to understand that. He had an enormous amount of love  he loved everybody. To love everybody  he sometimes did not see the very closest ones  and that is inevitable for men of his stature. What I'm going to try to do is explain to you quickly how to predict  and illustrate it with some predictions about what Iran is going to do in the next couple of years. In order to predict effectively  we need to use science. And the reason that we need to use science is because then we can reproduce what we're doing  it's not just wisdom or guesswork. And if we can predict  then we can engineer the future. So if you are concerned to influence energy policy  or you are concerned to influence national security policy  or health policy  or education  science    and a particular branch of science    is a way to do it  not the way we've been doing it  which is seat of the pants wisdom. Now before I get into how to do it let me give you a little truth in advertising  because I'm not engaged in the business of magic. There are lots of thing that the approach I take can predict  and there are some that it can't. It can predict complex negotiations or situations involving coercion    that is in essence everything that has to do with politics  much of what has to do with business  but sorry  if you're looking to speculate in the stock market  I don't predict stock markets    OK  it's not going up any time really soon. But I'm not engaged in doing that. I'm not engaged in predicting random number generators. I actually get phone calls from people who want to know what lottery numbers are going to win. I don't have a clue. I engage in the use of game theory  game theory is a branch of mathematics and that means  sorry  that even in the study of politics  math has come into the picture. We can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics  we need to look at this in a rigorous way. Now  what is game theory about  It assumes that people are looking out for what's good for them. That doesn't seem terribly shocking    although it's controversial for a lot of people    that we are self interested. In order to look out for what's best for them or what they think is best for them  people have values    they identify what they want  and what they don't want. And they have beliefs about what other people want  and what other people don't want  how much power other people have  how much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want. And they face limitations  constraints  they may be weak  they may be located in the wrong part of the world  they may be Einstein  stuck away farming someplace in a rural village in India not being noticed  as was the case for Ramanujan for a long time  a great mathematician but nobody noticed. Now who is rational  A lot of people are worried about what is rationality about  You know  what if people are rational  Mother Theresa  she was rational. Terrorists  they're rational. Pretty much everybody is rational. I think there are only two exceptions that I'm aware of    two year olds  they are not rational  they have very fickle preferences  they switch what they think all the time  and schizophrenics are probably not rational  but pretty much everybody else is rational. That is  they are just trying to do what they think is in their own best interest. Now in order to work out what people are going to do to pursue their interests  we have to think about who has influence in the world. If you're trying to influence corporations to change their behavior  with regard to producing pollutants  one approach  the common approach  is to exhort them to be better  to explain to them what damage they're doing to the planet. And many of you may have noticed that doesn't have as big an effect  as perhaps you would like it to have. But if you show them that it's in their interest  then they're responsive. So  we have to work out who influences problems. If we're looking at Iran  the president of the United States we would like to think  may have some influence    certainly the president in Iran has some influence    but we make a mistake if we just pay attention to the person at the top of the power ladder because that person doesn't know much about Iran  or about energy policy  or about health care  or about any particular policy. That person surrounds himself or herself with advisers. If we're talking about national security problems  maybe it's the Secretary of State  maybe it's the Secretary of Defense  the Director of National Intelligence  maybe the ambassador to the United Nations  or somebody else who they think is going to know more about the particular problem. But let's face it  the Secretary of State doesn't know much about Iran. The secretary of defense doesn't know much about Iran. Each of those people in turn has advisers who advise them  so they can advise the president. There are lots of people shaping decisions and so if we want to predict correctly we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome  not just the people at the pinnacle of the decision making pyramid. Unfortunately  a lot of times we don't do that. There's a good reason that we don't do that  and there's a good reason that using game theory and computers  we can overcome the limitation of just looking at a few people. Imagine a problem with just five decision makers. Imagine for example that Sally over here  wants to know what Harry  and Jane  and George and Frank are thinking  and sends messages to those people. Sally's giving her opinion to them  and they're giving their opinion to Sally. But Sally also wants to know what Harry is saying to these three  and what they're saying to Harry. And Harry wants to know what each of those people are saying to each other  and so on  and Sally would like to know what Harry thinks those people are saying. That's a complicated problem  that's a lot to know. With five decision makers there are a lot of linkages         as a matter of fact  if you remember your factorials. Five factorial is    . Now you may be surprised to know that smart people can keep     things straight in their head. Suppose we double the number of influencers from five to   . Does that mean we've doubled the number of pieces of information we need to know  from     to      No. How about    times  To        No. We've increased it to  .  million. Nobody can keep that straight in their head. But computers  they can. They don't need coffee breaks  they don't need vacations  they don't need to go to sleep at night  they don't ask for raises either. They can keep this information straight and that means that we can process the information. So I'm going to talk to you about how to process it  and I'm going to give you some examples out of Iran  and you're going to be wondering   Why should we listen to this guy  Why should we believe what he's saying   So I'm going to show you a factoid. This is an assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency of the percentage of time that the model I'm talking about is right in predicting things whose outcome is not yet known  when the experts who provided the data inputs got it wrong. That's not my claim  that's a CIA claim    you can read it  it was declassified a while ago. You can read it in a volume edited by H. Bradford Westerfield  Yale University Press. So  what do we need to know in order to predict  You may be surprised to find out we don't need to know very much. We do need to know who has a stake in trying to shape the outcome of a decision. We need to know what they say they want  not what they want in their heart of hearts  not what they think they can get  but what they say they want  because that is a strategically chosen position  and we can work backwards from that to draw inferences about important features of their decision making. We need to know how focused they are on the problem at hand. That is  how willing are they to drop what they're doing when the issue comes up  and attend to it instead of something else that's on their plate    how big a deal is it to them  And how much clout could they bring to bear if they chose to engage on the issue  If we know those things we can predict their behavior by assuming that everybody cares about two things on any decision. They care about the outcome. They'd like an outcome as close to what they are interested in as possible. They're careerists  they also care about getting credit    there's ego involvement  they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome  or as important  if it's their druthers  to block an outcome. And so we have to figure out how they balance those two things. Different people trade off between standing by their outcome  faithfully holding to it  going down in a blaze of glory  or giving it up  putting their finger in the wind  and doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position. Most people fall in between  and if we can work out where they fall we can work out how to negotiate with them to change their behavior. So with just that little bit of input we can work out what the choices are that people have  what the chances are that they're willing to take  what they're after  what they value  what they want  and what they believe about other people. You might notice what we don't need to know  there's no history in here. How they got to where they are may be important in shaping the input information  but once we know where they are we're worried about where they're going to be headed in the future. How they got there turns out not to be terribly critical in predicting. I remind you of that    percent accuracy rate. So where are we going to get this information  We can get this information from the Internet  from The Economist  The Financial Times  The New York Times  U.S. News and World Report  lots of sources like that  or we can get it from asking experts who spend their lives studying places and problems  because those experts know this information. If they don't know  who are the people trying to influence the decision  how much clout do they have  how much they care about this issue  and what do they say they want  are they experts  That's what it means to be an expert  that's the basic stuff an expert needs to know. Alright  lets turn to Iran. Let me make three important predictions    you can check this out  time will tell. What is Iran going to do about its nuclear weapons program  How secure is the theocratic regime in Iran  What's its future  And everybody's best friend  Ahmadinejad. How are things going for him  How are things going to be working out for him in the next year or two  You take a look at this  this is not based on statistics. I want to be very clear here. I'm not projecting some past data into the future. I've taken inputs on positions and so forth  run it through a computer model that had simulated the dynamics of interaction  and these are the simulated dynamics  the predictions about the path of policy. So you can see here on the vertical axis  I haven't shown it all the way down to zero  there are lots of other options  but here I'm just showing you the prediction  so I've narrowed the scale. Up at the top of the axis   Build the Bomb.  At      we start somewhere above      between building a bomb  and making enough weapons grade fuel so that you could build a bomb. That's where  according to my analyses  the Iranians were at the beginning of this year. And then the model makes predictions down the road. At     they would only produce enough weapons grade fuel to show that they know how  but they wouldn't build a weapon  they would build a research quantity. It would achieve some national pride  but not go ahead and build a weapon. And down at     they would build civilian nuclear energy  which is what they say is their objective. The yellow line shows us the most likely path. The yellow line includes an analysis of    decision makers in Iran  and a vast number of outside influencers trying to pressure Iran into changing its behavior  various players in the United States  and Egypt  and Saudi Arabia  and Russia  European Union  Japan  so on and so forth. The white line reproduces the analysis if the international environment just left Iran to make its own internal decisions  under its own domestic political pressures. That's not going to be happening  but you can see that the line comes down faster if they're not put under international pressure  if they're allowed to pursue their own devices. But in any event  by the end of this year  beginning of next year  we get to a stable equilibrium outcome. And that equilibrium is not what the United States would like  but it's probably an equilibrium that the United States can live with  and that a lot of others can live with. And that is that Iran will achieve that nationalist pride by making enough weapons grade fuel  through research  so that they could show that they know how to make weapons grade fuel  but not enough to actually build a bomb. How is this happening  Over here you can see this is the distribution of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today  this is what that power block is predicted to be like by the late parts of       early parts of     . Just about nobody supports research on weapons grade fuel today  but by      that gets to be a big block  and you put these two together  that's the controlling influence in Iran. Out here today  there are a bunch of people    Ahmadinejad for example    who would like not only to build a bomb  but test a bomb. That power disappears completely  nobody supports that by     . These guys are all shrinking  the power is all drifting out here  so the outcome is going to be the weapons grade fuel. Who are the winners and who are the losers in Iran  Take a look at these guys  they're growing in power  and by the way  this was done a while ago before the current economic crisis  and that's probably going to get steeper. These folks are the moneyed interests in Iran  the bankers  the oil people  the bazaaries. They are growing in political clout  as the mullahs are isolating themselves    with the exception of one group of mullahs  who are not well known to Americans. That's this line here  growing in power  these are what the Iranians call the quietists. These are the Ayatollahs  mostly based in Qom  who have great clout in the religious community  have been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder  because they see Iran going in an unhealthy direction  a direction contrary to what Khomeini had in mind. Here is Mr. Ahmadinejad. Two things to notice  he's getting weaker  and while he gets a lot of attention in the United States  he is not a major player in Iran. He is on the way down. OK  so I'd like you to take a little away from this. Everything is not predictable  the stock market is  at least for me  not predictable  but most complicated negotiations are predictable. Again  whether we're talking health policy  education  environment  energy  litigation  mergers  all of these are complicated problems that are predictable  that this sort of technology can be applied to. And the reason that being able to predict those things is important  is not just because you might run a hedge fund and make money off of it  but because if you can predict what people will do  you can engineer what they will do. And if you engineer what they do you can change the world  you can get a better result. I would like to leave you with one thought  which is for me  the dominant theme of this gathering  and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world. When people say to you   That's impossible   you say back to them   When you say 'That's impossible ' you're confused with  'I don't know how to do it.'  Thank you. Chris Anderson  One question for you. That was fascinating. I love that you put it out there. I got very nervous halfway through the talk though  just panicking whether you'd included in your model  the possibility that putting this prediction out there might change the result. We've got     people in Tehran who watch TEDTalks. Bruce Bueno de Mesquita  I've thought about that  and since I've done a lot of work for the intelligence community  they've also pondered that. It would be a good thing if people paid more attention  took seriously  and engaged in the same sorts of calculations  because it would change things. But it would change things in two beneficial ways. It would hasten how quickly people arrive at an agreement  and so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time. And  it would arrive at an agreement that everybody was happy with  without having to manipulate them so much    which is basically what I do  I manipulate them. So it would be a good thing. CA  So you're kind of trying to say   People of Iran  this is your destiny  lets go there.  BBM  Well  people of Iran  this is what many of you are going to evolve to want  and we could get there a lot sooner  and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions  and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end  and the world would be a better place. CA  Here's hoping they hear it that way. Thank you very much Bruce. BBM  Thank you. Bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth. They've been here for billions of years  and what they are are single celled microscopic organisms. So they are one cell and they have this special property that they only have one piece of DNA. They have very few genes  and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out. And the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment  they grow to twice their size  they cut themselves down in the middle  and one cell becomes two  and so on and so on. They just grow and divide  and grow and divide    so a kind of boring life  except that what I would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters. I know you guys think of yourself as humans  and this is sort of how I think of you. This man is supposed to represent a generic human being  and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body. There is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do  but you have    trillion bacterial cells in you or on you at any moment in your life. So     times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being. And of course it's the DNA that counts  so here's all the A  T  Gs and Cs that make up your genetic code  and give you all your charming characteristics. You have about        genes. Well it turns out you have     times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life. At the best  you're    percent human  but more likely about one percent human  depending on which of these metrics you like. I know you think of yourself as human beings  but I think of you as    or    percent bacterial. These bacteria are not passive riders  these are incredibly important  they keep us alive. They cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy. They digest our food  they make our vitamins  they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out. So they do all these amazing things that help us and are vital for keeping us alive  and they never get any press for that. But they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well. So  there's all kinds of bacteria on the Earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time  and if they are  they make you incredibly sick. And so  the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do  or all the bad things that bacteria do. The question we had is how could they do anything at all  I mean they're incredibly small  you have to have a microscope to see one. They live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide  and they've always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms. And so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals. And so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way that bacteria live. The clue to this came from another marine bacterium  and it's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri. What you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium  a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean  named Vibrio fischeri. This bacterium has the special property that it makes light  so it makes bioluminescence  like fireflies make light. We're not doing anything to the cells here. We just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room  and this is what we see. What was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light  but when the bacteria made light. What we noticed is when the bacteria were alone  so when they were in dilute suspension  they made no light. But when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously. The question that we had is how can bacteria  these primitive organisms  tell the difference from times when they're alone  and times when they're in a community  and then all do something together. What we've figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other  and they talk with a chemical language. This is now supposed to be my bacterial cell. When it's alone it doesn't make any light. But what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones  and these are the red triangles  and when the bacteria is alone the molecules just float away and so no light. But when the bacteria grow and double and they're all participating in making these molecules  the molecule    the extracellular amount of that molecule increases in proportion to cell number. And when the molecule hits a certain amount that tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are  they recognize that molecule and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony. That's how bioluminescence works    they're talking with these chemical words. The reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology. Again  another plug for the animals in the ocean  Vibrio fischeri lives in this squid. What you are looking at is the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid  and it's been turned on its back  and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these house the Vibrio fischeri cells  they live in there  at high cell number that molecule is there  and they're making light. The reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light. The way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii  just in sort of shallow knee deep water. The squid is nocturnal  so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps  but then at night it has to come out to hunt. On bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in  since it's just in those couple feet of water. What the squid has developed is a shutter that can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria. Then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back. And it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom    which is made by the bacterium    exactly matches how much light hits the squid's back  so the squid doesn't make a shadow. It actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter illuminate itself in an anti predation device so predators can't see its shadow  calculate its trajectory  and eat it. This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean. But then if you think about it  the squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying  thick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that. And so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep  it buries itself in the sand  and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm  and when the sun comes up it pumps out like    percent of the bacteria. Now the bacteria are dilute  that little hormone molecule is gone  so they're not making light    but of course the squid doesn't care. It's asleep in the sand. And as the day goes by the bacteria double  they release the molecule  and then light comes on at night  exactly when the squid wants it. First we figured out how this bacterium does this  but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this to figure out really what's the mechanism. And what we found    so this is now supposed to be  again  my bacterial cell    is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein    that's the red box    it's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule  the red triangle. And then as the cells grow  they're all releasing that molecule into the environment  so there's lots of molecule there. And the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule. These are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells. When the molecule increases to a certain amount    which says something about the number of cells    it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light. Why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous  glow in the dark bacterium that lives in the ocean    all bacteria have systems like this. So now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other. They make chemical words  they recognize those words  and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison. We have a fancy name for this  we call it quorum sensing. They vote with these chemical votes  the vote gets counted  and then everybody responds to the vote. What's important for today's talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions. But the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence. It's not like a couple bacteria get in you and they start secreting some toxins    you're enormous  that would have no effect on you. You're huge. What they do  we now understand  is they get in you  they wait  they start growing  they count themselves with these little molecules  and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together  they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host. Bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing. That's how it works. We also then went to look at what are these molecules    these were the red triangles on my slides before. This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule. This is the word that it talks with. So then we started to look at other bacteria  and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered. What I hope you can see is that the molecules are related. The left hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria. But the right hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species. What that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages. Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other. So these are private  secret conversations. These conversations are for intraspecies communication. Each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language that allows it to count its own siblings. Once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors. But what we were really thinking about is that most of the time bacteria don't live by themselves  they live in incredible mixtures  with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria. And that's depicted on this slide. This is your skin. So this is just a picture    a micrograph of your skin. Anywhere on your body  it looks pretty much like this  and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there. And so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria  and it's about counting your neighbors  it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species. There has to be a way to take a census of the rest of the bacteria in the population. So we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria  and what we've found now is that in fact  bacteria are multilingual. They all have a species specific system    they have a molecule that says  me.  But then  running in parallel to that is a second system that we've discovered  that's generic. So  they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor  and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria. It's used by all different bacteria and it's the language of interspecies communication. What happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you. They take that information inside  and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority of any given population. Then again we turn to chemistry  and we figured out what this generic molecule is    that was the pink ovals on my last slide  this is it. It's a very small  five carbon molecule. What the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule. So they're all using this molecule for interspecies communication. This is the bacterial Esperanto. Once we got that far  we started to learn that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language. But what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well. I've told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors  they communicate with these molecules. Of course  I've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing. We thought  what if we made these bacteria so they can't talk or they can't hear  Couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics  Of course  you've just heard and you already know that we're running out of antibiotics. Bacteria are incredibly multi drug resistant right now  and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria. They either pop the bacterial membrane  they make the bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA. We kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants. And so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases. We thought  well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications  just make these bacteria so they can't talk  they can't count  and they don't know to launch virulence. And so that's exactly what we've done  and we've sort of taken two strategies. The first one is we've targeted the intraspecies communication system. So we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules    which you saw    but they're a little bit different. And so they lock into those receptors  and they jam recognition of the real thing. By targeting the red system  what we are able to do is to make species specific  or disease specific  anti quorum sensing molecules. We've also done the same thing with the pink system. We've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we've made antagonists of the interspecies communication system. The hope is that these will be used as broad spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria. To finish I'll just show you the strategy. In this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule  but the logic is exactly the same. What you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal  in this case  a mouse  it doesn't initiate virulence right away. It gets in  it starts growing  it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules. It recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they're going to launch their attack  and the animal dies. What we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections  but we give them in conjunction with our anti quorum sensing molecules    so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing  but they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide. What we now know is that if we treat the animal with a pathogenic bacterium    a multi drug resistant pathogenic bacterium    in the same time we give our anti quorum sensing molecule  in fact  the animal lives. We think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it's going to get us around  at least initially  this big problem of resistance. What I hope you think  is that bacteria can talk to each other  they use chemicals as their words  they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about. Of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular. So in the spirit of TED they're doing things together because it makes a difference. What happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors  and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals. What I would hope that I could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity. Bacteria have been on the Earth for billions of years  humans  couple hundred thousand. We think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular organization works. We think  by studying bacteria  we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body. We know that the principles and the rules  if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms  the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well. I hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other. By using these two molecules they can say  me  and they can say  you.  Again of course that's what we do  both in a molecular way  and also in an outward way  but I think about the molecular stuff. This is exactly what happens in your body. It's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day  and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on  these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is  and what their tasks should be. Again  we think that bacteria invented that  and you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles  but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study. The final thing is  again just to reiterate that there's this practical part  and so we've made these anti quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics. But then  to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the Earth  we've also made pro quorum sensing molecules. So  we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better. Remember you have these    times or more bacterial cells in you or on you  keeping you healthy. What we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you  in the hopes of making you more healthy  making those conversations better  so bacteria can do things that we want them to do better than they would be on their own. Finally  I wanted to show you this is my gang at Princeton  New Jersey. Everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture. I hope when you learn things  like about how the natural world works    I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child. Science is done by that demographic. All of those people are between    and    years old  and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country. It's a really lucky demographic to work with. I keep getting older and older and they're always the same age  and it's just a crazy delightful job. I want to thank you for inviting me here. It's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference. Thanks. I am going to talk about myself  which I rarely do  because I    well for one thing  I prefer to talk about things I know nothing about. And secondly  I'm a recovering narcissist. I didn't know I was a narcissist actually. I thought narcissism meant you loved yourself. And then someone told me there is a flip side to it. So it's actually drearier than self love  it's unrequited self love. I don't feel I can afford a relapse. But I want to  though  explain how I came to design my own particular brand of comedy because I've been through so many different forms of it. I started with improvisation  in a particular form of improvisation called theater games  which had one rule  which I always thought was a great rule for an ethic for a society. And the rule was  you couldn't deny the other person's reality  you could only build on it. And of course we live in a society that's all about contradicting other peoples' reality. It's all about contradiction  which I think is why I'm so sensitive to contradiction in general. I see it everywhere. Like polls. You know  it's always curious to me that in public opinion polls the percentage of Americans who don't know the answer to any given question is always two percent.    percent of Americans think Alaska is part of Canada. But only two percent don't know the effect that the debacle in Argentina will have on the IMF's monetary policy    seems a contradiction. Or this ad that I read in the New York Times   Wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society. Buying it from us screams good taste.  Or this that I found in a magazine called California Lawyer  in an article that is surely meant for the lawyers at Enron.  Surviving the Slammer  Do's and Don'ts.   Don't use big words.   Learn the lingua franca.  Yeah.  Lingua this  Frankie.  And I suppose it's a contradiction that I talk about science when I don't know math. You know  because    and by the way to I was so grateful to Dean Kamen for pointing out that one of the reasons  that there are cultural reasons that women and minorities don't enter the fields of science and technology    because for instance  the reason I don't do math is  I was taught to do math and read at the same time. So you're six years old  you're reading Snow White and the Seven Dwarves  and it becomes rapidly obvious that there are only two kinds of men in the world  dwarves and Prince Charmings. And the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince. That's why little girls don't do math. It's too depressing. Of course  by talking about science I also may  as I did the other night  incur the violent wrath of some scientists who were very upset with me. I used the word postmodern as if it were OK. And they got very upset. One of them  to his credit  I think really just wanted to engage me in a serious argument. But I don't engage in serious arguments. I don't approve of them because arguments  of course  are all about contradiction  and they're shaped by the values that I have questions with. I have questions with the values of Newtonian science  like rationality. You're supposed to be rational in an argument. Well rationality is constructed by what Christie Hefner was talking about today  that mind body split  you know  The head is good  body bad. Head is ego  body id. When we say  I      as when Rene Descartes said   I think therefore I am      we mean the head. And as David Lee Roth sang in  Just a Gigolo    I ain't got no body.  That's how you get rationality. And that's why so much of humor is the body asserting itself against the head. That's why you have toilet humor and sexual humor. That's why you have the Raspyni Brothers whacking Richard in the genital area. And we're laughing doubly then because he's the body  but it's also    Voice offstage  Richard. Emily Levine  Richard. What did I say  Richard. Yes but it's also the head  the head of the conference. That's the other way that humor    like Art Buchwald takes shots at the heads of state. It doesn't make quite as much money as body humor I'm sure    but nevertheless  what makes us treasure you and adore you. There's also a contradiction in rationality in this country though  which is  as much as we revere the head  we are very anti intellectual. I know this because I read in the New York Times  the Ayn Rand foundation took out a full page ad after September     in which they said   The problem is not Iraq or Iran  the problem in this country  facing this country is the university professors and their spawn.  So I went back and re read  The Fountainhead.  I don't know how many of you have read it. And I'm not an expert on sadomasochism. But let me just read you a couple of random passages from page    .  The act of a master taking painful contemptuous possession of her  was the kind of rapture she wanted. When they lay together in bed it was  as it had to be  as the nature of the act demanded  an act of violence. It was an act of clenched teeth and hatred. It was the unendurable. Not a caress  but a wave of pain. The agony as an act of passion.  So you can imagine my surprise on reading in The New Yorker that Alan Greenspan  Chairman of the Federal Reserve  claims Ayn Rand as his intellectual mentor. It's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix. Bad enough we had to see J. Edgar Hoover in a dress. Now we have to picture Alan Greenspan in a black leather corset  with a butt tattoo that says   Whip inflation now.  And Ayn Rand of course  Ayn Rand is famous for a philosophy called Objectivism  which reflects another value of Newtonian physics  which is objectivity. Objectivity basically is constructed in that same S M way. It's the subject subjugating the object. That's how you assert yourself. You make yourself the active voice. And the object is the passive no voice. I was so fascinated by that Oxygen commercial. I don't know if you know this but    maybe it's different now  or maybe you were making a statement    but in many hospital nurseries across the country  until very recently anyway  according to a book by Jessica Benjamin  the signs over the little boys cribs read   I'm a boy   and the signs over the little girls cribs read   It's a girl.  Yeah. So the passivity was culturally projected onto the little girls. And this still goes on as I think I told you last year. There's a poll that proves    there was a poll that was given by Time magazine  in which only men were asked   Have you ever had sex with a woman you actively disliked   And well  yeah. Well     percent said yes  which I think is overinflated though because so many men if you just say   Have you ever had sex ...    Yes   They don't even wait for the rest of it. And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had    That's the first callback  of my attempted quadruple. So this subject object thing  is part of something I'm very interested in because this is why  frankly  I believe in political correctness. I do. I think it can go too far. I think Ringling Brothers may have gone too far with an ad they took out in the New York Times Magazine.  We have a lifelong emotional and financial commitment to our Asian Elephant partners.  Maybe too far. But you know    I don't think that a person of color making fun of white people is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color. Or women making fun of men is the same as men making fun of women. Or poor people making fun of rich people  the same as rich people. I think you can make fun of the have but not the have nots  which is why you don't see me making fun of Kenneth Lay and his charming wife. What's funny about being down to four houses  And I really learned this lesson during the sex scandals of the Clinton administration or  Or as I call them  the good ol' days. When people I knew  you know  people who considered themselves liberal  and everything else  were making fun of Jennifer Flowers and Paula Jones. Basically  they were making fun of them for being trailer trash or white trash. It seems  I suppose  a harmless prejudice and that you're not really hurting anybody. Until you read  as I did  an ad in the Los Angeles Times.  For sale  White trash compactor.  So this whole subject object thing has relevance to humor in this way. I read a book by a woman named Amy Richlin  who is the chair of the Classics department at USC. And the book is called  The Garden of Priapus.  And she says that Roman humor mirrors the construction of Roman society. So that Roman society was very top bottom  as ours is to some degree. And so was humor. There always had to be the butt of a joke. So it was always the satirist  like Juvenal or Martial  represented the audience  and he was going to make fun of the outsider  the person who didn't share that subject status. And in stand up of course  the stand up comedian is supposed to dominate the audience. A lot of heckling is the tension of trying to make sure that the comedian is going to be able to dominate  and overcome the heckler. And I got good at that when I was in stand up. But I always hated it because they were dictating the terms of the interaction  in the same way that engaging in a serious argument determines the content  to some degree  of what you're talking about. And I was looking for a form that didn't have that. And so I wanted something that was more interactive. I know that word is so debased now by the use of it by Internet marketers. I really miss the old telemarketers now  I'll tell you that. I do  because at least there you stood a chance. You know  I used to actually hang up on them. But then I read in  Dear Abby  that that was rude. So the next time that one called I let him get halfway through his spiel and then I said   You sound sexy.  He hung up on me  But the interactivity allows the audience to shape what you're going to do as much as you shape their experience of the world. And that's really what I'm looking for. And I was sort of  as I was starting to analyze what exactly it is that I do  I read a book called  Trickster Makes This World   by Lewis Hyde. And it was like being psychoanalyzed. I mean he had laid it all out. And then coming to this conference  I realized that most everybody here shared those same qualities because really what trickster is is an agent of change. Trickster is a change agent. And the qualities that I'm about to describe are the qualities that make it possible to make change happen. And one of these is boundary crossing. I think this is what so  in fact  infuriated the scientists. But I like to cross boundaries. I like to  as I said  talk about things I know nothing about. I hope that's my agent  because you aren't paying me anything. And I think it's good to talk about things I know nothing about because I bring a fresh viewpoint to it  you know  I'm able to see the contradiction that you may not be able to see. Like for instance a mime once    or a meme as he called himself. He was a very selfish meme. And he said that I had to show more respect because it took up to    years to learn how to do mime properly. And I said   Well  that's how you know only stupid people go into it.  It only takes two years to learn how to talk. And you know people  this is the problem with quote  objectivity  unquote. When you're only surrounded by people who speak the same vocabulary as you  or share the same set of assumptions as you  you start to think that that's reality. Like economists  you know  their definition of rational  that we all act out of our own economic self interest. Well  look at Michael Hawley  or look at Dean Kamen  or look at my grandmother. My grandmother always acted in other people's interests  whether they wanted her to or not. If they had had an Olympics in martyrdom  my grandmother would have lost on purpose.  No  you take the prize. You're young. I'm old. Who's going to see it  Where am I going  I'm going to die soon.  So that's one    this boundary crossing  this go between which    Fritz Lanting  is that his name  actually said that he was a go between. That's an actual quality of the trickster. And another is  non oppositional strategies. And this is instead of contradiction. Where you deny the other person's reality  you have paradox where you allow more than one reality to coexist  I think there's another philosophical construction. I'm not sure what it's called. But my example of it is a sign that I saw in a jewelry store. It said   Ears pierced while you wait.  There the alternative just boggles the imagination.  Oh no. Thanks though  I'll leave them here. Thanks very much. I have some errands to run. So I'll be back to pick them up around five  if that's OK with you. Huh  Huh  What  Can't hear you.  And another attribute of the trickster is smart luck. That accidents  that Louis Kahn  who talked about accidents  this is another quality of the trickster. The trickster has a mind that is prepared for the unprepared. That  and I will say this to the scientists  that the trickster has the ability to hold his ideas lightly so that he can let room in for new ideas or to see the contradictions or the hidden problems with his ideas. I had no joke for that. I just wanted to put the scientists in their place. But here's how I think I like to make change  and that is in making connections. This is what I tend to see almost more than contradictions. Like the  what do you call those toes of the gecko  You know  the toes of the gecko  curling and uncurling like the fingers of Michael Moschen. I love connections. Like I'll read that one of the two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe    there are two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe    one is space occupancy. Matter takes up space. I guess the more you matter the more space you take up  which explains the whole SUV phenomenon. And the other one though is impenetrability. Well  in ancient Rome  impenetrability was the criterion of masculinity. Masculinity depended on you being the active penetrator. And then  in economics  there's an active producer and a passive consumer  which explains why business always has to penetrate new markets. Well yeah  I mean why we forced China to open her markets. And didn't that feel good  And now we're being penetrated. You know the biotech companies are actually going inside us and planting their little flags on our genes. You know we're being penetrated. And I suspect  by someone who actively dislikes us. That's the second of the quadruple. Yes of course you got that. Thank you very much. I still have a way to go. And what I hope to do  when I make these connections  is short circuit people's thinking. You know  make you not follow your usual train of association  but make you rewire. It literally    when people say about the shock of recognition  it's literally re cognition  rewiring how you think    I had a joke to go with this and I forgot it. I'm so sorry. I'm getting like the woman in that joke about    have you heard this joke about the woman driving with her mother  And the mother is elderly. And the mother goes right through a red light. And the daughter doesn't want to say anything. She doesn't want to be like   You're too old to drive.  And the mother goes through a second red light. And the daughter says  as tactfully as possible   Mom  are you aware that you just went through two red lights   And the mother says   Oh  Am I driving   And that's the shock of recognition at the shock of recognition. That completes the quadruple. I just want to say two more things. One is  another characteristic of trickster is that the trickster has to walk this fine line. He has to have poise. And you know the biggest hurdle for me  in doing what I do  is constructing my performance so that it's prepared and unprepared. Finding the balance between those things is always dangerous because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared. But being too prepared doesn't leave room for the accidents to happen. I was thinking about what Moshe Safdie said yesterday about beauty because in his book  Hyde says that sometimes trickster can tip over into beauty. But to do that you have to lose all the other qualities because once you're into beauty you're into a finished thing. You're into something that occupies space and inhabits time. It's an actual thing. And it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty. But if you don't do that  if you allow for the accident to keep on happening  you have the possibility of getting on a wavelength. I like to think of what I do as a probability wave. When you go into beauty the probability wave collapses into one possibility. And I like to explore all the possibilities in the hope that you'll be on the wavelength of your audience. And the one final quality I want to say about trickster is that he doesn't have a home. He's always on the road. I want to say to you Richard  in closing  that in TED you've created a home. And thank you for inviting me into it. Thank you very much. What I wanted to talk to you about today is two things  one  the rise of a culture of availability  and two  a request. So we're seeing a rise of this availability being driven by mobile device proliferation  globally  across all social strata. We're seeing  along with that proliferation of mobile devices  an expectation of availability. And  with that  comes the third point  which is obligation    and an obligation to that availability. And the problem is  we're still working through  from a societal standpoint  how we allow people to be available. There's a significant delta  in fact  between what we're willing to accept. Apologies to Hans Rosling    he said anything that's not using real stats is a lie    but the big delta there is how we deal with this from a public standpoint. So we've developed certain tactics and strategies to cover up. This first one's called  the lean.  And if you've ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting  chicken   you're sitting there  looking at the person  waiting for them to look away  and then quickly checking the device. Although you can see the gentleman up on the right is busting him.  The stretch.  OK  the gentleman on the left is saying   Screw you  I'm going to check my device.  But the guy  here  on the right  he's doing the stretch. It's that reeeee e e each out  the physical contortion to get that device just below the tabletop. Or  my favorite  the  Love you  mean it.  Nothing says  I love you  like  Let me find somebody else I give a damn about.  Or  this one  coming to us from India. You can find this on YouTube  the gentleman who's recumbent on a motorcycle while text messaging. Or what we call the  sweet gravy  stop me before I kill again   That is actually the device. What this is doing is  we find a    a direct collision    we find a direct collision between availability    and what's possible through availability    and a fundamental human need    which we've been hearing about a lot  actually    the need to create shared narratives. We're very good at creating personal narratives  but it's the shared narratives that make us a culture. And when you're standing with someone  and you're on your mobile device  effectively what you're saying to them is   You are not as important as  literally  almost anything that could come to me through this device.  Look around you. There might be somebody on one right now  participating in multi dimensional engagement. Our reality right now is less interesting than the story we're going to tell about it later. This one I love. This poor kid  clearly a prop    don't get me wrong  a willing prop    but the kiss that's being documented kind of looks like it sucks. This is the sound of one hand clapping. So  as we lose the context of our identity  it becomes incredibly important that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative  becomes the context in which we live. The stories that we tell    what we push out    becomes who we are. People aren't simply projecting identity  they're creating it. And so that's the request I have for everybody in this room. We are creating the technology that is going to create the new shared experience  which will create the new world. And so my request is  please  let's make technologies that make people more human  and not less. Thank you. So how would you run a whole country without oil  That's the question that sort of hit me in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago. It never left my brain. And I started playing with it more like a puzzle. The original thought I had  this must be ethanol. So I went out and researched ethanol  and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country. About six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen  until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth  which is  you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car  if you use hydrogen. So that is not going to be the path to go. And then sort of through a process of wandering around  I got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars  in a way that is convenient and affordable  you could get to a solution. Now I started this from a point of view that it has to be something that scales en masse. Not how do you build one car  but how do you scale this so that it can become something that is used by    percent of the population  The thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good as any car that you would have today. So one  it has to be more convenient than a car. And two  it has be more affordable than today's cars. Affordable is not a        dollar sedan  right  Alright  That's not something that we can finance or buy today. And convenient is not something that you drive for an hour and charge for eight. So we're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics. And so the thought that I started with was how do you do this  still within the boundary of the science we know today    no time for science fair  no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up. How do you do it within the economics that we have today  How do you do it from the power of the consumer up  And not from the power of an edict down. On a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon  I actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership. In a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic  batteries not included.  Now if you separate between the two  you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network  by creating a network before the cars show up. The network has two components in them. First component is you charge the car whenever you stop    ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours and park for about    hours. If you drive a car in the morning and drive it back in the afternoon the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute. And so the first thought that came to mind is  everywhere we park we have electric power. Now it sounds crazy. But in some places around the world  like Scandinavia  you already have that. If you park your car and didn't plug in the heater  when you come back you don't have a car. It just doesn't work. Now that last mile  last foot  in a sense  is the first step of the infrastructure. The second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension. See we're bound by today's technology on batteries  which is about     miles if you want to stay within reasonable space and weight limitations.     miles is a good enough range for a lot of people. But you never want to get stuck. So what we added is a second element to our network  which is a battery swap system. You drive. You take your depleted battery out. A full battery comes on. And you drive on. You don't do it as a human being. You do it as a machine. It looks like a car wash. You come into your car wash. And a plate comes up  holds your battery  takes it out  puts it back in  and within two minutes you're back on the road and you can go again. If you had charge spots everywhere  and you had battery swap stations everywhere  how often would you do it  And it ends up that you'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station. As a matter of fact  we added to the contract. We said that if you stop to swap your battery more than    times a year we start paying you money because it's an inconvenience. Then we looked at the question of the affordability. We looked at the question  what happens when the battery is disconnected from the car. What is the cost of that battery  Everybody tells us batteries are so expensive. What we found out  when you move from molecules to electrons  something interesting happens. We can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again. The battery is not the gas tank  in a sense. Remember in your car you have a gas tank. You have the crude oil. And you have refining and delivery of that crude oil as what we call petrol or gasoline. The battery in this sense  is the crude oil. We have a battery bay. It costs the same hundred dollars as the gas tank. But the crude oil is replaced with a battery. Just it doesn't burn. It consumes itself step after step after step. It has       life cycles these days. And so it's sort of a mini well. We were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well  for the life of the car. Nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car. In a sense what we've done is we've created a new consumable. You  today  buy gasoline miles. And we created electric miles. And the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number. Today       in volume  when we come to market  it is eight cents a mile. Those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means    in the average consumer environment we're in in the U.S.    miles per gallon that's a buck     a buck    a gallon. That's cheaper than today's gasoline  even in the U.S. In Europe where taxes are in place  that's the equivalent to a minus    dollar barrel. But e miles follow Moore's Law. They go from eight cents a mile in       to four cents a mile in       to two cents a mile by     . Why  Because batteries life cycle improve    a bit of improvement on energy density  which reduces the price. And these prices are actually with clean electrons. We do not use any electrons that come from coal. So in a sense this is an absolute zero carbon  zero fossil fuel electric mile at two cents a mile by     . Now even if we get to    miles per gallon by       which is our desire. Imagine only    miles per gallon cars would be on the road. That is an    cent gallon. An    cent gallon means  if the entire Pacific would convert to crude oil  and we'd let any oil company bring it out and refine it  they still can't compete with two cents a mile. That's a new economic factor  which is fascinating to most people. Now this would have been a wonderful paper. That's how I solved it in my head. It was a white paper I handed out to governments. And some governments told me that it's fascinating that the younger generation actually thinks about these things. Until I got to the true young global leader  Shimon Peres  President of Israel  and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me. First he let me go to the prime minister of the country  who told me  if you can find the money you need for this network      million dollars  and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume  in two million cars    that's what we needed in Israel    I'll give you country to invest the     million into. Peres thought that was a great idea. So we went out  and we looked at all the car companies. We sent letters to all the car companies. Three of them never showed up. One of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount. But one of them Carlos Ghosn  CEO of Renault and Nissan  when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating. He said hybrids are like mermaids. When you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish. And Ghosn came up and said   I have the car  Mr. Peres  I will build you the cars.  And actually true to form  Renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume    mass volume being the first year      thousand cars. It's the first mass volume electric car  zero emission electric car in the market. I was running  as Chris said  to be the CEO of a large software company called SAP And then Peres said   Well won't you run this project   And I said   I'm ready for CEO  And he said   Oh no no no no no. You've got to explain to me  what is more important than saving your country and saving the world  that you would go and do   And I had to quit and come and do this thing called A Better Place. We then decided to scale it up. We went to other countries. As I said we went to Denmark. And Denmark set this beautiful policy  it's called the IQ test. It's inversely proportional to taxes. They put     percent tax on gasoline cars and zero tax on zero emission cars. So if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark  it costs you about        Euros. If you buy our car it's about        Euros. If you fail the IQ test they ask you to leave the country. We then were sort of coined as the guys who run only in small islands. I know most people don't think of Israel as a small island  but Israel is an island    it's a transportation island. If your car is driving outside Israel it's been stolen. If you're thinking about it in terms of islands  we decided to go to the biggest island that we could find  and that was Australia. The third country we announced was Australia. It's got three centers    in Brisbane  in Melbourne  in Sydney    and one freeway  one electric freeway that connects them. The next island was not too hard to find  and that was Hawaii. We decided to come into the U.S. and pick the two best places    the one where you didn't need any range extension. Hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery. And if you really have a long day you can switch  and keep on driving around the island. The second one was the San Francisco Bay Area where Gavin Newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors. He decided that he's going to take over the state  unofficially  and then officially  and then created this beautiful Region One policy. In the San Francisco Bay Area not only do you have the highest concentration of Priuses  but you also have the perfect range extender. It's called the other car. As we stared scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the U.S.  Why is this a big issue  And the most fascinating thing we've learned is that  when you have small problems on the individual level  like the price of gasoline to drive every morning. You don't notice it  but when the aggregate comes up you're dead. Alright  So the price of oil  much like lots of other curves that we've seen  goes along a depletion curve. The foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground. And we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground. It becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out. You think  well it's been up  it's been down  its been up  it's going to keep on going up and down. Here is the problem  at     dollars a barrel  which we were in six months ago  the U.S. spent a ton of money to get oil. Then we lost our economy and we went back down to       sometimes it's     sometimes it's   . Now we're running a stimulus package. It's called the trillion dollar stimulus package. We're going to revive the economy. Hopefully it happens between now and       somewhere in that space. What happens when the economy recovers  By      we would have had at least     million new cars even at the pace we're going at right now. That's another    percent demand on oil. That is another    million barrels a day. That's all the U.S. usage today. In other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak. And then we do the OPEC stimulus package also known as     dollars a barrel. We take our money and we give it away. You know what happens at that point  We go back down. It's going to go up and down. And the downs are going to be much longer and the ups are going to be much shorter. And that's the difference between problems that are additive  like CO   which we go slowly up and then we tip  and problems that are depletive  in which we lose what we have  which oscillate  and they oscillate until we lose everything we've got. Now we actually looked at what the answer would be. Right  Remember in the campaign  one million hybrid cars by     . That is  .  percent of the U.S. oil consumption. That is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world. That won't do much difference. We looked at an MIT study  ten million electric cars on the global roads. Ten million out of     million we will add between now and then. That is the most pessimistic number you can have. It's also the most optimistic number because it means we will scale this industry from     thousand cars is       to    million cars by             x growth in less than five years. You have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars. We have    million cars by region. That's an enormous amount of cars. China is adding those cars    India  Russia  Brazil. We have all these regions. Europe has solved it. They just put a tax on gasoline. They'll be the first in line to get off because their prices are high. China solves it by an edict. At some point they'll just declare that no gasoline car will come into a city  and that will be it. The Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in India fill two or three gallons every time. For them to get a battery that goes     miles is an extension on range  not a reduction in range. We're the only ones who don't have the price set right. We don't have the industry set right. We don't have any incentive to go and resolve it across the U.S. Now where is the car industry on that  Very interesting. The car industry has been focused just on themselves. They basically looked at it and said   Car  .  we'll solve everything within the car itself.  No infrastructure  no problem. We forgot about the entire chain around us. All this stuff that happens around. We are looking at the emergence of a car  .     a whole new market  a whole new business model. The business model in which the money that is actually coming in  to drive the car    the minutes  the miles if you want  that you are all familiar with    subsidize the price of the car  just like cellphones. You'll pay for the miles. And some of it will go back to the car maker. Some of it will go back to your own pocket. But our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars. You're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills. In Denmark  we will drive all the cars in Denmark from windmills  not from oil. In Israel  we've asked to put a solar farm in the south of Israel. And people said   Oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for.  And we said   What if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years   And they said   We tried. There isn't any.  We said   No no  but what if we prove it   And they said   Well you can dig.  And we decided to dig up  instead of digging down. These are perfect matches to one another. Now all you need is about    percent of the electricity generated. Think of it as a project that spans over about    years. That's one percent a year. Now when we're looking at solving big problems  we need to start thinking in two numbers. And those are not    percent by     . The two numbers are zero    as in zero footprint or zero oil    and scale it infinity. And when we go to COP   at the end of this year we can't stop thinking of padding CO . We have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale. One car emits four tons. And actually     and change million cars today emit  .  billion tons of CO . That's  in the additive  about    percent of our problem. Cars and trucks add up to about    percent of the world's CO  emissions. We have to come and attack this problem with a focus  with an effort that actually says  we're going to go to zero before the world ends. I actually shared that with some legislators here in the U.S. I shared it with a gentleman called Bobby Kennedy Jr.  who is one of my idols. I told him one of the reasons that his uncle was remembered is because he said we're going to send a man to the moon  and we'll do it by the end of the decade. We didn't say we're going to send a man    percent to the moon. And there will be about a    percent chance we'll recover him. He actually shared with me another story  which is from about     years ago.     years ago  in Parliament  in Great Britain  there was a long argument over economy versus morality.    percent    just like    percent emissions today comes from cars       percent of their energy for the entire industrial world in the U.K. came from a source of energy that was immoral  human slaves. And there was an argument. Should we stop using slaves  And what would it do to our economy  And people said   Well we need to take time to do it. Let's not do it immediately. Maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves. And after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery  and the industrial revolution started within less than one year. And the U.K. had     years of economic growth. We have to make the right moral decision. We have to make it immediately. We need to have presidential leadership just like we had in Israel that said we will end oil. And we need to do it not within    years or    years  but within this presidential term because if we don't  we will lose our economy  right after we'd lost our morality. Thank you all very much. The future of life  where the unraveling of our biology    and bring up the lights a little bit. I don't have any slides. I'm just going to talk    about where that's likely to carry us. And you know  I saw all the visions of the first couple of sessions. It almost made me feel a little bit guilty about having an uplifting talk about the future. It felt wrong to do that in some way. And yet  I don't really think it is because when it comes down to it  it's this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain    what people in the future are going to remember about this period. I want to talk to you a little bit about why the visions of Jeremy Rivkins  who would like to ban these sorts of technologies  or of the Bill Joys who would like to relinquish them  are actually    to follow those paths would be such a tragedy for us. I'm focusing on biology  the biological sciences. The reason I'm doing that is because those are going to be the areas that are the most significant to us. The reason for that is really very simple. It's because we're flesh and blood. We're biological creatures. And what we can do with our biology is going to shape our future and that of our children and that of their children    whether we gain control over aging  whether we learn to protect ourselves from Alzheimer's  and heart disease  and cancer. I think that Shakespeare really put it very nicely. And I'm actually going to use his words in the same order that he did. He said   And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe. And then from hour to hour we rot and rot. And thereby hangs a tale.  Life is short  you know. And we need to think about planning a little bit. We're all going to eventually  even in the developed world  going to have to lose everything that we love. When you're beginning to rot a little bit  all of the videos crammed into your head  all of the extensions that extend your various powers  are going to being to seem a little secondary. And you know  I'm getting a little bit gray    so is Ray Kurzweil  so is Eric Drexler. This is where it's really central to our lives. Now I know there's been a whole lot of hype about our power to control biology. You just have to look at the Human Genome Project. It wasn't two years ago that everybody was talking about    we've found the Holy Grail of biology. We're deciphering the code of codes. We're reading the book of life. It's a little bit reminiscent of      when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon  and everybody was about to race out toward the stars. And we've all seen        A Space Odyssey.  You know it's       and there is no HAL. And there is no odyssey to our own moon  much less the moons of Jupiter. And we're still picking up pieces of the Challenger. So it's not surprising that some people would wonder whether maybe    or    years from now  we'll look back at this instant in time  and all of the sort of talk about the Human Genome Project  and what all this is going to mean to us    well  it will really mean precious little. And I just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case. Because when we talk about our genetics and our biology  and modifying and altering and adjusting these things  we're talking about changing ourselves. And this is very critical stuff. If you have any doubts about how technology affects our lives  you just have to go to any major city. This is not the stomping ground of our Pleistocene ancestors. What's happening is we're taking this technology    it's becoming more precise  more potent    and we're turning it back upon ourselves. Before it's all done we are going to alter ourselves every bit as much as we have changed the world around us. It's going to happen a lot sooner than people imagine. On the way there it's going to completely revolutionize medicine and health care  that's obvious. It's going to change the way we have children. It's going to change the way we manage and alter our emotions. It's going to probably change the human lifespan. It will really make us question what it is to be a human being. The larger context of this is that are two unprecedented revolutions that are going on today. The first of them is the obvious one  the silicon revolution  which you all are very  very familiar with. It's changing our lives in so many ways  and it will continue to do that. What the essence of that is  is that we're taking the sand at our feet  the inert silicon at our feet  and we're breathing a level of complexity into it that rivals that of life itself  and may even surpass it. As an outgrowth of that  as a child of that revolution  is the revolution in biology. The genomics revolution  proteomics  metabolomics  all of these  omics  that sound so terrific on grants and on business plans. What we're doing is we are seizing control of our evolutionary future. I mean we're essentially using technology to just jam evolution into fast forward. It's not at all clear where it's going to take us. But in five to ten years we're going to start see some very profound changes. The most immediate changes that we'll see are things like in medicine. There is going to be a big shift towards preventative medicine as we start to be able to identify all of the risk factors that we have as individuals. But who is going to pay for all this  And how are we going to understand all this complex information  That is going to be the IT challenge of the next generation  is communicating all this information. There's pharmacogenomics  the combination of pharmacology and genetics  tailoring drugs to our individual constitutions that Juan talked about a little bit earlier. That's going to have amazing impacts. And it's going to be used for diet as well  and nutritional supplements and such. But it's going to have a big impact because we're going to have niche drugs. And we aren't going to be able to support the kinds of expenses that we have to create blockbuster drugs today. The approval process is going to fall apart  actually. It's too slow. It's too risk averse. And it is really not suited for the future that we're moving into. Another thing is that we're just going to have to deal with this knowledge. It's really wonderful when we hear   Oh    .  percent of the letters in the code are the same. We're all identical to each other. Isn't it wonderful   And look around you and know that what we really care about is that little bit of difference. We look the same to a visitor from another planet  maybe  but not to each other because we compete with each other all time. And we're going to have to come to grips with the fact that there are differences between us as individuals that we will know about  and between subpopulations of humans as well. To deny that that's the case is not a very good start on that. A generation or so away there are going to be even more profound things that are going to happen. That's when we're going to begin to use this knowledge to modify ourselves. Now I don't mean extra gills or something    something we care about  like aging. What if we could unravel aging and understand it    begin to retard the process or even reverse it  It would change absolutely everything. And it's obvious to anyone  that if we can do this  we absolutely will do this  whatever the consequences are. The second is modifying our emotions. I mean Ritalin  Viagra  things of that sort  Prozac. You know  this is just clumsy little baby steps. What if you could take a little concoction of pharmaceuticals that would make you feel really contented  just happy to be you. Are you going to be able to resist that if it doesn't have any overt side effects  Probably not. And if you don't  who are you going to be  Why do you do what you do  We're sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior. It's going to be very challenging to deal with. The third area is reproduction. The idea that we're going to chose our children's genes  as we begin to understand what genes say about who we are. That's the focus of my book  Redesigning Humans   where I talk about the kinds of choices we'll make  and the challenges it's going to present to society. There are three obvious ways of doing this. The first is cloning. It didn't happen. It's a total media circus. It will happen in five to    years. And when it does it's not going to be that big a deal. The birth of a delayed identical twin is not going to shake western civilization. But there are more important things that are already occurring  embryo screening. You take a six to eight cell embryo  you tease out one of the cells  you run a genetic test on that cell  and depending on the results of that test you either implant that embryo or you discard it. It's already done to avoid rare diseases today. And pretty soon it's going to be possible to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way. As that becomes possible this is going to move from something that is used by those who have infertility problems and are already doing in vitro fertilization  to the wealthy who want to protect their children  to just about everybody else. And in that process that's going to morph from being just for diseases  to being for lesser vulnerabilities  like risk of manic depression or something  to picking personalities  temperaments  traits  these sorts of things. Of course there is going to be genetic engineering. Directly going in    it's a little bit further away  but not that far away    going in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo. The way I suspect it will happen is using artificial chromosomes and extra chromosomes  so we go from    to    or   . And one that is not heritable because who would want to pass on to their children the archaic enhancement modules that they got    years earlier from their parents  It's a joke  of course they wouldn't want to do that. They'll want the new release. Those kinds of loose analogies with computers  and with programming  are actually much deeper than that. They are really going to come to operate in this realm. Now not everything that can be done should be done. And it won't be done. But when something is feasible in thousands of laboratories all over the world  which is going to be the case with these technologies  when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial  which is already the case  and when they're almost impossible to police  it's not a question of if this is going to happen  it's when and where and how it's going to happen. Humanity is going to go down this path. And it's going to do so for two reasons. The first is that all these technologies are just a spin off of mainstream medical research that everybody wants to see happen. It is being funded very very    in a big way. The second is  we're human. That's what we do. We try and use our technology to improve our lives in one way or another. To imagine that we're not going to use these technologies when they become available  is as much a denial of who we are as to imagine that we'll use these technologies and not fret and worry about it a great deal. The lines are going to blur. And they already are between therapy and enhancement  between treatment and prevention  between need and desire. That's really the central one  I believe. People can try and ban these things. They undoubtedly will. They have. But ultimately all this is going to do is just shift development elsewhere. It's going to drive these things from view. It's going to reserve the technology for the wealthy because they are in the best position to circumvent any of these sorts of laws. And it's going to deny us the information that we need to make wise decisions about how to use these technologies. So  sure  we need to debate these things. And I think it's wonderful that we do. But we shouldn't kid ourselves and think that we're going to reach a consensus about these things. That is simply not going to happen. They touch us too deeply. And they depend too much upon history  upon philosophy  upon religion  upon culture  upon politics. Some people are going to see this as an abomination  as the worst thing  as just awful. Other people are going to say   This is great. This is the flowering of human endeavor.  The one thing though that is really dangerous about these sorts of technologies  is that it's easy to become seduced by them. And to focus too much on all the high technology possibilities that exist. And to lose touch with the basic rhythms of our biology and our health. There are too many people that think that high technology medicine is going to keep them  save them  from overeating  from eating a lot of fast foods  from not getting any exercise. It's not going to happen. In the midst of all this amazing technology  and all these things that are occurring  it's really interesting because there is sort of a counter revolution that is going on  a resurgence of interest in remedies from the past  in nutraceuticals  in all of these sorts of things that some people  in the pharmaceutical industry particularly  like to brand as non science. But this whole effort is generated  is driven  by IT as well because that is how we're gathering all this information  and linking it  and integrating it together. There is a lot in this rich biota that is going to serve us well. And that's where about half of our drugs come. So we shouldn't dismiss this because it's an enormous opportunity to use these sorts of results  or these random loose trials from the last thousand years about what has impacts on our health. And to use our advanced technologies to pull out what is beneficial from this sea of noise  basically. In fact this isn't just abstract. I just formed a biotechnology company that is using this sort of an approach to develop therapeutics for Alzheimer's and other diseases of aging  and we're making some real progress. So here we are. It's the beginning of a new millennium. If you look forward  I mean future humans  far before the end of this millennium  in a few hundred years  they are going to look back at this moment. And from the beginning of today's sessions you'd think that they're going to see this as this horrible difficult  painful period that we struggled through. And I don't think that's what's going to happen. They're going to do like everybody does. They are going to forget about all that stuff. And they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time. They are going to think about it as this glorious instant when we laid down the very foundations of their lives  of their society  of their future. You know it's a little bit like a birth. Where there is this bloody  awful mess happens. And then what comes out of it  New life. Actually as was pointed out earlier  we forget about all the struggle there was in getting there. So to me  it's clear that one of the foundations of that future is going to be the reworking of our biology. It's going to come gradually at first. It's going to pick up speed. We're going to make lots of errors. That's the way these things work. To me it's an incredible privilege to be alive now and to be able to witness this thing. It is something that is a unique instant in the history of all of life. It will always be remembered. And what's extraordinary is that we're not just observing this  we are the architects of this. I think that we should be proud of it. What is so difficult and challenging is that we are also the objects of these changes. It's our health  it's our lives  it's our future  it's our children. And that is why they are so very troubling to so many people who would pull back in fear. I think that our choice in the choice of life  is not whether we're going to go down this path. We are  definitely. It's how we hold it in our hearts. It's how we look at it. I think Thucydides really spoke to us very clearly in     B.C. He put it nicely. Again  I'll use the words in the same order he did.  The bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them  both glory and danger alike. And yet notwithstanding  they go out and they meet it.  Thank you. The AlloSphere  it's a three story metal sphere in an echo free chamber. Think of the AlloSphere as a large  dynamically varying digital microscope that's connected to a supercomputer.    researchers can stand on a bridge suspended inside of the sphere  and be completely immersed in their data. Imagine if a team of physicists could stand inside of an atom and watch and hear electrons spin. Imagine if a group of sculptors could be inside of a lattice of atoms and sculpt with their material. Imagine if a team of surgeons could fly into the brain  as though it was a world  and see tissues as landscapes  and hear blood density levels as music. This is some of the research that you're going to see that we're undertaking at the AlloSphere. But first a little bit about this group of artists  scientists  and engineers that are working together. I'm a composer  orchestrally trained  and the inventor of the AlloSphere. With my visual artist colleagues  we map complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space  visually and sonically. Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information. And our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world for this kind of data exploration. I'm going to fly you into five research projects in the AlloSphere that are going to take you from biological macroscopic data all the way down to electron spin. This first project is called the AlloBrain. And it's our attempt to quantify beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful. You're flying through the cortex of my colleague's brain. Our narrative here is real fMRI data that's mapped visually and sonically. The brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with. You see    intelligent computer agents  the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you. They're mining blood density levels. And they're reporting them back to you sonically. Higher density levels mean more activity in that point of the brain. They're actually singing these densities to you with higher pitches mapped to higher densities. We're now going to move from real biological data to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature in our next artistic and scientific installation. In this artistic and scientific installation  biogenerative algorithms are helping us to understand self generation and growth  very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences. For artists  we're making new worlds that we can uncover and explore. These generative algorithms grow over time  and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects. Our researchers are interacting with this data by injecting bacterial code  which are computer programs  that allow these creatures to grow over time. We're going to move now from the biological and the macroscopic world  down into the atomic world  as we fly into a lattice of atoms. This is real AFM    Atomic Force Microscope    data from my colleagues in the Solid State Lighting and Energy Center. They've discovered a new bond  a new material for transparent solar cells. We're flying through       lattice of atoms    oxygen  hydrogen and zinc. You view the bond in the triangle. It's four blue zinc atoms bonding with one white hydrogen atom. You see the electron flow with the streamlines we as artists have generated for the scientists. This is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms. We think it makes a beautiful structural art. The sound that you're hearing are the actual emission spectrums of these atoms. We've mapped them into the audio domain  so they're singing to you. Oxygen  hydrogen and zinc have their own signature. We're going to actually move even further down as we go from this lattice of atoms to one single hydrogen atom. We're working with our physicist colleagues that have given us the mathematical calculations of the n dimensional Schr dinger equation in time. What you're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom. You're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines. The white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three orbital configuration. In a minute we're going to move to a two orbital configuration  and you're going to notice a pulsing. And you're going to hear an undulation between the sound. This is actually a light emitter. As the sound starts to pulse and contract  our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted. They're starting to find new mathematical structures in these calculations. And they're understanding more about quantum mathematics. We're going to move even further down  and go to one single electron spin. This will be the final project that I show you. Our colleagues in the Center for Quantum Computation and Spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers decoherence in a single electron spin. We've taken this information and we've made a mathematical model out of it. You're actually seeing and hearing quantum information flow. This is very important for the next step in simulating quantum computers and information technology. So these brief examples that I've shown you give you an idea of the kind of work that we're doing at the University of California  Santa Barbara  to bring together  arts  science and engineering into a new age of math  science and art. We hope that all of you will come to see the AlloSphere. Inspire us to think of new ways that we can use this unique instrument that we've created at Santa Barbara. Thank you very much. This is Tim Ferriss circa      A.D. Age two. You can tell by the power squat  I was a very confident boy    and not without reason. I had a very charming routine at the time  which was to wait until late in the evening when my parents were decompressing from a hard day's work  doing their crossword puzzles  watching television. I would run into the living room  jump up on the couch  rip the cushions off  throw them on the floor  scream at the top of my lungs and run out because I was the Incredible Hulk. Obviously  you see the resemblance. And this routine went on for some time. When I was seven I went to summer camp. My parents found it necessary for peace of mind. And at noon each day the campers would go to a pond  where they had floating docks. You could jump off the end into the deep end. I was born premature. I was always very small. My left lung had collapsed when I was born. And I've always had buoyancy problems. So water was something that scared me to begin with. But I would go in on occasion. And on one particular day  the campers were jumping through inner tubes  They were diving through inner tubes. And I thought this would be great fun. So I dove through the inner tube  and the bully of the camp grabbed my ankles. And I tried to come up for air  and my lower back hit the bottom of the inner tube. And I went wild eyed and thought I was going to die. A camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us. From that point onward I was terrified of swimming. That is something that I did not get over. My inability to swim has been one of my greatest humiliations and embarrassments. That is when I realized that I was not the Incredible Hulk. But there is a happy ending to this story. At age       that's my age now    in August I took two weeks to re examine swimming  and question all the of the obvious aspects of swimming. And went from swimming one lap    so    yards    like a drowning monkey  at about     beats per minute heart rate    I measured it    to going to Montauk on Long Island  close to where I grew up  and jumping into the ocean and swimming one kilometer in open water  getting out and feeling better than when I went in. And I came out  in my Speedos  European style  feeling like the Incredible Hulk. And that's what I want everyone in here to feel like  the Incredible Hulk  at the end of this presentation. More specifically  I want you to feel like you're capable of becoming an excellent long distance swimmer  a world class language learner  and a tango champion. And I would like to share my art. If I have an art  it's deconstructing things that really scare the living hell out of me. So  moving onward. Swimming  first principles. First principles  this is very important. I find that the best results in life are often held back by false constructs and untested assumptions. And the turnaround in swimming came when a friend of mine said   I will go a year without any stimulants     this is a six double espresso per day type of guy     if you can complete a one kilometer open water race.  So the clock started ticking. I started seeking out triathletes because I found that lifelong swimmers often couldn't teach what they did. I tried kickboards. My feet would slice through the water like razors  I wouldn't even move. I would leave demoralized  staring at my feet. Hand paddles  everything. Even did lessons with Olympians    nothing helped. And then Chris Sacca  who is now a dear friend mine  had completed an Iron Man with     degree temperature  said   I have the answer to your prayers.  And he introduced me to the work of a man named Terry Laughlin who is the founder of Total Immersion Swimming. That set me on the road to examining biomechanics. So here are the new rules of swimming  if any of you are afraid of swimming  or not good at it. The first is  forget about kicking. Very counterintuitive. So it turns out that propulsion isn't really the problem. Kicking harder doesn't solve the problem because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent of their energy expenditure into forward motion. The problem is hydrodynamics. So what you want to focus on instead is allowing your lower body to draft behind your upper body  much like a small car behind a big car on the highway. And you do that by maintaining a horizontal body position. The only way you can do that is to not swim on top of the water. The body is denser than water.    percent of it would be  at least  submerged naturally. So you end up  number three  not swimming  in the case of freestyle  on your stomach  as many people think  reaching on top of the water. But actually rotating from streamlined right to streamlined left  maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible. So let's look at some examples. This is Terry. And you can see that he's extending his right arm below his head and far in front. And so his entire body really is underwater. The arm is extended below the head. The head is held in line with the spine  so that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up    very important  especially for people with lower body fat. Here is an example of the stroke. So you don't kick. But you do use a small flick. You can see this is the left extension. Then you see his left leg. Small flick  and the only purpose of that is to rotate his hips so he can get to the opposite side. And the entry point for his right hand    notice this  he's not reaching in front and catching the water. Rather  he is entering the water at a    degree angle with his forearm  and then propelling himself by streamlining    very important. Incorrect  above  which is what almost every swimming coach will teach you. Not their fault  honestly. And I'll get to implicit versus explicit in a moment. Below is what most swimmers will find enables them to do what I did  which is going from    strokes per    yard length to    strokes in two workouts with no coach  no video monitoring. And now I love swimming. I can't wait to go swimming. I'll be doing a swimming lesson later  for myself  if anyone wants to join me. Last thing  breathing. A problem a lot of us have  certainly  when you're swimming. In freestyle  easiest way to remedy this is to turn with body roll  and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water. And that will get you very far. That's it. That's really all you need to know. Languages. Material versus method. I  like many people  came to the conclusion that I was terrible at languages. I suffered through Spanish for junior high  first year of high school  and the sum total of my knowledge was pretty much   Donde esta el bano   And I wouldn't even catch the response. A sad state of affairs. Then I transferred to a different school sophomore year  and I had a choice of other languages. Most of my friends were taking Japanese. So I thought why not punish myself  I'll do Japanese. Six months later I had the chance to go to Japan. My teachers assured me  they said   Don't worry. You'll have Japanese language classes every day to help you cope. It will be an amazing experience.  My first overseas experience in fact. So my parents encouraged me to do it. I left. I arrived in Tokyo. Amazing. I couldn't believe I was on the other side of the world. I met my host family. Things went quite well I think  all things considered. My first evening  before my first day of school  I said to my mother  very politely   Please wake me up at eight a.m.  So   Japanese  But I didn't say  Japanese . I said   Japanese . Pretty close. But I said   Please rape me at eight a.m.  You've never seen a more confused Japanese woman. I walked in to school. And a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper. I couldn't read any of it    hieroglyphics  it could have been    because it was Kanji  Chinese characters adapted into the Japanese language. Asked him what this said. And he goes   Ahh  okay okay  eehto  World History  ehh  Calculus  Traditional Japanese.  And so on. And so it came to me in waves. There had been something lost in translation. The Japanese classes were not Japanese instruction classes  per se. They were the normal high school curriculum for Japanese students    the other       students in the school  who were Japanese  besides the American. And that's pretty much my response. And that set me on this panic driven search for the perfect language method. I tried everything. I went to Kinokuniya. I tried every possible book  every possible CD. Nothing worked until I found this. This is the Joyo Kanji. This is a Tablet rather  or a poster of the       common use characters as determined by the Ministry of Education in     . Many of the publications in Japan limit themselves to these characters  to facilitate literacy    some are required to. And this became my Holy Grail  my Rosetta Stone. As soon as I focused on this material  I took off. I ended up being able to read Asahi Shinbu  Asahi newspaper  about six months later    so a total of    months later    and went from Japanese I to Japanese VI. Ended up doing translation work at age    when I returned to the U.S.  and have continued to apply this material over method approach to close to a dozen languages now. Someone who was terrible at languages  and at any given time  speak  read and write five or six. This brings us to the point  which is  it's oftentimes what you do  not how you do it  that is the determining factor. This is the difference between being effective    doing the right things    and being efficient    doing things well whether or not they're important. You can also do this with grammar. I came up with these six sentences after much experimentation. Having a native speaker allow you to deconstruct their grammar  by translating these sentences into past  present  future  will show you subject  object  verb  placement of indirect  direct objects  gender and so forth. From that point  you can then  if you want to  acquire multiple languages  alternate them so there is no interference. We can talk about that if anyone in interested. And now I love languages. So ballroom dancing  implicit versus explicit    very important. You might look at me and say   That guy must be a ballroom dancer.  But no  you'd be wrong because my body is very poorly designed for most things    pretty well designed for lifting heavy rocks perhaps. I used to be much bigger  much more muscular. And so I ended up walking like this. I looked a lot like an orangutan  our close cousins  or the Incredible Hulk. Not very good for ballroom dancing. I found myself in Argentina in       decided to watch a tango class    had no intention of participating. Went in  paid my ten pesos  walked up       women two guys  usually a good ratio. The instructor says   You are participating.  Immediately  death sweat. Fight or flight fear sweat  because I tried ballroom dancing in college    stepped on the girl's foot with my heel. She screamed. I was so concerned with her perception of what I was doing  that it exploded in my face  never to return to the ballroom dancing club. She comes up  and this was her approach  the teacher.  Okay  come on  grab me.  Gorgeous assistant instructor. She was very pissed off that I had pulled her from her advanced practice. So I did my best. I didn't know where to put my hands. And she pulled back  threw down her arms  put them on her hips  turned around and yelled across the room   This guy is built like a god damned mountain of muscle  and he's grabbing me like a fucking Frenchman   which I found encouraging. Everyone burst into laughter. I was humiliated. She came back. She goes   Come on. I don't have all day.  As someone who wrestled since age eight  I proceeded to crush her   Of Mice and Men  style. And she looked up and said   Now that's better.  So I bought a month's worth of classes. And proceeded to look at    I wanted to set competition so I'd have a deadline    Parkinson's Law  the perceived complexity of a task will expand to fill the time you allot it. So I had a very short deadline for a competition. I got a female instructor first  to teach me the female role  the follow  because I wanted to understand the sensitivities and abilities that the follow needed to develop  so I wouldn't have a repeat of college. And then I took an inventory of the characteristics  along with her  of the of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who'd won championships. I interviewed these people because they all taught in Buenos Aires. I compared the two lists  and what you find is that there is explicitly  expertise they recommended  certain training methods. Then there were implicit commonalities that none of them seemed to be practicing. Now the protectionism of Argentine dance teachers aside  I found this very interesting. So I decided to focus on three of those commonalities. Long steps. So a lot of milongueros    the tango dancers will use very short steps. I found that longer steps were much more elegant. So you can have    and you can do it in a very small space in fact. Secondly  different types of pivots. Thirdly  variation in tempo. These seemed to be the three areas that I could exploit to compete if I wanted to comptete against people who'd been practicing for    to    years. That photo is of the semi finals of the Buenos Aires championships  four months later. Then one month later  went to the world championships  made it to the semi final. And then set a world record  following that  two weeks later. I want you to see part of what I practiced. I'm going to jump forward here. This is the instructor that Alicia and I chose for the male lead. His name is Gabriel Misse. One of the most elegant dancers of his generation  known for his long steps  and his tempo changes and his pivots. Alicia  in her own right  very famous. So I think you'll agree  they look quite good together. Now what I like about this video is it's actually a video of the first time they ever danced together because of his lead. He had a strong lead. He didn't lead with his chest  which requires you lean forward. I couldn't develop the attributes in my toes  the strength in my feet  to do that. So he uses a lead that focuses on his shoulder girdle and his arm. So he can lift the woman to break her  for example. That's just one benefit of that. So then we broke it down. This would be an example of one pivot. This is a back step pivot. There are many different types. I have hundreds of hours of footage    all categorized  much like George Carlin categorized his comedy. So using my arch nemesis  Spanish  no less  to learn tango. So fear is your friend. Fear is an indicator. Sometimes it shows you what you shouldn't do. More often than not it shows you exactly what you should do. And the best results that I've had in life  the most enjoyable times  have all been from asking a simple question  what's the worst that can happen  Especially with fears you gained when you were a child. Take the analytical frameworks  the capabilities you have  apply them to old fears. Apply them to very big dreams. And when I think of what I fear now  it's very simple. When I imagine my life  what my life would have been like without the educational opportunities that I had  it makes me wonder. I've spent the last two years trying to deconstruct the American public school system  to either fix it or replace it. And have done experiments with about        students thus far    built  I'd say  about a half dozen schools  my readers  at this point. And if any of you are interested in that  I would love to speak with you. I know nothing. I'm a beginner. But I ask a lot of questions  and I would love your advice. Thank you very much. It's pretty simple. There are nine  sort of  rules that I discovered after    years of rock climbing. Most of them are pretty basic. Number one  don't let go    very sure success method. But really  truly    often you think about letting go way before your body does. So hang in there  and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions. Number two  hesitation is bad. This is a friction climb  up in Tuolumne Meadows  in the Yosemite high country. Friction climbing doesn't have any sort of hard positive edges. You're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock. The most friction you have is when you first put your hand or your foot on the rock. And then from that point on  you're basically falling. So momentum is good. Don't stop. Rule number three  have a plan. This is a climb called the Naked Edge  in El Dorado Canyon  outside of Boulder. This climber is on the last pitch of it. He's actually right about where I fell. There is about       feet of air below him. And all the hard pitches are actually below him. Often what happens is you're planning so hard for like   How do I get through the hardest part  How do I get through the hardest part   And then what happens  You get to the last pitch. It's easy. And you're completely flamed out. Don't do it. You have to plan ahead to get to the top. But you also can't forget that each individual move you have to be able to complete. This is a climb called the Dike Route  on Pywjack Dome  up in the Yosemite high country. The interesting thing about this climb is it's not that hard. But if you're the leader on it  at the hardest move  you're looking at about     foot fall  onto some low angle slabs. So you've got to focus. You don't want to stop in the middle like Coleridge's Kubla Kahn. You've got to keep going. Rule number five  know how to rest. It's amazing. The best climbers are the ones that in the most extreme situations can get their bodies into some position where they can rest  regroup  calm themselves  focus  and keep going. This is a climb in the Needles  again in California. Fear really sucks because what it means is you're not focusing on what you're doing. You're focusing on the consequences of failing at what you're doing because any given move should require all your concentration and thought processes to execute it effectively. One of the things in climbing is  most people sort of take it straight on. And they follow the most obvious solution. This is the Devils Tower in Wyoming  which is a columnar basalt formation that most of you probably know from  Close Encounters.  With this  typically crack climbers would put their hands in and their toes in and just start climbing. The cracks are too small to get your toes into so the only way to climb is using your fingertips in the cracks  and using opposing pressure and forcing yourself up. Rule number eight  strength doesn't always equal success. In the    years I've been a climbing guide and taught on indoor walls  and stuff like that  the most important thing I've learned was  guys will always try to do pull ups. Beginning guys  it's like  they thrash  they thrash  they get    feet up    and they can do about    pull ups right    And then they just flame out. Women are much more in balance because they don't have that idea that they're going to be able to do     pull ups. They think about how to get the weight over their feet because it's sort of natural    they carry you all day long. So balance is really critical  and keeping your weight on your feet  which is your strongest muscle. And of course there is rule number nine. I came up with rule number nine after I actually didn't plan for a fall  and went about    feet and cracked a rib. Once you get to that point where you know it's going to happen  you need to start thinking about how you're going to let go because that is the critical piece of not getting hurt    how you're going to fall onto the rope  or if you're climbing without a rope  fall to a place where you can actually control the fall. So don't hang on till the bitter end. Thank you very much. I'm here today  as June said  to talk about a project that my twin sister and I have been doing for the past three and half years. We're crocheting a coral reef. And it's a project that we've actually been now joined by hundreds of people around the world  who are doing it with us. Indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project  in many of its different aspects. It's a project that now reaches across three continents  and its roots go into the fields of mathematics  marine biology  feminine handicraft and environmental activism. It's true. It's also a project that in a very beautiful way  the development of this has actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth  which is a particularly lovely thing to be saying right here in February         which  as one of our previous speakers told us  is the    th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin. All of this I'm going to get to in the next    minutes  I hope. But let me first begin by showing you some pictures of what this thing looks like. Just to give you an idea of scale  that installation there is about six feet across  and the tallest models are about two or three feet high. This is some more images of it. That one on the right is about five feet high. The work involves hundreds of different crochet models. And indeed there are now thousands and thousands of models that people have contributed all over the world as part of this. The totality of this project involves tens of thousands of hours of human labor       percent of it done by women. On the right hand side  that bit there is part of an installation that is about    feet long. My sister and I started this project in      because in that year  at least in the science press  there was a lot of talk about global warming  and the effect that global warming was having on coral reefs. Corals are very delicate organisms  and they are devastated by any rise in sea temperatures. It causes these vast bleaching events that are the first signs of corals of being sick. And if the bleaching doesn't go away    if the temperatures don't go down    reefs start to die. A great deal of this has been happening in the Great Barrier Reef  particularly in coral reefs all over the world. This is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef. We have a new organization together called The Institute for Figuring  which is a little organization we started to promote  to do projects about the aesthetic and poetic dimensions of science and mathematics. And I went and put a little announcement up on our site  asking for people to join us in this enterprise. To our surprise  one of the first people who called was the Andy Warhol Museum. And they said they were having an exhibition about artists' response to global warming  and they'd like our coral reef to be part of it. I laughed and said   Well we've only just started it  you can have a little bit of it.  So in      we had an exhibition  a small exhibition of this crochet reef. And then some people in Chicago came along and they said   In late       the theme of the Chicago Humanities Festival is global warming. And we've got this       square foot gallery and we want you to fill it with your reef.  And I  naively by this stage  said   Oh  yes  sure.  Now I say  naively  because actually my profession is as a science writer. What I do is I write books about the cultural history of physics. I've written books about the history of space  the history of physics and religion  and I write articles for people like the New York Times and the L.A. Times. So I had no idea what it meant to fill a       square foot gallery. So I said yes to this proposition. And I went home  and I told my sister Christine. And she nearly had a fit because Christine is a professor at one of L.A.'s major art colleges  CalArts  and she knew exactly what it meant to fill a       square foot gallery. She thought I'd gone off my head. But she went into crochet overdrive. And to cut a long story short  eight months later we did fill the Chicago Cultural Center's       square foot gallery. By this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own  which got completely beyond us. The people in Chicago decided that as well as exhibiting our reefs  what they wanted to do was have the local people there make a reef. So we went and taught the techniques. We did workshops and lectures. And the people in Chicago made a reef of their own. And it was exhibited alongside ours. There were hundreds of people involved in that. We got invited to do the whole thing in New York  and in London  and in Los Angeles. In each of these cities  the local citizens  hundreds and hundreds of them  have made a reef. And more and more people get involved in this  most of whom we've never met. So the whole thing has sort of morphed into this organic  ever evolving creature  that's actually gone way beyond Christine and I. Now some of you are sitting here thinking   What planet are these people on  Why on earth are you crocheting a reef  Woolenness and wetness aren't exactly two concepts that go together. Why not chisel a coral reef out of marble  Cast it in bronze.  But it turns out there is a very good reason why we are crocheting it because many organisms in coral reefs have a very particular kind of structure. The frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals  and kelps  and sponges and nudibranchs  is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry. And the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet. It happens to be a fact. It's almost impossible to model this structure any other way  and it's almost impossible to do it on computers. So what is this hyperbolic geometry that corals and sea slugs embody  The next few minutes is  we're all going to get raised up to the level of a sea slug. This sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics when it was first discovered in the   th century. But not until      did mathematicians actually understand how they could model it. In      a mathematician at Cornell  Daina Taimina  made the discovery that this structure could actually be done in knitting and crochet. The first one she did was knitting. But you get too many stitches on the needle. So she quickly realized crochet was the better thing. But what she was doing was actually making a model of a mathematical structure  that many mathematicians had thought it was actually impossible to model. And indeed they thought that anything like this structure was impossible per se. Some of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years trying to prove that this structure was impossible. So what is this impossible hyperbolic structure  Before hyperbolic geometry  mathematicians knew about two kinds of space  Euclidean space  and spherical space. And they have different properties. Mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist. You all have a sense of what a flat space is  Euclidean space is. But mathematicians formalize this in a particular way. And what they do is  they do it through the concept of parallel lines. So here we have a line and a point outside the line. And Euclid said   How can I define parallel lines  I ask the question  how many lines can I draw through the point but never meet the original line   And you all know the answer. Does someone want to shout it out  One. Great. Okay. That's our definition of a parallel line. It's a definition really of Euclidean space. But there is another possibility that you all know of  spherical space. Think of the surface of a sphere    just like a beach ball  the surface of the Earth. I have a straight line on my spherical surface. And I have a point outside the line. How many straight lines can I draw through the point but never meet the original line  What do we mean to talk about a straight line on a curved surface  Now mathematicians have answered that question. They've understood there is a generalized concept of straightness  it's called a geodesic. And on the surface of a sphere  a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw. So it's like the equator or the lines of longitude. So we ask the question again   How many straight lines can I draw through the point  but never meet the original line   Does someone want to guess  Zero. Very good. Now mathematicians thought that was the only alternative. It's a bit suspicious isn't it  There is two answers to the question so far  Zero and one. Two answers  There may possibly be a third alternative. To a mathematician if there are two answers  and the first two are zero and one  there is another number that immediately suggests itself as the third alternative. Does anyone want to guess what it is  Infinity. You all got it right. Exactly. There is  there's a third alternative. This is what it looks like. There's a straight line  and there is an infinite number of lines that go through the point and never meet the original line. This is the drawing. This nearly drove mathematicians bonkers because  like you  they're sitting there feeling bamboozled. Thinking  how can that be  You're cheating. The lines are curved. But that's only because I'm projecting it onto a flat surface. Mathematicians for several hundred years had to really struggle with this. How could they see this  What did it mean to actually have a physical model that looked like this  It's a bit like this  imagine that we'd only ever encountered Euclidean space. Then our mathematicians come along and said   There's this thing called a sphere  and the lines come together at the north and south pole.  But you don't know what a sphere looks like. And someone that comes along and says   Look here's a ball.  And you go   Ah  I can see it. I can feel it. I can touch it. I can play with it.  And that's exactly what happened when Daina Taimina in       showed that you could crochet models in hyperbolic space. Here is this diagram in crochetness. I've stitched Euclid's parallel postulate on to the surface. And the lines look curved. But look  I can prove to you that they're straight because I can take any one of these lines  and I can fold along it. And it's a straight line. So here  in wool  through a domestic feminine art  is the proof that the most famous postulate in mathematics is wrong. And you can stitch all sorts of mathematical theorems onto these surfaces. The discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics that is called non Euclidean geometry. And this is actually the field of mathematics that underlies general relativity and is actually ultimately going to show us about the shape of the universe. So there is this direct line between feminine handicraft  Euclid and general relativity. Now  I said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible. Here's two creatures who've never heard of Euclid's parallel postulate    didn't know it was impossible to violate  and they're simply getting on with it. They've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years. I once asked the mathematicians why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible when sea slugs have been doing it since the Silurian age. Their answer was interesting. They said   Well I guess there aren't that many mathematicians sitting around looking at sea slugs.  And that's true. But it also goes deeper than that. It also says a whole lot of things about what mathematicians thought mathematics was  what they thought it could and couldn't do  what they thought it could and couldn't represent. Even mathematicians  who in some sense are the freest of all thinkers  literally couldn't see not only the sea slugs around them  but the lettuce on their plate    because lettuces  and all those curly vegetables  they also are embodiments of hyperbolic geometry. And so in some sense they literally  they had such a symbolic view of mathematics  they couldn't actually see what was going on on the lettuce in front of them. It turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders. And so  too  we've discovered that there is an infinite taxonomy of crochet hyperbolic creatures. We started out  Chrissy and I and our contributors  doing the simple mathematically perfect models. But we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it    the simple algorithm crochet three  increase one    when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code  the models immediately started to look more natural. And all of our contributors  who are an amazing collection of people around the world  do their own embellishments. As it were  we have this ever evolving  crochet taxonomic tree of life. Just as the morphology and the complexity of life on earth is never ending  little embellishments and complexifications in the DNA code lead to new things like giraffes  or orchids    so too  do little embellishments in the crochet code lead to new and wondrous creatures in the evolutionary tree of crochet life. So this project really has taken on this inner organic life of its own. There is the totality of all the people who have come to it. And their individual visions  and their engagement with this mathematical mode. We have these technologies. We use them. But why  What's at stake here  What does it matter  For Chrissy and I  one of the things that's important here is that these things suggest the importance and value of embodied knowledge. We live in a society that completely tends to valorize symbolic forms of representation    algebraic representations  equations  codes. We live in a society that's obsessed with presenting information in this way  teaching information in this way. But through this sort of modality  crochet  other plastic forms of play    people can be engaged with the most abstract  high powered  theoretical ideas  the kinds of ideas that normally you have to go to university departments to study in higher mathematics  which is where I first learned about hyperbolic space. But you can do it through playing with material objects. One of the ways that we've come to think about this is that what we're trying to do with the Institute for Figuring and projects like this  we're trying to have kindergarten for grown ups. And kindergarten was actually a very formalized system of education  established by a man named Friedrich Froebel  who was a crystallographer in the   th century. He believed that the crystal was the model for all kinds of representation. He developed a radical alternative system of engaging the smallest children with the most abstract ideas through physical forms of play. And he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right. The value of education is something that Froebel championed  through plastic modes of play. We live in a society now where we have lots of think tanks  where great minds go to think about the world. They write these great symbolic treatises called books  and papers  and op ed articles. We want to propose  Chrissy and I  through The Institute for Figuring  another alternative way of doing things  which is the play tank. And the play tank  like the think tank  is a place where people can go and engage with great ideas. But what we want to propose  is that the highest levels of abstraction  things like mathematics  computing  logic  etc.    all of this can be engaged with  not just through purely cerebral algebraic symbolic methods  but by literally  physically playing with ideas. Thank you very much. When I was five years old I fell in love with airplanes. Now I'm talking about the '  s. In the '  s an airplane had two wings and a round motor  and was always flown by a guy who looked like Cary Grant. He had high leather boots  jodhpurs  an old leather jacket  a wonderful helmet and those marvelous goggles    and  inevitably  a white scarf  to flow in the wind. He'd always walk up to his airplane in a kind of saunter  devil may care saunter  flick the cigarette away  grab the girl waiting here  give her a kiss. And then mount his airplane  maybe for the last time. Of course I always wondered what would happen if he'd kissed the airplane first. But this was real romance to me. Everything about flying in those years  which was    you have to stop and think for a moment    was probably the most advanced technological thing going on at the time. So as a youngster  I tried to get close to this by drawing airplanes  constantly drawing airplanes. It's the way I got a part of this romance. And of course  in a way  when I say romance  I mean in part the aesthetics of that whole situation. I think the word is the holistic experience revolving around a product. The product was that airplane. But it built a romance. Even the parts of the airplane had French names. Ze fuselage  ze empanage  ze nessal. You know  from a romance language. So that it was something that just got into your spirit. It did mine. And I decided I had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes. I wanted to build airplanes. So I built model airplanes. And I found that in doing the model airplanes the appearance drawings were not enough. You couldn't transfer those to the model itself. If you wanted it to fly you had to learn the discipline of flying. You had to learn about aeronautics. You had to learn what made an airplane stay in the air. And of course  as a model in those years  you couldn't control it. So it had to be self righting  and stay up without crashing. So I had to give up the approach of drawing the fantasy shapes and convert it to technical drawings    the shape of the wing  the shape of the fuselage and so on    and build an airplane over these drawings that I knew followed some of the principles of flying. And in so doing  I could produce a model that would fly  stay in the air. And it had  once it was in the air  some of this romance that I was in love with. Well the act of drawing airplanes led me to  when I had the opportunity to choose a course in school  led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering. And when I was sitting in classes    in which no one asked me to draw an airplane    to my surprise. I had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing. I'd wile away my time drawing airplanes in the class. One day a young man looked over my shoulder  he said   You draw very well. You should be in the art department.  And I said   Why   And he said   Well for one thing  there are more girls there.  So my romance was temporarily shifted. And I went into art because they appreciated drawing. Studied painting  didn't do very well at that. Went through design  some architecture. Eventually hired myself out as a designer. And for the following    years  living in Italy  living in America  I doled out a piece of this romance to anybody who'd pay for it    this sense  this aesthetic feeling  for the experience revolving around a designed object. And it exists. Any of you who rode the automobiles    was it yesterday     at the track  you know the romance revolving around those high performance cars. Well in    years I was mostly putting out pieces of this romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call doesn't always connect you with a circumstance in which you can produce things of this nature. So after    years I began to feel as though I was running dry. And I quit. And I started up a very small operation    went from    people to one  in an effort to rediscover my innocence. I wanted to get back where the romance was. And I couldn't choose airplanes because they had gotten sort of unromantic at that point  even though I'd done a lot of airplane work  on the interiors. So I chose furniture. And I chose chairs specifically because I knew something about them. I'd designed a lot of chairs  over the years for tractors and trucks and submarines    all kinds of things. But not office chairs. So I started doing that. And I found that there were ways to duplicate the same approach that I used to use on the airplane. Only this time  instead of the product being shaped by the wind  it was shaped by the human body. So the discipline was    as in the airplane you learn a lot about how to deal with the air  for a chair you have to learn a lot about how to deal with the body  and what the body needs  wants  indicates it needs. And that's the way  ultimately after some ups and downs  I ended up designing the chair I'm going to show you. I should say one more thing. When I was doing those model airplanes  I did everything. I conceived the kind of airplane. I basically engineered it. I built it. And I flew it. And that's the way I work now. When I started this chair it was not a preconceived notion. Design nowadays  if you mean it  you don't start with styling sketches. I started with a lot of loose ideas  roughly eight or nine years ago. And the loose ideas had something to do with what I knew happened with people in the office  at the work place    people who worked  and used task seating  a great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long. And I felt  the one thing they don't need  is a chair that interferes with their main reason for sitting there. So I took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they didn't have to fuss with it. So my idea was that  instead of sitting down and reaching for a lot of controls  that you would sit on the chair  and it would automatically balance your weight against the force required to recline. Now that may not mean a lot to some of you. But you know most good chairs do recline because it's beneficial to open up this joint between your legs and your upper body for better breathing and better flow. So that if you sit down on my chair  whether you're five feet tall or six foot six  it always deals with your weight and transfers the amount of force required to recline in a way that you don't have to look for something to adjust. I'll tell you right up front  this is a trade off. There are drawbacks to this. One is  you can't accommodate everybody. There are some very light people  some extremely heavy people  maybe people with a lot of bulk up top. They begin to fall off the end of your chart. But the compromise  I felt  was in my favor because most people don't adjust their chairs. They will sit in them forever. I had somebody on the bus out to the racetrack tell me about his sister calling him. He said she had one of the new  better chairs. She said   Oh I love it.  She said   But it's too high.  So he said   Well I'll come over and look at it.  He came over and looked at it. He reached down. He pulled a lever. And the chair sank down. She said   Oh it's wonderful. How did you do that   And he showed her the lever. Well  that's typical of a lot of us working in chairs. And why should you get a    page manual about how to run a chair  I had one for a wristwatch once.    pages. Anyway  I felt that it was important that you didn't have to make an adjustment in order to get this kind of action. The other thing I felt was that armrests had never really been properly approached from the standpoint of how much of an aid they could be to your work life. But I felt it was too much to ask to have to adjust each individual armrest in order to get it where you wanted. So I spent a long time. I said I worked eight or nine years on it. And each of these things went along sort of in parallel but incrementally were a problem of their own. I worked a long time on figuring out how to move the arms over a much greater arc    that is up and down    and make them a lot easier  so that you didn't have to use a button. And so after many trials  many failures  we came up with a very simple arrangement in which we could just move one arm or the other. And they go up easily. And stop where you want. You can put them down  essentially out of the way. No arms at all. Or you can pull them up where you want them. And this was another thing that I felt  while not nearly as romantic as Cary Grant  nevertheless begins to grab a little bit of aesthetic operation  aesthetic performance into a product. The next area that was of interest to me was the fact that reclining was a very important factor. And the more you can recline  in a way  the better it is. The more the angle between here and here opens up    and nowadays  with a screen in front of you  you don't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline  so we keep it at more or less the same level    but you transfer weight off your tailbones. Would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tailbone  You feel that bone under there  Just your own. There's two of them  one on either side. All the weight of your upper torso    your arms  your head    goes right down through your back  your spine  into those bones when you sit. And that's a lot of load. Just relieving your arms with armrests takes    percent of that load off. Now that  if your spine is not held in a good position  will help bend your spine the wrong way  and so on. So to unload that great weight    if that indeed exists    you can recline. When you recline you take away a lot of that load off your bottom end  and transfer it to your back. At the same time  as I say  you open up this joint. And breathability is good. But to do that  if you have any amount of recline  it gets to the point where you need a headrest because nearly always  automatically hold your head in a vertical position  see  As I recline  my head says more or less vertical. Well if you're reclined a great deal  you have to use muscle force to hold your head there. So that's where a headrest comes in. Now headrest is a challenge because you want it to adjust enough so that it'll fit  you know  a tall guy and a short girl. So here we are. I've got five inches of adjustment here in order to get the headrest in the right place. But then I knew from experience and looking around in offices where there were chairs with headrests that nobody would ever bother to reach back and turn a knob and adjust the headrest to put it in position. And you need it in a different position when you're upright  then when you're reclined. So I knew that had to be solved  and had to be automatic. So if you watch this chair as I recline  the headrest comes up to meet my neck. Ideally you want to put the head support in the cranial area  right there. So that part of it took a long time to work out. And there is a variety of other things  the shape of the cushions  the gel we put. We stole the idea from bicycle seats  and put gel in the cushions and in the armrests to absorb point load    distributes the loading so you don't get hard spots. You cant hit your elbow on bottom. And I did want to demonstrate the fact that the chair can accommodate people. While you're sitting in it you can adjust it down for the five footer  or you can adjust it for the six foot six guy    all within the scope of a few simple adjustments. I want to talk about the election. For the first time in the United States  a predominantly white group of voters voted for an African American candidate for President. And in fact Barack Obama did quite well. He won     electoral votes. And he won about    million popular votes more than any other presidential candidate    of any race  of any party    in history. If you compare how Obama did against how John Kerry had done four years earlier    Democrats really like seeing this transition here  where almost every state becomes bluer  becomes more democratic    even states Obama lost  like out west  those states became more blue. In the south  in the northeast  almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions here and there. One exception is in Massachusetts. That was John Kerry's home state. No big surprise  Obama couldn't do better than Kerry there. Or in Arizona  which is John McCain's home  Obama didn't have much improvement. But there is also this part of the country  kind of in the middle region here. This kind of Arkansas  Tennessee  Oklahoma  West Virginia region. Now if you look at '    Bill Clinton    the last Democrat to actually win    how he did in '    you see real big differences in this part of the country right here  the kind of Appalachians  Ozarks  highlands region  as I call it     or    point swings from how Bill Clinton did in '   to how Obama did in     . Yes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas  but these are very  very profound differences. So  when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas  you know. There is a book written called   What's the Matter with Kansas   But really the question here    Obama did relatively well in Kansas. He lost badly but every Democrat does. He lost no worse than most people do. But yeah  what's the matter with Arkansas  And when we think of Arkansas we tend to have pretty negative connotations. We think of a bunch of rednecks  quote  unquote  with guns. And we think people like this probably don't want to vote for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama. We think it's a matter of race. And is this fair  Are we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas  and this part of the country  And the answer is  it is at least partially fair. We know that race was a factor  and the reason why we know that is because we asked those people. Actually we didn't ask them  but when they conducted exit polls in every state  in    states  out of the     they asked a question  that was pretty direct  about race. They asked this question. In deciding your vote for President today  was the race of the candidate a factor  We're looking for people that said   Yes  race was a factor  moreover it was an important factor  in my decision   and people who voted for John McCain as a result of that factor  maybe in combination with other factors  and maybe alone. We're looking for this behavior among white voters or  really  non black voters. So you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question. In Louisiana  about one in five white voters said   Yes  one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama is because he was an African American.  If those people had voted for Obama  even half of them  Obama would have won Louisiana safely. Same is true with  I think  all of these states you see on the top of the list. Meanwhile  California  New York  we can say   Oh we're enlightened  but you know  certainly a much lower incidence of this admitted  I suppose  manifestation of racially based voting. Here is the same data on a map. You kind of see the relationship between the redder states of where more people responded and said   Yes  Barack Obama's race was a problem for me.  You see  comparing the map to '    you see an overlap here. This really seems to explain why Barack Obama did worse in this one part of the country. So we have to ask why. Is racism predictable in some way  Is there something driving this  Is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas that we don't understand  and Kentucky  Or are there more systematic factors at work  And so we can look at a bunch of different variables. These are things that economists and political scientists look at all the time    things like income  and religion  education. Which of these seem to drive this manifestation of racism in this big national experiment we had on November  th  And there are a couple of these that have strong predictive relationships  one of which is education  where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red  and you see this part of the country  the kind of Appalachians region  is less educated. It's just a fact. And you see the relationship there with the racially based voting patterns. The other variable that's important is the type of neighborhood that you live in. States that are more rural    even to some extent of the states like New Hampshire and Maine    they exhibit a little bit of this racially based voting against Barack Obama. So it's the combination of these two things  it's education and the type of neighbors that you have  which we'll talk about more in a moment. And the thing about states like Arkansas and Tennessee is that they're both very rural  and they are educationally impoverished. So yes  racism is predictable. These things  among maybe other variables  but these things seem to predict it. We're going to drill down a little bit more now  into something called the General Social Survey. This is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year. And they ask a series of really interesting questions. In      they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes. One simple question they asked is   Does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood   We can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different. In cites  about    percent of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race  but in rural communities  only about    percent. Probably because if you live on a farm  you might not have a lot of neighbors  period. But nevertheless  you're not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you. So what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors    or  really  some neighbor of another race    and people who have only white neighbors. And we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes  not a lot of difference. This was eight years ago  some people were more Republican back then. But you see Democrats versus Republican  not a big difference based on who your neighbors are. And even some questions about race    for example affirmative action  which is kind of a political question  a policy question about race  if you will    not much difference here. Affirmative action is not very popular frankly  with white voters  period. But people with black neighbors and people with mono racial neighborhoods feel no differently about it really. But if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will   Do you favor a law banning interracial marriage   There is a big difference. People who don't have neighbors of a different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial marriage as people who do. Just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you. And likewise they asked  not in       but in the same survey in        Would you not vote for a qualified black president   You see people without neighbors who are African American who were much more likely to say   That would give me a problem.  So it's really not even about urban versus rural. It's about who you live with. Racism is predictable. And it's predicted by interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you  people of other races. So if you want to address it  the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races. I have a couple of very obvious  I suppose  ideas for maybe how to do that. I'm a big fan of cities. Especially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable  and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups. I think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking  the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis. But also not everyone wants to live in a city  certainly not a city like New York. So we can think more about things like street grids. This is the neighborhood where I grew up in East Lansing  Michigan. It's a traditional Midwestern community  which means you have real grid. You have real neighborhoods and real trees  and real streets you can walk on. And you interact a lot with your neighbors    people you like  people you might not know. And as a result it's a very tolerant community  which is different  I think  than something like this  which is in Schaumburg  Illinois  where every little set of houses has their own cul de sac and drive through Starbucks and stuff like that. I think that actually this type of urban design  which became more prevalent in the     s and     s    I think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under Ronald Reagan. But also here is another idea we have    is an intercollegiate exchange program where you have students going from New York abroad. But frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from NYU  have them go study for a semester at the University of Arkansas  and vice versa. Do it at the high school level. Literally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from another part of the country  or of another racial group. I think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise. But the point is  this is all good news  because when something is predictable  it is what I call designable. You can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem  even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism. If we understand the root causes of the behavior and where it manifests itself and where it doesn't  we can start to design solutions to it. So that's all I have to say. Thank you very much. So I'm here to tell you a story of success from Africa. A year and a half ago  four of the five people who are full time members at Ushahidi  which means  testimony  in Swahili  were TED Fellows. A year ago in Kenya we had post election violence. And in that time we prototyped and built  in about three days  a system that would allow anybody with a mobile phone to send in information and reports on what was happening around them. We took what we knew about Africa  the default device  the mobile phone  as our common denominator  and went from there. We got reports like this. This is just a couple of them from January   th  last year. And our system was rudimentary. It was very basic. It was a mash up that used data that we collected from people  and we put it on our map. But then we decided we needed to do something more. We needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world. And so there is a team of developers from all over Africa  who are part of this team now    from Ghana  from Malawi  from Kenya. There is even some from the U.S. We're building for smartphones  so that it can be used in the developed world  as well as the developing world. We are realizing that this is true. If it works in Africa then it will work anywhere. And so we build for it in Africa first and then we move to the edges. It's now been deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It's being used by NGOs all over East Africa  small NGOs doing their own little projects. Just this last month it was deployed by Al Jazeera in Gaza. But that's actually not what I'm here to talk about. I'm here to talk about the next big thing  because what we're finding out is that we have this capacity to report eyewitness accounts of what's going on in real time. We're seeing this in events like Mumbai recently  where it's so much easier to report now than it is to consume it. There is so much information  what do you do  This is the Twitter reports for over three days just covering Mumbai. How do you decide what is important  What is the veracity level of what you're looking at  So what we find is that there is this great deal of wasted crisis information because there is just too much information for us to actually do anything with right now. And what we're actually really concerned with is this first three hours. What we are looking at is the first three hours. How do we deal with that information that is coming in  You can't understand what is actually happening. On the ground and around the world people are still curious  and trying to figure out what is going on. But they don't know. So what we built of course  Ushahidi  is crowdsourcing this information. You see this with Twitter  too. You get this information overload. So you've got a lot of information. That's great. But now what  So we think that there is something interesting we can do here. And we have a small team who is working on this. We think that we can actually create a crowdsourced filter. Take the crowd and apply them to the information. And by rating it and by rating the different people who submit information  we can get refined results and weighted results. So that we have a better understanding of the probability of something being true or not. This is the kind of innovation that is  quite frankly    it's interesting that it's coming from Africa. It's coming from places that you wouldn't expect. From young  smart developers. And it's a community around it that has decided to build this. So  thank you very much. And we are very happy to be part of the TED family. I'm going to read a few strips. These are  most of these are from a monthly page I do in and architecture and design magazine called Metropolis. And the first story is called  The Faulty Switch.  Another beautifully designed new building ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch. It's fine during the day when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight. But at dusk everything changes. The architect spent hundreds of hours designing the burnished brass switchplates for his new office tower. And then left it to a contractor to install these    cent switches behind them. We know instinctively where to reach when we enter a dark room. We automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward. But the sound we are greeted with  as the room is bathed in the simulated glow of late afternoon light  recalls to mind a dirty men's room in the rear of a Greek coffee shop. This sound colors our first impression of any room  it can't be helped. But where does this sound  commonly described as a click  come from  Is it simply the byproduct of a crude mechanical action  Or is it an imitation of one half the set of sounds we make to express disappointment  The often dental consonant of no Indo European language. Or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach  In the     s they tried their best to muffle this sound with mercury switches and silent knob controls. But today these improvements seem somehow inauthentic. The click is the modern triumphal clarion proceeding us through life  announcing our entry into every lightless room. The sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature. It has a deep melancholy ring. Children don't like it. It's why they leave lights on around the house.  Laughter  Adults find it comforting. But wouldn't it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship  Or the recorded crowing of a rooster  Or the distant peel of thunder  Thomas Edison went through thousands of unlikely substances before he came upon the right one for the filament of his electric light bulb. Why have we settled so quickly for the sound of its switch  That's the end of that. The next story is called  In Praise of the Taxpayer.  That so many of the city's most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom  is cause for celebration. These one or two story structures  designed to yield only enough income to cover the taxes on the land on which they stand  were not meant to be permanent buildings. Yet for one reason or another they have confounded the efforts of developers to be combined into lots suitable for high rise construction. Although they make no claim to architectural beauty  they are  in their perfect temporariness  a delightful alternative to the large scale structures that might someday take their place. The most perfect examples occupy corner lots. They offer a pleasant respite from the high density development around them. A break of light and air  an architectural biding of time. So buried in signage are these structures  that it often takes a moment to distinguish the modern specially constructed taxpayer from its neighbor  the small commercial building from an earlier century  whose upper floors have been sealed  and whose groundfloor space now functions as a taxpayer. The few surfaces not covered by signs are often clad in a distinctive  dark green gray  striated aluminum siding. Take out sandwich shops  film processing drop offs  peep shows and necktie stores. Now these provisional structures have  in some cases  remained standing for the better part of a human lifetime. The temporary building is a triumph of modern industrial organization  a healthy sublimation of the urge to build  and proof that not every architectural idea need be set in stone. That's the end. And the next story is called   On the Human Lap.  For the ancient Egyptians the lap was a platform upon which to place the earthly possessions of the dead       cubits from foot to knee. It was not until the   th century that an Italian painter recognized the lap as a Grecian temple  upholstered in flesh and cloth. Over the next     years we see the infant Christ go from a sitting to a standing position on the Virgin's lap  and then back again. Every child recapitulates this ascension  straddling one or both legs  sitting sideways  or leaning against the body. From there  to the modern ventriloquist's dummy  is but a brief moment in history. You were late for school again this morning. The ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap. The illusion of speech follows incidentally. What have you got to say for yourself  Jimmy  As adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance. We have fading memories of that provisional temple  erected each time an adult sat down. On a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on. It is children and teenage girls who are most keenly aware of its architectural beauty. They understand the structural integrity of a deep avuncular lap  as compared to the shaky arrangement of a neurotic niece in high heels. The relationship between the lap and its owner is direct and intimate. I envision a    story      unit residential high rise    a reason to consider the mental health of any architect before granting an important commission. The bathrooms and kitchens will  of course  have no windows. The lap of luxury is an architectural construct of childhood  which we seek  in vain  as adults  to employ. That's the end. The next story is called  The Haverpiece Collection  A nondescript warehouse  visible for a moment from the northbound lanes of the Prykushko Expressway  serves as the temporary resting place for the Haverpiece collection of European dried fruit. The profound convolutions on the surface of a dried cherry. The foreboding sheen of an extra large date. Do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries  Where everything was displayed in poorly labeled roach proof bins. Pears dried in the form of genital organs. Apricot halves like the ears of cherubim. In      the unsold stock was purchased by Maurice Haverpiece  a wealthy prune juice bottler  and consolidated to form the core collection. As an art form it lies somewhere between still life painting and plumbing. Upon his death in       a quarter of the items were sold off for compote to a high class hotel restaurant. Unsuspecting guests were served stewed turn of the century Turkish figs for breakfast. The rest of the collection remains here  stored in plain brown paper bags until funds can be raised to build a permanent museum and study center. A shoe made of apricot leather for the daughter of a czar. That's the end. Thank you. The first half of the   th century was an absolute disaster in human affairs  a cataclysm. We had the First World War  the Great Depression  the Second World War and the rise of the communist nations. And each one of these forces split the world  tore the world apart  divided the world. And they threw up walls    political walls  trade walls  transportation walls  communication walls  iron curtains    which divided peoples and nations. It was only in the second half of the   th century that we slowly began to pull ourselves out of this abyss. Trade walls began to come tumbling down. Here are some data on tariffs  starting at    percent  coming down to less than   percent. We globalized the world. And what does that mean  It means that we extended cooperation across national boundaries  we made the world more cooperative. Transportation walls came tumbling down. You know in      the typical ship carried       to        tons worth of goods. Today a container ship can carry         tons  it can be manned with a smaller crew  and unloaded faster than ever before. Communication walls  I don't have to tell you    the Internet    have come tumbling down. And of course the iron curtains  political walls have come tumbling down. Now all of this has been tremendous for the world. Trade has increased. Here is just a little bit of data. In       exports from China to the United States     billion dollars. By       over     billion dollars. And perhaps most remarkably  at the beginning of the   st century  really for the first time in modern history  growth extended to almost all parts of the world. So China  I've already mentioned  beginning around       around the time of the death of Mao  growth    ten percent a year. Year after year after year  absolutely incredible. Never before in human history have so many people been raised out of such great poverty as happened in China. China is the world's greatest anti poverty program over the last three decades. India  starting a little bit later  but in       begetting tremendous growth. Incomes at that time less than        per year. And over the next    years have almost tripled. Growth of six percent a year. Absolutely incredible. Now Africa  Sub Saharan Africa    Sub Saharan Africa has been the area of the world most resistant to growth. And we can see the tragedy of Africa in the first few bars here. Growth was negative. People were actually getting poorer than their parents  and sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been. But at the end of the   th century  the beginning of the   st century  we saw growth in Africa. And I think  as you'll see  there's reasons for optimism  because I believe that the best is yet to come. Now why. On the cutting edge today it's new ideas which are driving growth. And by that I mean it's products for which the research and development costs are really high  and the manufacturing costs are low. More than ever before it is these types of ideas which are driving growth on the cutting edge. Now ideas have this amazing property. Thomas Jefferson  I think  really expressed this quite well. He said   He who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself  without lessening mine. As he who lights his candle at mine receives light without darkening me.  Or to put it slightly differently  one apple feeds one man  but an idea can feed the world. Now this is not new. This is practically not new to TEDsters. This is practically the model of TED. But what is new is that the greater function of ideas is going to drive growth even more than ever before. This provides a reason why trade and globalization are even more important  more powerful than ever before  and are going to increase growth more than ever before. And to explain why this is so  I have a question. Suppose that there are two diseases  one of them is rare  the other one is common  but if they are not treated they are equally severe. If you had to choose  which would you rather have  the common disease or the rare disease  Common  the common    I think that's absolutely right  and why  Because there are more drugs to treat common diseases than there are to treat rare diseases. The reason for this is incentives. It costs about the same to produce a new drug whether that drug treats       people          people  or a million people. But the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people. So the incentives are much larger to produce drugs which treat more people. To put this differently  larger markets save lives. In this case misery truly does love company. Now think about the following  if China and India were as rich as the United States is today  the market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now. Now we are not there yet  but it is happening. As other countries become richer the demand for these pharmaceuticals is going to increase tremendously. And that means an increase incentive to do research and development  which benefits everyone in the world. Larger markets increase the incentive to produce all kinds of ideas  whether it's software  whether it's a computer chip  whether it's a new design. For the Hollywood people in the audience  this even explains why action movies have larger budgets than comedies  it's because action movies translate easier into other languages and other cultures  so the market for those movies is larger. People are willing to invest more  and the budgets are larger. Alright. Well if larger markets increase the incentive to produce new ideas  how do we maximize that incentive  It's by having one world market  by globalizing the world. The way I like to put this is  one idea. Ideas are meant to be shared  so one idea can serve one world  one market. One idea  one world  one market. Well how else can we create new ideas  That's one reason. Globalize trade. How else can we create new ideas  Well  more idea creators. Now idea creators  they come from all walks of life. Artists and innovators    many of the people you've seen on this stage. I'm going to focus on scientists and engineers because I have some data on that  and I'm a data person. Now  today  less than one tenth of one percent of the world's population are scientists and engineers. The United States has been an idea leader. A large fraction of those people are in the United States. But the U.S. is losing its idea leadership. And for that I am very grateful. That is a good thing. It is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader because for too long the United States  and a handful of other developed countries  have shouldered the entire burden of research and development. But consider the following  if the world as a whole were as wealthy as the United States is now there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers contributing to ideas which benefit everyone  which are shared by everyone. I think of the great Indian mathematician  Ramanujan. How many Ramanujans are there in India today toiling in the fields  barely able to feed themselves  when they could be feeding the world  Now we're not there yet. But it is going to happen in this century. The real tragedy of the last century is this  if you think about the world's population as a giant computer  a massively parallel processor  then the great tragedy has been that billions of our processors have been off line. But in this century China is coming on line. India is coming on line. Africa is coming on line. We will see an Einstein in Africa in this century. Here is just some data. This is China.       less than one million new university students in China per year        over five million. Now think what this means. This means we all benefit when another country gets rich. We should not fear other countries becoming wealthy. That is something that we should embrace    a wealthy China  a wealthy India  a wealthy Africa. We need a greater demand for ideas    those larger markets I was talking about earlier    and a greater supply of ideas for the world. Now you can see some of the reasons why I'm optimistic. Globalization is increasing the demand for ideas  the incentive to create new ideas. Investments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas. In fact if you look at world history you can see some reasons for optimism. From about the beginnings of humanity to       zero economic growth  nothing.      to       maybe a little bit of economic growth  but less in a century than you expect to see in a year today.     s  maybe one percent. Twentieth century  a little bit over two percent. Twenty first century could easily be  .   even higher percent. Even at that rate  by      average GDP per capita in the world will be         . That's not U.S. GDP per capita  which will be over a million  but world GDP per capita            . That's not that far. We won't make it. But some of our grandchildren probably will. And I should say  I think this is a rather modest prediction. In Kurzweilian terms this is gloomy. In Kurzweilian terms I'm like the Eeyore of economic growth. Alright what about problems  What about a great depression  Well let's take a look. Let's take a look at the Great Depression. Here is GDP per capita from      to     . Now let's imagine that you were an economist in       trying to forecast future growth for the United States  not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff  not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the   th century. What would you have predicted  not knowing this  If you had based your prediction  your forecast on      to      you'd have predicted something like this. If you'd been a little more optimistic    say  based upon the Roaring Twenties    you'd have said this. So what actually happened  We went off a cliff but we recovered. In fact in the second half of the   th century growth was even higher than anything you would have predicted based upon the first half of the   th century. So growth can wash away even what appears to be a great depression. Alright. What else  Oil. Oil. This was a big topic. When I was writing up my notes oil was      per barrel. So people were asking a question. They were saying   Is China drinking our milkshake   And there is some truth to this  in the sense that we have something of a finite resource  and increased growth is going to push up demand for that. But I think I don't have to tell this audience that a higher price of oil is not necessarily a bad thing. Moreover  as everyone knows  look    it's energy  not oil  which counts. And higher oil prices mean a greater incentive to invest in energy R D. You can see this in the data. As oil prices go up  energy patents go up. The world is much better equipped to overcome an increase in the price of oil today  than ever in the past  because of what I'm talking about. One idea  one world  one market. So I'm optimistic so long as we hew to these two ideas  to keep globalizing world markets  keep extending cooperation across national boundaries  and keep investing in education. Now the United States has a particularly important role to play in this  to keep our education system globalized  to keep our education system open to students from all over the world  because our education system is the candle that other students come to light their own candles. Now remember here what Jefferson said. Jefferson said   When they come and light their candles at ours  they gain light  and we are not darkened.  But Jefferson wasn't quite right  was he  Because the truth is  when they light their candles at ours  there is twice as much light available for everyone. So my view is  Be optimistic. Spread the ideas. Spread the light. Thank you. This machine  which we all have residing in our skulls  reminds me of an aphorism  of a comment of Woody Allen to ask about what is the very best thing to have within your skull. And it's this machine. And it's constructed for change. It's all about change. It confers on us the ability to do things tomorrow that we can't do today  things today that we couldn't do yesterday. And of course it's born stupid. The last time you were in the presence of a baby    this happens to be my granddaughter  Mitra. Isn't she fabulous  But nonetheless when she popped out despite the fact that her brain had actually been progressing in its development for several months before on the basis of her experiences in the womb    nonetheless she had very limited abilities  as does every infant at the time of normal  natural full term birth. If we were to assay her perceptual abilities  they would be crude. There is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on. In fact there is little evidence that there is any cognitive ability in a very young infant. Infants don't respond to much. There is not really much of an indication in fact that there is a person on board. And they can only in a very primitive way  and in a very limited way control their movements. It would be several months before this infant could do something as simple as reach out and grasp under voluntary control an object and retrieve it  usually to the mouth. And it will be some months beforeward  and we see a long steady progression of the evolution from the first wiggles  to rolling over  and sitting up  and crawling  standing  walking  before we get to that magical point in which we can motate in the world. And yet  when we look forward in the brain we see really remarkable advance. By this age the brain can actually store. It has stored  recorded  can fastly retrieve the meanings of thousands  tens of thousands of objects  actions  and their relationships in the world. And those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands  potentially millions of ways. By this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities. And it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills. This brain is very much a thinking machine. And by this age there is absolutely no question that this brain  it has a person on board. And in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self development. And by this age we see a remarkable evolution in its capacity to control movement. Now movement has advanced to the point where it can actually control movement simultaneously  in a complex sequence  in complex ways as would be required for example for playing a complicated game  like soccer. Now this boy can bounce a soccer ball on his head. And where this boy comes from  Sao Paulo  Brazil  about    percent of boys of his age have this ability. You could go out into the community in Monterey  and you'd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability. And if you did he'd probably be from Sao Paulo. That's all another way of saying that our individual skills and abilities are very much shaped by our environments. That environment extends into our contemporary culture  the thing our brain is challenged with. Because what we've done in our personal evolutions is build up a large repertoire of specific skills and abilities that are specific to our own individual histories. And in fact they result in a wonderful differentiation in humankind  in the way that  in fact  no two of us are quite alike. Every one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities that all derive out of the plasticity  the adaptability of this really remarkable adaptive machine. In an adult brain of course we've built up a large repertoire of mastered skills and abilities that we can perform more or less automatically from memory  and that define us as acting  moving  thinking creatures. Now we study this  as the nerdy  laboratory  university based scientists that we are  by engaging the brains of animals like rats  or monkeys  or of this particularly curious creature    one of the more bizarre forms of life on earth    to engage them in learning new skills and abilities. And we try to track the changes that occur as the new skill or ability is acquired. In fact we do this in individuals of any age  in these different species    that is to say from infancies  infancy up to adulthood and old age. So we might engage a rat  for example  to acquire a new skill or ability that might involve the rat using its paw to master particular manual grasp behaviors just like we might examine a child and their ability to acquire the sub skills  or the general overall skill of accomplishing something like mastering the ability to read. Or you might look in an older individual who has mastered a complex set of abilities that might relate to reading musical notation or performing the mechanical acts of performance that apply to musical performance. From these studies we defined two great epochs of the plastic history of the brain. The first great epoch is commonly called the  Critical Period.  And that is the period in which the brain is setting up in its initial form its basic processing machinery. This is actually a period of dramatic change in which it doesn't take learning  per se  to drive the initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain. All it takes for example in the sound domain  is exposure to sound. And the brain actually is at the mercy of the sound environment in which it is reared. So for example I can rear an animal in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound  a repertoire of sound that I make up  that I make  just by exposure  artificially important to the animal and its young brain. And what I see is that the animal's brain sets up its initial processing of that sound in a form that's idealized  within the limits of its processing achievements to represent it in an organized and orderly way. The sound doesn't have to be valuable to the animal  I could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable  like the sounds that simulate the sounds of a native language of a child. And I see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized    specialized for that complex array  a repertoire of sounds. It actually exaggerates their separateness of representation  in multi dimensional neuronal representational terms. Or I can expose the animal to a completely meaningless and destructive sound. I can raise an animal under conditions that would be equivalent to raising a baby under a moderately loud ceiling fan  in the presence of continuous noise. And when I do that I actually specialize the brain to be a master processor for that meaningless sound. And I frustrate its ability to represent any meaningful sound as a consequence. Such things in the early history of babies occur in real babies. And they account for  for example the beautiful evolution of a language specific processor in every normally developing baby. And so they also account for development of defective processing in a substantial population of children who are more limited  as a consequence  in their language abilities at an older age. Now in this early period of plasticity the brain actually changes outside of a learning context. I don't have to be paying attention to what I hear. The input doesn't really have to be meaningful. I don't have to be in a behavioral context. This is required so the brain sets up it's processing so that it can act differentially  so that it can act selectively  so that the creature that wears it  that carries it  can begin to operate on it in a selective way. In the next great epoch of life  which applies for most of life  the brain is actually refining its machinery as it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities. And in this epoch  which extends from late in the first year of life to death  it's actually doing this under behavioral control. And that's another way of saying the brain has strategies that define the significance of the input to the brain. And it's focusing on skill after skill  or ability after ability  under specific attentional control. It's a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved or whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior. This is actually very powerful. This lifelong capacity for plasticity  for brain change  is powerfully expressed. It is the basis of our real differentiation  one individual from another. You can look down in the brain of an animal that's engaged in a specific skill  and you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels. So here is a very simple experiment. It was actually conducted about five years ago in collaboration with scientists from the University of Provence in Marseilles. It's a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained in a task that involves it manipulating a tool that's equivalent in its difficulty to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon. The monkey actually mastered the task in about     practice tries. So in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all. It had a success rate of about one in eight tries. Those tries were elaborate. Each attempt was substantially different from the other. But the monkey gradually developed a strategy. And     or so tries later the monkey is performing it flawlessly    never fails. He's successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time. At this point the task is being performed in a beautifully stereotyped way  very beautifully regulated and highly repeated  trial to trial. We can look down in the brain of the monkey. And we see that it's distorted. We can track these changes  and have tracked these changes in many such behaviors across time. And here we see the distortion reflected in the map of the skin surfaces of the hand of the monkey. Now this is a map  down in the surface of the brain  in which  in a very elaborate experiment we've reconstructed the responses  location by location  in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons. We see here a reconstruction of how the hand is represented in the brain. We've actually distorted the map by the exercise. And that is indicated in the pink. We have a couple fingertip surfaces that are larger. These are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool. If we look at the selectivity of responses in the cortex of the monkey  we see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics which represents input from the skin of the fingertips that are engaged. In other words there is still a single  simple representation of the fingertips in this most organized of cortical areas of the surface of the skin of the body. Monkey has like you have. And yet now it's represented in substantially finer grain. The monkey is getting more detailed information from these surfaces. And that is an unknown    unsuspected  maybe  by you    part of acquiring the skill or ability. Now actually we've looked in several different cortical areas in the monkey learning this task. And each one of them changes in ways that are specific to the skill or ability. So for example we can look to the cortical area that represents input that's controlling the posture of the monkey. We look in cortical areas that control specific movements  and the sequences of movements that are required in the behavior  and so forth. They are all remodeled. They all become specialized for the task at hand. There are    or    cortical areas that are changed specifically when you learn a simple skill like this. And that represents in your brain  really massive change. It represents the change in a reliable way of the responses of tens of millions  possibly hundreds of millions of neurons in your brain. It represents changes of hundreds of millions  possibly billions of synaptic connections in your brain. This is constructed by physical change. And the level of construction that occurs is massive. Think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general. Or acquiring their native language abilities. The changes are massive. What it's all about is the selective representations of things that are important to the brain. Because in most of the life of the brain this is under control of behavioral context. It's what you pay attention to. It's what's rewarding to you. It's what the brain regards  itself  as positive and important to you. It's all about cortical processing and forebrain specialization. And that underlies your specialization. That is why you  in your many skills and abilities  are a unique specialist  a specialist that's vastly different in your physical brain in detail than the brain of an individual     years ago  enormously different in the details from the brain of the average individual       years ago. Now  one of the characteristics of this change process is that information is always related to other inputs or information that is occurring in immediate time  in context. And that's because the brain is constructing representations of things that are correlated in little moments of time and that relate to one another in little moments of successive time. The brain is recording all information and driving all change in temporal context. Now overwhelmingly the most powerful context that's occurred in your brain is you. Billions of events have occurred in your history that are related in time to yourself as the receiver  or yourself as the actor  yourself as the thinker  yourself as the mover. Billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in from the surface of your body that are always associated with you as the receiver  and that result in the embodiment of you. You are constructed  your self is constructed from these billions of events. It's constructed. It's created in your brain. And it's created in the brain via physical change. This is a marvelously constructed thing that results in individual form because each one of us has vastly different histories  and vastly different experiences  that drive in to us this marvelous differentiation of self  of personhood. Now we've used this research to try to understand not just how a normal person develops  and elaborates their skills and abilities  but also try to understand the origins of impairment  and the origins of differences or variations that might limit the capacities of a child  or an adult. I'm going to talk about using these strategies to actually design brain plasticity based approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child that increases the competence of the child as a language receiver and user and  thereafter  as a reader. And I'm going to talk about experiments that involve actually using this brain science  first of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age. And then  by using it in a targeted approach we're going to try to differentiate the machinery to recover function in old age. So the first example I'm going to talk about relates to children with learning impairments. We now have a large body of literature that demonstrates that the fundamental problem that occurs in the majority of children that have early language impairments  and that are going to struggle to learn to read  is that their language processor is created in a defective form. And the reason that it rises in a defective form is because early in the baby's brain's life the machine process is noisy. It's that simple. It's a signal to noise problem. Okay  And there are a lot of things that contribute to that. There are numerous inherited faults that could make the machine process noisier. Now I might say the noise problem could also occur on the basis of information provided in the world from the ears. If any    those of you who are older in the audience know that when I was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate was born with what we called mental retardation. We knew that they were going to be slow cognitively  we knew they were going to struggle to learn to develop normal language abilities  and we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read. Most of them would be intellectual and academic failures. That's disappeared. That no longer applies. That inherited weakness  that inherited condition has evaporated. We don't hear about that anymore. Where did it go  Well  it was understood by a Dutch surgeon  about    years ago  that if you simply fix the problem early enough  when the brain is still in this initial plastic period so it can set up this machinery adequately  in this initial set up time in the critical period  none of that happens. What are you doing by operating on the cleft palate to correct it  You're basically opening up the tubes that drain fluid from the middle ears  which have had them reliably full. Every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled. It's degraded. The child's native language is such a case is not English. It's not Japanese. It's muffled English. It's degraded Japanese. It's crap. And the brain specializes for it. It creates a representation of language crap. And then the child is stuck with it. Now the crap doesn't just happen in the ear. It can also happen in the brain. The brain itself can be noisy. It's commonly noisy. There are many inherited faults that can make it noisier. And the native language for a child with such a brain is degraded. It's not English. It's noisy English. And that results in defective representations of sounds of words    not normal    a different strategy  by a machine that has different time constants and different space constants. And you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants. They are about an order of magnitude longer  about    times longer in duration on average  than in a normal child. Space constants are about three times greater. Such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits in this domain. Of course they will. Because as a receiver of language  they are receiving it and representing it  and in information it's representing crap. And they are going to have poor reading skills. Because reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds into this orthographic or visual representational form. If you don't have a brain representation of word sounds that translation makes no sense. And you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology. Then these children increasingly in evaluation after evaluation  in their operations in language  and their operations in reading    we document that abnormal neurology. The point is is that you can train the brain out of this. A way to think about this is you can actually re refine the processing capacity of the machinery by changing it. Changing it in detail. It takes about    hours on the average. And we've accomplished that in about         kids today. Actually  probably about        children are being trained as we speak. And actually when you look at the impacts  the impacts are substantial. So here we're looking at the normal distribution. What we're most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution. This is from about       children. You can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution are moving into the middle or the right. This is in a broad assessment of their language abilities. This is like an IQ test for language. The impact in the distribution  if you trained every child in the United States  would be to shift the whole distribution to the right and narrow the distribution. This is a substantially large impact. Think of a classroom of children in the language arts. Think of the children on the slow side of the class. We have the potential to move most of those children to the middle or to the right side. In addition to accurate language training it also fixes memory and cognition speech fluency and speech production. And an important language dependent skill is enabled by this training    that is to say reading. And to a large extent it fixes the brain. You can look down in the brain of a child in a variety of tasks that scientists have at Stanford  and MIT  and UCSF  and UCLA  and a number of other institutions. And children operating in various language behaviors  or in various reading behaviors  you see for the most extent  for most children  their neuronal responses  complexly abnormal before you start  are normalized by the training. Now you can also take the same approach to address problems in aging. Where again the machinery is deteriorating now from competent machinery  it's going south. Noise is increasing in the brain. And learning modulation and control is deteriorating. And you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual and witness a change in the time constants and space constants with which  for example  the brain is representing language again. Just as the brain came out of chaos at the beginning  it's going back into chaos in the end. This results in declines in memory in cognition  and in postural ability and agility. It turns out you can train the brain of such an individual    this is a small population of such individuals    train equally intensively for about    hours. These are     to    year olds. And what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory  of their ability to remember things after a delay  of their ability to control their attention  their language abilities and visual spatial abilities. The overall neuropsychological index of these trained individuals in this population is about two standard deviations. That means that if you sit at the left side of the distribution  and I'm looking at your neuropyschological abilities  the average person has moved to the middle or the right side of the distribution. It means that most people who are at risk for senility  more or less immediately  are now in a protected position. My issues are to try to get to rescuing older citizens more completely and in larger numbers  because I think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale    and the same for kids. My main interest is how to elaborate this science to address other maladies. I'm specifically interested in things like autism  and cerebral palsy  these great childhood catastrophes. And in older age conditions like Parkinsonism  and in other acquired impairments like schizophrenia. Your issues as it relates to this science  is how to maintain your own high functioning learning machine. And of course  a well ordered life in which learning is a continuous part of it  is key. But also in your future is brain aerobics. Get ready for it. It's going to be a part of every life not too far in the future  just like physical exercise is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period. The other way that we will ultimately come to consider this literature and the science that is important to you is in a consideration of how to nurture yourself. Now that you know  now that science is telling us that you are in charge  that it's under your control  that your happiness  your well being  your abilities  your capacities  are capable of continuous modification  continuous improvement  and you're the responsible agent and party. Of course a lot of people will ignore this advice. It will be a long time before they really understand it. Now that's another issue and not my fault. Okay. Thank you. I should tell you that when I was asked to be here  I thought to myself that well  it's TED. And these TEDsters are    you know  as innocent as that name sounds    these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world. And what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough to justify my participation in something like that  And so I thought perhaps a really civilized sounding British accent might help things a bit. And then I thought no  no. I should just get up there and be myself and just talk the way I really talk because  after all  this is the great unveiling. And so I thought I'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you. Although many of you already know that I do speak the Queen's English because I am from Queens  New York. But the theme of this session  of course  is invention. And while I don't have any patents that I'm aware of  you will be meeting a few of my inventions today. I suppose it's fair to say that I am interested in the invention of self or selves. We're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits  unique developmental experiences  geographical and historical contexts. But then what  To what extent do we self construct  do we self invent  How do we self identify and how mutable is that identity  Like  what if one could be anyone at any time  Well my characters  like the ones in my shows  allow me to play with the spaces between those questions. And so I've brought a couple of them with me. And well  they're very excited. What I should tell you    what I should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little TED talks. So feel free to think of this as Sarah University. Okay. Okay. Oh  well. Oh  wonderful. Good evening everybody. Thank you so very much for having me here today. Ah  thank you very much. My name is Lorraine Levine. Oh my  There's so many of you. Hi sweetheart. Okay. Anyway  I am here because of a young girl  Sarah Jones. She's a very nice  young black girl. Well you know  she calls herself black    she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her. But anyway. She has me here because she puts me in her show  what she calls her one woman show. And you know what that means  of course. That means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work. But I don't mind. Frankly  I'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this  you know. Really  it's amazing. Not only  of course  the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries but the celebrities. There are so many celebrities running around here. I saw    Glenn Close I saw earlier. I love her. And she was getting a yogurt in the Google cafe. Isn't that adorable  So many others you see  they're just wonderful. It's lovely to know they're concerned  you know. And    oh  I saw Goldie Hawn. Oh  Goldie Hawn. I love her  too  she's wonderful. Yeah. You know  she's only half Jewish. Did you know that about her  Yeah. But even so  a wonderful talent.  Laughter  And I    you know  when I saw her  such a wonderful feeling. Yeah  she's lovely. But anyway  I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel. It's such an eye opening experience to be here. You're all so responsible for this world that we live in today. You know  I couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl. And you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time    you're all so young. You know  your parents must be very proud. But I    I also appreciate the diversity that you have here. I noticed it's very multicultural. You know  when you're standing up here  you can see all the different people. It's like a rainbow. It's okay to say rainbow. Yeah. I just    I can't keep up with whether you can say  you know  the different things. What are you allowed to say or not say  I just    I don't want to offend anybody. You know. But anyway  you know  I just think that to be here with all of you accomplished young people    literally  some of you  the architects building our brighter future. You know  it's heartening to me. Even though  quite frankly  some of your presentations are horrifying  absolutely horrifying. It's true. It's true. You know  between the environmental degradation and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about. And of course  we know it's all because of the    all the ... Well  I don't know how else to say it to you  so I'll just say it my way  the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the  you know  the bankers and the Wall Street. You know it. Anyway. The point is  I'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess. So I salute each of you and your stellar achievements. Thank you for all that you do. And congratulations on being such big makhers that you've become TED meisters. So  happy continued success. Congratulations. Mazel tov. Hi. Hi. Thank you everybody. Sorry  this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything  to be here right now. My name is Noraida. And I'm just    I'm so thrilled to be part of like your TED conference that you're doing and everything like that. I am Dominican American. Actually  you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic  otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City. But I don't know if there's any other Dominican people here  but I know that Juan Enriquez  he was here yesterday. And I think he's Mexican  so that's    honestly  that's close enough for me right now. So    I just    I'm sorry. I'm just trying not to be nervous because this is a very wonderful experience for me and everything. And I just    you know I'm not used to doing the public speaking. And whenever I get nervous I start to talk really fast. Nobody can understand nothing I'm saying  which is very frustrating for me  as you can imagine. I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath. But then on top of that  you know  Sarah Jones told me we only have    minutes. So then I'm like  should I be nervous  you know  because maybe it's better. And I'm just trying not to panic and freak out. So I like  take a deep breath. Okay. Sorry. So anyway  what I was trying to say is that I really love TED. Like  I love everything about this. It's amazing. Like  it's    I can't get over this right now. And  like  people would not believe  seriously  where I'm from  that this even exists. You know  like even  I mean I love like the name  the    TED. I mean I know it's a real person and everything  but I'm just saying that like  you know  I think it's very cool how it's also an acronym  you know  which is like  you know  is like very high concept and everything like that. I like that. And actually  I can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything. Because  actually  I'm a sophomore at college right now. At my school    actually I was part of co founding an organization  which is like a leadership thing  you know  like you guys  you would really like it and everything. And the organization is called DA BOMB  A and DA BOMB    not like what you guys can build and everything    it's like  DA BOMB  it means like Dominican    it's an acronym    Dominican American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies. So  I know  see  like the name is like a little bit long  but with the war on terror and everything  the Dean of Student Activities has asked us to stop saying DA BOMB and use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea  whatever. So  basically like DA BOMB    what Dominican American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does is  basically  we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me. I am a working mother  and I also go to school full time. And  you know  it's like    it's so important to have like role models out there. I mean  I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different  whatever. But like even at my job    like  I just got promoted. Right now it's very exciting actually for me because I'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director under the Senior Vice President for Business Development    that's my new title. So  but I think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me  like something like this is so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning. And if everybody  like all people really had access to that  it would be a very different world out there  as I know you know. So  I think all people  we need that  but especially  I look at people like me  you know like  I mean  Latinos    we're about to be the majority  in like two weeks. So  we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else. So  I'm very happy that you're  you know  doing this kind of thing  making the talks available online. That's very good. I love that. And I just    I love you guys. I love TED. And if you don't mind  privately now  in the future  I'm going to think of TED as an acronym for Technology  Entertainment and Dominicans. Thank you very much. So  that was Noraida  and just like Lorraine and everybody else you're meeting today  these are folks who are based on real people from my real life  friends  neighbors  family members. I come from a multicultural family. In fact  the older lady you just met  very  very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother's side. It's a long story  believe me. But on top of my family background  my parents also sent me to the United Nations school  where I encountered a plethora of new characters  including Alexandre  my French teacher  okay. Well  you know  it was beginner French  that I am taking with her  you know. And it was Madame Bousson  you know  she was very  French . It was like  you know  she was there in the class  you know  she was kind of typically French. You know  she was very chic  but she was very filled with ennui  you know. And she would be there  you know  kind of talking with the class  you know  talking about the  you know  the existential futility of life  you know. And we were only    years old  so it was not appropriate.  Laughter  But  German . Yes  I took German for three years   German   and it was quite the experience because I was the only black girl in the class  even in the UN school. Although  you know  it was wonderful. The teacher  Herr Schtopf  he never discriminated. Never. He always  always treated each of us  you know  equally unbearably during the class. So  there were the teachers and then there were my friends  classmates from everywhere  many of whom are still dear friends to this day. And they've inspired many characters as well. For example  a friend of mine. Well  I just wanted to quickly say good evening. My name is Praveen Manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity. Of course  TED  the reputation precedes itself all over the world. But  you know  I am originally from India  and I wanted to start by telling you that once Sarah Jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to TED in California  originally  I was very pleased and  frankly  relieved because  you know  I am a human rights advocate. And usually my work  it takes me to Washington D.C. And there  I must attend these meetings  mingling with some tiresome politicians  trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown.  Laughter  So  you can just imagine    right. So  but I'm thrilled to be joining all of you here. I wish we had more time together  but that's for another time. Okay  Great. And  sadly  I don't think we'll have time for you to meet everybody I brought  but    I'm trying to behave myself  it's my first time here. But I do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize  if you saw  Bridge and Tunnel.  Uh  well  thank you. Good evening. My name is Pauline Ning  and first I want to tell you that I'm    of course I am a member of the Chinese community in New York. But when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED  I said  well  you know  first  I don't know that  you know    before two years ago  you would not find me in front of an audience of people  much less like this because I did not like to give speeches because I feel that  as an immigrant  I do not have good English skills for speaking. But then  I decided  just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger  I try anyway. My daughter    my daughter wrote that  she told me   Always start your speech with humor.  But my background    I want to tell you story only briefly. My husband and I  we brought our son and daughter here in     s to have the freedom we cannot have in China at that time. And we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition  but it's very hard. You know  as immigrant  I would speak Chinese to them  and they would always answer me back in English. They love rock music  pop culture  American culture. But when they got older  when the time comes for them to start think about getting married  that's when we expect them to realize  a little bit more  their own culture. But that's where we had some problems. My son  he says he is not ready to get married. And he has a sweetheart  but she is American woman  not Chinese. It's not that it's bad  but I told him   What's wrong with a Chinese woman   But I think he will change his mind soon. So  then I decide instead  I will concentrate on my daughter. The daughter's marriage is very special to the mom. But first  she said she's not interested. She only wants to spend time with her friends. And then at college  it's like she never came home. And she doesn't want me to come and visit. So I said   What's wrong in this picture   So  I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend. But she told me   Mom  you don't have to worry about boys because I don't like them.  And I said   Yes  men can be difficult  but all women have to get used to that.  She said   No Mom. I mean  I don't like boys. I like girls. I am lesbian.  So  I always teach my kids to respect American ideas  but I told my daughter that this is one exception    that she is not gay  she is just confused by this American problem. But she told me   Mom  it's not American.  She said she is in love    in love with a nice Chinese girl. So  these are the words I am waiting to hear  but from my son  not my daughter. But at first I did not know what to do. But then  over time  I have come to understand that this is who she is. So  even though sometimes it's still hard  I will share with you that it helps me to realize society is more tolerant  usually because of places like this  because of ideas like this  and people like you  with an open mind. So I think maybe TED  you impact people's lives in the ways maybe even you don't realize. So  for my daughter's sake  I thank you for your ideas worth spreading. Thank you. Xie xie. Good evening. My name is Habbi Belahal. And I would like to first of all thank Sarah Jones for putting all of the pressure on the only Arab who she brought with her to be last today. I am originally from Jordan. And I teach comparative literature at Queens College. It is not Harvard. But I feel a bit like a fish out of water. But I am very proud of my students. And I see that a few of them did make it here to the conference. So you will get the extra credit I promised you. But  while I know that I may not look like the typical TED izen  as you would say  I do like to make the point that we in global society  we are never as different as the appearances may suggest. So  if you will indulge me  I will share quickly with you a bit of verse  which I memorized as a young girl at    years of age. So  back in the ancient times.  Arabic  And this roughly translates   Please  let me hold your hand. I want to hold your hand. I want to hold your hand. And when I touch you  I feel happy inside. It's such a feeling that my love  I can't hide  I can't hide  I can't hide.  Well  so okay  but please  please  but please. If it is sounding familiar  it is because I was at the same time in my life listening to the Beatles. On the radio  unclear   they were very popular. So  all of that is to say that I like to believe that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another  there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme. And I pray that this is the way that we will self invent  in time. That's all  shukran. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Okay  Great. Thank you all very much. It was lovely. Thank you for having me. Thank you very  very much. I love you. Well  you have to let me say this. I just    thank you. I want to thank Chris and Jacqueline  and just everyone for having me here. It's been a long time coming  and I feel like I'm home. And I know I've performed for some of your companies or some of you have seen me elsewhere  but this is honestly one of the best audiences I've ever experienced. The whole thing is amazing  and so don't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon. So the first question is  why do we need to even worry about a pandemic threat  What is it that we're concerned about  When I say  we   I'm at the Council on Foreign Relations. We're concerned in the national security community  and of course in the biology community and the public health community. While globalization has increased travel  it's made it necessary that everybody be everywhere  all the time  all over the world. And that means that your microbial hitchhikers are moving with you. So a plague outbreak in Surat  India becomes not an obscure event  but a globalized event    a globalized concern that has changed the risk equation. Katrina showed us that we cannot completely depend on government to have readiness in hand  to be capable of handling things. Indeed  an outbreak would be multiple Katrinas at once. Our big concern at the moment is a virus called H N  flu    some of you call it bird flu    which first emerged in southern China  in the mid     s  but we didn't know about it until     . At the end of last Christmas only    countries had seen H N . But we're now up to    countries in the world  have had this virus emerge  in either birds  or people or both. In the bird outbreaks we now can see that pretty much the whole world has seen this virus except the Americas. And I'll get into why we've so far been spared in a moment. In domestic birds  especially chickens  it's     percent lethal. It's one of the most lethal things we've seen in circulation in the world in any recent centuries. And we've dealt with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens  and unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmers with the result that there's cover up. It's also carried on migration patterns of wild migratory aquatic birds. There has been this centralized event in a place called Lake Chenghai  China. Two years ago the migrating birds had a multiple event where thousands died because of a mutation occurring in the virus  which made the species range broaden dramatically. So that birds going to Siberia  to Europe  and to Africa carried the virus  which had not previously been possible. We're now seeing outbreaks in human populations    so far  fortunately  small events  tiny outbreaks  occasional clusters. The virus has mutated dramatically in the last two years to form two distinct families  if you will  of the H N  viral tree with branches in them  and with different attributes that are worrying. So what's concerning us  Well  first of all  at no time in history have we succeeded in making in a timely fashion  a specific vaccine for more than     million people. It's not going to do us very much good in a global pandemic. You've heard about the vaccine we're stockpiling. But nobody believes it will actually be particularly effective if we have a real outbreak. So one thought is  after       when the airports closed  our flu season was delayed by two weeks. So the thought is  hey  maybe what we should do is just immediately    we hear there is H N  spreading from human to human  the virus has mutated to be a human to human transmitter    let's shut down the airports. However  huge supercomputer analyses  done of the likely effectiveness of this  show that it won't buy us much time at all. And of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans. For example  all masks are made in China. How do you get them mobilized around the world if you've shut all the airports down  How do you get the vaccines moved around the world and the drugs moved  and whatever may or not be available that would work. So it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive. We're worried because this virus  unlike any other flu we've ever studied  can be transmitted by eating raw meat of the infected animals. We've seen transmission to wild cats and domestic cats  and now also domestic pet dogs. And in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets  we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu  seizures  central nervous system disorders  partial paralysis. This is not your normal garden variety flu. It mimics what we now understand about reconstructing the      flu virus  the last great pandemic  in that it also jumped directly from birds to people. We had evolution over time  and this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings     percent of people who have become infected with H N  have  in fact  succumbed. And we don't have a huge number of people who got infected and never developed disease. In experimental feeding in monkeys you can see that it actually downregulates a specific immune system modulator. The result is that what kills you is not the virus directly  but your own immune system overreacting  saying   Whatever this is so foreign I'm going berserk.  The result  most of the deaths have been in people under    years of age  robustly healthy young adults. We have seen human to human transmission in at least three clusters    fortunately involving very intimate contact  still not putting the world at large at any kind of risk. Alright  so I've got you nervous. Now you probably assume  well the governments are going to do something. And we have spent a lot of money. Most of the spending in the Bush administration has actually been more related to the anthrax results and bio terrorism threat. But a lot of money has been thrown out at the local level and at the federal level to look at infectious diseases. End result  only    states have been certified to be able to do mass distribution of vaccine and drugs in a pandemic. Half the states would run out of hospital beds in the first week  maybe two weeks. And    states already have an acute nursing shortage. Add on pandemic threat  you're in big trouble. So what have people been doing with this money  Exercises  drills  all over the world. Let's pretend there's a pandemic. Let's everybody run around and play your role. Main result is that there is tremendous confusion. Most of these people don't actually know what their job will be. And the bottom line  major thing that has come through in every single drill  nobody knows who's in charge. Nobody knows the chain of command. If it were Los Angeles  is it the mayor  the governor  the President of the United States  the head of Homeland Security  In fact  the federal government says it's a guy called the Principle Federal Officer  who happens to be with TSA. The government says the federal responsibility will basically be about trying to keep the virus out  which we all know is impossible  and then to mitigate the impact primarily on our economy. The rest is up to your local community. Everything is about your town  where you live. Well how good a city council you have  how good a mayor you have    that's who's going to be in charge. Most local facilities would all be competing to try and get their hands on their piece of the federal stockpile of a drug called Tamiflu  which may or may not be helpful    I'll get into that    of available vaccines  and any other treatments  and masks  and anything that's been stockpiled. And you'll have massive competition. Now we did purchase a vaccine  you've probably all heard about it  made by Sanofi Aventis. Unfortunately it's made against the current form of H N . We know the virus will mutate. It will be a different virus. The vaccine will probably be useless. So here's where the decisions come in. You're the mayor of your local town. Let's see  should we order that all pets be kept indoors  Germany did that when H N  appeared in Germany last year  in order to minimize the spread between households by household cats  dogs and so on. What do we do when we don't have any containment rooms with reverse air that will allow the healthcare workers to take care of patients  These are in Hong Kong  we have nothing like that here. What about quarantine  During the SARS epidemic in Beijing quarantine did seem to help. We have no uniform policies regarding quarantine across the United States. And some states have differential policies  county by county. But what about the no brainer things  Should we close all the schools  Well then what about all the workers  They won't go to work if their kids aren't in school. Encouraging telecommuting  What works  Well the British government did a model of telecommuting. Six weeks they had all people in the banking industry pretend a pandemic was underway. What they found was  the core functions    you know you still sort of had banks  but you couldn't get people to put money in the ATM machines. Nobody was processing the credit cards. Your insurance payments didn't go through. And basically the economy would be in a disaster state of affairs. And that's just office workers  bankers. We don't know how important hand washing is for flu    shocking. One assumes it's a good idea to wash your hands a lot. But actually in scientific community there is great debate about what percentage of flu transmission between people is from sneezing and coughing and what percentage is on your hands. The Institute of Medicine tried to look at the masking question. Can we figure out a way  since we know we won't have enough masks because we don't make them in America anymore  they're all made in China    do we need N    A state of the art  top of the line  must be fitted to your face mask  Or can we get away with some different kinds of masks  In the SARS epidemic  we learned in Hong Kong that most of transmission was because people were removing their masks improperly. And their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask  and then they rubbed their nose. Bingo  They got SARS. It wasn't flying microbes. If you go online right now  you'll get so much phony baloney information. You'll end up buying    this is called an N   mask. Ridiculous. We don't actually have a standard for what should be the protective gear for the first responders  the people who will actually be there on the front lines. And Tamiflu. You've probably heard of this drug  made by Hoffmann La Roche  patented drug. There is some indication that it may buy you some time in the midst of an outbreak. Should you take Tamiflu for a long period of time  well  one of the side effects is suicidal ideations. A public health survey analyzed the effect that large scale Tamiflu use would have  actually shows it counteractive to public health measures  making matters worse. And here is the other interesting thing  when a human being ingests Tamiflu  only    percent is metabolized appropriately to be an active compound in the human being. The rest turns into a stable compound  which survives filtration into the water systems  thereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry flu and providing them a chance to breed resistant strains. And we now have seen Tamiflu resistant strains in both Vietnam in person to person transmission  and in Egypt in person to person transmission. So I personally think that our life expectancy for Tamiflu as an effective drug is very limited    very limited indeed. Nevertheless most of the governments have based their whole flu policies on building stockpiles of Tamiflu. Russia has actually stockpiled enough for    percent of all Russians. We've stockpiled enough for    percent. When I say enough  that's two weeks worth. And then you're on your own because the pandemic is going to last for    to    months. Some of the poorer countries that have had the most experience with H N  have built up stockpiles  they're already expired. They are already out of date. What do we know from       the last great pandemic  The federal government abdicated most responsibility. And so we ended up with this wild patchwork of regulations all over America. Every city  county  state did their own thing. And the rules and the belief systems were wildly disparate. In some cases all schools  all churches  all public venues were closed. The pandemic circulated three times in    months in the absence of commercial air travel. The second wave was the mutated  super killer wave. And in the first wave we had enough healthcare workers. But by the time the second wave hit it took such a toll among the healthcare workers that we lost most of our doctors and nurses that were on the front lines. Overall we lost         people. The virus was     percent lethal to pregnant women and we don't actually know why. Most of the death toll was    to    year olds    robustly healthy young adults. It was likened to the plague. We don't actually know how many people died. The low ball estimate is    million. This was based on European and North American data. A new study by Chris Murray at Harvard shows that if you look at the databases that were kept by the Brits in India  there was a    fold greater death rate among the Indians. So there is a strong belief that in places of poverty the death toll was far higher. And that a more likely toll is somewhere in the neighborhood of    to     million people before we had commercial air travel. So are we ready  As a nation  no we're not. And I think even those in the leadership would say that is the case  that we still have a long ways to go. So what does that mean for you  Well the first thing is  I wouldn't start building up personal stockpiles of anything    for yourself  your family  or your employees    unless you've really done your homework. What mask works  what mask doesn't work. How many masks do you need  The Institute of Medicine study felt that you could not recycle masks. Well if you think it's going to last    months  are you going to buy    months worth of masks for every single person in your family  We don't know    again with Tamiflu  the number one side effect of Tamiflu is flu like symptoms. So then how can you tell who in your family has the flu if everybody is taking Tamiflu  If you expand that out to think of a whole community  or all your employees in your company  you begin to realize how limited the Tamiflu option might be. Everybody has come up to me and said  well I'll stockpile water or  I'll stockpile food  or what have you. But really  Do you really have a place to stockpile    months worth of food  Twenty four months worth of food  Do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the     s people viewed the civil defense issue  and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu  I don't think that's rational. I think it's about having to be prepared as communities  not as individuals    being prepared as nation  being prepared as state  being prepared as town. And right now most of the preparedness is deeply flawed. And I hope I've convinced you of that  which means that the real job is go out and say to your local leaders  and your national leaders   Why haven't you solved these problems  Why are you still thinking that the lessons of Katrina do not apply to flu   And put the pressure where the pressure needs to be put. But I guess the other thing to add is  if you do have employees  and you do have a company  I think you have certain responsibilities to demonstrate that you are thinking ahead for them  and you are trying to plan. At a minimum the British banking plan showed that telecommuting can be helpful. It probably does reduce exposure because people are not coming into the office and coughing on each other  or touching common objects and sharing things via their hands. But can you sustain your company that way  Well if you have a dot com  maybe you can. Otherwise you're in trouble. Happy to take your questions. Audience member  What factors determine the duration of a pandemic  Laurie Garret  What factors determine the duration of a pandemic  we don't really know. I could give you a bunch of flip  this  that  and the other. But I would say that honestly we don't know. Clearly the bottom line is the virus eventually attenuates  and ceases to be a lethal virus to humanity  and finds other hosts. But we don't really know how and why that happens. It's a very complicated ecology. Audience member  What kind of triggers are you looking for  You know way more than any of us. To say ahh  if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic  LG  The moment that you see any evidence of serious human to human to transmission. Not just intimately between family members who took care of an ailing sister or brother  but a community infected    spread within a school  spread within a dormitory  something of that nature. Then I think that there is universal agreement now  at WHO all the way down  Send out the alert. Audience member  Some research has indicated that statins can be helpful. Can you talk about that  LG  Yeah. There is some evidence that taking Lipitor and other common statins for cholesterol control may decrease your vulnerability to influenza. But we do not completely understand why. The mechanism isn't clear. And I don't know that there is any way responsibly for someone to start medicating their children with their personal supply of Lipitor or something of that nature. We have absolutely no idea what that would do. You might be causing some very dangerous outcomes in your children  doing such a thing. Audience member  How far along are we in being able to determine whether someone is actually carrying  whether somebody has this before the symptoms are full blown  LG  Right. So I have for a long time said that what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic. And our Centers for Disease Control has labeled a test they developed a rapid diagnostic. It takes    hours in a very highly developed laboratory  in highly skilled hands. I'm thinking dipstick. You could do it to your own kid. It changes color. It tells you if you have H N . In terms of where we are in science with DNA identification capacities and so on  it's not that far off. But we're not there. And there hasn't been the kind of investment to get us there. Audience member  In the      flu I understand that they theorized that there was some attenuation of the virus when it made the leap into humans. Is that likely  do you think  here  I mean     percent death rate is pretty severe. LG  Um yeah. So we don't actually know what the lethality was of the      strain to wild birds before it jumped from birds to humans. It's curious that there is no evidence of mass die offs of chickens or household birds across America before the human pandemic happened. That may be because those events were occurring on the other side of the world where nobody was paying attention. But the virus clearly went through one round around the world in a mild enough form that the British army in World War I actually certified that it was not a threat and would not affect the outcome of the war. And after circulating around the world came back in a form that was tremendously lethal. What percentage of infected people were killed by it  Again we don't really know for sure. It's clear that if you were malnourished to begin with  you had a weakened immune system  you lived in poverty in India or Africa  your likelihood of dying was far greater. But we don't really know. Audience member  One of the things I've heard is that the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia  and that a pneumonia vaccine may offer you    percent better chance of survival. LG  For a long time  researchers in emerging diseases were kind of dismissive of the pandemic flu threat on the grounds that back in      they didn't have antibiotics. And that most people who die of regular flu    which in regular flu years is about         people worldwide  most of them senior citizens    and they die not of the flu but because the flu gives an assault to their immune system. And along comes pneumococcus or another bacteria  streptococcus and boom  they get a bacterial pneumonia. But it turns out that in      that was not the case at all. And so far in the H N  cases in people  similarly bacterial infection has not been an issue at all. It's this absolutely phenomenal disruption of the immune system that is the key to why people die of this virus. And I would just add we saw the same thing with SARS. So what's going on here is your body says  your immune system sends out all its sentinels and says   I don't know what the heck this is. We've never seen anything even remotely like this before.  It won't do any good to bring in the sharpshooters because those antibodies aren't here. And it won't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery because those T cells don't recognize it either. So we're going to have to go all out thermonuclear response  stimulate the total cytokine cascade. The whole immune system swarms into the lungs. And yes they die  drowning in their own fluids  of pneumonia. But it's not bacterial pneumonia. And it's not a pneumonia that would respond to a vaccine. And I think my time is up. I thank you all for your attention.
