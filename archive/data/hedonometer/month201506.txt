I'm really excited to share with you some findings that really surprise me about what makes companies  succeed the most  what factors actually matter the most for startup success. I believe that the startup organization is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place. If you take a group of people  with the right equity incentives and organize them in a startup  you can unlock human potential in a way never before possible. You get them to achieve  unbelievable things. But if the startup  organization is so great  why do so many fail  That's what I wanted to find out. I wanted to find out what actually matters most for startup success. And I wanted to try  to be systematic about it  avoid some of my instincts and maybe misperceptions I have from so many companies I've seen over the years. I wanted to know this because I've been starting businesses since I was    years old when I sold candy at the bus stop in junior high school  to high school  when I made solar energy devices  to college  when I made loudspeakers. And when I graduated from college  I started software companies. And    years ago  I started Idealab  and in the last    years  we started more than     companies  many successes  and many big failures. We learned a lot from those failures. So I tried to look across what factors accounted the most for company success and failure. So I looked at these five. First  the idea. I used to think that  the idea was everything. I named my company Idealab for how much I worship the  aha   moment when you first come up with the idea. But then over time  I came to think that maybe the team  the execution  adaptability  that mattered even more than the idea. I never thought I'd be quoting boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage  but he once said   Everybody has a plan  until they get punched in the face.   Laughter  And I think that's so true about business as well. So much about a team's execution is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer. The customer is the true reality. And that's why I came to think that the team maybe was the most important thing. Then I started looking at the business model. Does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues  That started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mattered most for success. Then I looked at the funding. Sometimes companies received intense amounts of funding. Maybe that's the most important thing  And then of course  the timing. Is the idea way too early and the world's not ready for it  Is it early  as in  you're in advance and you have to educate the world  Is it just right  Or is it too late  and there's already too many competitors  So I tried to look very carefully at these five factors across many companies. And I looked across all     Idealab companies  and     non Idealab companies to try and come up with  something scientific about it. So first  on these Idealab companies  the top five companies    Citysearch  CarsDirect  GoTo  NetZero  Tickets.com    those all became billion dollar successes. And the five companies on the bottom    Z.com  Insider Pages  MyLife  Desktop Factory  Peoplelink    we all had high hopes for  but didn't succeed. So I tried to rank across all  of those attributes how I felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions. And then for non Idealab companies  I looked at wild successes  like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and LinkedIn. And some failures  Webvan  Kozmo  Pets.com Flooz and Friendster. The bottom companies had intense funding  they even had business models in some cases  but they didn't succeed. I tried to look at what factors actually accounted the most for success and failure across all of these companies  and the results really surprised me. The number one thing was timing. Timing accounted for    percent of the difference between success and failure. Team and execution came in second  and the idea  the differentiability of the idea  the uniqueness of the idea  that actually came in third. Now  this isn't absolutely definitive  it's not to say that  the idea isn't important  but it very much surprised me that the idea wasn't the most important thing. Sometimes it mattered more when  it was actually timed. The last two  business model and funding  made sense to me actually. I think business model makes sense to be that low because you can start out without a business model and add one later if your customers are demanding what you're creating. And funding  I think as well  if you're underfunded at first but you're gaining traction  especially in today's age  it's very  very easy to get intense funding. So now let me give you some specific examples about each of these. So take a wild success like Airbnb that everybody knows about. Well  that company was famously passed on by many smart investors because people thought   No one's going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger.  Of course  people proved that wrong. But one of the reasons it succeeded  aside from a good business model  a good idea  great execution  is the timing. That company came out right during the height of the recession when people really needed extra money  and that maybe helped people overcome their objection to renting out their own home to a stranger. Same thing with Uber. Uber came out  incredible company  incredible business model  great execution  too. But the timing was so perfect for their need to get drivers into the system. Drivers were looking for extra money  it was very  very important. Some of our early successes  Citysearch  came out when people needed web pages. GoTo.com  which we announced actually at TED in       was when companies were looking for cost effective ways to get traffic. We thought the idea was so great  but actually  the timing was probably maybe more important. And then some of our failures. We started a company called Z.com  it was an online entertainment company. We were so excited about it    we raised enough money  we had a great business model  we even signed incredibly great Hollywood talent to join the company. But broadband penetration was too low in          . It was too hard to watch video content online  you had to put codecs in your browser and do all this stuff  and the company eventually went out of business in     . Just two years later  when the codec problem was solved by Adobe Flash and when broadband penetration crossed    percent in America  YouTube was perfectly timed. Great idea  but unbelievable timing. In fact  YouTube didn't even have a business model when it first started. It wasn't even certain that  that would work out. But that was beautifully   beautifully timed. So what I would say  in summary  is execution definitely matters a lot. The idea matters a lot. But timing might matter even more. And the best way to really assess timing is to really look at whether  consumers are really ready for what you have to offer them. And to be really  really honest about it  not be in denial about any results that you see  because if you have something you love  you want to push it forward  but you have to be very  very honest about that factor on timing. As I said earlier  I think startups can change the world and make the world a better place. I hope some of these insights can maybe help you have a slightly higher success ratio  and thus make something great come to the world that wouldn't have happened otherwise. Thank you very much  you've been a great audience. Mark Twain summed up what I take to be one of the fundamental problems of cognitive science with a single witticism. He said   There's something fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment in fact.  Twain meant it as a joke  of course  but he's right  There's something fascinating about science. From a few bones  we infer the existence of dinosuars. From spectral lines  the composition of nebulae. From fruit flies  the mechanisms of heredity  and from reconstructed images of blood flowing through the brain  or in my case  from the behavior of very young children  we try to say something about the fundamental mechanisms of human cognition. In particular  in my lab in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT  I have spent the past decade trying to understand the mystery of how children learn so much from so little so quickly. Because  it turns out that the fascinating thing about science is also a fascinating thing about children  which  to put a gentler spin on Mark Twain  is precisely their ability to draw rich  abstract inferences rapidly and accurately from sparse  noisy data. I'm going to give you just two examples today. One is about a problem of generalization  and the other is about a problem of causal reasoning. And although I'm going to talk about work in my lab  this work is inspired by and indebted to a field. I'm grateful to mentors  colleagues  and collaborators around the world. Let me start with the problem of generalization. Generalizing from small samples of data is the bread and butter of science. We poll a tiny fraction of the electorate and we predict the outcome of national elections. We see how a handful of patients responds to treatment in a clinical trial  and we bring drugs to a national market. But this only works if our sample is randomly drawn from the population. If our sample is cherry picked in some way    say  we poll only urban voters  or say  in our clinical trials for treatments for heart disease  we include only men    the results may not generalize to the broader population. So scientists care whether evidence is randomly sampled or not  but what does that have to do with babies  Well  babies have to generalize from small samples of data all the time. They see a few rubber ducks and learn that they float  or a few balls and learn that they bounce. And they develop expectations about ducks and balls that they're going to extend to rubber ducks and balls for the rest of their lives. And the kinds of generalizations babies have to make about ducks and balls they have to make about almost everything  shoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbages and kings. So do babies care whether the tiny bit of evidence they see is plausibly representative of a larger population  Let's find out. I'm going to show you two movies  one from each of two conditions of an experiment  and because you're going to see just two movies  you're going to see just two babies  and any two babies differ from each other in innumerable ways. But these babies  of course  here stand in for groups of babies  and the differences you're going to see represent average group differences in babies' behavior across conditions. In each movie  you're going to see a baby doing maybe just exactly what you might expect a baby to do  and we can hardly make babies more magical than they already are. But to my mind the magical thing  and what I want you to pay attention to  is the contrast between these two conditions  because the only thing that differs between these two movies is the statistical evidence the babies are going to observe. We're going to show babies a box of blue and yellow balls  and my then graduate student  now colleague at Stanford  Hyowon Gweon  is going to pull three blue balls in a row out of this box  and when she pulls those balls out  she's going to squeeze them  and the balls are going to squeak. And if you're a baby  that's like a TED Talk. It doesn't get better than that. But the important point is it's really easy to pull three blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly blue balls. You could do that with your eyes closed. It's plausibly a random sample from this population. And if you can reach into a box at random and pull out things that squeak  then maybe everything in the box squeaks. So maybe babies should expect those yellow balls to squeak as well. Now  those yellow balls have funny sticks on the end  so babies could do other things with them if they wanted to. They could pound them or whack them. But let's see what the baby does. Did you see that   Ball squeaks  Cool. See this one  Wow. Laura Schulz  Told you.  Laughs  Hey Clara  this one's for you. You can go ahead and play. LS  I don't even have to talk  right  All right  it's nice that babies will generalize properties of blue balls to yellow balls  and it's impressive that babies can learn from imitating us  but we've known those things about babies for a very long time. The really interesting question is what happens when we show babies exactly the same thing  and we can ensure it's exactly the same because we have a secret compartment and we actually pull the balls from there  but this time  all we change is the apparent population from which that evidence was drawn. This time  we're going to show babies three blue balls pulled out of a box of mostly yellow balls  and guess what  You  probably won't  randomly draw three blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly yellow balls. That is not plausibly randomly sampled evidence. That evidence suggests that maybe Hyowon was deliberately sampling the blue balls. Maybe there's something special about the blue balls. Maybe only the blue balls squeak. Let's see what the baby does. See this toy   Ball squeaks  Oh  that was cool. See   Ball squeaks  Now this one's for you to play. You can go ahead and play. LS  So you just saw two    month old babies do entirely different things based only on the probability of the sample they observed. Let me show you the experimental results. On the vertical axis  you'll see the percentage of babies who squeezed the ball in each condition  and as you'll see  babies are much more likely to generalize the evidence when it's plausibly representative of the population than when the evidence is clearly cherry picked. And this leads to a fun prediction  Suppose you pulled just one blue ball out of the mostly yellow box. You  probably won't  pull three blue balls in a row at random out of a yellow box  but you could randomly sample just one blue ball. That's not an improbable sample. And if you could reach into a box at random and pull out something that squeaks  maybe everything in the box squeaks. So even though babies are going to see much less evidence for squeaking  and have many fewer actions to imitate in this one ball condition than in the condition you just saw  we predicted that babies themselves would squeeze more  and that's exactly what we found. So    month old babies  in this respect  like scientists  care whether evidence is randomly sampled or not  and they use this to develop expectations about the world  what squeaks and what doesn't  what to explore and what to ignore. Let me show you another example now  this time about a problem of causal reasoning. And it starts with a problem of confounded evidence that all of us have  which is that we are part of the world. And this might not seem like a problem to you  but like most problems  it's only a problem when things go wrong. Take this baby  for instance. Things are going wrong for him. He would like to make this toy go  and he can't. I'll show you a few second clip. And there's two possibilities  broadly  Maybe he's doing something wrong  or maybe there's something wrong with the toy. So in this next experiment  we're going to give babies just a tiny bit of statistical data supporting one hypothesis over the other  and we're going to see if babies can use that to make different decisions about what to do. Here's the setup. Hyowon is going to try to make the toy go and succeed. I am then going to try twice and fail both times  and then Hyowon is going to try again and succeed  and this roughly sums up my relationship to my graduate students in technology across the board. But the important point here is it provides a little bit of evidence that the problem isn't with the toy  it's with the person. Some people can make this toy go  and some can't. Now  when the baby gets the toy  he's going to have a choice. His mom is right there  so he can go ahead and hand off the toy and change the person  but there's also going to be another toy at the end of that cloth  and he can pull the cloth towards him and change the toy. So let's see what the baby does. LS  One  two  three  go  Arthur  I'm going to try again. One  two  three  go  YG  Arthur  let me try again  okay  One  two  three  go   Music  Look at that. Remember these toys  See these toys  Yeah  I'm going to put this one over here  and I'm going to give this one to you. You can go ahead and play. LS  Okay  Laura  but of course  babies love their mommies. Of course babies give toys to their mommies when they can't make them work. So again  the really important question is what happens when we change the statistical data ever so slightly. This time  babies are going to see the toy work and fail in exactly the same order  but we're changing the distribution of evidence. This time  Hyowon is going to succeed once and fail once  and so am I. And this suggests it doesn't matter who tries this toy  the toy is broken. It doesn't work all the time. Again  the baby's going to have a choice. Her mom is right next to her  so she can change the person  and there's going to be another toy at the end of the cloth. Let's watch what she does. Let me try one more time. One  two  three  go  Hmm. LS  Let me try  Clara. One  two  three  go  Hmm  let me try again. One  two  three  go   Music  HG  I'm going to put this one over here  and I'm going to give this one to you. You can go ahead and play. LS  Let me show you the experimental results. On the vertical axis  you'll see the distribution of children's choices in each condition  and you'll see that the distribution of the choices children make depends on the evidence they observe. So in the second year of life  babies can use a tiny bit of statistical data to decide between two fundamentally different strategies for acting in the world  asking for help and exploring. I've just shown you two laboratory experiments out of literally hundreds in the field that make similar points  because the really critical point is that children's ability to make rich inferences from sparse data underlies all the species specific cultural learning that we do. Children learn about new tools from just a few examples. They learn new causal relationships from just a few examples. They even learn new words  in this case in American Sign Language. I want to close with just two points. If you've been following my world  the field of brain and cognitive sciences  for the past few years  three big ideas will have come to your attention. The first is that this is the era of the brain. And indeed  there have been staggering discoveries in neuroscience  localizing functionally specialized regions of cortex  turning mouse brains transparent  activating neurons with light. A second big idea is that this is the era of big data and machine learning  and machine learning promises to revolutionize our understanding of everything from social networks to epidemiology. And maybe  as it tackles problems of scene understanding and natural language processing  to tell us something about human cognition. And the final big idea you'll have heard is that maybe it's a good idea we're going to know so much about brains and have so much access to big data  because left to our own devices  humans are fallible  we take shortcuts  we err  we make mistakes  we're biased  and in innumerable ways  we get the world wrong. I think these are all important stories  and they have a lot to tell us about what it means to be human  but I want you to note that today I told you a very different story. It's a story about minds and not brains  and in particular  it's a story about the kinds of computations that uniquely human minds can perform  which involve rich  structured knowledge and the ability to learn from small amounts of data  the evidence of just a few examples. And fundamentally  it's a story about how starting as very small children and continuing out all the way to the greatest accomplishments of our culture  we get the world right. Folks  human minds do not only learn from small amounts of data. Human minds think of altogether new ideas. Human minds generate research and discovery  and human minds generate art and literature and poetry and theater  and human minds take care of other humans  our old  our young  our sick. We even heal them. In the years to come  we're going to see technological innovations beyond anything I can even envision  but we are very unlikely to see anything even approximating the computational power of a human child in my lifetime or in yours. If we invest in these most powerful learners and their development  in babies and children and mothers and fathers and caregivers and teachers the ways we invest in our other most powerful and elegant forms of technology  engineering and design  we will not just be dreaming of a better future  we will be planning for one. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Laura  thank you. I do actually have a question for you. First of all  the research is insane. I mean  who would design an experiment like that   Laughter  I've seen that a couple of times  and I still don't honestly believe that that can truly be happening  but other people have done similar experiments  it checks out. The babies really are that genius. LS  You know  they look really impressive in our experiments  but think about what they look like in real life  right  It starts out as a baby. Eighteen months later  it's talking to you  and babies' first words aren't just things like balls and ducks  they're things like  all gone   which refer to disappearance  or  uh oh   which refer to unintentional actions. It has to be that powerful. It has to be much more powerful than anything I showed you. They're figuring out the entire world. A four year old can talk to you about almost anything. CA  And if I understand you right  the other key point you're making is  we've been through these years where there's all this talk of how quirky and buggy our minds are  that behavioral economics and the whole theories behind that that we're not rational agents. You're really saying that the bigger story is how extraordinary  and there really is genius there that is underappreciated. LS  One of my favorite quotes in psychology comes from the social psychologist Solomon Asch  and he said the fundamental task of psychology is to remove the veil of self evidence from things. There are orders of magnitude more decisions you make every day that get the world right. You know about objects and their properties. You know them when they're occluded. You know them in the dark. You can walk through rooms. You can figure out what other people are thinking. You can talk to them. You can navigate space. You know about numbers. You know causal relationships. You know about moral reasoning. You do this effortlessly  so we don't see it  but that is how we get the world right  and it's a remarkable and very difficult to understand accomplishment. CA  I suspect there are people in the audience who have this view of accelerating technological power who might dispute your statement that never in our lifetimes will a computer do what a three year old child can do  but what's clear is that in any scenario  our machines have so much to learn from our toddlers. LS  I think so. You'll have some machine learning folks up here. I mean  you should never bet against babies or chimpanzees or technology as a matter of practice  but it's not just a difference in quantity  it's a difference in kind. We have incredibly powerful computers  and they do do amazingly sophisticated things  often with very big amounts of data. Human minds do  I think  something quite different  and I think it's the structured  hierarchical nature of human knowledge that remains a real challenge. CA  Laura Schulz  wonderful food for thought. Thank you so much. LS  Thank you.  Applause  In the great     s movie   The Blues Brothers   there's a scene where John Belushi goes to visit Dan Aykroyd in his apartment in Chicago for the very first time. It's a cramped  tiny space and it's just three feet away from the train tracks. As John sits on Dan's bed  a train goes rushing by  rattling everything in the room. John asks   How often does that train go by   Dan replies   So often  you won't even notice it.  And then  something falls off the wall. We all know what he's talking about. As human beings  we get used to everyday things really fast. As a product designer  it's my job to see those everyday things  to feel them  and try to improve upon them. For example  see this piece of fruit  See this little sticker  That sticker wasn't there when I was a kid. But somewhere as the years passed  someone had the bright idea to put that sticker on the fruit. Why  So it could be easier for us to check out  at the grocery counter. Well that's great  we can get in and out of the store quickly. But now  there's a new problem. When we get home and we're hungry and we see this ripe  juicy piece of fruit on the counter  we just want to pick it up and eat it. Except now  we have to look for this little sticker. And dig at it with our nails  damaging the flesh. Then rolling up that sticker    you know what I mean. And then trying to flick it off your fingers. It's not fun  not at all. But something interesting happened. See the first time you did it  you probably felt those feelings. You just wanted to eat the piece of fruit. You felt upset. You just wanted to dive in. By the   th time  you started to become less upset and you just started peeling the label off. By the    th time  at least for me  I became numb to it. I simply picked up the piece of fruit  dug at it with my nails  tried to flick it off  and then wondered   Was there another sticker   So why is that  Why do we get used to everyday things  Well as human beings  we have limited brain power. And so our brains encode the  everyday things we do into habits so we can free up space  to learn new things. It's a process called habituation and it's one of the most basic ways  as humans  we learn. Now  habituation isn't always bad. Remember learning to drive  I sure do. Your hands clenched at    and   on the wheel  looking at every single object out there    the cars  the lights  the pedestrians. It's a nerve wracking experience. So much so  that I couldn't even talk to anyone else in the car and I couldn't even listen to music. But then something interesting happened. As the weeks went by  driving became easier and easier. You habituated it. It started to become  fun and second nature. And then  you could talk  to your friends again and listen to music. So there's a good reason why our brains habituate things. If we didn't  we'd notice every little detail  all the time. It would be exhausting  and we'd have no time to learn about new things. But sometimes  habituation isn't good. If it stops us from noticing  the problems that are around us  well  that's bad. And if it stops us from noticing  and fixing those problems  well  then that's really bad. Comedians know all about this. Jerry Seinfeld's entire career was built on noticing those little details  those idiotic things we do every day that we don't even remember. He tells us about the time  he visited his friends and he just wanted to take  a comfortable shower. He'd reach out and grab the handle and turn it slightly one way  and it was     degrees too hot. And then he'd turn it the other way  and it was     degrees too cold. He just wanted a comfortable shower. Now  we've all been there  we just don't remember it. But Jerry did  and that's a comedian's job. But designers  innovators  and entrepreneurs  it's our job to not just notice those things  but to go one step further and try to fix them. See this  this person  this is Mary Anderson. In      in New York City  she was visiting. It was a cold  wet  snowy day and she was warm inside a streetcar. As she was going to her destination  she noticed the driver opening the window to clean off the excess snow so he could drive safely. When he opened the window  though  he let all this cold  wet air inside  making all the passengers miserable. Now probably  most of those  passengers just thought   It's a fact of life  he's got to open the window to clean it. That's just how it is.  But Mary didn't. Mary thought   What if the diver could actually clean the windshield from the inside so that he could stay safe and drive and the passengers could  actually stay warm   So she picked up her sketchbook right then and there  and began drawing what would become the world's first windshield wiper. Now as a product designer  I try to learn from people like Mary to try to see the world  the way it really is  not the way we think it is. Why  Because it's easy to solve a problem that almost everyone sees. But it's hard to solve a problem that almost no one sees. Now some people think you're born with this ability or you're not  as if Mary Anderson was hardwired at birth to see the world more clearly. That wasn't the case for me. I had to work at it. During my years at Apple  Steve Jobs challenged us to come into work every day  to see our products through  the eyes of the customer  the new customer  the one that has fears  and possible frustrations and hopeful exhilaration that their new technology product could work straightaway for them. He called it staying beginners  and wanted to make sure that we focused on those tiny little details to make them faster  easier and seamless for the new customers. So I remember this clearly in the very earliest days of the iPod. See  back in the '  s  being a gadget freak like I am  I would rush out to the store for the very  very latest gadget. I'd take all the time to get to the store  I'd check out  I'd come back home  I'd start to unbox it. And then  there was  another little sticker  the one that said   Charge before use.  What  I can't believe it  I just spent all this time buying this product and now I have to charge before use. I have to wait what felt like an eternity to use that coveted new toy. It was crazy. But you know what  Almost every product back then did that. When it had batteries in it  you had to charge it before you used it. Well  Steve noticed that and he said   We're not going to let that  happen to our product.  So what did we do  Typically  when you have a product that has a hard drive in it  you run it for about     minutes in the factory to make sure that hard drive's going  to be working years later for the customer after they  pull it out of the box. What did we do instead  We ran that product for over two hours. Why  Well  first off  we could make a higher quality product  be easy to test  and make sure it was great for the customer. But most importantly  the battery came fully charged right out of the box  ready to use. So that customer   with all that exhilaration  could just start using the product. It was great  and it worked. People liked it. Today  almost every product that you get that's battery powered comes out of the box fully charged  even if it doesn't have a hard drive. But back then  we noticed  that detail and we fixed it  and now everyone else does that as well. No more   Charge before use.  So why am I telling you this  Well  it's seeing the invisible problem  not just the obvious problem  that's important  not just for product design  but for everything we do. You see  there are invisible problems all around us  ones we can solve. But first we need to see them  to feel them. So  I'm hesitant to give you any tips about neuroscience or psychology. There's far too many experienced people in the TED community who would know much more about that than I ever will. But let me leave you with a few tips that I do  that we all can do  to fight habituation. My first tip is to look broader. You see  when you're tackling a problem  sometimes  there are a lot of steps that lead up to that problem. And sometimes  a lot  of steps after it. If you can take a step back and look broader  maybe you can change some of those boxes before the problem. Maybe you can combine them. Maybe you can remove them altogether to make that better. Take thermostats  for instance. In the     s when they first came out  they were really simple to use. You could turn them up or turn them down. People understood them. But in the     s  the energy crisis struck  and customers started thinking about how to save energy. So what happened  Thermostat designers decided  to add a new step. Instead of just turning up and down  you now had to program it. So you could tell it the temperature you wanted at a certain time. Now that seemed great. Every thermostat had started adding that feature. But it turned out that no one saved any energy. Now  why is that  Well  people couldn't predict the future. They just didn't know how their weeks would change season to season  year to year. So no one was saving energy  and what happened  Thermostat designers went back to the drawing board and they focused on that programming step. They made better U.I.s  they made better documentation. But still  years later  people were not saving any energy because they just couldn't predict the future. So what did we do  We put a machine learning algorithm in instead of the programming that would simply watch when you turned it up and down  when you liked a certain temperature when you got up  or when you went away. And you know what  It worked. People are saving energy  without any programming. So  it doesn't matter what you're doing. If you take a step back  and look at all the boxes  maybe there's a way to remove one or combine them so that you can make  that process much simpler. So that's my first tip  look broader. For my second tip  it's to look closer. One of my greatest teachers  was my grandfather. He taught me all about the world. He taught me how things were built and how they were repaired  the tools and techniques necessary to make a successful project. I remember one story  he told me about screws  and about how you need to have the right screw for the right job. There are many different screws  wood screws  metal screws  anchors  concrete screws  the list went on and on. Our job is to make products that are easy to install for all of our customs themselves without professionals. So what did we do  I remembered that story  that my grandfather told me  and so we thought   How many different screws  can we put in the box  Was it going to be two  three  four  five  Because there's so many different wall types.  So we thought about it  we optimized it  and we came up with three different screws to put in the box. We thought that was going to solve the problem. But it turned out  it didn't. So we shipped the product  and people weren't having a great experience. So what did we do  We went back to the drawing board just instantly after we figured out we didn't get it right. And we designed a special screw  a custom screw  much to the chagrin of our investors. They were like   Why are you spending so much time on a little screw  Get out there and sell more   And we said   We will sell more if we get this right.  And it turned out  we did. With that custom little screw  there was just one screw in the box  that was easy to mount and put on the wall. So if we focus on those tiny details  the ones we may not see and we look at them as we say   Are those important or is that the way we've always done it  Maybe there's a way to get rid of those.  So my last piece of advice is to think younger. Every day  I'm confronted with interesting questions from my three young kids. They come up with questions like   Why can't cars fly around traffic   Or   Why don't my shoelaces have Velcro instead   Sometimes  those questions are smart. My son came to me the other day and I asked him   Go run out to the mailbox  and check it.  He looked at me  puzzled  and said   Why doesn't the mailbox just check itself and tell us when it has mail    Laughter  I was like   That's a pretty  good question.  So  they can ask tons of questions and sometimes we find out we just don't have the right answers. We say   Son  that's just the way the world works.  So the more we're exposed to something  the more we get used to it. But kids haven't been around  long enough to get used to those things. And so when they run into problems  they immediately try to solve them  and sometimes they find a better way  and that way really is better. So my advice that we take to heart is to have young people on your team  or people with young minds. Because if you have those young minds  they cause everyone in the room to think younger. Picasso once said    Every child is an artist. The problem is when he or she grows up  is how to remain an artist.  We all saw the world more clearly when we saw it for the first time  before a lifetime of habits  got in the way. Our challenge is to get back there  to feel that frustration  to see those little details  to look broader  look closer  and to think younger so we can stay beginners. It's not easy. It requires us pushing back against one of the most basic ways we make sense of the world. But if we do  we could do some pretty amazing things. For me  hopefully  that's better product design. For you  that could mean something else  something powerful. Our challenge is to wake up  each day and say   How can I experience the world better   And if we do  maybe  just maybe  we can get rid of these dumb little stickers. Thank you very much. The FBI is responsible for more terrorism plots in the United States than any other organization. More than al Qaeda  more than al Shabaab  more than the Islamic State  more than all of them combined. This isn't likely how you think about the FBI. You probably think of FBI agents gunning down bad guys like John Dillinger  or arresting corrupt politicians. After the      terrorist attacks  the FBI became less concerned with gangsters and  crooked elected officials. The new target became terrorists  and the pursuit of terrorists  has consumed the FBI. Every year  the Bureau spends  .  billion dollars on domestic counterterrorism activities. Compare than to just  .  billion dollars combined for organized crime  financial fraud  public corruption and all other types of traditional criminal activity. I've spent years pouring through the case files of terrorism prosecutions in  the United States  and I've come to  the conclusion that the FBI is much better at creating terrorists than it is at catching terrorists. In the    years since       you can count about six real  terrorist attacks in the United States. These include the Boston Marathon  bombings in       as well as failed attacks  such as the time when  a man named Faisal Shahzad tried to deliver a car bomb to Times Square. In those same    years  the Bureau  however  has bragged about how it's foiled dozens of terrorism plots. In all  the FBI has arrested more than     people in aggressive  undercover  conterterrorism stings. These operations  which are usually led by an informant  provide the means and opportunity  and sometimes even the idea  for mentally ill and  economically desperate people to become what we now term terrorists. After       the FBI was given an edict  never again. Never another attack on American soil. FBI agents were told to find terrorists before they struck. To do this  agents recruited a network of more than        informants nationwide  all looking for anyone who  might be dangerous. An informant can earn          dollars or more for every terrorism case  they bring to the FBI. That's right  the FBI is paying mostly criminals and con men six figures to spy on communities in the United States  but mostly Muslim American communities. These informants nab people like  Abu Khalid Abdul Latif and Walli Mujahidh. Both are mentally ill. Abdul Latif had a history of huffing gasoline and attempting suicide. Mujahidh had schizoaffective disorder  he had trouble distinguishing between reality and fantasy. In       the FBI arrested these two men for conspiring to attack a military recruiting station outside Seattle with weapons provided   of course  by the FBI. The FBI's informant was Robert Childs  a convicted rapist and child molester who was paid        dollars  for his work on the case. This isn't an outlier. In       an FBI informant who had fled Pakistan on murder charges led four men in a plot to bomb  synagogues in the Bronx. The lead defendant was James Cromitie  a broke Walmart employee with a history of mental problems. And the informant had offered  him         dollars if he participated in that plot. There are many more examples. Today  The Intercept published my new story about a counterterrorism sting in Tampa involving Sami Osmakac  a young man who was living  near Tampa  Florida. Osmakac also had  schizoaffective disorder. He too was broke  and he had no connections to  international terrorist groups. Nonetheless  an FBI informant gave him a job  handed him money  introduced him to an undercover agent posing as a terrorist  and lured him in a plot to bomb an Irish bar. But here's what's interesting  The lead undercover agent    you can see him in this picture with his face blurred    would go back to the Tampa field office with his recording equipment on. Behind closed doors  FBI agents admitted that what they were doing was farcical. A federal judge doesn't want you to hear about these conversations. He sealed the transcripts and placed them under a protective order in an attempt to prevent someone like me from doing something like this. Behind closed doors  the lead agent  the squad supervisor  described their would be terrorist as a  retarded fool who didn't have a pot to piss in.  They described his terrorist ambitions as wishy washy and a pipe dream scenario. But that didn't stop the FBI. They provided Sami Osmakac  everything he needed. They gave him a car bomb  they gave him an AK     they helped him make a so called martyrdom video  and they even gave  him money for a taxi cab so that he could get to where they wanted him to go. As they were working the sting  the squad supervisor tells his agents he wanted a Hollywood ending. And he got a Hollywood ending. When Sami Osmakac attempted to deliver what he thought was a car bomb  he was arrested  convicted and  sentenced to    years in prison. Sami Osmakac isn't alone. He's one of more than      so called terrorists  for whom the FBI has created  Hollywood endings. U.S. government officials call this the War on Terror. It's really just theater  a national security theater  with mentally ill men like Sami Osmakac unwitting actors in a  carefully choreographed production brought to you by the FBI. Thank you. Tom Rielly  So  those are some pretty strong accusations  pretty strong charges. How can you back this up  Trevor Aaronson  My research began in      when I received a grant from the  Investigative Reporting Program at U.C. Berkeley  and a research assistant and I put together a database of all terrorism prosecutions at the time during  the first decade after     . And we used the court file to find out whether the defendants had any connections to international terrorist groups  whether an informant was used  and whether the informant played the role of an agent provocateur by providing the means and opportunity. And we submitted that to the FBI and we asked them to respond to our database. If they believed there were any errors  we asked them to tell us what they were and we'd go back and check and they never challenged any of our findings. Later  I used that data  in a magazine article and later in my book  and on appearances on places like CBS and NPR  they were offered that opportunity again to say   Trevor Aaronson's  findings are wrong.  And they've never come forward and said   These are the problems with those findings.  So the data has since been used  by groups like Human Rights Watch on its recent report on  these types of sting operations. And so far  the FBI has never  really responded to these charges that it's really not catching terrorists so much as it's catching mentally ill people that it can dress up as terrorists  in these types of sting operations. TR  So The Intercept is that new investigative journalism website  that's cofounded by Glenn Greenwald. Tell us about your article  and why there. TA  The Intercept seemed to be the most logical place for this because my article is  really leveraging the fact that a source had leaked to me transcripts of these private FBI conversations that a federal judge had sealed based on the government's claim  that their release would irreparably damage  the U.S. government's law enforcement strategy. So a place like The Intercept was set up to protect journalists and publish their work when they're dealing with  very sensitive matters like this. So my story in The Intercept   which was just published today  tells the story of how Sami Osmakac was set up in this FBI sting and goes into much greater detail. In this talk  I could only highlight the things that they said  such as calling him a  retarded fool.  But it was much more elaborate  they went to great lengths to put money in Sami Osmakac's hands  which he then used to purchase weapons from the undercover agent. When he went to trial  the central piece of evidence  was that he paid for these weapons  when in truth  these transcripts show how the FBI orchestrated someone who was essentially mentally ill and broke to get money to then  pay for weapons that they could then charge him in a conspiracy for. TR  One final question. Less than    days ago  the FBI arrested some potential  ISIS suspects in Brooklyn  saying that they might be headed to Syria  and were those real  or examples of more of the same  TA  Well so far  we only know what's come out in the court file  but they seem to suggest it's another example of the same. These types of sting operations  have moved from flavor to flavor. So initially it was al Qaeda plots  and now the Islamic State is the current flavor. What's worth noting about that case is that the three men that were charged only began the plot to go to Syria after the introduction of the FBI informant  and in fact  the FBI informant had helped them with the travel documents that they needed. In kind of a comical turn  in that particular case  one of the defendant's mother had found out that he was interested in going to Syria and had hid his passport. So it's unclear that even if he had showed up at the airport  that he ever could have gone anywhere. So yes  there are people who might be interested in joining the Islamic State in the United States  and those are people that the United  States government should be looking at to see if they're interested in violence here. In this particular case  given the evidence that's so far come out  it suggests the FBI made it possible for these guys to move along in a plan to go to Syria when they were never close  to that in the first place. TR  Thanks a lot  that's amazing. TA  Thank you. It was November          my first day as a principal  but hardly my first day in the school district of Philadelphia. I graduated from Philadelphia public schools  and I went on to teach special education for    years in a low income  low performing school in North Philadelphia  where crime is rampant and deep poverty is among the highest in the nation. Shortly after I walked into my new school  a huge fight broke out among the girls. After things were quickly under control  I immediately called a meeting in the school's auditorium to introduce myself as the school's new principal. I walked in angry  a little nervous    but I was determined to set the tone for my new students. I started listing as forcefully as I could my expectations for their behavior and my expectations for what they would learn in school. When  all of a sudden  a girl way in the back of the auditorium  she stood up and she said   Miss  Miss   When our eyes locked  she said   Why do you keep calling this a school  This is not a school.  In one outburst  Ashley had expressed what I felt and never quite was able to articulate about my own experience when I attended a low performing school in the same neighborhood  many  many  many years earlier. That school was definitely not a school. Fast forwarding a decade later to       I was entering my third low performing school as principal. I was to be Strawberry Mansion's fourth principal in four years. It was labeled  low performing and persistently dangerous  due to its low test scores and high number of weapons  drugs  assaults and arrests. Shortly as I approached the door of my new school and attempted to enter  and found the door locked with chains  I could hear Ashley's voice in my ears going   Miss  Miss  This is not a school.  The halls were dim and dark from poor lighting. There were tons of piles of broken old furniture and desks in the classrooms  and there were thousands of unused materials and resources. This was not a school. As the year progressed  I noticed that the classrooms were nearly empty. The students were just scared  scared to sit in rows in fear that something would happen  scared because they were often teased in the cafeteria for eating free food. They were scared from all the fighting and all the bullying. This was not a school. And then  there were the teachers  who were incredibly afraid for their own safety  so they had low expectations for the students and themselves  and they were totally unaware of their role in the destruction of the school's culture. This was the most troubling of all. You see  Ashley was right  and not just about her school. For far too many schools  for kids who live in poverty  their schools are really not schools at all. But this can change. Let me tell you how it's being done at Strawberry Mansion High School. Anybody who's ever worked with me will tell you I am known for my slogans. So today  I am going to use three that have been paramount in our quest for change. My first slogan is  if you're going to lead  lead. I always believed that what happens in a school and what does not happen in a school is up to the principal. I am the principal  and having that title required me to lead. I was not going to stay in my office  I was not going to delegate my work  and I was not going to be afraid to address anything that was not good for children  whether that made me liked or not. I am a leader  so I know I cannot do anything alone. So  I assembled a top notch leadership team who believed in the possibility of all the children  and together  we tackled the small things  like resetting every single locker combination by hand so that every student could have a secure locker. We decorated every bulletin board in that building with bright  colorful  and positive messages. We took the chains off the front doors of the school. We got the lightbulbs replaced  and we cleaned every classroom to its core  recycling every  every textbook that was not needed  and discarded thousands of old materials and furniture. We used two dumpsters per day. And  of course  of course  we tackled the big stuff  like rehauling the entire school budget so that we can reallocate funds to have more teachers and support staff. We rebuilt the entire school day schedule from scratch to add a variety of start and end times  remediation  honors courses  extracurricular activities  and counseling  all during the school day. All during the school day. We created a deployment plan that specified where every single support person and police officer would be every minute of the day  and we monitored at every second of the day  and  our best invention ever  we devised a schoolwide discipline program titled  Non negotiables.  It was a behavior system    designed to promote positive behavior at all times. The results  Strawberry Mansion was removed from the Persistently Dangerous List our first year after being    after being on the Persistently Dangerous List for five consecutive years. Leaders make the impossible possible. That brings me to my second slogan  So what  Now what  When we looked at the data  and we met with the staff  there were many excuses for why Strawberry Mansion was low performing and persistently dangerous. They said that only    percent of the kids come to school on a regular basis      percent of them live in poverty  only one percent of the parents participate  many of the children come from incarceration and single parent homes     percent of the students have special needs  and the state data revealed that six percent of the students were proficient in algebra  and    were proficient in literature. After they got through telling us all the stories of how awful the conditions and the children were  I looked at them  and I said   So what. Now what  What are we gonna do about it   Eliminating excuses at every turn became my primary responsibility. We addressed every one of those excuses through a mandatory professional development  paving the way for intense focus on teaching and learning. After many observations  what we determined was that teachers knew what to teach but they did not know how to teach so many children with so many vast abilities. So  we developed a lesson delivery model for instruction that focused on small group instruction  making it possible for all the students to get their individual needs met in the classroom. The results  After one year  state data revealed that our scores have grown by     percent in Algebra and     percent in literature. We have a very long way to go  a very long way to go  but we now approach every obstacle with a  So What. Now What   attitude. And that brings me to my third and final slogan. If nobody told you they loved you today  you remember I do  and I always will. My students have problems  social  emotional and economic problems you could never imagine. Some of them are parents themselves  and some are completely alone. If someone asked me my real secret for how I truly keep Strawberry Mansion moving forward  I would have to say that I love my students and I believe in their possibilities unconditionally. When I look at them  I can only see what they can become  and that is because I am one of them. I grew up poor in North Philadelphia too. I know what it feels like to go to a school that's not a school. I know what it feels like to wonder if there's ever going to be any way out of poverty. But because of my amazing mother  I got the ability to dream despite the poverty that surrounded me. So    if I'm going to push my students toward their dream and their purpose in life  I've got to get to know who they are. So I have to spend time with them  so I manage the lunchroom every day. And while I'm there  I talk to them about deeply personal things  and when it's their birthday  I sing  Happy Birthday  even though I cannot sing at all. I often ask them   Why do you want me to sing when I cannot sing at all   And they respond by saying   Because we like feeling special.  We hold monthly town hall meetings to listen to their concerns  to find out what is on their minds. They ask us questions like   Why do we have to follow rules    Why are there so many consequences    Why can't we just do what we want to do   They ask  and I answer each question honestly  and this exchange in listening helps to clear up any misconceptions. Every moment is a teachable moment. My reward  my reward for being non negotiable in my rules and consequences is their earned respect. I insist on it  and because of this  we can accomplish things together. They are clear about my expectations for them  and I repeat those expectations every day over the P.A. system. I remind them    I remind them of those core values of focus  tradition  excellence  integrity and perseverance  and I remind them every day how education can truly change their lives. And I end every announcement the same   If nobody told you they loved you today  you remember I do  and I always will.  Ashley's words of  Miss  Miss  this is not a school   is forever etched in my mind. If we are truly going to make real progress in addressing poverty  then we have to make sure that every school that serves children in poverty is a real school  a school  a school    a school that provides them with knowledge and mental training to navigate the world around them. I do not know all the answers  but what I do know is for those of us who are privileged and have the responsibility of leading a school that serves children in poverty  we must truly lead  and when we are faced with unbelievable challenges  we must stop and ask ourselves   So what. Now what  What are we going to do about it   And as we lead  we must never forget that every single one of our students is just a child  often scared by what the world tells them they should be  and no matter what the rest of the world tells them they should be  we should always provide them with hope  our undivided attention  unwavering belief in their potential  consistent expectations  and we must tell them often  if nobody told them they loved them today  remember we do  and we always will. Thank you. Thank you  Jesus. In       during the final six months of Kim Jong Il's life  I lived undercover in North Korea. I was born and raised in South Korea  their enemy. I live in America  their other enemy. Since       I had visited North Korea a few times. And I had come to realize that to write about it with any meaning  or to understand the place beyond the regime's propaganda  the only option was total immersion. So I posed as a teacher and a missionary at an all male university in Pyongyang. The Pyongyang University of Science and Technology was founded by Evangelical Christians who cooperate with the regime to educate the sons of the North Korean elite  without proselytizing  which is a capital crime there. The students were     young men  expected to be the future leaders of the most isolated and brutal dictatorship in existence. When I arrived  they became my students.      was a special year  marking the    th anniversary of the birth of North Korea's original Great Leader  Kim Il Sung. To celebrate the occasion  the regime shut down all universities  and sent students off to the fields to build the DPRK's much heralded ideal as the world's most powerful and prosperous nation. My students were the only ones spared from that fate. North Korea is a gulag posing as a nation. Everything there is about the Great Leader. Every book  every newspaper article  every song  every TV program    there is just one subject. The flowers are named after him  the mountains are carved with his slogans. Every citizen wears the badge of the Great Leader at all times. Even their calendar system begins with the birth of Kim Il Sung. The school was a heavily guarded prison  posing as a campus. Teachers could only leave on group outings accompanied by an official minder. Even then  our trips were limited to sanctioned national monuments celebrating the Great Leader. The students were not allowed to leave the campus  or communicate with their parents. Their days were meticulously mapped out  and any free time they had was devoted to honoring their Great Leader. Lesson plans had to meet the approval of North Korean staff  every class was recorded and reported on  every room was bugged  and every conversation  overheard. Every blank space was covered with the  portraits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il  like everywhere else in North Korea. We were never allowed to discuss the outside world. As students of science and technology  many of them were computer majors but they did not know the existence of the Internet. They had never heard of Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs. Facebook  Twitter    none of those things would have meant a thing. And I could not tell them. I went there looking for truth. But where do you even start when an entire nation's ideology  my students' day to day realities  and even my own position at the universities  were all built on lies  I started with a game. We played  Truth and Lie.  A volunteer would write a sentence on the chalkboard  and the other students had to guess whether it was a truth or a lie. Once a student wrote   I visited China last year on vacation   and everyone shouted   Lie   They all knew this wasn't possible. Virtually no North Korean is allowed to leave the country. Even traveling within their own country requires a travel pass. I had hoped that this game would reveal some truth about my students  because they lie so often and so easily  whether about the mythical accomplishments of their Great Leader  or the strange claim that they cloned a rabbit as fifth graders. The difference between truth and lies seemed at times hazy to them. It took me a while to understand the different types of lies  they lie to shield their system from the world  or they were taught lies  and were just regurgitating them. Or  at moments  they lied out of habit. But if all they have ever known were lies  how could we expect them to be otherwise  Next  I tried to teach them essay writing. But that turned out to be nearly impossible. Essays are about coming up with one's own thesis  and making an evidence based argument to prove it. These students  however  were simply told what to think  and they obeyed. In their world  critical thinking was not allowed. I also gave them the weekly assignment of writing a personal letter  to anybody. It took a long time  but eventually some of them began to write to their mothers  their friends  their girlfriends. Although those were just homework  and would never reach their intended recipients  my students slowly began to reveal their true feelings in them. They wrote that they were fed up with the sameness of everything. They were worried about their future. In those letters  they rarely ever mentioned their Great Leader. I was spending all of my time with these young men. We all ate meals together  played basketball together. I often called them gentlemen  which made them giggle. They blushed at the mention of girls. And I came to adore them. And watching them open up even in the tiniest of ways  was deeply moving. But something also felt wrong. During those months of living in their world  I often wondered if the truth would  in fact  improve their lives. I wanted so much to tell them the truth  of their country and of the outside world  where Arab youth were turning their rotten regime inside out  using the power of social media  where everyone except them was connected through the world wide web  which wasn't worldwide after all. But for them  the truth was dangerous. By encouraging them to run after it  I was putting them at risk    of persecution  of heartbreak. When you're not allowed to express anything in the open  you become good at reading what is unspoken. In one of their personal letters to me  a student wrote that he understood why I always called them gentlemen. It was because I was wishing them to be gentle in life  he said. On my last day in December of       the day Kim Jong Il's death was announced  their world shattered. I had to leave without a proper goodbye. But I think they knew how sad I was for them. Once  toward the end of my stay  a student said to me   Professor  we never think of you as being different from us. Our circumstances are different  but you're the same as us. We want you to know that we truly think of you as being the same.  Today  if I could respond to my students with a letter of my own  which is of course impossible  I would tell them this   My dear gentlemen  It's been a bit over three years since I last saw you. And now  you must be       maybe even as old as   . At our final class  I asked you if there was anything you wanted. The only wish you expressed  the only thing you ever asked of me in all those months we spent together  was for me to speak to you in Korean. Just once. I was there to teach you English  you knew it wasn't allowed. But I understood then  you wanted to share that bond of our mother tongue. I called you my gentlemen  but I don't know if being gentle in Kim Jong Un's merciless North Korea is a good thing. I don't want you to lead a revolution    let some other young person do it. The rest of the world might casually encourage or even expect some sort of North Korean Spring  but I don't want you to do anything risky  because I know in your world  someone is always watching. I don't want to imagine what might happen to you. If my attempts to reach you have inspired something new in you  I would rather you forget me. Become soldiers of your Great Leader  and live long  safe lives. You once asked me if I thought your city of Pyongyang was beautiful  and I could not answer truthfully then. But I know why you asked. I know that it was important for you to hear that I  your teacher  the one who has seen the world that you are forbidden from  declare your city as the most beautiful. I know hearing that would make your lives there a bit more bearable  but no  I don't find your capital beautiful. Not because it's monotone and concrete  but because of what it symbolizes  a monster that feeds off the rest of the country  where citizens are soldiers and slaves. All I see there is darkness. But it's your home  so I cannot hate it. And I hope instead that you  my lovely young gentlemen  will one day help make it beautiful. Thank you. This is a play called  Sell Buy Date.  It's my first since  Bridge and Tunnel   which I did on Broadway  and this one  I    thank you    I've excerpted it just for you  so here we go. Right. Class  let's be absolutely certain all electronic devices are switched off before we begin. So class  hopefully you'll recognize what you just heard me say as the      Very good  the cellular phone announcement. Right  This was also known as a mobile phone. So you'll remember  people of that era would have had an external electronic device  right  something like this  and they all would have carried one of these around with them  and amongst their biggest fears was the sheer mortification that one of these might ring at some inopportune moment. Right  So a bit of trivia about that era for you. So the format of today's class is I will be presenting multiple BERT modules today from that period in history  right  so starting circa     . And remember  this was the very first year of the BERT program. So we've got quite a few of these to get through. Bear in mind  I will be living into various different bodies  different ages  also what were then called races  or ethnic groups  as you'll remember from Unit  . And     Laughter     and along the gender continuum  I will be living into males as well. It was quite binary at that time. Also  don't forget  we are reading the book module for next week's focus on gender. Now  I know some of you have requested the book in pill form. I know people still believe ingesting it is better for retention  but since we are trying to experience what our forebears did  right  let's please just consider doing the actual ocular reading  okay  And also  how many people have your emotional shunts engaged  Right. Please toggle them off. Okay  I know it's challenging  but I want you to be able to feel the entire natural emo range  all right  It is essential to this part of the syllabus. Yes  Macy  All right. I understand. If you're unwilling to    All right  well  we can discuss that after class. All right  we will discuss your concerns. Just relax. Nobody's died and gone to composting. Okay. After class. Okay  After class. Let's just get started  okay. This first subject identified as a middle class homemaker. Remember  these early modules in these people's full identities were protected  and this allowed them to speak more freely on our topic  which for many of them was taboo. Okay honey  now  I'm ready when you are. No  sweetheart  I said  I'm ready when you are. I'm freezing. It's like a meat locker in here in this recording studio. I should have brought a shmata. All this fancy technology but they can't afford heat. What is he saying  I can't hear you  I can't hear you through the glass  honey  There you are in my ear. Oh  you can hear me  The whole time. Oh  yes  I am a little chilly. Yes  oh the cold is for the machines  the new technology. Okay. Yes  now remind me again  you're recording not only my voice but my feelings and my memories  Right. Yes  BERT  yes  I read about it. Bio Empathetic Resonant Technology. Right  right  so people will be able to feel my experience and my memory  Okay. No  right  I'm ready. I just thought you were going to give me a test to see how my memory's doing. I was going to tell you you're too late  it's already bad news. No  no  go ahead  honey. Oh  that's the first question  What do I think of prostitution  Are you soliciting me  young man  I've heard of May December romances  but what are you  about    years old  Eighteen  Eighteen years. I think I have candies in my purse older than    years old. I'm teasing you  sweetheart. No  I'm comfortable with any question. Sure. So about the prostitution    oh  sex worker  sex worker. No  just in my day  they called it prostitution  not sex work. Oh  because it includes pornography also  Okay. No  well  I guess when I was a girl  we didn't really have a name for that either. We would have said dirty magazines  I suppose  or dirty movies. Well  it's not like what you have with the Internet. No  well  I don't mind sharing. My late husband and I  we were a very romantic couple. Lots of tenderness  you understand. Well  as you get older  you know  at one point I thought my husband might be helped by using some of the pills men can take  but he wasn't interested in those  so I thought  what about maybe watching an adult movie on the Internet  Just for inspiration  you understand. Well  at the time  neither of us were very good on the computer  so usually  if we needed help with the Internet  we would just call our children or our grandchildren  but obviously  in this case  that wasn't an option  so I thought  I'll have a look myself  just to see. How difficult could it be  You search for certain key words and you look    Oh wow is right  young man. You can't imagine what I saw. Well  first of all  I was just trying to find  you know  couples  normal couples making love  but this  so many people together at one time. You couldn't tell which part belonged to which body. How they even got the cameras to capture some of this  I couldn't tell you. But the one thing they didn't capture was making love. There was lots of making of something  but they took the love part right out of it  you know  the fun. It was all very extreme  you know  Like you would say  with the extreme sports. Lots of endurance  but never tenderness. So anyway  needless to say  that was    .   I'll never get back again  but it only showed up on the credit card as  entertainment services   so my husband was never the wiser  and after all of that  well  you could say it turned out he didn't need the extra inspiration after all. Right  so next subject is a young woman     Applause     Next subject  class  is a young woman called Bella  a university student interviewed in      during what was called an Intro to Feminist Porn class as part of her major in sex work at a college in the Bay Area. Yeah  I just want to  like  get a recording of  like  you guys recording me  like a meta recording  or whatever. It's just like this whole experience is just  like  really amazing  and I'd like to capture that for  like  Instagram and my Tumblr. So  like  hi guys  it's me  Bella  and I am  like  being interviewed right now for this  like  really amazing Bio Empathetic Resonance Technology  which is  like  basically where they are  like  recording  as you can see from these  whatever  like  electrodes  the formation of  like  neuropeptides in my hippocampus  or whatever. They will later be able to reconstitute these as  like  my own actual memory  like actual experiences  so other people can  like  actually feel what I'm feeling right now. Okay. Okay. So  like  hello  BERT person of the future who is experiencing me. This is what it feels like to be  like  a college freshman  and also the  like  headache that you are experiencing through me is the  like  residual effect of the Jell O shots which I had last night at the bi weekly feminist pole dancing party which I cohost on Wednesdays. It's called  Don't Get All Pole emical      Laughter     and it's in Beekman Hall  and  what else  like  non Jell O shots are also available for vegans  and  oh  okay  yeah  totally  yeah  we should also focus on your questions also. So for your record  I am  like  a sex work studies major but minoring in social media with a concentration on notable YouTube memes. Yes  well  of course  like  I consider myself to be  like  obviously  like  a feminist. I was named for Bella Abzug  who was  like  a famous  like  feminist from history  and  like  also I feel that it is  like  important to  like  represent women who are  like  sex positive feminists. What is sex negative  Well  like  I guess I would ask  like  what do you think sex negative is   Laughter  Yeah  because  like  the terms that we use are  like  so important  because  like  we call it sex work because it helps people understand that  like  it's work  and  like  you know  just like there are  like  healthcare providers and  like  insurance providers  like  we think of these workers as  like  sex care providers. Yeah  but like  I don't think of myself like  providing direct sex care services per se as  like  being a requirement for me to be  like  an advocate. Like  I support other women's right to choose it voluntarily  like  if they enjoy it. Yeah  but  like  I see myself going forward as more likely  like  protecting sex workers'  like  legal freedoms and rights. Yeah  so  like  basically  I'm planning on becoming a lawyer. Right  class.  Laughter   Applause  So these next two modules are also circa     . One subject is an Irishwoman with a particularly noteworthy relationship to this issue  but first will be a West Indian woman  a self described escort who was recorded at a sex workers' rights rally and parade. She was interviewed whilst marching in full carnival headdress and very little else. All right  you want me to start talking now. Yeah  I told you  you can put those wires anywhere you want to as long as it don't get in the way. Yeah  no  but  tell me again what the name of    BERT  BERT. Yeah  I was telling you  you know  I think I have in all my time I have had at least one client with that name  so this won't be the first time I had BERT all over me. Oh  I'm sorry  but you got to get into the spirit of it if you're going to interview me. All right  You can say it. No justice  no piece  No justice  no piece  But you see the sign  You get it  P I E C E. No justice  no piece of us. You understand  Right  so that's the part where I was telling you is that when I first came to this country  I worked every job I could find. I was a nanny  I was a home care attendant for all these different old people  and then I said  child  if I have to touch another white man's backside  I might as well get paid a lot more money for it than this  you understand  Pshh  you know how hard it is being a domestic worker  Some of these men  they're heavy. You have to pick them up and flip them over. Now  I let them pick me up and flip me over  you understand  Well  you have to have a sense of humor about it  that's what I think. No  but see  listen  you find me somebody who don't hate some part of their job. I mean  there's a lot of things about this job that I hate  but the money is not one of them  and I will tell you  as long as this is the best possibility for me to make real money  I am going to be Jamaican No Fakin' if that's what they want to call me. No  I'm not even from Jamaica. That's how they market me. My family is from Trinidad and the Virgin Islands. They don't know what I do  but you know what  My children  they know that their school fees are paid  they have their books and their computer  and this way  I know that they have a chance. So I'm not going to tell you that what I do  it's easy  I'm not going to tell you that I feel    what's that you said  liberated  But I'm going to tell you that I feel paid. Right.  Applause  Thanks  that's lovely  and just the cup of tea  love  and just a splash of the whiskey. It's perfect  that's grand. Just a drop more. A splash. Perfect. What was your name  Peter  Is that right  so  Peter  Right. So that  that is the unique part of it for me  right  is that I ended up in both  first in the convent  and then in the prostitution after. That's right. So one woman at the university here in Dublin  she wrote about me. She said  Maureen Fitzroy is the living embodiment of the whore virgin dichotomy. Right   Laughter  Doesn't it sound like something you need to go into hospital  Well  I've got this terrible dichotomy. Doesn't it. Right. Well  for me though  it was  as a girl  it started with me dad. I mean  half the time  when he spoke to us  it was just a sort of tell us we were all useless rotten idiots and we had no morals  that type of thing. And I certainly didn't do myself any favors. By the time I was     I had started messing about with this older fella  and he wanted it to be our little secret  and I did as I was told  didn't I  and when that got back to me dad  he had me sent straightaway to the convent. Well no  that older fella  he would still come to find me in the convent. Yeah  he'd leave me notes tucked into the holes in the brick at the back of the charity shop so we could meet. And he'd tell me how he's leaving his wife  and I believed him  until I got pregnant. I did  Peter  and I left him a note about it in our special place there  and I never did hear from him again. No  I gave it up for adoption so it could have a decent life  and then they wouldn't let me back into the convent. No  my one sister Virginia gave me a fiver for the coach to Dublin  and that's how I ended up here. Well  surprise  surprise  I fell in love with another fella much older than me  and I always say I was just so happy because he didn't drink  I married the bastard. Well  he didn't drink  but he did have just the wee heroin problem  didn't he  and    That's right  and before I knew it  he was the one who turned me on to the prostitution  my own husband. He had me supporting the both of us. I was   . Well  it wasn't Pretty Woman  I can tell you that. That Julia Roberts  if she'd ever had to sleep with a man to put a few pounds in her pocket  I don't think she'd ever have made that film. Well  for your record  my opinion of the legalization  I'd say I'm against it. I just  I don't care what these young girls say. You know  living like that  you're just lost  and  you know  I'm    years old. I'm still trying to find who I am. You know  I never was a wife or a nun  or a prostitute even  really  not really. Nobody ever asked who I wanted to be. They just told me  and if you legalize it  then you're really telling these girls   Go on and get lost for a living   and a lot of them  they'll do as they're told. All right  so four perspectives from four quite     Applause     four quite different voices there  right  One woman saying sex itself is natural but the sex industry seems to mechanize or industrialize it. Then the second woman considered sex work to be empowering  liberating  and feminist  though she  herself  notably  did not seem keen to do it. The third woman  who actually was a so called sex worker did not agree that it was liberating but she wanted the right to the economic empowerment  and then we hear the fourth woman saying not only prostitution itself but proscribed roles for women in general prevented her from ever finding who she was  right  So another fact most people did not know was the average age of an at risk girl being introduced to the sex industry was    or   . Also consider that the age when all girls in that society first became exposed to sexualized images of women was quite a bit earlier  right  This was a doll called Barbie  right  I initially thought she was an educational tool for anorexia prevention    but actually she was considered by many to be a wholesome symbol of femininity  and often young girls began what was called dieting. Remember this  This was restricting food intake on purpose by the age of six  and defining themselves based on attractiveness by around that same time. Right  Yes  Right  Bradley  okay  excellent point. So there was a lucrative market in that society in convincing all people they had to look a certain way to even have a sex life  right  But girls  especially  were expected to be  sexy  while avoiding being perceived as  sluts  for being sexual. Right  So there's that shame piece we've heard about. Yes. Valerie  right  Okay  very good. Of course  men were having sex as well  but you'll remember from the reading  what were male sluts called  Very good  they were called men. So not easy living in a world like that  right  Though it was not all bad news either. Most women in the early     s considered themselves empowered  and men generally felt they were also evolved in this area  and  in fact  most people would have been aware of issues like human trafficking  for example  but they would have seen that as quite separate from more recreational adult entertainment. And so we'll just very briefly  class    we don't have a lot of time    we'll just very briefly hear from a man on our topic at this stage. So this next subject was interviewed on the night of his bachelor party. Dude  can you  all right  can you just keep it down  I'm trying to talk to BERT right now. Oh  your name's not BERT. BERT's the name of the  oh  all right. No  no  no  totally  it's totally fine. I'm mostly sober  so I just want to be helpful. Yeah  and I totally believe in causes  yeah  like  all that stuff. And actually  I'm wearing Toms right now. Yeah  Toms  like  the shoes  like  you buy a pair and then a kid in Africa gets clean water. Yeah. Totally. But what was the question again  Sorry. Of course I believe in women's rights. I'm marrying a woman. No  but I mean  like  just because I'm in a strip club parking lot doesn't mean that I'm  like  a sexist or whatever. My fiancee is totally amazing  she's totally a strong girl  woman  smart woman  like  the whole thing. Yeah  she knows I'm here. She's probably at a strip club herself right now  like  as a joke  same as me. My best man  I told him he could surprise me  and he thought this would be hilarious  but this is not something. Yeah  we all went to B school together. Wharton. Yeah  so  dude  can you guys    All right  but it's my bachelor party  and I can spend it in the parking lot with Anderson Cooper if I want to. All right  I'll see you in there. All right  okay  so Anderson  so  like  first of all  stripping  but then  like  all the other things you're talking about  prostitution and all that stuff  that's  like  not the same thing at all. You know  Like  you keep calling it the sex industry or whatever  but it's like  if the girl wants to be an exotic dancer and she's     like  that's her right. Whoa  whoa  I hear what you're saying  but I just feel like people  they just want to make it seem like all dudes are just  like  predators  that we would just automatically go to a prostitute  or whatever. Even  like  when I pledged  you know  like when I rushed my fraternity. My brothers who I'm close to  those guys  they're all like me. We're just normal people  but  like  there's this myth that you must be that guy who is kind of an asshole  and like  all bros before hos or whatever. And actually  like  bros before hos  it doesn't mean like what it sounds like. It's actually just like a joking way of saying that you care about your brothers and you put them first. Yeah  but  you can't blame the media  either. I mean  like  if you go watch  Hangover     and you think that's an instruction manual for your life  like  I don't know what to tell you. You know  You don't watch  Bourne Identity  and go drive your car over a gondola in Venice.  Laughter  Well  yeah  okay  like  if you're a little kid or whatever  of course it's different  but    Yeah  all right  I remember one thing like that. I was at this kid's house one time playing GTA  uh  Grand Theft Auto  Dude  are you from Canada   Laughter  So  like  whatever  with Grand Theft Auto  you're this kid  like  you're this guy walking around or whatever  and you can basically  like  the more cops you kill  the more points you get  and stuff like that. But also  you can find prostitutes and obviously you can do sexual stuff with them  but you can  like  kill them and take your money back. Yeah  this kid  I remember he ran over a couple of them a few times with his car and he got all these points. We were  like      I think. It felt pretty terrible  actually. No  I don't think I said anything  I just finished playing and went home. All right class  so then there were men who had more than just a passing relationship to this issue.  Laughter  The next subject described himself as a reformed and remorseful pimp turned motivational speaker  life coach and therapist  but if you want to know more about him  you'll have to come to the entire play. Thank you so much  you beautiful TED audience. I will see you for  Sell Buy Date.  I love a great mystery  and I'm fascinated by the greatest unsolved mystery in science  perhaps because it's personal. It's about who we are  and I can't help but be curious. The mystery is this  What is the relationship between your brain and your conscious experiences  such as your experience of the taste of chocolate or the feeling of velvet  Now  this mystery is not new. In       Thomas Huxley wrote   How it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the genie when Aladdin rubbed his lamp.  Now  Huxley knew that brain activity and conscious experiences are correlated  but he didn't know why. To the science of his day  it was a mystery. In the years since Huxley  science has learned a lot about brain activity  but the relationship between brain activity and conscious experiences is still a mystery. Why  Why have we made so little progress  Well  some experts think that we can't solve this problem because we lack the necessary concepts and intelligence. We don't expect monkeys to solve problems in quantum mechanics  and as it happens  we can't expect our species to solve this problem either. Well  I disagree. I'm more optimistic. I think we've simply made a false assumption. Once we fix it  we just might solve this problem. Today  I'd like tell you what that assumption is  why it's false  and how to fix it. Let's begin with a question  Do we see reality as it is  I open my eyes and I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato a meter away. As a result  I come to believe that in reality  there's a red tomato a meter away. I then close my eyes  and my experience changes to a gray field  but is it still the case that in reality  there's a red tomato a meter away  I think so  but could I be wrong  Could I be misinterpreting the nature of my perceptions  We have misinterpreted our perceptions before. We used to think the Earth is flat  because it looks that way. Pythagorus discovered that we were wrong. Then we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of the Universe  again because it looks that way. Copernicus and Galileo discovered  again  that we were wrong. Galileo then wondered if we might be misinterpreting our experiences in other ways. He wrote   I think that tastes  odors  colors  and so on reside in consciousness. Hence if the living creature were removed  all these qualities would be annihilated.  Now  that's a stunning claim. Could Galileo be right  Could we really be misinterpreting our experiences that badly  What does modern science have to say about this  Well  neuroscientists tell us that about a third of the brain's cortex is engaged in vision. When you simply open your eyes and look about this room  billions of neurons and trillions of synapses are engaged. Now  this is a bit surprising  because to the extent that we think about vision at all  we think of it as like a camera. It just takes a picture of objective reality as it is. Now  there is a part of vision that's like a camera  the eye has a lens that focuses an image on the back of the eye where there are     million photoreceptors  so the eye is like a     megapixel camera. But that doesn't explain the billions of neurons and trillions of synapses that are engaged in vision. What are these neurons up to  Well  neuroscientists tell us that they are creating  in real time  all the shapes  objects  colors  and motions that we see. It feels like we're just taking a snapshot of this room the way it is  but in fact  we're constructing everything that we see. We don't construct the whole world at once. We construct what we need in the moment. Now  there are many demonstrations that are quite compelling that we construct what we see. I'll just show you two. In this example  you see some red discs with bits cut out of them  but if I just rotate the disks a little bit  suddenly  you see a  D cube pop out of the screen. Now  the screen of course is flat  so the three dimensional cube that you're experiencing must be your construction. In this next example  you see glowing blue bars with pretty sharp edges moving across a field of dots. In fact  no dots move. All I'm doing from frame to frame is changing the colors of dots from blue to black or black to blue. But when I do this quickly  your visual system creates the glowing blue bars with the sharp edges and the motion. There are many more examples  but these are just two that you construct what you see. But neuroscientists go further. They say that we reconstruct reality. So  when I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato  that experience is actually an accurate reconstruction of the properties of a real red tomato that would exist even if I weren't looking. Now  why would neuroscientists say that we don't just construct  we reconstruct  Well  the standard argument given is usually an evolutionary one. Those of our ancestors who saw more accurately had a competitive advantage compared to those who saw less accurately  and therefore they were more likely to pass on their genes. We are the offspring of those who saw more accurately  and so we can be confident that  in the normal case  our perceptions are accurate. You see this in the standard textbooks. One textbook says  for example   Evolutionarily speaking  vision is useful precisely because it is so accurate.  So the idea is that accurate perceptions are fitter perceptions. They give you a survival advantage. Now  is this correct  Is this the right interpretation of evolutionary theory  Well  let's first look at a couple of examples in nature. The Australian jewel beetle is dimpled  glossy and brown. The female is flightless. The male flies  looking  of course  for a hot female. When he finds one  he alights and mates. There's another species in the outback  Homo sapiens. The male of this species has a massive brain that he uses to hunt for cold beer. And when he finds one  he drains it  and sometimes throws the bottle into the outback. Now  as it happens  these bottles are dimpled  glossy  and just the right shade of brown to tickle the fancy of these beetles. The males swarm all over the bottles trying to mate. They lose all interest in the real females. Classic case of the male leaving the female for the bottle. The species almost went extinct. Australia had to change its bottles to save its beetles. Now  the males had successfully found females for thousands  perhaps millions of years. It looked like they saw reality as it is  but apparently not. Evolution had given them a hack. A female is anything dimpled  glossy and brown  the bigger the better. Even when crawling all over the bottle  the male couldn't discover his mistake. Now  you might say  beetles  sure  they're very simple creatures  but surely not mammals. Mammals don't rely on tricks. Well  I won't dwell on this  but you get the idea.  Laughter  So this raises an important technical question  Does natural selection really favor seeing reality as it is  Fortunately  we don't have to wave our hands and guess  evolution is a mathematically precise theory. We can use the equations of evolution to check this out. We can have various organisms in artificial worlds compete and see which survive and which thrive  which sensory systems are more fit. A key notion in those equations is fitness. Consider this steak  What does this steak do for the fitness of an animal  Well  for a hungry lion looking to eat  it enhances fitness. For a well fed lion looking to mate  it doesn't enhance fitness. And for a rabbit in any state  it doesn't enhance fitness  so fitness does depend on reality as it is  yes  but also on the organism  its state and its action. Fitness is not the same thing as reality as it is  and it's fitness  and not reality as it is  that figures centrally in the equations of evolution. So  in my lab  we have run hundreds of thousands of evolutionary game simulations with lots of different randomly chosen worlds and organisms that compete for resources in those worlds. Some of the organisms see all of the reality  others see just part of the reality  and some see none of the reality  only fitness. Who wins  Well  I hate to break it to you  but perception of reality goes extinct. In almost every simulation  organisms that see none of reality but are just tuned to fitness drive to extinction all the organisms that perceive reality as it is. So the bottom line is  evolution does not favor veridical  or accurate perceptions. Those perceptions of reality go extinct. Now  this is a bit stunning. How can it be that not seeing the world accurately gives us a survival advantage  That is a bit counterintuitive. But remember the jewel beetle. The jewel beetle survived for thousands  perhaps millions of years  using simple tricks and hacks. What the equations of evolution are telling us is that all organisms  including us   are in the same boat as the jewel beetle. We do not see reality as it is. We're shaped with tricks and hacks that keep us alive. Still  we need some help with our intuitions. How can not perceiving reality as it is be useful  Well  fortunately  we have a very helpful metaphor  the desktop interface on your computer. Consider that blue icon for a TED Talk that you're writing. Now  the icon is blue and rectangular and in the lower right corner of the desktop. Does that mean that the text file itself in the computer is blue  rectangular  and in the lower right hand corner of the computer  Of course not. Anyone who thought that misinterprets the purpose of the interface. It's not there to show you the reality of the computer. In fact  it's there to hide that reality. You don't want to know about the diodes and resistors and all the megabytes of software. If you had to deal with that  you could never write your text file or edit your photo. So the idea is that evolution has given us an interface that hides reality and guides adaptive behavior. Space and time  as you perceive them right now  are your desktop. Physical objects are simply icons in that desktop. There's an obvious objection. Hoffman  if you think that train coming down the track at     MPH is just an icon of your desktop  why don't you step in front of it  And after you're gone  and your theory with you  we'll know that there's more to that train than just an icon. Well  I wouldn't step in front of that train for the same reason that I wouldn't carelessly drag that icon to the trash can  not because I take the icon literally    the file is not literally blue or rectangular    but I do take it seriously. I could lose weeks of work. Similarly  evolution has shaped us with perceptual symbols that are designed to keep us alive. We'd better take them seriously. If you see a snake  don't pick it up. If you see a cliff  don't jump off. They're designed to keep us safe  and we should take them seriously. That does not mean that we should take them literally. That's a logical error. Another objection  There's nothing really new here. Physicists have told us for a long time that the metal of that train looks solid but really it's mostly empty space with microscopic particles zipping around. There's nothing new here. Well  not exactly. It's like saying  I know that that blue icon on the desktop is not the reality of the computer  but if I pull out my trusty magnifying glass and look really closely  I see little pixels  and that's the reality of the computer. Well  not really    you're still on the desktop  and that's the point. Those microscopic particles are still in space and time  they're still in the user interface. So I'm saying something far more radical than those physicists. Finally  you might object  look  we all see the train  therefore none of us constructs the train. But remember this example. In this example  we all see a cube  but the screen is flat  so the cube that you see is the cube that you construct. We all see a cube because we all  each one of us  constructs the cube that we see. The same is true of the train. We all see a train because we each see the train that we construct  and the same is true of all physical objects. We're inclined to think that perception is like a window on reality as it is. The theory of evolution is telling us that this is an incorrect interpretation of our perceptions. Instead  reality is more like a  D desktop that's designed to hide the complexity of the real world and guide adaptive behavior. Space as you perceive it is your desktop. Physical objects are just the icons in that desktop. We used to think that the Earth is flat because it looks that way. Then we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of reality because it looks that way. We were wrong. We had misinterpreted our perceptions. Now we believe that spacetime and objects are the nature of reality as it is. The theory of evolution is telling us that once again  we're wrong. We're misinterpreting the content of our perceptual experiences. There's something that exists when you don't look  but it's not spacetime and physical objects. It's as hard for us to let go of spacetime and objects as it is for the jewel beetle to let go of its bottle. Why  Because we're blind to our own blindnesses. But we have an advantage over the jewel beetle  our science and technology. By peering through the lens of a telescope we discovered that the Earth is not the unmoving center of reality  and by peering through the lens of the theory of evolution we discovered that spacetime and objects are not the nature of reality. When I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a red tomato  I am interacting with reality  but that reality is not a red tomato and is nothing like a red tomato. Similarly  when I have an experience that I describe as a lion or a steak  I'm interacting with reality  but that reality is not a lion or a steak. And here's the kicker  When I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a brain  or neurons  I am interacting with reality  but that reality is not a brain or neurons and is nothing like a brain or neurons. And that reality  whatever it is  is the real source of cause and effect in the world    not brains  not neurons. Brains and neurons have no causal powers. They cause none of our perceptual experiences  and none of our behavior. Brains and neurons are a species specific set of symbols  a hack. What does this mean for the mystery of consciousness  Well  it opens up new possibilities. For instance  perhaps reality is some vast machine that causes our conscious experiences. I doubt this  but it's worth exploring. Perhaps reality is some vast  interacting network of conscious agents  simple and complex  that cause each other's conscious experiences. Actually  this isn't as crazy an idea as it seems  and I'm currently exploring it. But here's the point  Once we let go of our massively intuitive but massively false assumption about the nature of reality  it opens up new ways to think about life's greatest mystery. I bet that reality will end up turning out to be more fascinating and unexpected than we've ever imagined. The theory of evolution presents us with the ultimate dare  Dare to recognize that perception is not about seeing truth  it's about having kids. And by the way  even this TED is just in your head. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  If that's really you there  thank you. So there's so much from this. I mean  first of all  some people may just be profoundly depressed at the thought that  if evolution does not favor reality  I mean  doesn't that to some extent undermine all our endeavors here  all our ability to think that we can think the truth  possibly even including your own theory  if you go there  Donald Hoffman  Well  this does not stop us from a successful science. What we have is one theory that turned out to be false  that perception is like reality and reality is like our perceptions. That theory turns out to be false. Okay  throw that theory away. That doesn't stop us from now postulating all sorts of other theories about the nature of reality  so it's actually progress to recognize that one of our theories was false. So science continues as normal. There's no problem here. CA  So you think it's possible     Laughter     This is cool  but what you're saying I think is it's possible that evolution can still get you to reason. DH  Yes. Now that's a very  very good point. The evolutionary game simulations that I showed were specifically about perception  and they do show that our perceptions have been shaped not to show us reality as it is  but that does not mean the same thing about our logic or mathematics. We haven't done these simulations  but my bet is that we'll find that there are some selection pressures for our logic and our mathematics to be at least in the direction of truth. I mean  if you're like me  math and logic is not easy. We don't get it all right  but at least the selection pressures are not uniformly away from true math and logic. So I think that we'll find that we have to look at each cognitive faculty one at a time and see what evolution does to it. What's true about perception may not be true about math and logic. CA  I mean  really what you're proposing is a kind of modern day Bishop Berkeley interpretation of the world  consciousness causes matter  not the other way around. DH  Well  it's slightly different than Berkeley. Berkeley thought that  he was a deist  and he thought that the ultimate nature of reality is God and so forth  and I don't need to go where Berkeley's going  so it's quite a bit different from Berkeley. I call this conscious realism. It's actually a very different approach. CA  Don  I could literally talk with you for hours  and I hope to do that. Thanks so much for that. DH  Thank you.  Applause  The first time I uttered a prayer was in a glass stained cathedral. I was kneeling long after the congregation was on its feet  dip both hands into holy water  trace the trinity across my chest  my tiny body drooping  like a question mark all over the wooden pew. I asked Jesus to fix me  and when he did not answer I befriended silence in the hopes that my sin would burn and salve my mouth would dissolve like sugar on tongue  but shame lingered as an aftertaste. And in an attempt to reintroduce me to sanctity  my mother told me of the miracle I was  said I could grow up  to be anything I want. I decided to be a boy. It was cute. I had snapback  toothless grin  used skinned knees as street cred  played hide and seek with  what was left of my goal. I was it. The winner to a game  the other kids couldn't play  I was the mystery of an anatomy  a question asked but not answered  tightroping between awkward boy and apologetic girl  and when I turned     the boy phase wasn't deemed cute anymore. It was met with nostalgic aunts who missed seeing my knees in the shadow of skirts  who reminded me that my kind of attitude would never bring a husband home  that I exist for heterosexual marriage and child bearing. And I swallowed their insults along with their slurs. Naturally  I did not come out of the closet. The kids at my school opened it without my permission. Called me by a name I did not recognize  said  lesbian   but I was more boy than girl  more Ken than Barbie. It had nothing to do with hating my body  I just love it enough to let it go  I treat it like a house  and when your house is falling apart  you do not evacuate  you make it comfortable enough to house all your insides  you make it pretty enough to invite guests over  you make the floorboards strong enough to stand on. My mother fears I have named myself after fading things. As she counts the echoes left behind by Mya Hall  Leelah Alcorn  Blake Brockington. She fears that I'll die without a whisper  that I'll turn into  what a shame  conversations at the bus stop. She claims I have turned myself into a mausoleum  that I am a walking casket  news headlines have turned my identity into a spectacle  Bruce Jenner on everyone's lips while the brutality of living in this body becomes an asterisk  at the bottom of equality pages. No one ever thinks of us as human because we are more ghost than flesh  because people fear that my gender expression is a trick  that it exists to be perverse  that it ensnares them without their consent  that my body is a feast for their eyes and hands and once they have fed off my queer  they'll regurgitate all the parts they did not like. They'll put me back into the closet  hang me with all the other skeletons. I will be the best attraction. Can you see how easy it is to talk people into coffins  to misspell their names on gravestones. And people still wonder why there are boys rotting  they go away in high school hallways they are afraid of becoming another hashtag in a second afraid of classroom discussions becoming like judgment day and now oncoming traffic is embracing more transgender children than parents. I wonder how long it will be before the trans suicide notes start to feel redundant  before we realize that our bodies become lessons about sin way before we learn how to love them. Like God didn't save all this breath and mercy  like my blood is not the wine that washed over Jesus' feet. My prayers are now getting stuck in my throat. Maybe I am finally fixed  maybe I just don't care  maybe God finally listened to my prayers. Thank you. Our emotions influence every aspect of our lives  from our health and how we learn  to how we do business and make decisions  big ones and small. Our emotions also influence how we connect with one another. We've evolved to live in a world like this  but instead  we're living more and more of our lives like this    this is the text message from my daughter last night    in a world that's devoid of emotion. So I'm on a mission to change that. I want to bring emotions back into our digital experiences. I started on this path    years ago. I was a computer scientist in Egypt  and I had just gotten accepted to a Ph.D. program at Cambridge University. So I did something quite unusual for a young newlywed Muslim Egyptian wife  With the support of my husband  who had to stay in Egypt  I packed my bags and I moved to England. At Cambridge  thousands of miles away from home  I realized I was spending more hours with my laptop than I did with any other human. Yet despite this intimacy  my laptop had absolutely no idea how I was feeling. It had no idea if I was happy  having a bad day  or stressed  confused  and so that got frustrating. Even worse  as I communicated online with my family back home  I felt that all my emotions disappeared in cyberspace. I was homesick  I was lonely  and on some days I was actually crying  but all I had to communicate these emotions was this. Today's technology has lots of I.Q.  but no E.Q.  lots of cognitive intelligence  but no emotional intelligence. So that got me thinking  what if our technology could sense our emotions  What if our devices could sense how we felt and reacted accordingly  just the way an emotionally intelligent friend would  Those questions led me and my team to create technologies that can read and respond to our emotions  and our starting point was the human face. So our human face happens to be one of the most powerful channels that we all use to communicate social and emotional states  everything from enjoyment  surprise  empathy and curiosity. In emotion science  we call each facial muscle movement an action unit. So for example  action unit     it's not a Hollywood blockbuster  it is actually a lip corner pull  which is the main component of a smile. Try it everybody. Let's get some smiles going on. Another example is action unit  . It's the brow furrow. It's when you draw your eyebrows together and you create all these textures and wrinkles. We don't like them  but it's a strong indicator of a negative emotion. So we have about    of these action units  and they combine to express hundreds of emotions. Teaching a computer to read these facial emotions is hard  because these action units  they can be fast  they're subtle  and they combine in many different ways. So take  for example  the smile and the smirk. They look somewhat similar  but they mean very different things. So the smile is positive  a smirk is often negative. Sometimes a smirk can make you become famous. But seriously  it's important for a computer to be able to tell the difference between the two expressions. So how do we do that  We give our algorithms tens of thousands of examples of people we know to be smiling  from different ethnicities  ages  genders  and we do the same for smirks. And then  using deep learning  the algorithm looks for all these textures and wrinkles and shape changes on our face  and basically learns that all smiles have common characteristics  all smirks have subtly different characteristics. And the next time it sees a new face  it essentially learns that this face has the same characteristics of a smile  and it says   Aha  I recognize this. This is a smile expression.  So the best way to demonstrate how this technology works is to try a live demo  so I need a volunteer  preferably somebody with a face. Cloe's going to be our volunteer today. So over the past five years  we've moved from being a research project at MIT to a company  where my team has worked really hard to make this technology work  as we like to say  in the wild. And we've also shrunk it so that the core emotion engine works on any mobile device with a camera  like this iPad. So let's give this a try. As you can see  the algorithm has essentially found Cloe's face  so it's this white bounding box  and it's tracking the main feature points on her face  so her eyebrows  her eyes  her mouth and her nose. The question is  can it recognize her expression  So we're going to test the machine. So first of all  give me your poker face. Yep  awesome.  Laughter  And then as she smiles  this is a genuine smile  it's great. So you can see the green bar go up as she smiles. Now that was a big smile. Can you try a subtle smile to see if the computer can recognize  It does recognize subtle smiles as well. We've worked really hard to make that happen. And then eyebrow raised  indicator of surprise. Brow furrow  which is an indicator of confusion. Frown. Yes  perfect. So these are all the different action units. There's many more of them. This is just a slimmed down demo. But we call each reading an emotion data point  and then they can fire together to portray different emotions. So on the right side of the demo    look like you're happy. So that's joy. Joy fires up. And then give me a disgust face. Try to remember what it was like when Zayn left One Direction. Yeah  wrinkle your nose. Awesome. And the valence is actually quite negative  so you must have been a big fan. So valence is how positive or negative an experience is  and engagement is how expressive she is as well. So imagine if Cloe had access to this real time emotion stream  and she could share it with anybody she wanted to. Thank you. So  so far  we have amassed    billion of these emotion data points. It's the largest emotion database in the world. We've collected it from  .  million face videos  people who have agreed to share their emotions with us  and from    countries around the world. It's growing every day. It blows my mind away that we can now quantify something as personal as our emotions  and we can do it at this scale. So what have we learned to date  Gender. Our data confirms something that you might suspect. Women are more expressive than men. Not only do they smile more  their smiles last longer  and we can now really quantify what it is that men and women respond to differently. Let's do culture  So in the United States  women are    percent more expressive than men  but curiously  we don't see any difference in the U.K. between men and women. Age  People who are    years and older are    percent more emotive than younger people. Women in their   s smile a lot more than men the same age  perhaps a necessity for dating. But perhaps what surprised us the most about this data is that we happen to be expressive all the time  even when we are sitting in front of our devices alone  and it's not just when we're watching cat videos on Facebook. We are expressive when we're emailing  texting  shopping online  or even doing our taxes. Where is this data used today  In understanding how we engage with media  so understanding virality and voting behavior  and also empowering or emotion enabling technology  and I want to share some examples that are especially close to my heart. Emotion enabled wearable glasses can help individuals who are visually impaired read the faces of others  and it can help individuals on the autism spectrum interpret emotion  something that they really struggle with. In education  imagine if your learning apps sense that you're confused and slow down  or that you're bored  so it's sped up  just like a great teacher would in a classroom. What if your wristwatch tracked your mood  or your car sensed that you're tired  or perhaps your fridge knows that you're stressed  so it auto locks to prevent you from binge eating.  Laughter  I would like that  yeah. What if  when I was in Cambridge  I had access to my real time emotion stream  and I could share that with my family back home in a very natural way  just like I would've if we were all in the same room together  I think five years down the line  all our devices are going to have an emotion chip  and we won't remember what it was like when we couldn't just frown at our device and our device would say   Hmm  you didn't like that  did you   Our biggest challenge is that there are so many applications of this technology  my team and I realize that we can't build them all ourselves  so we've made this technology available so that other developers can get building and get creative. We recognize that there are potential risks and potential for abuse  but personally  having spent many years doing this  I believe that the benefits to humanity from having emotionally intelligent technology far outweigh the potential for misuse. And I invite you all to be part of the conversation. The more people who know about this technology  the more we can all have a voice in how it's being used. So as more and more of our lives become digital  we are fighting a losing battle trying to curb our usage of devices in order to reclaim our emotions. So what I'm trying to do instead is to bring emotions into our technology and make our technologies more responsive. So I want those devices that have separated us to bring us back together. And by humanizing technology  we have this golden opportunity to reimagine how we connect with machines  and therefore  how we  as human beings  connect with one another. Thank you. An evolutionary biologist at Purdue University named William Muir studied chickens. He was interested in productivity    I think it's something that concerns all of us    but it's easy to measure in chickens because you just count the eggs. He wanted to know what could make his chickens more productive  so he devised a beautiful experiment. Chickens live in groups  so first of all  he selected just an average flock  and he let it alone for six generations. But then he created a second group of the individually most productive chickens    you could call them superchickens    and he put them together in a superflock  and each generation  he selected only the most productive for breeding. After six generations had passed  what did he find  Well  the first group  the average group  was doing just fine. They were all plump and fully feathered and egg production had increased dramatically. What about the second group  Well  all but three were dead. They'd pecked the rest to death. The individually productive chickens had only achieved their success by suppressing the productivity of the rest. Now  as I've gone around the world talking about this and telling this story in all sorts of organizations and companies  people have seen the relevance almost instantly  and they come up and they say things to me like   That superflock  that's my company.  Or   That's my country.  Or   That's my life.  All my life I've been told that the way we have to get ahead is to compete  get into the right school  get into the right job  get to the top  and I've really never found it very inspiring. I've started and run businesses because invention is a joy  and because working alongside brilliant  creative people is its own reward. And I've never really felt very motivated by pecking orders or by superchickens or by superstars. But for the past    years  we've run most organizations and some societies along the superchicken model. We've thought that success is achieved by picking the superstars  the brightest men  or occasionally women  in the room  and giving them all the resources and all the power. And the result has been just the same as in William Muir's experiment  aggression  dysfunction and waste. If the only way the most productive can be successful is by suppressing the productivity of the rest  then we badly need to find a better way to work and a richer way to live. So what is it that makes some groups obviously more successful and more productive than others  Well  that's the question a team at MIT took to research. They brought in hundreds of volunteers  they put them into groups  and they gave them very hard problems to solve. And what happened was exactly what you'd expect  that some groups were very much more successful than others  but what was really interesting was that the high achieving groups were not those where they had one or two people with spectacularly high I.Q. Nor were the most successful groups the ones that had the highest aggregate I.Q. Instead  they had three characteristics  the really successful teams. First of all  they showed high degrees of social sensitivity to each other. This is measured by something called the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test. It's broadly considered a test for empathy  and the groups that scored highly on this did better. Secondly  the successful groups gave roughly equal time to each other  so that no one voice dominated  but neither were there any passengers. And thirdly  the more successful groups had more women in them. Now  was this because women typically score more highly on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test  so you're getting a doubling down on the empathy quotient  Or was it because they brought a more diverse perspective  We don't really know  but the striking thing about this experiment is that it showed what we know  which is some groups do better than others  but what's key to that is their social connectedness to each other. So how does this play out in the real world  Well  it means that what happens between people really counts  because in groups that are highly attuned and sensitive to each other  ideas can flow and grow. People don't get stuck. They don't waste energy down dead ends. An example  Arup is one of the world's most successful engineering firms  and it was commissioned to build the equestrian center for the Beijing Olympics. Now  this building had to receive two and a half thousand really highly strung thoroughbred horses that were coming off long haul flights  highly jet lagged  not feeling their finest. And the problem the engineer confronted was  what quantity of waste to cater for  Now  you don't get taught this in engineering school     Laughter     and it's not really the kind of thing you want to get wrong  so he could have spent months talking to vets  doing the research  tweaking the spreadsheet. Instead  he asked for help and he found someone who had designed the Jockey Club in New York. The problem was solved in less than a day. Arup believes that the culture of helpfulness is central to their success. Now  helpfulness sounds really anemic  but it's absolutely core to successful teams  and it routinely outperforms individual intelligence. Helpfulness means I don't have to know everything  I just have to work among people who are good at getting and giving help. At SAP  they reckon that you can answer any question in    minutes. But there isn't a single high tech company I've worked with that imagines for a moment that this is a technology issue  because what drives helpfulness is people getting to know each other. Now that sounds so obvious  and we think it'll just happen normally  but it doesn't. When I was running my first software company  I realized that we were getting stuck. There was a lot of friction  but not much else  and I gradually realized the brilliant  creative people that I'd hired didn't know each other. They were so focused on their own individual work  they didn't even know who they were sitting next to  and it was only when I insisted that we stop working and invest time in getting to know each other that we achieved real momentum. Now  that was    years ago  and now I visit companies that have banned coffee cups at desks because they want people to hang out around the coffee machines and talk to each other. The Swedes even have a special term for this. They call it fika  which means more than a coffee break. It means collective restoration. At Idexx  a company up in Maine  they've created vegetable gardens on campus so that people from different parts of the business can work together and get to know the whole business that way. Have they all gone mad  Quite the opposite    they've figured out that when the going gets tough  and it always will get tough if you're doing breakthrough work that really matters  what people need is social support  and they need to know who to ask for help. Companies don't have ideas  only people do. And what motivates people are the bonds and loyalty and trust they develop between each other. What matters is the mortar  not just the bricks. Now  when you put all of this together  what you get is something called social capital. Social capital is the reliance and interdependency that builds trust. The term comes from sociologists who were studying communities that proved particularly resilient in times of stress. Social capital is what gives companies momentum  and social capital is what makes companies robust. What does this mean in practical terms  It means that time is everything  because social capital compounds with time. So teams that work together longer get better  because it takes time to develop the trust you need for real candor and openness. And time is what builds value. When Alex Pentland suggested to one company that they synchronize coffee breaks so that people would have time to talk to each other  profits went up    million dollars  and employee satisfaction went up    percent. Not a bad return on social capital  which compounds even as you spend it. Now  this isn't about chumminess  and it's no charter for slackers  because people who work this way tend to be kind of scratchy  impatient  absolutely determined to think for themselves because that's what their contribution is. Conflict is frequent because candor is safe. And that's how good ideas turn into great ideas  because no idea is born fully formed. It emerges a little bit as a child is born  kind of messy and confused  but full of possibilities. And it's only through the generous contribution  faith and challenge that they achieve their potential. And that's what social capital supports. Now  we aren't really used to talking about this  about talent  about creativity  in this way. We're used to talking about stars. So I started to wonder  well  if we start working this way  does that mean no more stars  So I went and I sat in on the auditions at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. And what I saw there really surprised me  because the teachers weren't looking for individual pyrotechnics. They were looking for what happened between the students  because that's where the drama is. And when I talked to producers of hit albums  they said   Oh sure  we have lots of superstars in music. It's just  they don't last very long. It's the outstanding collaborators who enjoy the long careers  because bringing out the best in others is how they found the best in themselves.  And when I went to visit companies that are renowned for their ingenuity and creativity  I couldn't even see any superstars  because everybody there really mattered. And when I reflected on my own career  and the extraordinary people I've had the privilege to work with  I realized how much more we could give each other if we just stopped trying to be superchickens. Once you appreciate truly how social work is  a lot of things have to change. Management by talent contest has routinely pitted employees against each other. Now  rivalry has to be replaced by social capital. For decades  we've tried to motivate people with money  even though we've got a vast amount of research that shows that money erodes social connectedness. Now  we need to let people motivate each other. And for years  we've thought that leaders were heroic soloists who were expected  all by themselves  to solve complex problems. Now  we need to redefine leadership as an activity in which conditions are created in which everyone can do their most courageous thinking together. We know that this works. When the Montreal Protocol called for the phasing out of CFCs  the chlorofluorocarbons implicated in the hole in the ozone layer  the risks were immense. CFCs were everywhere  and nobody knew if a substitute could be found. But one team that rose to the challenge adopted three key principles. The first was the head of engineering  Frank Maslen  said  there will be no stars in this team. We need everybody. Everybody has a valid perspective. Second  we work to one standard only  the best imaginable. And third  he told his boss  Geoff Tudhope  that he had to butt out  because he knew how disruptive power can be. Now  this didn't mean Tudhope did nothing. He gave the team air cover  and he listened to ensure that they honored their principles. And it worked  Ahead of all the other companies tackling this hard problem  this group cracked it first. And to date  the Montreal Protocol is the most successful international environmental agreement ever implemented. There was a lot at stake then  and there's a lot at stake now  and we won't solve our problems if we expect it to be solved by a few supermen or superwomen. Now we need everybody  because it is only when we accept that everybody has value that we will liberate the energy and imagination and momentum we need to create the best beyond measure. Thank you. Just after Christmas last year      kids in California got the measles by either visiting Disneyland or being exposed to someone who'd been there. The virus then hopped the Canadian border  infecting more than     children in Quebec. One of the tragic things about this outbreak is that measles  which can be fatal to a child with a weakened immune system  is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world. An effective vaccine against it has been available for more than half a century  but many of the kids involved in the Disneyland outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly even worse  autism. But wait    wasn't the paper that sparked the controversy about autism and vaccines debunked  retracted  and branded a deliberate fraud by the British Medical Journal  Don't most science savvy people know that the theory that vaccines cause autism is B.S.  I think most of you do  but millions of parents worldwide continue to fear that vaccines put their kids at risk for autism. Why  Here's why. This is a graph of autism prevalence estimates rising over time. For most of the   th century  autism was considered an incredibly rare condition. The few psychologists and pediatricians who'd even heard of it figured they would get through their entire careers without seeing a single case. For decades  the prevalence estimates remained stable at just three or four children in       . But then  in the     s  the numbers started to skyrocket. Fundraising organizations like Autism Speaks routinely refer to autism as an epidemic  as if you could catch it from another kid at Disneyland. So what's going on  If it isn't vaccines  what is it  If you ask the folks down at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta what's going on  they tend to rely on phrases like  broadened diagnostic criteria  and  better case finding  to explain these rising numbers. But that kind of language doesn't do much to allay the fears of a young mother who is searching her two year old's face for eye contact. If the diagnostic criteria had to be broadened  why were they so narrow in the first place  Why were cases of autism so hard to find before the     s  Five years ago  I decided to try to uncover the answers to these questions. I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow and cautious progress of science than it does with the seductive power of storytelling. For most of the   th century  clinicians told one story about what autism is and how it was discovered  but that story turned out to be wrong  and the consequences of it are having a devastating impact on global public health. There was a second  more accurate story of autism which had been lost and forgotten in obscure corners of the clinical literature. This second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we need to go next. The first story starts with a child psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital named Leo Kanner. In       Kanner published a paper describing    young patients who seemed to inhabit private worlds  ignoring the people around them  even their own parents. They could amuse themselves for hours by flapping their hands in front of their faces  but they were panicked by little things like their favorite toy being moved from its usual place without their knowledge. Based on the patients who were brought to his clinic  Kanner speculated that autism is very rare. By the     s  as the world's leading authority on the subject  he declared that he had seen less than     true cases of his syndrome while fielding referrals from as far away as South Africa. That's actually not surprising  because Kanner's criteria for diagnosing autism were incredibly selective. For example  he discouraged giving the diagnosis to children who had seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism. He once bragged that he had turned nine out of    kids referred to his office as autistic by other clinicians without giving them an autism diagnosis. Kanner was a smart guy  but a number of his theories didn't pan out. He classified autism as a form of infantile psychosis caused by cold and unaffectionate parents. These children  he said  had been kept neatly in a refrigerator that didn't defrost. At the same time  however  Kanner noticed that some of his young patients had special abilities that clustered in certain areas like music  math and memory. One boy in his clinic could distinguish between    symphonies before he turned two. When his mother put on one of his favorite records  he would correctly declare   Beethoven   But Kanner took a dim view of these abilities  claiming that the kids were just regurgitating things they'd heard their pompous parents say  desperate to earn their approval. As a result  autism became a source of shame and stigma for families  and two generations of autistic children were shipped off to institutions for their own good  becoming invisible to the world at large. Amazingly  it wasn't until the     s that researchers began to test Kanner's theory that autism was rare. Lorna Wing was a cognitive psychologist in London who thought that Kanner's theory of refrigerator parenting were  bloody stupid   as she told me. She and her husband John were warm and affectionate people  and they had a profoundly autistic daughter named Susie. Lorna and John knew how hard it was to raise a child like Susie without support services  special education  and the other resources that are out of reach without a diagnosis. To make the case to the National Health Service that more resources were needed for autistic children and their families  Lorna and her colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have been done    years earlier. They undertook a study of autism prevalence in the general population. They pounded the pavement in a London suburb called Camberwell to try to find autistic children in the community. What they saw made clear that Kanner's model was way too narrow  while the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse. Some kids couldn't talk at all  while others waxed on at length about their fascination with astrophysics  dinosaurs or the genealogy of royalty. In other words  these children didn't fit into nice  neat boxes  as Judith put it  and they saw lots of them  way more than Kanner's monolithic model would have predicted. At first  they were at a loss to make sense of their data. How had no one noticed these children before  But then Lorna came upon a reference to a paper that had been published in German in       the year after Kanner's paper  and then forgotten  buried with the ashes of a terrible time that no one wanted to remember or think about. Kanner knew about this competing paper  but scrupulously avoided mentioning it in his own work. It had never even been translated into English  but luckily  Lorna's husband spoke German  and he translated it for her. The paper offered an alternate story of autism. Its author was a man named Hans Asperger  who ran a combination clinic and residential school in Vienna in the     s. Asperger's ideas about teaching children with learning differences were progressive even by contemporary standards. Mornings at his clinic began with exercise classes set to music  and the children put on plays on Sunday afternoons. Instead of blaming parents for causing autism  Asperger framed it as a lifelong  polygenetic disability that requires compassionate forms of support and accommodations over the course of one's whole life. Rather than treating the kids in his clinic like patients  Asperger called them his little professors  and enlisted their help in developing methods of education that were particularly suited to them. Crucially  Asperger viewed autism as a diverse continuum that spans an astonishing range of giftedness and disability. He believed that autism and autistic traits are common and always have been  seeing aspects of this continuum in familiar archetypes from pop culture like the socially awkward scientist and the absent minded professor. He went so far as to say  it seems that for success in science and art  a dash of autism is essential. Lorna and Judith realized that Kanner had been as wrong about autism being rare as he had been about parents causing it. Over the next several years  they quietly worked with the American Psychiatric Association to broaden the criteria for diagnosis to reflect the diversity of what they called  the autism spectrum.  In the late '  s and early     s  their changes went into effect  swapping out Kanner's narrow model for Asperger's broad and inclusive one. These changes weren't happening in a vacuum. By coincidence  as Lorna and Judith worked behind the scenes to reform the criteria  people all over the world were seeing an autistic adult for the first time. Before  Rain Man  came out in       only a tiny  ingrown circle of experts knew what autism looked like  but after Dustin Hoffman's unforgettable performance as Raymond Babbitt earned  Rain Man  four Academy Awards  pediatricians  psychologists  teachers and parents all over the world knew what autism looked like. Coincidentally  at the same time  the first easy to use clinical tests for diagnosing autism were introduced. You no longer had to have a connection to that tiny circle of experts to get your child evaluated. The combination of  Rain Man   the changes to the criteria  and the introduction of these tests created a network effect  a perfect storm of autism awareness. The number of diagnoses started to soar  just as Lorna and Judith predicted  indeed hoped  that it would  enabling autistic people and their families to finally get the support and services they deserved. Then Andrew Wakefield came along to blame the spike in diagnoses on vaccines  a simple  powerful  and seductively believable story that was as wrong as Kanner's theory that autism was rare. If the CDC's current estimate  that one in    kids in America are on the spectrum  is correct  autistics are one of the largest minority groups in the world. In recent years  autistic people have come together on the Internet to reject the notion that they are puzzles to be solved by the next medical breakthrough  coining the term  neurodiversity  to celebrate the varieties of human cognition. One way to understand neurodiversity is to think in terms of human operating systems. Just because a P.C. is not running Windows doesn't mean that it's broken. By autistic standards  the normal human brain is easily distractable  obsessively social  and suffers from a deficit of attention to detail. To be sure  autistic people have a hard time living in a world not built for them.  Seventy  years later  we're still catching up to Asperger  who believed that the  cure  for the most disabling aspects of autism is to be found in understanding teachers  accommodating employers  supportive communities  and parents who have faith in their children's potential. An autistic  man  named Zosia Zaks once said   We need all hands on deck to right the ship of humanity.  As we sail into an uncertain future  we need every form of human intelligence on the planet working together to tackle the challenges that we face as a society. We can't afford to waste a brain. Thank you. Along the ancient path of the Monongahela River  Braddock  Pennsylvania sits in the eastern region of Allegheny County  approximately nine miles outside of Pittsburgh. An industrial suburb  Braddock is home to Andrew Carnegie's first steel mill  the Edgar Thomson Works. Operating since       it is the last functioning steel mill in the region. For    years  I have produced collaborative portraits  still lifes  landscapes and aerial views in order to build a visual archive to address the intersection of the steel industry  the environment  and the health care system's impact on the bodies of my family and community. The tradition and grand narrative of Braddock is mostly comprised of stories of industrialists and trade unions. Currently  the new narrative about Braddock  a poster child for Rust Belt revitalization  is a story of urban pioneers discovering a new frontier. Mass media has omitted the fact that Braddock is predominantly black. Our existence has been co opted  silenced and erased. Fourth generation in a lineage of women  I was raised under the protection and care of Grandma Ruby  off  th Street at     Washington Avenue. She worked as a manager for Goodwill. Mom was a nurse's aid. She watched the steel mills close and white flight to suburban developments. By the time my generation walked the streets  disinvestment at the local  state and federal level  eroded infrastructure  and the War on Drugs dismantled my family and community. Grandma Ruby's stepfather Gramps was one of few black men to retire from Carnegie's mill with his pension. He worked in high temperatures  tearing down and rebuilding furnaces  cleaning up spilt metal and slag. The history of a place is written on the body and the landscape. Areas of heavy truck traffic  exposure to benzene and atomized metals  risk cancer and lupus. One hundred twenty three licensed beds      employees  rehabilitation programs decimated. A housing discrimination lawsuit against Allegheny County removed where the projects Talbot Towers once stood. Recent rezoning for more light industry has since appeared. Google Maps and Google Earth pixelations conceal the flammable waste being used to squeeze the Bunn family off their home and land. In       I chartered a helicopter with my cameras to document this aggressive dispossession. In flight  my observation reveals thousands of plastic white bundles owned by a conservation industry that claims it's eco friendly and recycles millions of tires to preserve people's lives and to improve people's lives. My work spirals from the micro to the macro level  excavating hidden histories. Recently  at the Seattle Art Museum  Isaac Bunn and I mounted this exhibition  and the exhibition was used as a platform to launch his voice. Through reclamation of our narrative  we will continue to fight historic erasure and socioeconomic inequality. Thank you. I am failing as a woman  I am failing as a feminist. I have passionate opinions about gender equality  but I worry that to freely accept the label of  feminist   would not be fair to good feminists. I'm a feminist  but I'm a rather bad one. Oh  so I call myself a Bad Feminist. Or at least  I wrote an essay  and then I wrote a book called  Bad Feminist   and then in interviews  people started calling me The Bad Feminist. So  what started as a bit of an inside joke with myself and a willful provocation  has become a thing. Let me take a step back. When I was younger  mostly in my teens and   s  I had strange ideas about feminists as hairy  angry  man hating  sex hating women    as if those are bad things. These days  I look at how women are treated the world over  and anger  in particular  seems like a perfectly reasonable response. But back then  I worried about the tone people used when suggesting I might be a feminist. The feminist label was an accusation  it was an  F  word  and not a nice one. I was labeled a woman who doesn't play by the rules  who expects too much  who thinks far too highly of myself  by daring to believe I'm equal     Coughs     superior to a man. You don't want to be that rebel woman  until you realize that you very much are that woman  and cannot imagine being anyone else. As I got older  I began to accept that I am  indeed  a feminist  and a proud one. I hold certain truths to be self evident  Women are equal to men. We deserve equal pay for equal work. We have the right to move through the world as we choose  free from harassment or violence. We have the right to easy  affordable access to birth control  and reproductive services. We have the right to make choices about our bodies  free from legislative oversight or evangelical doctrine. We have the right to respect. There's more. When we talk about the needs of women  we have to consider the other identities we inhabit. We are not just women. We are people with different bodies  gender expressions  faiths  sexualities  class backgrounds  abilities  and so much more. We need to take into account these differences and how they affect us  as much as we account for what we have in common. Without this kind of inclusion  our feminism is nothing. I hold these truths to be self evident  but let me be clear  I'm a mess. I am full of contradictions. There are many ways in which I'm doing feminism wrong. I have another confession. When I drive to work  I listen to thuggish rap at a very loud volume. Even though the lyrics are degrading to women    these lyrics offend me to my core    the classic Yin Yang Twins song  Salt Shaker     it is amazing.  Make it work with your wet t shirt. Bitch  you gotta shake it 'til your camel starts to hurt   Think about it. Poetry  right  I am utterly mortified by my music choices. I firmly believe in man work  which is anything I don't want to do  including    all domestic tasks  but also  bug killing  trash removal  lawn care and vehicle maintenance. I want no part of any of that. Pink is my favorite color. I enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things. I watch  The Bachelor  and romantic comedies  and I have absurd fantasies about fairy tales coming true. Some of my transgressions are more flagrant. If a woman wants to take her husband's name  that is her choice  and it is not my place to judge. If a woman chooses to stay home to raise her children  I embrace that choice  too. The problem is not that she makes herself economically vulnerable in that choice  the problem is that our society is set up to make women economically vulnerable when they choose. Let's deal with that. I reject the mainstream feminism that has historically ignored or deflected the needs of women of color  working class women  queer women and transgender women  in favor of supporting white  middle  and upper class straight women. Listen  if that's good feminism    I am a very bad feminist. There is also this  As a feminist  I feel a lot of pressure. We have this tendency to put visible feminists on a pedestal. We expect them to pose perfectly. When they disappoint us  we gleefully knock them from the very pedestal we put them on. Like I said  I am a mess    consider me knocked off that pedestal before you ever try to put me up there. Too many women  particularly groundbreaking women and industry leaders  are afraid to be labeled as feminists. They're afraid to stand up and say   Yes  I am a feminist   for fear of what that label means  for fear of being unable to live up to unrealistic expectations. Take  for example  Beyonc   or as I call her  The Goddess. She has emerged  in recent years  as a visible feminist. At the      MTV Video Music Awards  she performed in front of the word  feminist     feet high. It was a glorious spectacle to see this pop star openly embracing feminism and letting young women and men know that being a feminist is something to celebrate. As the moment faded  cultural critics began endlessly debating whether or not Beyonc  was  indeed  a feminist. They graded her feminism  instead of simply taking a grown  accomplished woman at her word. We demand perfection from feminists  because we are still fighting for so much  we want so much  we need so damn much. We go far beyond reasonable  constructive criticism  to dissecting any given woman's feminism  tearing it apart until there's nothing left. We do not need to do that. Bad feminism    or really  more inclusive feminism    is a starting point. But what happens next  We go from acknowledging our imperfections to accountability  or walking the walk  and being a little bit brave. If I listen to degrading music  I am creating a demand for which artists are more than happy to contribute a limitless supply. These artists are not going to change how they talk about women in their songs until we demand that change by affecting their bottom line. Certainly  it is difficult. Why must it be so catchy  It's hard to make the better choice  and it is so easy to justify a lesser one. But    when I justify bad choices  I make it harder for women to achieve equality  the equality that we all deserve  and I need to own that. I think of my nieces  ages three and four. They are gorgeous and headstrong  brilliant girls  who are a whole lot of brave. I want them to thrive in a world where they are valued for the powerful creatures they are. I think of them  and suddenly  the better choice becomes far easier to make. We can all make better choices. We can change the channel when a television show treats sexual violence against women like sport  Game of Thrones. We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women as nothing. We can spend our box office dollars elsewhere when movies don't treat women as anything more than decorative objects. We can stop supporting professional sports where the athletes treat  their partners like punching bags. In other ways  men    and especially straight white men    can say   No  I will not publish with your magazine  or participate in your project  or otherwise work with you  until you include a fair number of women  both as participants and decision makers. I won't work with you until your publication  or your organization  is more inclusive of all kinds of difference.  Those of us who are underrepresented and invited to participate in such projects  can also decline to be included until more of us are invited through the glass ceiling  and we are tokens no more. Without these efforts  without taking these stands  our accomplishments are going to mean very little. We can commit these small acts of bravery and hope that our choices trickle upward to the people in power    editors  movie and music producers  CEOs  lawmakers    the people who can make bigger  braver choices to create lasting  meaningful change. We can also boldly claim our feminism    good  bad  or anywhere in between. The last line of my book  Bad Feminist  says   I would rather be a bad feminist than no feminist at all.  This is true for so many reasons  but first and foremost  I say this because once upon a time  my voice was stolen from me  and feminism helped me to get my voice back. There was an incident. I call it an incident so I can carry the burden of what happened. Some boys broke me  when I was so young  I did not know what boys can do to break a girl. They treated me like I was nothing. I began to believe I was nothing. They stole my voice  and in the after  I did not dare to believe that anything I might say could matter. But    I had writing. And there  I wrote myself back together. I wrote myself toward a stronger version of myself. I read the words of women who might understand a story like mine  and women who looked like me  and understood what it was like to move through the world with brown skin. I read the words of women who showed me I was not nothing. I learned to write like them  and then I learned to write as myself. I found my voice again  and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond measure. Through writing and feminism  I also found that if I was a little bit brave  another woman might hear me and see me and recognize that none of us are the nothing the world tries to tell us we are. In one hand  I hold the power to accomplish anything. And in my other  I hold the humbling reality that I am just one woman. I am a bad feminist  I am a good woman  I am trying to become better in how I think  and what I say  and what I do  without abandoning everything that makes me human. I hope that we can all do the same. I hope that we can all be a little bit brave  when we most need such bravery. Blah blah blah blah blah. Blah blah blah blah  blah blah  blah blah blah blah blah blah. Blah blah blah  blah. So what the hell was that  Well  you don't know because you couldn't understand it. It wasn't clear. But hopefully  it was said with enough conviction that it was at least alluringly mysterious. Clarity or mystery  I'm balancing these two things in my daily work as a graphic designer  as well as my daily life as a New Yorker every day  and there are two elements that absolutely fascinate me. Here's an example. Now  how many people know what this is  Okay. Now how many people know what this is  Okay. Thanks to two more deft strokes by the genius Charles M. Schulz  we now have seven deft strokes that in and of themselves create an entire emotional life  one that has enthralled hundreds of millions of fans for over    years. This is actually a cover of a book that I designed about the work of Schulz and his art  which will be coming out this fall  and that is the entire cover. There is no other typographic information or visual information on the front  and the name of the book is  Only What's Necessary.  So this is sort of symbolic about the decisions I have to make every day about the design that I'm perceiving  and the design I'm creating. So clarity. Clarity gets to the point. It's blunt. It's honest. It's sincere. We ask ourselves this.   When should you be clear    Now  something like this  whether we can read it or not  needs to be really  really clear. Is it  This is a rather recent example of urban clarity that I just love  mainly because I'm always late and I am always in a hurry. So when these meters started showing up a couple of years ago on street corners  I was thrilled  because now I finally knew how many seconds I had to get across the street before I got run over by a car. Six  I can do that.  Laughter  So let's look at the yin to the clarity yang  and that is mystery. Mystery is a lot more complicated by its very definition. Mystery demands to be decoded  and when it's done right  we really  really want to.   When should you be mysterious    In World War II  the Germans really  really wanted to decode this  and they couldn't. Here's an example of a design that I've done recently for a novel by Haruki Murakami  who I've done design work for for over    years now  and this is a novel about a young man who has four dear friends who all of a sudden  after their freshman year of college  completely cut him off with no explanation  and he is devastated. And the friends' names each have a connotation in Japanese to a color. So there's Mr. Red  there's Mr. Blue  there's Ms. White  and Ms. Black. Tsukuru Tazaki  his name does not correspond to a color  so his nickname is Colorless  and as he's looking back on their friendship  he recalls that they were like five fingers on a hand. So I created this sort of abstract representation of this  but there's a lot more going on underneath the surface of the story  and there's more going on underneath the surface of the jacket. The four fingers are now four train lines in the Tokyo subway system  which has significance within the story. And then you have the colorless subway line intersecting with each of the other colors  which basically he does later on in the story. He catches up with each of these people to find out why they treated him the way they did. And so this is the three dimensional finished product sitting on my desk in my office  and what I was hoping for here is that you'll simply be allured by the mystery of what this looks like  and will want to read it to decode and find out and make more clear why it looks the way it does.   The Visual Vernacular.   This is a way to use a more familiar kind of mystery. What does this mean  This is what it means.   Make it look like something else.   The visual vernacular is the way we are used to seeing a certain thing applied to something else so that we see it in a different way. This is an approach I wanted to take to a book of essays by David Sedaris that had this title at the time.   All the Beauty You Will Ever Need   Now  the challenge here was that this title actually means nothing. It's not connected to any of the essays in the book. It came to the author's boyfriend in a dream. Thank you very much  so     Laughter     so usually  I am creating a design that is in some way based on the text  but this is all the text there is. So you've got this mysterious title that really doesn't mean anything  so I was trying to think  Where might I see a bit of mysterious text that seems to mean something but doesn't  And sure enough  not long after  one evening after a Chinese meal  this arrived  and I thought   Ah  bing  ideagasm    Laughter  I've always loved the hilariously mysterious tropes of fortune cookies that seem to mean something extremely deep but when you think about them    if you think about them    they really don't. This says   Hardly anyone knows how much is gained by ignoring the future.  Thank you.  Laughter  But we can take this visual vernacular and apply it to Mr. Sedaris  and we are so familiar with how fortune cookie fortunes look that we don't even need the bits of the cookie anymore. We're just seeing this strange thing and we know we love David Sedaris  and so we're hoping that we're in for a good time.   'Fraud' Essays by David Rakoff   David Rakoff was a wonderful writer and he called his first book  Fraud  because he was getting sent on assignments by magazines to do things that he was not equipped to do. So he was this skinny little urban guy and GQ magazine would send him down the Colorado River whitewater rafting to see if he would survive. And then he would write about it  and he felt that he was a fraud and that he was misrepresenting himself. And so I wanted the cover of this book to also misrepresent itself and then somehow show a reader reacting to it. This led me to graffiti. I'm fascinated by graffiti. I think anybody who lives in an urban environment encounters graffiti all the time  and there's all different sorts of it. This is a picture I took on the Lower East Side of just a transformer box on the sidewalk and it's been tagged like crazy. Now whether you look at this and think   Oh  that's a charming urban affectation   or you look at it and say   That's illegal abuse of property   the one thing I think we can all agree on is that you cannot read it. Right  There is no clear message here. There is another kind of graffiti that I find far more interesting  which I call editorial graffiti. This is a picture I took recently in the subway  and sometimes you see lots of prurient  stupid stuff  but I thought this was interesting  and this is a poster that is saying rah rah Airbnb  and someone has taken a Magic Marker and has editorialized about what they think about it. And it got my attention. So I was thinking  how do we apply this to this book  So I get the book by this person  and I start reading it  and I'm thinking  this guy is not who he says  he is  he's a fraud. And I get out a red Magic Marker  and out of frustration just scribble this across the front. Design done.  Laughter  And they went for it   Laughter  Author liked it  publisher liked it  and that is how the book went out into the world  and it was really fun to see people reading this on the subway and walking around with it and what have you  and they all sort of looked like they were crazy.   'Perfidia' a novel by James Ellroy   Okay  James Ellroy  amazing crime writer  a good friend  I've worked with him for many years. He is probably best known as the author of  The Black Dahlia  and  L.A. Confidential.  His most recent novel was called this  which is a very mysterious name that I'm sure a lot of people know what it means  but a lot of people don't. And it's a story about a Japanese American detective in Los Angeles in      investigating a murder. And then Pearl Harbor happens  and as if his life wasn't difficult enough  now the race relations have really ratcheted up  and then the Japanese American internment camps are quickly created  and there's lots of tension and horrible stuff as he's still trying to solve this murder. And so I did at first think very literally about this in terms of all right  we'll take Pearl Harbor and we'll add it to Los Angeles and we'll make this apocalyptic dawn on the horizon of the city. And so that's a picture from Pearl Harbor just grafted onto Los Angeles. My editor in chief said   You know  it's interesting but I think you can do better and I think you can make it simpler.  And so I went back to the drawing board  as I often do. But also  being alive to my surroundings  I work in a high rise in Midtown  and every night  before I leave the office  I have to push this button to get out  and the big heavy glass doors open and I can get onto the elevator. And one night  all of a sudden  I looked at this and I saw it in a way that I hadn't really noticed it before. Big red circle  danger. And I thought this was so obvious that it had to have been done a zillion times  and so I did a Google image search  and I couldn't find another book cover that looked quite like this  and so this is really what solved the problem  and graphically it's more interesting and creates a bigger tension between the idea of a certain kind of sunrise coming up over L.A. and America.   'Gulp' A tour of the human digestive system by Mary Roach.   Mary Roach is an amazing writer who takes potentially mundane scientific subjects and makes them not mundane at all  she makes them really fun. So in this particular case  it's about the human digestive system. So I'm trying to figure out what is the cover of this book going to be. This is a self portrait.  Laughter  Every morning I look at myself in the medicine cabinet mirror to see if my tongue is black. And if it's not  I'm good to go. I recommend you all do this. But I also started thinking  here's our introduction. Right  Into the human digestive system. But I think what we can all agree on is that actual photographs of human mouths  at least based on this  are off putting.  Laughter  So for the cover  then  I had this illustration done which is literally more palatable and reminds us that it's best to approach the digestive system from this end. I don't even have to complete the sentence. All right.   Unuseful mystery   What happens when clarity and mystery get mixed up  And we see this all the time. This is what I call unuseful mystery. I go down into the subway    I take the subway a lot    and this piece of paper is taped to a girder. Right  And now I'm thinking  uh oh  and the train's about to come and I'm trying to figure out what this means  and thanks a lot. Part of the problem here is that they've compartmentalized the information in a way they think is helpful  and frankly  I don't think it is at all. So this is mystery we do not need. What we need is useful clarity  so just for fun  I redesigned this. This is using all the same elements. Thank you. I am still waiting for a call from the MTA.  Laughter  You know  I'm actually not even using more colors than they use. They just didn't even bother to make the   and the   green  those idiots.  Laughter  So the first thing we see is that there is a service change  and then  in two complete sentences with a beginning  a middle and an end  it tells us what the change is and what's going to be happening. Call me crazy   Laughter    Useful mystery   All right. Now  here is a piece of mystery that I love  packaging. This redesign of the Diet Coke can by Turner Duckworth is to me truly a piece of art. It's a work of art. It's beautiful. But part of what makes it so heartening to me as a designer is that he's taken the visual vernacular of Diet Coke    the typefaces  the colors  the silver background    and he's reduced them to their most essential parts  so it's like going back to the Charlie Brown face. It's like  how can you give them just enough information so they know what it is but giving them the credit for the knowledge that they already have about this thing  It looks great  and you would go into a delicatessen and all of a sudden see that on the shelf  and it's wonderful. Which makes the next thing      Unuseful clarity      all the more disheartening  at least to me. So okay  again  going back down into the subway  after this came out  these are pictures that I took. Times Square subway station  Coca Cola has bought out the entire thing for advertising. Okay  And maybe some of you know where this is going. Ahem.  You moved to New York with the clothes on your back  the cash in your pocket  and your eyes on the prize. You're on Coke.   Laughter   You moved to New York with an MBA  one clean suit  and an extremely firm handshake. You're on Coke.   Laughter  These are real   Laughter  Not even the support beams were spared  except they switched into Yoda mode.  Laughter   Coke you're on.   Laughter    Excuse me  I'm on WHAT     This campaign was a huge misstep. It was pulled almost instantly due to consumer backlash and all sorts of unflattering parodies on the web    and also that dot next to  You're on   that's not a period  that's a trademark. So thanks a lot. So to me  this was just so bizarre about how they could get the packaging so mysteriously beautiful and perfect and the message so unbearably  clearly wrong. It was just incredible to me. So I just hope that I've been able to share with you some of my insights on the uses of clarity and mystery in my work  and maybe how you might decide to be more clear in your life  or maybe to be a bit more mysterious and not so over sharing. And if there's just one thing that I leave you with from this talk  I hope it's this  Blih blih blih blah. Blah blah blih blih.   'Judge This ' Chip Kidd   Blih blih blah blah blah. Blah blah blah. Blah blah. This is my great uncle  my father's father's younger brother. His name was Joe McKenna. He was a young husband and a semi pro basketball player and a fireman in New York City. Family history says he loved being a fireman  and so in       on one of his days off  he elected to hang out at the firehouse. To make himself useful that day  he started polishing all the brass  the railings on the fire truck  the fittings on the walls  and one of the fire hose nozzles  a giant  heavy piece of metal  toppled off a shelf and hit him. A few days later  his shoulder started to hurt. Two days after that  he spiked a fever. The fever climbed and climbed. His wife was taking care of him  but nothing she did made a difference  and when they got the local doctor in  nothing he did mattered either. They flagged down a cab and took him to the hospital. The nurses there recognized right away that he had an infection  what at the time they would have called  blood poisoning   and though they probably didn't say it  they would have known right away that there was nothing they could do. There was nothing they could do because the things we use now to cure infections didn't exist yet. The first test of penicillin  the first antibiotic  was three years in the future. People who got infections either recovered  if they were lucky  or they died. My great uncle was not lucky. He was in the hospital for a week  shaking with chills  dehydrated and delirious  sinking into a coma as his organs failed. His condition grew so desperate that the people from his firehouse lined up to give him transfusions hoping to dilute the infection surging through his blood. Nothing worked. He died. He was    years old. If you look back through history  most people died the way my great uncle died. Most people didn't die of cancer or heart disease  the lifestyle diseases that afflict us in the West today. They didn't die of those diseases because they didn't live long enough to develop them. They died of injuries    being gored by an ox  shot on a battlefield  crushed in one of the new factories of the Industrial Revolution    and most of the time from infection  which finished what those injuries began. All of that changed when antibiotics arrived. Suddenly  infections that had been a death sentence became something you recovered from in days. It seemed like a miracle  and ever since  we have been living inside the golden epoch of the miracle drugs. And now  we are coming to an end of it. My great uncle died in the last days of the pre antibiotic era. We stand today on the threshold of the post antibiotic era  in the earliest days of a time when simple infections such as the one Joe had will kill people once again. In fact  they already are. People are dying of infections again because of a phenomenon called antibiotic resistance. Briefly  it works like this. Bacteria compete against each other for resources  for food  by manufacturing lethal compounds that they direct against each other. Other bacteria  to protect themselves  evolve defenses against that chemical attack. When we first made antibiotics  we took those compounds into the lab and made our own versions of them  and bacteria responded to our attack the way they always had. Here is what happened next  Penicillin was distributed in       and widespread penicillin resistance arrived by     . Vancomycin arrived in       vancomycin resistance in     . Imipenem in       and resistance to in     . Daptomycin  one of the most recent drugs  in       and resistance to it just a year later in     . For    years  we played a game of leapfrog    our drug and their resistance  and then another drug  and then resistance again    and now the game is ending. Bacteria develop resistance so quickly that pharmaceutical companies have decided making antibiotics is not in their best interest  so there are infections moving across the world for which  out of the more than     antibiotics available on the market  two drugs might work with side effects  or one drug  or none. This is what that looks like. In       the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  the CDC  identified a single case in a hospital in North Carolina of an infection resistant to all but two drugs. Today  that infection  known as KPC  has spread to every state but three  and to South America  Europe and the Middle East. In       doctors in Sweden diagnosed a man from India with a different infection resistant to all but one drug that time. The gene that creates that resistance  known as NDM  has now spread from India into China  Asia  Africa  Europe and Canada  and the United States. It would be natural to hope that these infections are extraordinary cases  but in fact  in the United States and Europe         people a year die of infections which no drugs can help. A project chartered by the British government known as the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance estimates that the worldwide toll right now is         deaths a year. That is a lot of deaths  and yet  the chances are good that you don't feel at risk  that you imagine these people were hospital patients in intensive care units or nursing home residents near the ends of their lives  people whose infections are remote from us  in situations we can't identify with. What you didn't think about  none of us do  is that antibiotics support almost all of modern life. If we lost antibiotics  here's what else we'd lose  First  any protection for people with weakened immune systems    cancer patients  AIDS patients  transplant recipients  premature babies. Next  any treatment that installs foreign objects in the body  stents for stroke  pumps for diabetes  dialysis  joint replacements. How many athletic baby boomers need new hips and knees  A recent study estimates that without antibiotics  one out of ever six would die. Next  we'd probably lose surgery. Many operations are preceded by prophylactic doses of antibiotics. Without that protection  we'd lose the ability to open the hidden spaces of the body. So no heart operations  no prostate biopsies  no Cesarean sections. We'd have to learn to fear infections that now seem minor. Strep throat used to cause heart failure. Skin infections led to amputations. Giving birth killed  in the cleanest hospitals  almost one woman out of every    . Pneumonia took three children out of every   . More than anything else  we'd lose the confident way we live our everyday lives. If you knew that any injury could kill you  would you ride a motorcycle  bomb down a ski slope  climb a ladder to hang your Christmas lights  let your kid slide into home plate  After all  the first person to receive penicillin  a British policeman named Albert Alexander  who was so ravaged by infection that his scalp oozed pus and doctors had to take out an eye  was infected by doing something very simple. He walked into his garden and scratched his face on a thorn. That British project I mentioned which estimates that the worldwide toll right now is         deaths a year also predicts that if we can't get this under control by       not long  the worldwide toll will be    million deaths a year. How did we get to this point where what we have to look forward to is those terrifying numbers  The difficult answer is  we did it to ourselves. Resistance is an inevitable biological process  but we bear the responsibility for accelerating it. We did this by squandering antibiotics with a heedlessness that now seems shocking. Penicillin was sold over the counter until the     s. In much of the developing world  most antibiotics still are. In the United States     percent of the antibiotics given in hospitals are unnecessary. Forty five percent of the prescriptions written in doctor's offices are for conditions that antibiotics cannot help. And that's just in healthcare. On much of the planet  most meat animals get antibiotics every day of their lives  not to cure illnesses  but to fatten them up and to protect them against the factory farm conditions they are raised in. In the United States  possibly    percent of the antibiotics sold every year go to farm animals  not to humans  creating resistant bacteria that move off the farm in water  in dust  in the meat the animals become. Aquaculture depends on antibiotics too  particularly in Asia  and fruit growing relies on antibiotics to protect apples  pears  citrus  against disease. And because bacteria can pass their DNA to each other like a traveler handing off a suitcase at an airport  once we have encouraged that resistance into existence  there is no knowing where it will spread. This was predictable. In fact  it was predicted by Alexander Fleming  the man who discovered penicillin. He was given the Nobel Prize in      in recognition  and in an interview shortly after  this is what he said   The thoughtless person playing with penicillin treatment is morally responsible for the death of a man who succumbs to infection with a pencillin resistant organism.  He added   I hope this evil can be averted.  Can we avert it  There are companies working on novel antibiotics  things the superbugs have never seen before. We need those new drugs badly  and we need incentives  discovery grants  extended patents  prizes  to lure other companies into making antibiotics again. But that probably won't be enough. Here's why  Evolution always wins. Bacteria birth a new generation every    minutes. It takes pharmaceutical chemistry    years to derive a new drug. Every time we use an antibiotic  we give the bacteria billions of chances to crack the codes of the defenses we've constructed. There has never yet been a drug they could not defeat. This is asymmetric warfare  but we can change the outcome. We could build systems to harvest data to tell us automatically and specifically how antibiotics are being used. We could build gatekeeping into drug order systems so that every prescription gets a second look. We could require agriculture to give up antibiotic use. We could build surveillance systems to tell us where resistance is emerging next. Those are the tech solutions. They probably aren't enough either  unless we help. Antibiotic resistance is a habit. We all know how hard it is to change a habit. But as a society  we've done that in the past. People used to toss litter into the streets  used to not wear seatbelts  used to smoke inside public buildings. We don't do those things anymore. We don't trash the environment or court devastating accidents or expose others to the possibility of cancer  because we decided those things were expensive  destructive  not in our best interest. We changed social norms. We could change social norms around antibiotic use too. I know that the scale of antibiotic resistance seems overwhelming  but if you've ever bought a fluorescent lightbulb because you were concerned about climate change  or read the label on a box of crackers because you think about the deforestation from palm oil  you already know what it feels like to take a tiny step to address an overwhelming problem. We could take those kinds of steps for antibiotic use too. We could forgo giving an antibiotic if we're not sure it's the right one. We could stop insisting on a prescription for our kid's ear infection before we're sure what caused it. We could ask every restaurant  every supermarket  where their meat comes from. We could promise each other never again to buy chicken or shrimp or fruit raised with routine antibiotic use  and if we did those things  we could slow down the arrival of the post antibiotic world. But we have to do it soon. Penicillin began the antibiotic era in     . In just    years  we walked ourselves up to the edge of disaster. We won't get    years to find our way back out again. Thank you very much. So in       Karl Benz invented the automobile. Later that year  he took it out for the first public test drive  and    true story    crashed into a wall. For the last     years  we've been working around that least reliable part of the car  the driver. We've made the car stronger. We've added seat belts  we've added air bags  and in the last decade  we've actually started trying to make the car smarter to fix that bug  the driver. Now  today I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the difference between patching around the problem with driver assistance systems and actually having fully self driving cars and what they can do for the world. I'm also going to talk to you a little bit about our car and allow you to see how it sees the world and how it reacts and what it does  but first I'm going to talk a little bit about the problem. And it's a big problem   .  million people are killed on the world's roads every year. In America alone         people are killed each year. To put that in perspective  that's the same as a     falling out of the sky every working day. It's kind of unbelievable. Cars are sold to us like this  but really  this is what driving's like. Right  It's not sunny  it's rainy  and you want to do anything other than drive. And the reason why is this  Traffic is getting worse. In America  between      and       the vehicle miles traveled increased by    percent. We grew by six percent of roads  so it's not in your brains. Traffic really is substantially worse than it was not very long ago. And all of this has a very human cost. So if you take the average commute time in America  which is about    minutes  you multiply that by the     million workers we have  that turns out to be about six billion minutes wasted in commuting every day. Now  that's a big number  so let's put it in perspective. You take that six billion minutes and you divide it by the average life expectancy of a person  that turns out to be     lifetimes spent every day  wasted  just getting from A to B. It's unbelievable. And then  there are those of us who don't have the privilege of sitting in traffic. So this is Steve. He's an incredibly capable guy  but he just happens to be blind  and that means instead of a    minute drive to work in the morning  it's a two hour ordeal of piecing together bits of public transit or asking friends and family for a ride. He doesn't have that same freedom that you and I have to get around. We should do something about that. Now  conventional wisdom would say that we'll just take these driver assistance systems and we'll kind of push them and incrementally improve them  and over time  they'll turn into self driving cars. Well  I'm here to tell you that's like me saying that if I work really hard at jumping  one day I'll be able to fly. We actually need to do something a little different. And so I'm going to talk to you about three different ways that self driving systems are different than driver assistance systems. And I'm going to start with some of our own experience. So back in       we had the first test of a self driving car where we let regular people use it. Well  almost regular    they were     Googlers  but they weren't working on the project. And we gave them the car and we allowed them to use it in their daily lives. But unlike a real self driving car  this one had a big asterisk with it  They had to pay attention  because this was an experimental vehicle. We tested it a lot  but it could still fail. And so we gave them two hours of training  we put them in the car  we let them use it  and what we heard back was something awesome  as someone trying to bring a product into the world. Every one of them told us they loved it. In fact  we had a Porsche driver who came in and told us on the first day   This is completely stupid. What are we thinking   But at the end of it  he said   Not only should I have it  everyone else should have it  because people are terrible drivers.  So this was music to our ears  but then we started to look at what the people inside the car were doing  and this was eye opening. Now  my favorite story is this gentleman who looks down at his phone and realizes the battery is low  so he turns around like this in the car and digs around in his backpack  pulls out his laptop  puts it on the seat  goes in the back again  digs around  pulls out the charging cable for his phone  futzes around  puts it into the laptop  puts it on the phone. Sure enough  the phone is charging. All the time he's been doing    miles per hour down the freeway. Right  Unbelievable. So we thought about this and we said  it's kind of obvious  right  The better the technology gets  the less reliable the driver is going to get. So by just making the cars incrementally smarter  we're probably not going to see the wins we really need. Let me talk about something a little technical for a moment here. So we're looking at this graph  and along the bottom is how often does the car apply the brakes when it shouldn't. You can ignore most of that axis  because if you're driving around town  and the car starts stopping randomly  you're never going to buy that car. And the vertical axis is how often the car is going to apply the brakes when it's supposed to to help you avoid an accident. Now  if we look at the bottom left corner here  this is your classic car. It doesn't apply the brakes for you  it doesn't do anything goofy  but it also doesn't get you out of an accident. Now  if we want to bring a driver assistance system into a car  say with collision mitigation braking  we're going to put some package of technology on there  and that's this curve  and it's going to have some operating properties  but it's never going to avoid all of the accidents  because it doesn't have that capability. But we'll pick some place along the curve here  and maybe it avoids half of accidents that the human driver misses  and that's amazing  right  We just reduced accidents on our roads by a factor of two. There are now        less people dying every year in America. But if we want a self driving car  we need a technology curve that looks like this. We're going to have to put more sensors in the vehicle  and we'll pick some operating point up here where it basically never gets into a crash. They'll happen  but very low frequency. Now you and I could look at this and we could argue about whether it's incremental  and I could say something like        rule   and it's really hard to move up to that new curve. But let's look at it from a different direction for a moment. So let's look at how often the technology has to do the right thing. And so this green dot up here is a driver assistance system. It turns out that human drivers make mistakes that lead to traffic accidents about once every         miles in America. In contrast  a self driving system is probably making decisions about    times per second  so order of magnitude  that's about       times per mile. So if you compare the distance between these two  it's about    to the eighth  right  Eight orders of magnitude. That's like comparing how fast I run to the speed of light. It doesn't matter how hard I train  I'm never actually going to get there. So there's a pretty big gap there. And then finally  there's how the system can handle uncertainty. So this pedestrian here might be stepping into the road  might not be. I can't tell  nor can any of our algorithms  but in the case of a driver assistance system  that means it can't take action  because again  if it presses the brakes unexpectedly  that's completely unacceptable. Whereas a self driving system can look at that pedestrian and say  I don't know what they're about to do  slow down  take a better look  and then react appropriately after that. So it can be much safer than a driver assistance system can ever be. So that's enough about the differences between the two. Let's spend some time talking about how the car sees the world. So this is our vehicle. It starts by understanding where it is in the world  by taking a map and its sensor data and aligning the two  and then we layer on top of that what it sees in the moment. So here  all the purple boxes you can see are other vehicles on the road  and the red thing on the side over there is a cyclist  and up in the distance  if you look really closely  you can see some cones. Then we know where the car is in the moment  but we have to do better than that  we have to predict what's going to happen. So here the pickup truck in top right is about to make a left lane change because the road in front of it is closed  so it needs to get out of the way. Knowing that one pickup truck is great  but we really need to know what everybody's thinking  so it becomes quite a complicated problem. And then given that  we can figure out how the car should respond in the moment  so what trajectory it should follow  how quickly it should slow down or speed up. And then that all turns into just following a path  turning the steering wheel left or right  pressing the brake or gas. It's really just two numbers at the end of the day. So how hard can it really be  Back when we started in       this is what our system looked like. So you can see our car in the middle and the other boxes on the road  driving down the highway. The car needs to understand where it is and roughly where the other vehicles are. It's really a geometric understanding of the world. Once we started driving on neighborhood and city streets  the problem becomes a whole new level of difficulty. You see pedestrians crossing in front of us  cars crossing in front of us  going every which way  the traffic lights  crosswalks. It's an incredibly complicated problem by comparison. And then once you have that problem solved  the vehicle has to be able to deal with construction. So here are the cones on the left forcing it to drive to the right  but not just construction in isolation  of course. It has to deal with other people moving through that construction zone as well. And of course  if anyone's breaking the rules  the police are there and the car has to understand that that flashing light on the top of the car means that it's not just a car  it's actually a police officer. Similarly  the orange box on the side here  it's a school bus  and we have to treat that differently as well. When we're out on the road  other people have expectations  So  when a cyclist puts up their arm  it means they're expecting the car to yield to them and make room for them to make a lane change. And when a police officer stood in the road  our vehicle should understand that this means stop  and when they signal to go  we should continue. Now  the way we accomplish this is by sharing data between the vehicles. The first  most crude model of this is when one vehicle sees a construction zone  having another know about it so it can be in the correct lane to avoid some of the difficulty. But we actually have a much deeper understanding of this. We could take all of the data that the cars have seen over time  the hundreds of thousands of pedestrians  cyclists  and vehicles that have been out there and understand what they look like and use that to infer what other vehicles should look like and other pedestrians should look like. And then  even more importantly  we could take from that a model of how we expect them to move through the world. So here the yellow box is a pedestrian crossing in front of us. Here the blue box is a cyclist and we anticipate that they're going to nudge out and around the car to the right. Here there's a cyclist coming down the road and we know they're going to continue to drive down the shape of the road. Here somebody makes a right turn  and in a moment here  somebody's going to make a U turn in front of us  and we can anticipate that behavior and respond safely. Now  that's all well and good for things that we've seen  but of course  you encounter lots of things that you haven't seen in the world before. And so just a couple of months ago  our vehicles were driving through Mountain View  and this is what we encountered. This is a woman in an electric wheelchair chasing a duck in circles on the road.  Laughter  Now it turns out  there is nowhere in the DMV handbook that tells you how to deal with that  but our vehicles were able to encounter that  slow down  and drive safely. Now  we don't have to deal with just ducks. Watch this bird fly across in front of us. The car reacts to that. Here we're dealing with a cyclist that you would never expect to see anywhere other than Mountain View. And of course  we have to deal with drivers  even the very small ones. Watch to the right as someone jumps out of this truck at us. And now  watch the left as the car with the green box decides he needs to make a right turn at the last possible moment. Here  as we make a lane change  the car to our left decides it wants to as well. And here  we watch a car blow through a red light and yield to it. And similarly  here  a cyclist blowing through that light as well. And of course  the vehicle responds safely. And of course  we have people who do I don't know what sometimes on the road  like this guy pulling out between two self driving cars. You have to ask   What are you thinking   Now  I just fire hosed you with a lot of stuff there  so I'm going to break one of these down pretty quickly. So what we're looking at is the scene with the cyclist again  and you might notice in the bottom  we can't actually see the cyclist yet  but the car can  it's that little blue box up there  and that comes from the laser data. And that's not actually really easy to understand  so what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn that laser data and look at it  and if you're really good at looking at laser data  you can see a few dots on the curve there  right there  and that blue box is that cyclist. Now as our light is red  the cyclist's light has turned yellow already  and if you squint  you can see that in the imagery. But the cyclist  we see  is going to proceed through the intersection. Our light has now turned green  his is solidly red  and we now anticipate that this bike is going to come all the way across. Unfortunately the other drivers next to us were not paying as much attention. They started to pull forward  and fortunately for everyone  this cyclists reacts  avoids  and makes it through the intersection. And off we go. Now  as you can see  we've made some pretty exciting progress  and at this point we're pretty convinced this technology is going to come to market. We do three million miles of testing in our simulators every single day  so you can imagine the experience that our vehicles have. We are looking forward to having this technology on the road  and we think the right path is to go through the self driving rather than driver assistance approach because the urgency is so large. In the time I have given this talk today     people have died on America's roads. How soon can we bring it out  Well  it's hard to say because it's a really complicated problem  but these are my two boys. My oldest son is     and that means in four and a half years  he's going to be able to get his driver's license. My team and I are committed to making sure that doesn't happen. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Chris  I've got a question for you. Chris Urmson  Sure. CA  So certainly  the mind of your cars is pretty mind boggling. On this debate between driver assisted and fully driverless    I mean  there's a real debate going on out there right now. So some of the companies  for example  Tesla  are going the driver assisted route. What you're saying is that that's kind of going to be a dead end because you can't just keep improving that route and get to fully driverless at some point  and then a driver is going to say   This feels safe   and climb into the back  and something ugly will happen. CU  Right. No  that's exactly right  and it's not to say that the driver assistance systems aren't going to be incredibly valuable. They can save a lot of lives in the interim  but to see the transformative opportunity to help someone like Steve get around  to really get to the end case in safety  to have the opportunity to change our cities and move parking out and get rid of these urban craters we call parking lots  it's the only way to go. CA  We will be tracking your progress with huge interest. Thanks so much  Chris. CU  Thank you.  Applause  When you're a child  anything and everything is possible. The challenge  so often  is hanging on to that as we grow up. And as a four year old  I had the opportunity to sail for the first time. I will never forget the excitement as we closed the coast. I will never forget the feeling of adventure as I climbed on board the boat and stared into her tiny cabin for the first time. But the most amazing feeling was the feeling of freedom  the feeling that I felt when we hoisted her sails. As a four year old child  it was the greatest sense of freedom that I could ever imagine. I made my mind up there and then that one day  somehow  I was going to sail around the world. So I did what I could in my life to get closer to that dream. Age     it was saving my school dinner money change. Every single day for eight years  I had mashed potato and baked beans  which cost  p each  and gravy was free. Every day I would pile up the change on the top of my money box  and when that pile reached a pound  I would drop it in and cross off one of the     squares I'd drawn on a piece of paper. Finally  I bought a tiny dinghy. I spent hours sitting on it in the garden dreaming of my goal. I read every book I could on sailing  and then eventually  having been told by my school I wasn't clever enough to be a vet  left school age    to begin my apprenticeship in sailing. So imagine how it felt just four years later to be sitting in a boardroom in front of someone who I knew could make that dream come true. I felt like my life depended on that moment  and incredibly  he said yes. And I could barely contain my excitement as I sat in that first design meeting designing a boat on which I was going to sail solo nonstop around the world. From that first meeting to the finish line of the race  it was everything I'd ever imagined. Just like in my dreams  there were amazing parts and tough parts. We missed an iceberg by    feet. Nine times  I climbed to the top of her    foot mast. We were blown on our side in the Southern Ocean. But the sunsets  the wildlife  and the remoteness were absolutely breathtaking. After three months at sea  age just     I finished in second position. I'd loved it  so much so that within six months I decided to go around the world again  but this time not in a race  to try to be the fastest person ever to sail solo nonstop around the world. Now for this  I needed a different craft  bigger  wider  faster  more powerful. Just to give that boat some scale  I could climb inside her mast all the way to the top. Seventy five foot long     foot wide. I affectionately called her Moby. She was a multihull. When we built her  no one had ever made it solo nonstop around the world in one  though many had tried  but whilst we built her  a Frenchman took a boat    percent bigger than her and not only did he make it  but he took the record from    days right down to   . The bar was now much  much higher. And these boats were exciting to sail. This was a training sail off the French coast. This I know well because I was one of the five crew members on board. Five seconds is all it took from everything being fine to our world going black as the windows were thrust underwater  and that five seconds goes quickly. Just see how far below those guys the sea is. Imagine that alone in the Southern Ocean plunged into icy water  thousands of miles away from land. It was Christmas Day. I was forging into the Southern Ocean underneath Australia. The conditions were horrendous. I was approaching a part in the ocean which was       miles away from the nearest town. The nearest land was Antarctica  and the nearest people would be those manning the European Space Station above me. You really are in the middle of nowhere. If you need help  and you're still alive  it takes four days for a ship to get to you and then four days for that ship to get you back to port. No helicopter can reach you out there  and no plane can land. We are forging ahead of a huge storm. Within it  there was    knots of wind  which was far too much wind for the boat and I to cope with. The waves were already    to    feet high  and the spray from the breaking crests was blown horizontally like snow in a blizzard. If we didn't sail fast enough  we'd be engulfed by that storm  and either capsized or smashed to pieces. We were quite literally hanging on for our lives and doing so on a knife edge. The speed I so desperately needed brought with it danger. We all know what it's like driving a car    miles an hour        . It's not too stressful. We can concentrate. We can turn on the radio. Take that             accelerate through to             miles an hour. Now you have white knuckles and you're gripping the steering wheel. Now take that car off road at night and remove the windscreen wipers  the windscreen  the headlights and the brakes. That's what it's like in the Southern Ocean. You could imagine it would be quite difficult to sleep in that situation  even as a passenger. But you're not a passenger. You're alone on a boat you can barely stand up in  and you have to make every single decision on board. I was absolutely exhausted  physically and mentally. Eight sail changes in    hours. The mainsail weighed three times my body weight  and after each change  I would collapse on the floor soaked with sweat with this freezing Southern Ocean air burning the back of my throat. But out there  those lowest of the lows are so often contrasted with the highest of the highs. A few days later  we came out of the back of the low. Against all odds  we'd been able to drive ahead of the record within that depression. The sky cleared  the rain stopped  and our heartbeat  the monstrous seas around us were transformed into the most beautiful moonlit mountains. It's hard to explain  but you enter a different mode when you head out there. Your boat is your entire world  and what you take with you when you leave is all you have. If I said to you all now   Go off into Vancouver and find everything you will need for your survival for the next three months   that's quite a task. That's food  fuel  clothes  even toilet roll and toothpaste. That's what we do  and when we leave we manage it down to the last drop of diesel and the last packet of food. No experience in my life could have given me a better understanding of the definition of the word  finite.  What we have out there is all we have. There is no more. And never in my life had I ever translated that definition of finite that I'd felt on board to anything outside of sailing until I stepped off the boat at the finish line having broken that record. Suddenly I connected the dots. Our global economy is no different. It's entirely dependent on finite materials we only have once in the history of humanity. And it was a bit like seeing something you weren't expecting under a stone and having two choices  I either put that stone to one side and learn more about it  or I put that stone back and I carry on with my dream job of sailing around the world. I chose the first. I put it to one side and I began a new journey of learning  speaking to chief executives  experts  scientists  economists to try to understand just how our global economy works. And my curiosity took me to some extraordinary places. This photo was taken in the burner of a coal fired power station. I was fascinated by coal  fundamental to our global energy needs  but also very close to my family. My great grandfather was a coal miner  and he spent    years of his life underground. This is a photo of him  and when you see that photo  you see someone from another era. No one wears trousers with a waistband quite that high in this day and age.  Laughter  But yet  that's me with my great grandfather  and by the way  they are not his real ears.  Laughter  We were close. I remember sitting on his knee listening to his mining stories. He talked of the camaraderie underground  and the fact that the miners used to save the crusts of their sandwiches to give to the ponies they worked with underground. It was like it was yesterday. And on my journey of learning  I went to the World Coal Association website  and there in the middle of the homepage  it said   We have about     years of coal left.  And I thought to myself  well  that's well outside my lifetime  and a much greater figure than the predictions for oil. But I did the math  and I realized that my great grandfather had been born exactly     years before that year  and I sat on his knee until I was    years old  and I realized it's nothing in time  nor in history. And it made me make a decision I never thought I would make  to leave the sport of solo sailing behind me and focus on the greatest challenge I'd ever come across  the future of our global economy. And I quickly realized it wasn't just about energy. It was also materials. In       I picked up a scientific study looking at how many years we have of valuable materials to extract from the ground  copper      tin  zinc      silver    . These figures couldn't be exact  but we knew those materials were finite. We only have them once. And yet  our speed that we've used these materials has increased rapidly  exponentially. With more people in the world with more stuff  we've effectively seen     years of price declines in those basic commodities erased in just    years. And this affects all of us. It's brought huge volatility in prices  so much so that in       your average European car manufacturer saw a raw material price increase of     million Euros  wiping away half their operating profits through something they have absolutely no control over. And the more I learned  the more I started to change my own life. I started traveling less  doing less  using less. It felt like actually doing less was what we had to do. But it sat uneasy with me. It didn't feel right. It felt like we were buying ourselves time. We were eking things out a bit longer. Even if everybody changed  it wouldn't solve the problem. It wouldn't fix the system. It was vital in the transition  but what fascinated me was  in the transition to what  What could actually work  It struck me that the system itself  the framework within which we live  is fundamentally flawed  and I realized ultimately that our operating system  the way our economy functions  the way our economy's been built  is a system in itself. At sea  I had to understand complex systems. I had to take multiple inputs  I had to process them  and I had to understand the system to win. I had to make sense of it. And as I looked at our global economy  I realized it too is that system  but it's a system that effectively can't run in the long term. And I realized we've been perfecting what's effectively a linear economy for     years  where we take a material out of the ground  we make something out of it  and then ultimately that product gets thrown away  and yes  we do recycle some of it  but more an attempt to get out what we can at the end  not by design. It's an economy that fundamentally can't run in the long term  and if we know that we have finite materials  why would we build an economy that would effectively use things up  that would create waste  Life itself has existed for billions of years and has continually adapted to use materials effectively. It's a complex system  but within it  there is no waste. Everything is metabolized. It's not a linear economy at all  but circular. And I felt like the child in the garden. For the first time on this new journey  I could see exactly where we were headed. If we could build an economy that would use things rather than use them up  we could build a future that really could work in the long term. I was excited. This was something to work towards. We knew exactly where we were headed. We just had to work out how to get there  and it was exactly with this in mind that we created the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in September     . Many schools of thought fed our thinking and pointed to this model  industrial symbiosis  performance economy  sharing economy  biomimicry  and of course  cradle to cradle design. Materials would be defined as either technical or biological  waste would be designed out entirely  and we would have a system that could function absolutely in the long term. So what could this economy look like  Maybe we wouldn't buy light fittings  but we'd pay for the service of light  and the manufacturers would recover the materials and change the light fittings when we had more efficient products. What if packaging was so nontoxic it could dissolve in water and we could ultimately drink it  It would never become waste. What if engines were re manufacturable  and we could recover the component materials and significantly reduce energy demand. What if we could recover components from circuit boards  reutilize them  and then fundamentally recover the materials within them through a second stage  What if we could collect food waste  human waste  What if we could turn that into fertilizer  heat  energy  ultimately reconnecting nutrients systems and rebuilding natural capital  And cars    what we want is to move around. We don't need to own the materials within them. Could cars become a service and provide us with mobility in the future  All of this sounds amazing  but these aren't just ideas  they're real today  and these lie at the forefront of the circular economy. What lies before us is to expand them and scale them up. So how would you shift from linear to circular  Well  the team and I at the foundation thought you might want to work with the top universities in the world  with leading businesses within the world  with the biggest convening platforms in the world  and with governments. We thought you might want to work with the best analysts and ask them the question   Can the circular economy decouple growth from resource constraints  Is the circular economy able to rebuild natural capital  Could the circular economy replace current chemical fertilizer use   Yes was the answer to the decoupling  but also yes  we could replace current fertilizer use by a staggering  .  times. But what inspired me most about the circular economy was its ability to inspire young people. When young people see the economy through a circular lens  they see brand new opportunities on exactly the same horizon. They can use their creativity and knowledge to rebuild the entire system  and it's there for the taking right now  and the faster we do this  the better. So could we achieve this in their lifetimes  Is it actually possible  I believe yes. When you look at the lifetime of my great grandfather  anything's possible. When he was born  there were only    cars in the world  they had only just been invented. When he was     we flew for the first time in history. Now there are         charter flights every single day. When he was     we built the first computer. Many said it wouldn't catch on  but it did  and just    years later we turned it into a microchip of which there will be thousands in this room here today. Ten years before he died  we built the first mobile phone. It wasn't that mobile  to be fair  but now it really is  and as my great grandfather left this Earth  the Internet arrived. Now we can do anything  but more importantly  now we have a plan. Thank you. As a matter of fact  I was trying to think about my career since I left the White House  and the best example I have is a cartoon in The New Yorker a couple of years ago. This little boy is looking up at his father  and he says   Daddy  when I grow up  I want to be a former president.  Well  I have had a great blessing as a former president  because I have had an access that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe. Not only am I familiar with the    states in the United States  but also my wife and I have visited more than     countries in the world  and the Carter Center has had full time programs in    nations on Earth. And a lot of times  when we go into a country  we not only the meet the king or the president  but we also meet the villagers who live in the most remote areas of Africa. So our overall commitment at the Carter Center is to promote human rights  and knowing the world as I do  I can tell you without any equivocation that the number one abuse of human rights on Earth is  strangely  not addressed quite often  is the abuse of women and girls. There are a couple of reasons for this that I'll mention to begin with. First of all is the misinterpretation of religious scriptures  holy scriptures  in the Bible  Old Testament  New Testament  Quran and so forth  and these have been misinterpreted by men who are now in the ascendant positions in the synagogues and the churches and in the mosques. And they interpret these rules to make sure that women are ordinarily relegated to a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of God. This is a very serious problem. It's ordinarily not addressed. A number of years ago  in the year       I had been a Baptist  a Southern Baptist for    years    I tell you  I still teach Sunday school every Sunday  I'll be teaching this Sunday as well    but the Southern Baptist Convention in the year      decided that women should play a secondary position  a subservient position to men. So they issued an edict  in effect  that prevents women from being priests  pastors  deacons in the church  or chaplains in the military  and if a woman teaches a classroom in a Southern Baptist seminary  they cannot teach if a boy is in the room  because you can find verses in the Bible  there's over        verses in the Bible  that say that a woman shouldn't teach a man  and so forth. But the basic thing is the scriptures are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position. That is an all pervasive problem  because men can exert that power and if an abusive husband or an employer  for instance  wants to cheat women  they can say that if women are not equal in the eyes of God  why should I treat them as equals myself  Why should I pay them equal pay for doing the same kind of work  The other very serious blight that causes this problem is the excessive resort to violence  and that is increasing tremendously around the world. In the United States of America  for instance  we have had an enormous increase in abuse of poor people  mostly black people and minorities  by putting them in prison. When I was in office as governor of Georgia  one out of every       Americans were in prison. Nowadays   .  people per       are in prison. That's a sevenfold increase. And since I left the White House  there's been an     percent increase in the number of women who are black who are in prison. We also have  one of the only countries  on Earth that still has the death penalty that is a developed country. And we rank right alongside the countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights in encouraging the death penalty. We're in California now  and I figured out the other day that California has spent four billion dollars in convicting    people for the death penalty. If you add that up  that's     million dollars it costs California to send a person to be executed. Nebraska this week just passed a law abolishing the death penalty  because it costs so much.  Applause  So the resort to violence and abuse of poor people and helpless people is another cause of the increase in abuse of women. Let me just go down a very few abuses of women that concern me most  and I'll be fairly brief  because I have a limited amount of time  as you know. One is genital mutilation. Genital mutilation is horrible and not known by American women  but in some countries  many countries  when a child is born that's a girl  very soon in her life  her genitals are completely cut away by a so called cutter who has a razor blade and  in a non sterilized way  they remove the exterior parts of a woman's genitalia. And sometimes  in more extreme cases but not very rare cases  they sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate. And then later  when she gets married  the same cutter goes in and opens the orifice up so she can have sex. This is not a rare thing  although it's against the law in most countries. In Egypt  for instance     percent of all the females that live in Egypt today have been sexually mutilated in that way. In some countries  it's more than    percent of the women are cut that way before they reach maturity. This is a horrible affliction on all women that live in those countries. Another very serious thing is honor killings  where a family with misinterpretation  again  of a holy scripture    there's nothing in the Quran that mandates this    will execute a girl in their family if she is raped or if she marries a man that her father does not approve  or sometimes even if she wears inappropriate clothing. And this is done by members of her own family  so the family becomes murderers when the girl brings so called disgrace to the family. An analysis was done in Egypt not so long ago by the United Nations and it showed that    percent of these murders of a girl are perpetrated by the father  the uncle or the brother  but    percent of the murders are conducted by women. Another problem that we have in the world that relates to women particularly is slavery  or human trafficking it's called nowadays. There were about   .  million people sold from Africa into slavery in the New World back in the   th century and the   th century. There are    million people now living in slavery. The United States Department of State now has a mandate from Congress to give a report every year  and the State Department reports that         people are sold across international borders every year into slavery  and that    percent of those sold are women  into sexual slavery. In the United States right this moment         people are living in human bondage  or slavery. Atlanta  Georgia  where the Carter Center is located and where I teach at Emory University  they have between     and     women  people sold into slavery every month. It's the number one place in the nation because of that. Atlanta has the busiest airport in the world  and they also have a lot of passengers that come from the Southern Hemisphere. If a brothel owner wants to buy a girl that has brown or black skin  they can do it for       dollars. A white skinned girl brings several times more than that  and the average brothel owner in Atlanta and in the United States now can earn about         per slave. The sex trade in Atlanta  Georgia  exceeds the total drug trade in Atlanta  Georgia. So this is another very serious problem  and the basic problem is prostitution  because there's not a whorehouse in America that's not known by the local officials  the local policemen  or the chief of police or the mayor and so forth. And this leads to one of the worst problems  and that is that women are bought increasingly and put into sexual slavery in all countries in the world. Sweden has got a good approach to it. About    to    years ago  Sweden decided to change the law  and women are no longer prosecuted if they are in sexual slavery  but the brothel owners and the pimps and the male customers are prosecuted  and     Applause     prostitution has gone down. In the United States  we take just the opposite position. For every male arrested for illegal sex trade     women are arrested in the United States of America. Canada  Ireland  I've already said Sweden  France  and other countries are moving now towards this so called Swedish model. That's another thing that can be done. We have two great institutions in this country that all of us admire  our military and our great university system. In the military  they are now analyzing how many sexual assaults take place. The last report I got  there were        sexual assaults that took place in the military          . Only        not much more than   percent  are actually prosecuted  and the reason is that the commanding officer of any organization    a ship like my submarine  or a battalion in the Army or a company in the Marines    the commanding officer has the right under law to decide whether to prosecute a rapist or not  and of course  the last thing they want is for anybody to know that under their command  sexual assaults are taking place  so they do not do it. That law needs to be changed. About one out of four girls who enter American universities will be sexually assaulted before she graduates  and this is now getting a lot of publicity  partially because of my book  but other things  and so    universities in America are now condemned by the Department of Education under Title IX because the officials of the universities are not taking care of the women to protect them from sexual assault. The Department of Justice says that more than half of the rapes on a college campus take place by serial rapists  because outside of the university system  if they rape somebody  they'll be prosecuted  but when they get on a university campus  they can rape with impunity. They're not prosecuted. Those are the kinds of things that go on in our society. Another thing that's very serious about the abuse of women and girls is the lack of equal pay for equal work  as you know.  Applause  And this is sometimes misinterpreted  but for full time employment  a woman in the United States now gets    percent less than a man. When I became president  the difference was    percent. So we've made some progress  partially because I was president and so forth     Applause   Laughter     but in the last    years  there's been no progress made  so it's been just about    or    percent difference for the last    years. These are the kind of things that go on. If you take the Fortune     companies     of them have women CEOs  out of      and those CEOs  I need not tell you  make less on an average than the other CEOs. Well  that's what goes on in our country. Another problem with the United States is we are the most warlike nation on Earth. We have been to war with about    different countries since the Second World War. Sometimes  we've had soldiers on the ground fighting. The other times  we've been flying overhead dropping bombs on people. Other times  of course  now  we have drones that attack people and so forth. We've been at war with    different countries or more since the Second World War. There was four years  I won't say which ones  where we didn't    we didn't fire a bullet. But anyway  those kinds of things  the resort to violence and the misinterpretation of the holy scriptures are what causes  are the basic causes  of abuse of women and girls. There's one more basic cause that I need not mention  and that is that in general  men don't give a damn. The average man that might say  I'm against the abuse of women and girls quietly accepts the privileged position that we occupy  and this is very similar to what I knew when I was a child  when separate but equal had existed. Racial discrimination  legally  had existed for     years  from      at the end of the War Between the States  the Civil War  all the way up to the     s  when Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed for equal rights. But during that time  there were many white people that didn't think that racial discrimination was okay  but they stayed quiet  because they enjoyed the privileges of better jobs  unique access to jury duty  better schools  and everything else  and that's the same thing that exists today  because the average man really doesn't care. Even though they say   I'm against discrimination against girls and women   they enjoy a privileged position. And it's very difficult to get the majority of men who control the university system  the majority of men that control the military system  the majority of men that control the governments of the world  and the majority of men that control the great religions. So what is the basic thing that we need to do today  I would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful nations like this one  and where you come from  Europe and so forth  who have influence and who have freedom to speak and to act  need to take the responsibility on yourselves to be more forceful in demanding an end to racial discrimination against girls and women all over the world. The average woman in Egypt doesn't have much to say about her daughters getting genitally mutilated and so forth. I didn't even go down to detail about that. But I hope that out of this conference  that every woman here  will get your husbands to realize that these abuses on the college campuses and the military and so forth and in the future job market  need to protect your daughters and your granddaughters. I have    grandchildren  four children  and    great grandchildren  and I think often about them and about the plight that they will face in America  not only if they lived in Egypt or a foreign country  in having equal rights  and I hope that all of you will join me in being a champion for women and girls around the world and protect their human rights. Thank you very much.
