Some of you have heard the story before  but  in fact  there's somebody in the audience who's never heard this story    in front of an audience    before  so I'm a little more nervous than I normally am telling this story. I used to be a photographer for many years. In       I was working for Time magazine  and I was given a three day assignment to photograph Amerasian children  children who had been fathered by American GIs all over Southeast Asia  and then abandoned           children all over Asia. I had never heard the word Amerasian before. I spent a few days photographing children in different countries  and like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists  I always hope that when my pictures were published  they might actually have an effect on a situation  instead of just documenting it. So  I was so disturbed by what I saw  and I was so unhappy with the article that ran afterwards  that I decided I would take six months off. I was    years old. I decided I would find six children in different countries  and actually go spend some time with the kids  and try to tell their story a little bit better than I thought I had done for Time magazine. In the course of doing the story  I was looking for children who hadn't been photographed before  and the Pearl Buck Foundation told me that they worked with a lot of Americans who were donating money to help some of these kids. And a man told me  who ran the Pearl Buck Foundation in Korea  that there was a young girl  who was    years old  being raised by her grandmother. And the grandmother had never let any Westerners ever see her. Every time any Westerners came to the village  she hid the girl. And of course  I was immediately intrigued. I saw photographs of her  and I thought I wanted to go. And the guy just told me   There's no way. This grandmother won't even    you know  there's no way she's ever going to let you meet this girl that's she's raising.  I took a translator with me  and went to this village  found the grandmother  sat down with her. And to my astonishment  she agreed to let me photograph her granddaughter. And I was paying for this myself  so I asked the translator if it would be OK if I stayed for the week. I had a sleeping bag. The family had a small shed on the side of the house  so I said   Could I sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings   And I just told the little girl  whose name was Hyun Sook Lee  that if I ever did anything to embarrass her    she didn't speak a word of English  although she looked very American    she could just put up her hand and say   Stop   and I would stop taking pictures. And then  my translator left. So there I was  I couldn't speak a word of Korean  and this is the first night I met Hyun Sook. Her mother was still alive. Her mother was not raising her  her grandmother was raising her. And what struck me immediately was how in love the two of these people were. The grandmother was incredibly fond  deeply in love with this little girl. They slept on the floor at night. The way they heat their homes in Korea is to put bricks under the floors  so the heat actually radiates from underneath the floor. Hyun Sook was    years old. I had photographed  as I said  a lot of these kids. Hyun Sook was in fact the fifth child that I found to photograph. And almost universally  amongst all the kids  they were really psychologically damaged by having been made fun of  ridiculed  picked on and been rejected. And Korea was probably the place I found to be the worst for these kids. And what struck me immediately in meeting Hyun Sook was how confident she appeared to be  how happy she seemed to be in her own skin. And remember this picture  because I'm going to show you another picture later  but you can see how much she looks like her grandmother  although she looks so Western. I decided to follow her to school. This is the first morning I stayed with her. This is on the way to school. This is the morning assembly outside her school. And I noticed that she was clowning around. When the teachers would ask questions  she'd be the first person to raise her hand. Again  not at all shy or withdrawn  or anything like the other children that I'd photographed. Again  the first one to go to the blackboard to answer questions. Getting in trouble for whispering into her best friend's ears in the middle of class. And one of the other things that I said to her through the translator    again  this thing about saying stop    was to not pay attention to me. And so  she really just completely ignored me most of the time. I noticed that at recess  she was the girl who picked the other girls to be on her team. It was very obvious  from the very beginning  that she was a leader. This is on the way home. And that's North Korea up along the hill. This is up along the DMZ. They would actually cover the windows every night  so that light couldn't be seen  because the South Korean government has said for years that the North Koreans may invade at any time. So there's always this    the closer you were to North Korea  the more terrifying it was. Very often at school  I'd be taking pictures  and she would whisper into her girlfriends' ears  and then look at me and say   Stop.  And I would stand at attention  and all the girls would crack up  and it was sort of a little joke. The end of the week came and my translator came back  because I'd asked her to come back  so I could formally thank the grandmother and Hyun Sook. And in the course of the grandmother talking to the translator  the grandmother started crying. And I said to my translator   What's going on  why is she crying   And she spoke to the grandmother for a moment  and then she started getting tears in her eyes. And I said   OK  what did I do  What's going on  Why is everyone crying   And the translator said   The grandmother says that she thinks she's dying  and she wants to know if you would take Hyun Sook to America with you.  And I said   I'm    years old  and I live in hotels  and I'm not married.  I mean I had fallen in love with this girl  but I    you know  it was  like  emotionally I was about    years old. If you know of photographers  the joke is it's the finest form of delayed adolescence ever invented.  Sorry  I have to go on an assignment  I'll be back     and then you never come back. So  I asked the translator why she thought she was dying. Can I get her to a hospital  Could I pay to get her a doctor  And she refused any help at all. And so  when I got outside  I actually gave the translator some money and said   Please go back and see if you can do something.  And I gave the grandmother my business card. And I said   If you're serious  I will try to find a family for her.  And I immediately wrote a letter to my best friends in Atlanta  Georgia  who had an    year old son. And my best friend had mistakenly one day said something about wishing he had another child. So here my friends Gene and Gail had not heard from me in about a year  and suddenly I was calling  saying  I'm in Korea  and I've met this extraordinary girl.  And I said   The grandmother thinks she's sick  but I think maybe we would have to bring the grandmother over also.  And I said   I'll pay for the ...   I mean  I had this whole sort of picture. So anyway  I left. And my friends actually said they were very interested in adopting her. And I said   Look  I think I'll scare the grandmother to death  if I actually write to her and tell her that you're willing to adopt her  I want to go back and talk to her.  But I was off on assignment. I figured I'd come back in a couple of weeks and talk to the grandmother. And on Christmas Day  I was in Bangkok with a group of photographers and got a telegram    back in those days  you got telegrams    from Time magazine saying someone in Korea had died  and left their child in a will to me. Did I know anything about this  Because I hadn't told them what I was doing  because I was so upset with the story they'd run. So  I went back to Korea  and I went back to Hyun Sook's village  and she was gone. And the house that I had spent time in was empty. It was incredibly cold. No one in the village would tell me where Hyun Sook was  because the grandmother had always hidden her from Westerners. And they had no idea about this request that she'd made of me. So I finally found Myung Sung  her best friend that she used to play with after school every day. And Myung Sung  under some pressure from me and the translator  gave us an address on the outside of Seoul. And I went to that address and knocked on the door  and a man answered the door. It was not a very nice area of Seoul  as there were mud streets outside of it. And I knocked on the door  and Hyun Sook answered the door  and her eyes were bloodshot  and she seemed to be in shock. She didn't recognize me    there was no recognition whatsoever. And this man came to the door and kind of barked something in Korean. And I said to the translator   What did he say   And she said   He wants to know who you are.  And I said   Well  tell him that I am a photographer.  I started explaining who I was  and he interrupted. And she said   He says he knows who you are  what do you want   I said   Well  tell him that I was asked by this little girl's grandmother to find a family for her.  And he said   I'm her uncle  she's fine  you can leave now.  So I was    you know  the door was being slammed in my face  it's incredibly cold  and I'm trying to think   What would the hero do in a movie  if I was writing this as a movie script   So I said   Listen  it's really cold  I've come a very long way  do you mind if I just come in for a minute  I'm freezing.  So the guy kind of reluctantly let us in and we sat down on the floor. And as we started talking  I saw him yell something  and Hyun Sook came and brought us some food. And I had this whole mental picture of  sort of like Cinderella. I sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful  bright  happy little child  who now appeared to be very withdrawn  being enslaved by this family. And I was really appalled  and I couldn't figure out what to do. And the more I tried talking to him  the less friendly he was getting. So I finally decided  I said  Look      this is all through the translator  because  this is all  you know  I don't speak a word of Korean    and I said   Look  I'm really glad that Hyun Sook has a family to live with. I was very worried about her. I made a promise to her grandmother  your mother  that I would find a family  and now I'm so happy that you're going to take care of her.  I said   But you know  I bought an airline ticket  and I'm stuck here for a week.  And I said   I'm staying in a hotel downtown. Would you like to come and have lunch tomorrow  And you can practice your English.  Because he told me    I was trying to ask him questions about himself. And so I went to the hotel  and I found two older Amerasians. A girl whose mother had been a prostitute  and she was a prostitute  and a boy who'd been in and out of jail. And I said to them   Look  there's a little girl who has a tiny chance of getting out of here and going to America.  I said   I don't know if it's the right decision or not  but I would like you to come to lunch tomorrow and tell the uncle what it's like to walk down the street  what people say to you  what you do for a living. And just    I want him to understand what happens if she stays here. And I could be wrong  I don't know  but I wish you would come tomorrow.  So  these two came to lunch  and we got thrown out of the restaurant. They were yelling at him  they were    it got to be really ugly. And we went outside  and he was just furious. And I knew I had totally blown this whole thing. Here I was again  trying to figure out what to do. And he started yelling at me  and I said to the translator   OK  tell him to calm down  what is he saying   And she said   Well  he's saying  'Who the hell are you to walk into my house  some rich American with your cameras around your neck  accusing me of enslaving my niece  This is my niece  I love her  she's my sister's daughter. Who the hell are you to accuse me of something like this '  And I said  you know   Look   I said   You're absolutely right. I don't pretend to understand what's going on here.  I said   All I know is  I've been photographing a lot of these children.  I said   I'm in love with your niece  I think she's an incredibly special child.  And I said   Look  I will fly my friends over here from the United States if you want to meet them  to see if you approve of them. I just think that    what little I know about the situation  she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to have.  So  everyone told me afterwards that inviting the prospective parents over was  again  the stupidest thing I could have possibly done  because who's ever good enough for your relative  But he invited me to come to a ceremony they were having that day for her grandmother. And they actually take items of clothing and photographs  and they burn them as part of the ritual. And you can see how different she looks just in three months. This was now  I think  February  early February. And the pictures before were taken in September. Well  there was an American Marine priest that I had met in the course of doing the story  who had    children living in his house. He had three women helping him take care of these kids. And so I suggested to the uncle that we go down and meet Father Keene  to find out how the adoption process worked. Because I wanted him to feel like this was all being done very much above board. So  this is on the way down to the orphanage. This is Father Keene. He's just a wonderful guy. He had kids from all over Korea living there  and he would find families for these kids. This is a social worker interviewing Hyun Sook. Now  I had always thought she was completely untouched by all of this  because the grandmother  to me  appeared to be sort of the village wise woman  and the person everybody    throughout the day  I noticed people kept coming to visit her grandmother. And I always had this mental picture that even though they may have been one of the poorer families in the village  they were one of the most respected families in the village. And I always felt that the grandmother had kind of demanded  and insisted  that the villagers treat Hyun Sook with the same respect they treated her. Hyun Sook stayed at Father Keene's  and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through. He actually agreed to the adoption. And I went off on assignment and came back a week later  and Father Keene said   I've got to talk to you about Hyun Sook.  I kind of said   Oh God  now what   And he takes me into this room  and he closes the door  and he says   I have    children here in the orphanage  and it's total bedlam.  And there's clothes  and there's kids  and  you know  there's three adults and    kids    you can imagine. And he said   The second day she was here she made up a list of all of the names of the older kids and the younger kids. And she assigned one of the older kids to each of the younger kids. And then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day.  And he said   She's telling me that I'm messy  and I have to clean up my room.  And he said   I don't know who raised her  but   he said   she's running the orphanage  and she's been here three days.  This was movie day    that she organized    where all the kids went to the movies. A lot of the kids who had been adopted actually wrote back to the other kids  telling them about what their life was like with their new families. So  it was a really big deal when the letters showed up. This is a woman who is now working at the orphanage  whose son had been adopted. Gene and Gail started studying Korean the moment they had gotten my first letter. They really wanted to be able to welcome Hyun Sook into their family. And one of the things Father Keene told me when I came back from one of these trips    Hyun Sook had chosen the name Natasha  which I understood was from her watching a  Rocky and Bullwinkle  cartoon on the American Air Force station. This may be one of those myth buster things that we'll have to clear up here  in a minute. So  my friend Gene flew over with his son  Tim. Gail couldn't come. And they spent a lot of time huddled over a dictionary. And this was Gene showing the uncle where Atlanta was on the map  where he lived. This is the uncle signing the adoption papers. Now  we went out to dinner that night to celebrate. The uncle went back to his family  and Natasha and Tim and Gene and I went out to dinner. And Gene was showing Natasha how to use a knife and fork  and then Natasha was returning the utensil lessons. We went back to our hotel room  and Gene was showing Natasha also where Atlanta was. This is the third night we were in Korea. The first night we'd gotten a room for the kids right next to us. Now  I'd been staying in this room for about three months    it was a little    story Korean hotel. So  the second night  we didn't keep the kids' room  because we went down and slept on the floor with all the kids at the orphanage. And the third night  we came back  we'd just gone out to dinner  where you saw the pictures  and we got to the front desk and the guy at the front desk said   There's no other free rooms on your floor tonight  so if you want to put the kids five floors below you  there's a room there.  And Gene and I looked at each other and said   No  we don't want two    year olds five floors away.  So  his son said   Dad  I have a sleeping bag  I'll sleep on the floor.  And I said   Yeah  I have one too.  So  Tim and I slept on the floor  Natasha got one bed  Gene got the other    kids pass out  it's been very exciting for three days. We're lying in bed  and Gene and I are talking about how cool we are. We said   That was so great  we saved this little girl's life.  We were just like  you know  ah  just full of ourselves. And we fall asleep    and I've been in this room  you know  for a couple of months now. And they always overheat the hotels in Korea terribly  so during the day I always left the window open. And then  at night  about midnight  they turn the heat off in the hotel. So at about   a.m.  the whole room would be like    below zero  and I'd get up. I'd been doing this every night I'd been there. So  sure enough  it's one o'clock  room's freezing  I go to close the window  and I hear people shouting outside  and I thought   Oh  the bars must have just gotten out.  And I don't speak Korean  but I'm hearing these voices  and I'm not hearing anger  I'm hearing terror. So  I open the window  and I look out  and there's flames coming up the side of our hotel  and the hotel's on fire. So  I run over to Gene  and I wake him up  and I say   Gene  don't freak out  I think the hotel's on fire.  And now there's smoke and flames coming by our windows    we're on the eleventh floor. So  the two of us were just like   Oh my God  oh my God.  So  we're trying to get Natasha up  and we can't talk to her. And you know what kids are like when they've been asleep for like an hour  it's like they took five Valiums    you know  they're all over the place. And we can't talk to her. I remember his son had the L.L. Bean bootlaces  and we're trying to do up his laces. So  we try to get to the door  and we run to the door  and we open the door and it's like walking into a blast furnace. There's people screaming  there's the sound of glass breaking  there's these weird thumps. And the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds. And Gene turns around and says   We're not going to make it.  And he closes the door  and the whole room is now filled with smoke. We're all choking  and there's smoke pouring through the vents  under the doors. There's people screaming. I just remember this unbelievable  just utter chaos. I remember sitting near the bed  and I was just so    I had two overwhelming feelings. One was absolute terror    it's like   Oh  please God  I just want to wake up. This has got to be a nightmare  this can't be happening. Please  I just want to wake up  it's got to be a nightmare.  And the other is unbelievable guilt. Here I've been  playing God with my friends' lives  my friends' son  with Natasha's life  and this what you get when you try playing God  is you hurt people. I remember just being so frightened and terrified. And Gene  who's lying on the floor  says   Man  we've got to soak towels.  I said   What   He says   We've got to soak towels. We're going to die from the smoke.  So  we ran to the bathroom  and got towels  and put them over our faces  and the kids faces. Then he said   Do you have gaffer's tape   I said   What   He said   Do you have gaffer's tape   I said   Yeah  somewhere in my Halliburton.  He says   We've got to stop the smoke.  He said   That's all we can do  we've got to stop the smoke.  I mean  Gene    thank God for Gene. So  we put the room service menus over the vents in the wall  we put blankets at the bottom of the door  we put the kids on the windowsill to try to get some air. And there was a building  a new building  going up  that was being built right outside  across the street from our hotel. And there  in the building were photographers waiting for people to jump. Eleven people ended up dying in the fire. Five people jumped and died  other people were killed by the smoke. And there's this loud thumping on the door after about    minutes in all this  and people were shouting in Korean. And I remember  Natasha didn't want us opening the door    sorry  I was trying not to open the door  because we'd spent so much time barricading the room. I didn't know who it was  I didn't know what they wanted  and Natasha could tell they were firemen trying to get us out. I remember a sort of a tussle at the door  trying to get the door open. In any case     hours later  I mean  they put us in the lobby. Gene ended up using his coat  and his fist in the coat  to break open a liquor cabinet. People were lying on the floor. It was one of just the most horrifying nights. And then    hours later  we rented a car  as we had planned to  and drove back to Natasha's village. And we kept saying   Do you realize we were dying in a hotel fire  like eight hours ago   It's so weird how life just goes on. Natasha wanted to introduce her brother and father to all the villagers  and the day we showed up turned out to be a    year old man's birthday. This guy's    years old. So it turned into a dual celebration  because Natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the United States. So  these are the greenhouse tents. This is the elders teaching Gene their dances. We drank a lot of rice wine. We were both so drunk  I couldn't believe it. This is the last picture before Gene and Tim headed back. The adoption people told us it was going to take a year for the adoption to go through. Like  what could you do for a year  So I found out the name of every official on both the Korean and American side  and I photographed them  and told them how famous they were going to be when this book was done. And four months later  the adoption papers came through. This is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage. This is Father Keene with Natasha at the bus stop. Her great aunt at the airport. I had a wonderful deal with Cathay Pacific airlines for many years  where they gave me free passes on all their airlines in return for photography. It was like the ultimate perk. And the pilot  I actually knew    because they used to let me sit in the jump seat  to tell you how long ago this was. This is a Tri Star  and so they let Natasha actually sit in the jump seat. And the pilot  Jeff Cowley  actually went back and adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage after meeting Natasha. This is    hours later in Atlanta. It's a very long flight. Just to make things even crazier  Gail  Natasha's new mom  was three days away from giving birth to her own daughter. So you know  if you were writing this  you'd say   No  we've got to write the script differently.  This is the first night showing Natasha her new cousins and uncles and aunts. Gene and Gail know everyone in Atlanta    they're the most social couple imaginable. So  at this point  Natasha doesn't speak a word of English  other than what little Father Keene taught her. This is Kylie  her sister  who's now a doctor  on the right. This is a deal I had with Natasha  which is that when we got to Atlanta she could take    she could cut off my beard. She never liked it very much. She learned English in three months. She entered seventh grade at her own age level. Pledge of Allegiance for the first time. This is her cooking teacher. Natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up  because they would talk to her and she wouldn't answer  and they didn't realize she didn't actually speak English very well  in the beginning. But what I noticed  again as an observer  was she was choosing who was going to be on her team  and seemed to be very popular very  very quickly. Now  remember the picture  how much she looked like her grandmother  at the beginning  People were always telling Natasha how much she looks like her mother  Gail. This is a tense moment in the first football game  I think. And Kylie    I mean  it was almost like Kylie was her own child. She's being baptized. Now  a lot of parents  when they adopt  actually want to erase their children's history. And Gail and Gene did the complete opposite. They were studying Korean  they bought Korean clothes. Gene even did a little tile work in the kitchen  which was that   Once upon a time  there was a beautiful girl that came from hills of Korea to live happily ever after in Atlanta.  She hates this picture    it was her first job. She bought a bright red Karmann Ghia with the money she made working at Burger King. The captain of the cheerleaders. Beauty pageant. Used to do their Christmas card every year. Gene's been restoring this car for a million years. Kodak hired Natasha to be a translator for them at the Olympics in Korea. Her future husband  Jeff  was working for Canon cameras  and met Natasha at the Olympic Village. This is her first trip back to Korea  so there's her uncle. This is her half sister. She went back to the village. That's her best friend's mother. And I always thought that was a very Annie Hall kind of outfit. It's just  you know  it was just so interesting  just to watch    this is her mother in the background there. This is Natasha's wedding day. Gene is looking a little older. This is Sydney  who's going to be three years old in a couple of days. And there's Evan. Natasha  would you just come up  for a second  just maybe to say hello to everybody  Natasha's actually never heard me tell the story. I mean  she    you know  we've looked at the pictures together. Natasha  I've seen pictures millions of times  but today was the first time I'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation. I started crying. Rick Smolan  I'm sure there's about    things she's going to tell me   That wasn't what happened  that wasn't what you said.  Natasha  Later  I'll do that later. RS  Anyway  thank you  Mike and Richard  so much for letting us tell the story. Thank you all of you.   Picture yourself in a world where there's no one else      nobody anywhere.     A moment ago  there were voices and faces to look upon      you can't see them anywhere.     Nothing more to say     and no one left to say it to  anyway.     Oh  listen to what I say.     Everybody can be somebody     and everybody is free to make a difference.     Everybody can be somebody.     Everybody is free to make a difference in this world.     Now picture a world where the people all feel their worth.     Children are everywhere.     Now there is a reason for everyone's time on Earth.     Wondering why you should care  yeah.     Nothing more to say     and only love can see us through  anyway.     Oh  listen what I say  yeah.     Everybody can be somebody     and everybody is free to make a difference.     Everybody can be somebody.     Everybody is free to make a difference.     You don't have to be a big celebrity     to feel the power  the power in your soul  no.     You don't have to be a big star on MTV     to realize that in your eyes is a view that only you can see.     Everybody can be somebody.     Everybody is free to make a difference in this world.     You can make a little difference in this world.     I can make a little difference in this world.     She can make a little difference in this world.     He can make a little difference in this world.     You can  I can  she can  he can      we can make a little bit of difference in this world.     Everybody gonna make a little     little difference  yeah.     Talking 'bout everybody gonna make a little difference.     Everybody gonna make a little difference in this world      oh yeah.   Thank you so much. This is a song that came about because I think it's difficult to be in the world and not be aware of what's going on  and the wars and so forth. This song kind of came out of all of that. And I wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record  which I still stand by  but this has got something else in it. It's called  Peace on Earth.    There is no hope.     There is no future.     No faith in God to save the day.     There is no reason  no understanding     no sacred place to hide away.     There is no earnest conversation.     No words of wisdom from the wise.     There is no reconciliation     and no collective compromise.     Peace on Earth      that's what we want.     Peace on Earth      that's what we all say.     Peace on Earth.     Yet  there in the hallway     lurks the ghost of war.     He wants more  and more  and more  and more      and more  and more  and more  and more.     There is no darkness  no sunshine.     There is no great society.     There is no freedom without conviction.     There is no freedom to be free.     There is no heaven  no fire and brimstone.     There is no brotherhood of man.     There is no country  no one religion.     There is no universal plan.     Peace on Earth      that's what we want.     Peace on Earth      that's what we all say.     Peace on Earth.     Yet  there in the hallway     lurks the ghost of war.     He wants more  and more  and more  and more      and more  and more  and more  and more  and more.     The answer is     mutual assured destruction      a balance of power      a weapon for everyone.     Mutual assured destruction     bringing peace to everyone.     Peace on Earth      that's what we want.     Peace on Earth      that's what we all say.     Peace on Earth.     There in the hallway      peace on Earth.     Peace on Earth.     Peace on Earth.   I don't speak English. I start speaking English  learning English  about a year ago. I speak French and I grew up with French  so my English is Franglais. I'm born in the Western Congo  in an area around here  and then went to university in Kisangani. And after I finished  I went to this area  the Ituri Forest. But what I've been doing    when I was about     I grew in my uncle's house. And my father was a soldier  and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher. What I've been doing from    to    was  I was assisting them collecting ivory tusk  meat and whatever they were killing  poaching  hunting in the forest  bring it in the main city to get access to the market. But finally  I got myself involved. Around    to    years  I became  myself  a poacher. And I wanted to do it  because    I believed    to continue my studies. I wanted to go to university  but my father was poor  my uncle even. So  I did it. And for three to four years  I went to university. For three times  I applied to biomedical science  to be a doctor. I didn't succeed. I was having my inscriptions  my admission to biology. And I said   No way  I'm not doing it. My family's poor  my area don't have better health care. I want to be a doctor to serve them.  Three times  that means three years  and I start getting old. I say   Oh  no  I continue.  So  I did tropical ecology and plant botany. When I finished  I went to the Ituri Forest for my internship. It's where I really getting passion with what I'm doing right up to now    I'm standing in front of you    doing botany and wildlife conservation. That time the Ituri Forest was created as a forest reserve with some animals and also plants. And the training center there was built around the scientific Congolese staff and some American scientists also. So  the Okapi Faunal Reserve protects number    I think that is the largest number of elephants we have right now in protected areas in Congo. It has also chimpanzees. And it has been named Okapi Faunal Reserve because of this beautiful creature. That is a forest giraffe. I think you guys know it quite well. Here we have savanna giraffes  but through evolution we have this forest giraffe that lives only in Congo. It has also some beautiful primates. Thirteen species    highest diversity we can find in one single area in Africa. And it has the Ituri Forest itself    about       species of plants  so far known. I joined the Wildlife Conservation Society  working there  in       but I started working with them as a student in     . I was appointed as a teaching assistant at my university because I accomplished with honor. But I didn't like the way    the instruction I got was very poor. And I wanted to be formed to a training center and a research center. With the end of the dictatorship regime of Mobutu Sese Seko  that most of you know  life became very  very difficult. And the work we have been doing was completely difficult to do and to achieve it. When Kabila started his movement to liberate Congo  so Mobutu soldiers started moving and retreated. So they started fleeing from the east to the west. And the Okapi Faunal Reserve is there  so there was a road from Goma  somewhere here  and coming like this. So they might go through  pass through the Okapi Faunal Reserve. Congo has five of the world's richest sites of protected area  and the Okapi Faunal Reserve is one of them. So soldier was fleeing in the Okapi Faunal Reserve. On their way  they looted everything. Torture  wars    oh  my God  you can't believe. Every person was looking his way    where to go  we don't know. And it was for us  the young  the first time really we hear the language of war  of guns. And even people who faced the rebellion of       after our independence  they didn't believe what was happening. They were killing people. They were doing whatever they want because they have power. Who have been doing that  Young children. Child soldiers. You can't ask him how old he is because he has guns. But I was from the west  working in the east. I even  at  that time was not speaking Swahili. And when they came  they looted everything. You can't speak Lingala because Lingala was from Mobutu  and everyone speaking Lingala is soldier. And I was from the same area to him. All my friends said  we are leaving because we are a target. But I'm not going to the east  because I don't know Swahili. I stay. If I go  I will be killed. I can't go back to my area    it's more than       kilometers  away . I stayed after they looted everything. We have been doing research on botany  and we have a small herbarium of       sheets of plants. We cut  we dry and we packed them  we mounted them on a folder. Purpose  so that we start them for agriculture  for medicine  for whatever  and for science  for the study of the flora and the change of the forest. That is people moving around  that's even Pygmies. And this is a bright guy  hard working person  and Pygmy. I've been working with him about    years. And with soldiers  they went to the forest for poaching elephants. Because he's Pygmy  he knows how to track elephants in the forest. He has been attacked by a leopard and they abandon him in the forest. They came to told me  I have to save him. And what I did  I gave him just antibiotics that we care for tuberculosis. And fortunately  I saved his life. And that was the language of the war. Everywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral  killing animals  the logging timbers and so on. And what of important things    I think all of you here have a cell phone. That mineral has killed a lot  five millions of Congolese have gone because of this Colombo Tantalite    they call it Coltan    that they use it to make cell phones and it has been in that area  all over in Congo. Extraction  and good  big business of the war. And what I did for the first war  after we have lost everything  I have to save something  even myself  my life and life of the staff. I buried some of our new vehicle engines  I buried it to save it. And some of equipment went with them  on the top of the canopy  to save it. He's not collecting plants  he's going to save our equipment on the canopy. And with the material that's left    because they wanted to destroy it  to burn it  they didn't understand it  they didn't go to school    I packed it. And that is me  going to  hurrying to Uganda  to try to save that       material  with people carrying them on the bikes  bicycles. And after that  we succeeded. I housed that       material at the herbarium of Makerere University. And after the war  I have been able to bring it back home  so that we continue our studies. The second war came while we didn't expect it. With friends  we had been sitting and watching match football  and having some good music with WorldSpace radio  when it started  I think. So  it was so bad. We heard that now from the east again the war started  and it's going fast. This time I think Kabila will go in place of  as he did with Mobutu. And the reserve was a target to the rebels. Three different movements and two militia acting in the same area and competing for natural resources. And there was no way to work. They destroy everything. Poaching    oh  no way. And that's the powerful men. We have to meet and to talk to them. What's the regulation of the reserve and what is the regulation of the parks  And they can't do what they are doing. So we went to meet them. That is Coltan extraction  gold mining. So  we started talking with them  convincing them that we are in a protected area. There are regulations that it's prohibited to do logging  mining and poaching  specifically. But they said   You guys  you think that soldiers who are dying are not important  and your animals you are protecting are most important. We don't think so. We have to do it  because to let our movement advance.  I say   No way  you are not going to do it here.  We started talking with them and I was negotiating. Tried to protect our equipment  tried to protect our staff and the villages of about       people. And we continued. But I was doing that  negotiating with them. Sometimes we are having meeting and they are talking with Jean Pierre Bemba  with Mbusa Nyamwisi  with Kabila  and I'm there. Sometimes  they talk to my own language  that is  Lingala. I hear it and what strategy they are doing  what they are planning. Sometimes  they are having a helicopter to supply them with ammunition and so on. They used me to carry that  and I was doing counting  what comes from where  and where  and where. I had only this equipment    my satellite phone  my computer and a plastic solar panel    that I hide it in the forest. And every time  daily  after we have meeting  what compromise we have  whatever  I go  I write a short email  send it. I don't know how many people I had on my address. I sent the message  what is going about the progress of the war and what they are planning to do. They started suspecting that what we do on the morning  and the afternoon  it's on the news  BBC  RFI. Something might be going on. And one day  we went for a meeting. Sorry. One day  we went to meet the Chief Commander. He had the same iridium cell phone like me. And he asked me   Do you know how to use this   I said   I have never seen it. I don't know.  And I had mine on my pocket. So  it was a chance that they trusted me a lot. They didn't    they was not looking on me. So I was scared. And when we finished the meeting  I went to return it in the forest. And I was sending news  doing whatever  reporting daily to the U.N.  to UNESCO  to our institution in New York  what have been going. And for that  they have been having big pressure to leave  to free the area. Because there was no way    whatever they do  it's known the same time. During the first two rebellions  they killed all animals in the zoo. We have a zoo of    Okapis  and one of them was pregnant. And during the war  after a week of heavy war  fighting in the area  we succeeded  we had the first Okapi. This is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this. This is not local population  this is rebels. They are now happy sending the news that they have protected the Okapi with the war  because we sent the news that they are killing and poaching everywhere. After a week  we celebrated the birthday of that Okapi  they killed an elephant  just    meters to the area where the zoo  where Okapi was born. And I was mad. I oppose it    that they are now going to dissect it  until I do my report and then I see the Chief Commander. And I succeeded. The elephant just decayed and they just got the tusks. What we are doing after that    that was the situation of the war    we have to rebuild. I had some money. I was paid     dollars. I devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium  because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants. Wildlife Conservation Society more dealing with plants. I started this with    dollars  and start fundraising money to where I've been going. I had opportunity to go all over  where herbarium for my African material is. And they supported me a bit  and I built this. Now  it's doing work to train young Congolese. And also  what one of the speciality we are doing  my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity  and what the impacts of the Ituri Forest is playing to uptake carbon. This is one of the studies we are doing on a    hectare plot  where we have tagged trees and lianas from one centimeters  and we are tracking them. We have now data of about    years  to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions. And that is    I think it's difficult for me. This is a very embarrassing talk  I know. I don't know where to start  where to finish it. When I was thinking to come here  what best title I wanted to say to my talk  I didn't find this. But now I think that I would have titled it   The Language of Guns.  Where are you people  Now we are talking about reconstitution  rebuild Africa. But is gun industries a tool to rebuild  or is it a game  I think we see the war like a game    like soccer  football. Everybody is happy  but see what it's doing  see what is going in Darfur. Now we say  oh  my God. See what the wars in Rwanda. That's because of the language of guns. I don't think that someone may blame Google  because it's doing the right things  even if people like Al Qaeda are using Google to connect between them. But it's serving millions for the best. But what is doing with gun industries  Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you  thank you. Just wait over there. It's an amazing story. I suspect a lot of people here have the same question I have. How can we help you  Corneille Ewango  That's really embarrassing questions. I think that now I feel nervous. And I think  helping us  people are acting sometimes by ignorance. I did it myself. If I know when I was young  that  by  killing an elephant  I'm destroying biodiversity  I would not have done it. Many  many of you have seen the talents of Africans  but there are few who are going to school. Many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics  HIV  malaria  poverty  not going to school. What you can assist us  it's by building capacities. How many have got opportunity like me to go to U.S.  do a master's  And go    now  I'm in the Netherlands to do a Ph.D. But many of them are just here  because they don't have money. And they can't go even to university. They can't even attain the bachelor's degree. Building capacities for the young generation is going to make a better generation and a better future tomorrow for Africa. CA  Thank you  thank you. I'm going to talk about a technology that we're developing at Oxford now  that we think is going to change the way that computer games and Hollywood movies are being made. That technology is simulating humans. It's simulated humans with a simulated body and a simulated nervous system to control that body. Now  before I talk more about that technology  let's have a quick look at what human characters look like at the moment in computer games. This is a clip from a game called  Grand Theft Auto  .  We already saw that briefly yesterday. And what you can see is    it is actually a very good game. It's one of the most successful games of all time. But what you'll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive. They pretty much look the same. I've made him run into a wall here  over and over again. And you can see he looks always the same. The reason for that is that these characters are actually not real characters. They are a graphical visualization of a character. To produce these animations  an animator at a studio has to anticipate what's going to happen in the actual game  and then has to animate that particular sequence. So  he or she sits down  animates it  and tries to anticipate what's going to happen  and then these particular animations are just played back at appropriate times in the computer game. Now  the result of that is that you can't have real interactivity. All you have is animations that are played back at more or less the appropriate times. It also means that games aren't really going to be as surprising as they could be  because you only get out of it  at least in terms of the character  what you actually put into it. There's no real emergence there. And thirdly  as I said  most of the animations are very repetitive because of that. Now  the only way to get around that is to actually simulate the human body and to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body. And maybe  if I could have you for a quick demonstration to show what the difference is    because  I mean  it's very  very trivial. If I push Chris a bit  like this  for example  he'll react to it. If I push him from a different angle  he'll react to it differently  and that's because he has a physical body  and because he has the motor skills to control that body. It's a very trivial thing. It's not something you get in computer games at the moment  at all. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  That's it  Torsten Reil  That's it  yes. So  that's what we're trying to simulate    not Chris specifically  I should say  but humans in general. Now  we started working on this a while ago at Oxford University  and we tried to start very simply. What we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk. That stick figure is physically stimulated. You can see it here on the screen. So  it's subject to gravity  has joints  etc. If you just run the simulation  it will just collapse  like this. The tricky bit is now to put an AI controller in it that actually makes it work. And for that  we use the neural network  which we based on that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine that controls walking in humans. It's called the central pattern generator. So  we simulated that as well  and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk. For that we used artificial evolution    genetic algorithms. We heard about those already yesterday  and I suppose that most of you are familiar with that already. But  just briefly  the concept is that you create a large number of different individuals    neural networks  in this case    all of which are random at the beginning. You hook these up    in this case  to the virtual muscles of that two legged creature here    and hope that it does something interesting. At the beginning  they're all going to be very boring. Most of them won't move at all  but some of them might make a tiny step. Those are then selected by the algorithm  reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well. And you repeat that process over and over again  until you have something that walks    in this case  in a straight line  like this. So that was the idea behind this. When we started this  I set up the simulation one evening. It took about three to four hours to run the simulation. I got up the next morning  went to the computer and looked at the results  and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line  like I've just demonstrated  and this is what I got instead. So  it was back to the drawing board for us. We did get it to work eventually  after tweaking a bit here and there. And this is an example of a successful evolutionary run. So  what you'll see in a moment is a very simple biped that's learning how to walk using artificial evolution. At the beginning  it can't walk at all  but it will get better and better over time. So  this is the one that can't walk at all. Now  after five generations of applying evolutionary process  the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better. Generation    and it'll take a few steps more    still not quite there. But now  after generation     it actually walks in a straight line without falling over. That was the real breakthrough for us. It was  academically  quite a challenging project  and once we had reached that stage  we were quite confident that we could try and do other things as well with this approach    actually simulating the body and simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it. Now  at this stage  it also became clear that this could be very exciting for things like computer games or online worlds. What you see here is the character standing there  and there's an obstacle that we put in its way. And what you see is  it's going to fall over the obstacle. Now  the interesting bit is  if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right  which is what I'm doing now  here  it will fall over it in a completely different way. And again  if you move the obstacle a tiny bit  it'll again fall differently. Now  what you see  by the way  at the top there  are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles. Okay. That's the video. Thanks. Now  this might look kind of trivial  but it's actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds. Now  at this stage  we decided to start a company and move this further  because obviously this was just a very simple  blocky biped. What we really wanted was a full human body. So we started the company. We hired a team of physicists  software engineers and biologists to work on this  and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body  basically. It's got to be relatively fast  so you can run it on a normal machine  but it's got to be accurate enough  so it looks good enough  basically. So we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing  and tried to make it as realistic as possible. What you see here on the screen right now is a very simple visualization of that body. I should add that it's very simple to add things like hair  clothes  etc.  but what we've done here is use a very simple visualization  so you can concentrate on the movement. Now  what I'm going to do right now  in a moment  is just push this character a tiny bit and we'll see what happens. Nothing really interesting  basically. It falls over  but it falls over like a rag doll  basically. The reason for that is that there's no intelligence in it. It becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it. So  this character now has motor skills in the upper body    nothing in the legs yet  in this particular one. But what it will do    I'm going to push it again. It will realize autonomously that it's being pushed. It's going to stick out its hands. It's going to turn around into the fall  and try and catch the fall. So that's what you see here. Now  it gets really interesting if you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well. So here  we've got the same character. I'm going to push it a bit harder now  harder than I just pushed Chris. But what you'll see is    it's going to receive a push now from the left. What you see is it takes steps backwards  it tries to counter balance  it tries to look at the place where it thinks it's going to land. I'll show you this again. And then  finally hits the floor. Now  this becomes really exciting when you push that character in different directions  again  just as I've done. That's something that you cannot do right now. At the moment  you only have empty computer graphics in games. What this is now is a real simulation. That's what I want to show you now. So  here's the same character with the same behavior I've just shown you  but now I'm just going to push it from different directions. First  starting with a push from the right. This is all slow motion  by the way  so we can see what's going on. Now  the angle will have changed a tiny bit  so you can see that the reaction is different. Again  a push  now this time from the front. And you see it falls differently. And now from the left    and it falls differently. That was really exciting for us to see that. That was the first time we've seen that. This is the first time the public sees this as well  because we have been in stealth mode. I haven't shown this to anybody yet. Now  just a fun thing  what happens if you put that character    this is now a wooden version of it  but it's got the same AI in it    but if you put that character on a slippery surface  like ice. We just did that for a laugh  just to see what happens. And this is what happens. It's nothing we had to do about this. We just took this character that I just talked about  put it on a slippery surface  and this is what you get out of it. And that's a really fascinating thing about this approach. Now  when we went to film studios and games developers and showed them that technology  we got a very good response. And what they said was  the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen. Because stunts are obviously very dangerous  they're very expensive  and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do  obviously  because you can't really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt. So  they wanted to have a digital version of a stuntman and that's what we've been working on for the past few months. And that's our first product that we're going to release in a couple of weeks. So  here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked. That's what people want. That's what we're giving them. You can see  it's always reacting. This is not a dead body. This is a body who basically  in this particular case  feels the force and tries to protect its head. Only  I think it's quite a big blow again. You feel kind of sorry for that thing  and we've seen it so many times now that we don't really care any more. There are much worse videos than this  by the way  which I have taken out  but ... Now  here's another one. What people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion  a strong force applied to the character  and have the character react to it in midair. So that you don't have a character that looks limp  but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away  that looks kind of alive in midair as well. So this character is going to be hit by a force  it's going to realize it's in the air  and it's going to try and  well  stick out its arm in the direction where it's landing. That's one angle  here's another angle. We now think that the realism we're achieving with this is good enough to be used in films. And let's just have a look at a slightly different visualization. This is something I just got last night from an animation studio in London  who are using our software and experimenting with it right now. So this is exactly the same behavior that you saw  but in a slightly better rendered version. So if you look at the character carefully  you see there are lots of body movements going on  none of which you have to animate like in the old days. Animators had to actually animate them. This is all happening automatically in the simulation. This is a slightly different angle  and again a slow motion version of this. This is incredibly quick. This is happening in real time. You can run this simulation in real time  in front of your eyes  change it  if you want to  and you get the animation straight out of it. At the moment  doing something like this by hand would take you probably a couple of days. This is another behavior they requested. I'm not quite sure why  but we've done it anyway. It's a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach. In this case  the character's hands are fixed to a particular point in space  and all we've told the character to do is to struggle. And it looks organic. It looks realistic. You feel kind of sorry for the guy. It's even worse    and that is another video I just got last night    if you render that a bit more realistically. Now  I'm showing this to you just to show you how organic it actually can feel  how realistic it can look. And this is all a physical simulation of the body  using AI to drive virtual muscles in that body. Now  one thing which we did for a laugh was to create a slightly more complex stunt scene  and one of the most famous stunts is the one where James Bond jumps off a dam in Switzerland and then is caught by a bungee. Got a very short clip here. Yes  you can just about see it here. In this case  they were using a real stunt man. It was a very dangerous stunt. It was just voted  I think in the Sunday Times  as one of the most impressive stunts. Now  we've just tried and    looked at our character and asked ourselves   Can we do that ourselves as well   Can we use the physical simulation of the character  use artificial intelligence  put that artificial intelligence into the character  drive virtual muscles  simulate the way he jumps off the dam  and then skydive afterwards  and have him caught by a bungee afterwards  We did that. It took about altogether just two hours  pretty much  to create the simulation. And that's what it looks like  here. Now  this could do with a bit more work. It's still very early stages  and we pretty much just did this for a laugh  just to see what we'd get out of it. But what we found over the past few months is that this approach    that we're pretty much standard upon    is incredibly powerful. We are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of the simulations. There's very often very surprising behavior that you didn't predict before. There's so many things we can do with this right now. The first thing  as I said  is going to be virtual stuntmen. Several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen  and they're going to hit the screen quite soon  actually  for some major productions. The second thing is video games. With this technology  video games will look different and they will feel very different. For the first time  you'll have actors that really feel very interactive  that have real bodies that really react. I think that's going to be incredibly exciting. Probably starting with sports games  which are going to become much more interactive. But I particularly am really excited about using this technology in online worlds  like there  for example  that Tom Melcher has shown us. The degree of interactivity you're going to get is totally different  I think  from what you're getting right now. A third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation. We've been approached by several simulation companies  but one project we're particularly excited about  which we're starting next month  is to use our technology    and in particular  the walking technology    to help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy  to predict the outcome of operations on these children. As you probably know  it's very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation is if you try and correct the gait. The classic quote is  I think  it's unpredictable at best  is what people think right now  is the outcome. Now  what we want to do with our software is allow our surgeons to have a tool. We're going to simulate the gait of a particular child and the surgeon can then work on that simulation and try out different ways to improve that gait  before he actually commits to an actual surgery. That's one project we're particularly excited about  and that's going to start next month. Just finally  this is only just the beginning. We can only do several behaviors right now. The AI isn't good enough to simulate a full human body. The body yes  but not all the motor skills that we have. And  I think  we're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing. Right now  we don't have that but I'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage. We do have one unintentional dancer actually  the last thing I'm going to show you. This was an AI contour that was produced and evolved    half evolved  I should say    to produce balance  basically. So  you kick the guy and the guy's supposed to counter balance. That's what we thought was going to come out of this. But this is what emerged out of it  in the end. Bizarrely  this thing doesn't have a head. I'm not quite sure why. So  this was not something we actually put in there. He just started to create that dance himself. He's actually a better dancer than I am  I have to say. And what you see after a while    I think he even goes into a climax right at the end. And I think    there you go. So  that all happened automatically. We didn't put that in there. That's just the simulation creating this itself  basically. So it's just    Thanks. Not quite John Travolta yet  but we're working on that as well  so thanks very much for your time. Thanks. CA  Incredible. That was really incredible. TR  Thanks. I had a fire nine days ago. My archive      films  my    millimeter negative  all my books  my dad's books  my photographs. I'd collected    I was a collector  major  big time. It's gone. I just looked at it  and I didn't know what to do. I mean  this was    was I my things  I always live in the present    I love the present. I cherish the future. And I was taught some strange thing as a kid  like  you've got to make something good out of something bad. You've got to make something good out of something bad. This was bad  Man  I was    I cough. I was sick. That's my camera lens. The first one    the one I shot my Bob Dylan film with    years ago. That's my feature film.  King  Murray  won Cannes Film Festival         the only print I had. That's my papers. That was in minutes       minutes. Epiphany hit me. Something hit me.  You've got to make something good out of something bad   I started to say to my friends  neighbors  my sister. By the way  that's  Sputnik.  I ran it last year.  Sputnik  was downtown  the negative. It wasn't touched. These are some pieces of things I used in my Sputnik feature film  which opens in New York in two weeks downtown. I called my sister. I called my neighbors. I said   Come dig.  That's me at my desk. That was a desk took    some years to build. You know    all the stuff. That's my daughter  Jean. She came. She's a nurse in San Francisco.  Dig it up   I said.  Pieces. I want pieces. Bits and pieces.  I came up with this idea  a life of bits and pieces  which I'm just starting to work on    my next project. That's my sister. She took care of pictures  because I was a big collector of snapshot photography that I believed said a lot. And those are some of the pictures that    something was good about the burnt pictures. I didn't know. I looked at that    I said   Wow  is that better than the     That's my proposal on Jimmy Doolittle. I made that movie for television. It's the only copy I had. Pieces of it. Idea about women. So I started to say   Hey  man  you are too much  You could cry about this.  I really didn't. I just instead said   I'm going to make something out of it  and maybe next year ...   And I appreciate this moment to come up on this stage with so many people who've already given me so much solace  and just say to TEDsters  I'm proud of me. That I take something bad  I turn it  and I'm going to make something good out of this  all these pieces. That's Arthur Leipzig's original photograph I loved. I was a big record collector    the records didn't make it. Boy  I tell you  film burns. Film burns. I mean  this was    millimeter safety film. The negatives are gone. That's my father's letter to me  telling me to marry the woman I first married when I was   . That's my daughter and me. She's still there. She's there this morning  actually. That's my house. My family's living in the Hilton Hotel in Scotts Valley. That's my wife  Heidi  who didn't take it as well as I did. My children  Davey and Henry. My son  Davey  in the hotel two nights ago. So  my message to you folks  from my three minutes  is that I appreciate the chance to share this with you. I will be back. I love being at TED. I came to live it  and I am living it. That's my view from my window outside of Santa Cruz  in Bonny Doon  just    miles from here. Thank you everybody. How do groups get anything done  Right  How do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value  instead of just being chaos  And the economic framing of that problem is called coordination costs. And a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output. And we've had a classic answer for coordination costs  which is  if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people  you start an institution  right  You raise some resources. You found something. It can be private or public. It can be for profit or not profit. It can be large or small. But you get these resources together. You found an institution  and you use the institution to coordinate the activities of the group. More recently  because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor    and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination    there has been a second answer  which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure  to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by product of the operating of the system  without regard to institutional models. So  that's what I want to talk about today. I'm going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples  but always pointing to the broader themes. So  I'm going to start by trying to answer a question that I know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other  and which the Internet is purpose built to answer  which is  where can I get a picture of a roller skating mermaid  So  in New York City  on the first Saturday of every summer  Coney Island  our local  charmingly run down amusement park  hosts the Mermaid Parade. It's an amateur parade  people come from all over the city  people get all dressed up. Some people get less dressed up. Young and old  dancing in the streets. Colorful characters  and a good time is had by all. And what I want to call your attention to is not the Mermaid Parade itself  charming though it is  but rather to these photos. I didn't take them. How did I get them  And the answer is  I got them from Flickr. Flickr is a photo sharing service that allows people to take photos  upload them  share them over the Web and so forth. Recently  Flickr has added an additional function called tagging. Tagging was pioneered by Delicious and Joshua Schachter. Delicious is a social bookmarking service. Tagging is a cooperative infrastructure answer to classification. Right  If I had given this talk last year  I couldn't do what I just did  because I couldn't have found those photos. But instead of saying  we need to hire a professional class of librarians to organize these photos once they're uploaded  Flickr simply turned over to the users the ability to characterize the photos. So  I was able to go in and draw down photos that had been tagged  Mermaid Parade.  There were       photos taken by     photographers  all aggregated and then put under this nice  neat name  shown in reverse chronological order. And I was then able to go and retrieve them to give you that little slideshow. Now  what hard problem is being solved here  And it's    in the most schematic possible view  it's a coordination problem  right  There are a large number of people on the Internet  a very small fraction of them have photos of the Mermaid Parade. How do we get those people together to contribute that work  The classic answer is to form an institution  right  To draw those people into some prearranged structure that has explicit goals. And I want to call your attention to some of the side effects of going the institutional route. First of all  when you form an institution  you take on a management problem  right  No good just hiring employees  you also have to hire other employees to manage those employees and to enforce the goals of the institution and so forth. Secondly  you have to bring structure into place. Right  You have to have economic structure. You have to have legal structure. You have to have physical structure. And that creates additional costs. Third  forming an institution is inherently exclusionary. You notice we haven't got everybody who has a photo. You can't hire everyone in a company  right  You can't recruit everyone into a governmental organization. You have to exclude some people. And fourth  as a result of that exclusion  you end up with a professional class. Look at the change here. We've gone from people with photos to photographers. Right  We've created a professional class of photographers whose goal is to go out and photograph the Mermaid Parade  or whatever else they're sent out to photograph. When you build cooperation into the infrastructure  which is the Flickr answer  you can leave the people where they are and you take the problem to the individuals  rather than moving the individuals to the problem. You arrange the coordination in the group  and by doing that you get the same outcome  without the institutional difficulties. You lose the institutional imperative. You lose the right to shape people's work when it's volunteer effort  but you also shed the institutional cost  which gives you greater flexibility. What Flickr does is it replaces planning with coordination. And this is a general aspect of these cooperative systems. Right. You'll have experienced this in your life whenever you bought your first mobile phone  and you stopped making plans. You just said   I'll call you when I get there.   Call me when you get off work.  Right  That is a point to point replacement of coordination with planning. Right. We're now able to do that kind of thing with groups. To say instead of  we must make an advance plan  we must have a five year projection of where the Wikipedia is going to be  or whatever  you can just say  let's coordinate the group effort  and let's deal with it as we go  because we're now well enough coordinated that we don't have to take on the problems of deciding in advance what to do. So here's another example. This one's somewhat more somber. These are photos on Flickr tagged  Iraq.  And everything that was hard about the coordination cost with the Mermaid Parade is even harder here. There are more pictures. There are more photographers. It's taken over a wider geographic area. The photos are spread out over a longer period of time. And worst of all  that figure at the bottom  approximately ten photos per photographer  is a lie. It's mathematically true  but it doesn't really talk about anything important    because in these systems  the average isn't really what matters. What matters is this. This is a graph of photographs tagged Iraq as taken by the     photographers who contributed the       photos. And it's ranked in order of number of photos taken per photographer. You can see here  over at the end  our most prolific photographer has taken around     photos  and you can see there's a few people who have taken hundreds of photos. Then there's dozens of people who've taken dozens of photos. And by the time we get around here  we get ten or fewer photos  and then there's this long  flat tail. And by the time you get to the middle  you've got hundreds of people who have contributed only one photo each. This is called a power law distribution. It appears often in unconstrained social systems where people are allowed to contribute as much or as little as they like    this is often what you get. Right  The math behind the power law distribution is that whatever's in the nth position is doing about one nth of whatever's being measured  relative to the person in the first position. So  we'd expect the tenth most prolific photographer to have contributed about a tenth of the photos  and the hundredth most prolific photographer to have contributed only about a hundred as many photos as the most prolific photographer did. So  the head of the curve can be sharper or flatter. But that basic math accounts both for the steep slope and for the long  flat tail. And curiously  in these systems  as they grow larger  the systems don't converge  they diverge more. In bigger systems  the head gets bigger and the tail gets longer  so the imbalance increases. You can see the curve is obviously heavily left weighted. Here's how heavily  if you take the top    percent of photographers contributing to this system  they account for three quarters of the photos taken    just the top    percent most prolific photographers. If you go down to five percent  you're still accounting for    percent of the photos. If you go down to one percent  exclude    percent of the group effort  you're still accounting for almost a quarter of the photos. And because of this left weighting  the average is actually here  way to the left. And that sounds strange to our ears  but what ends up happening is that    percent of the contributors have contributed a below average amount. That sounds strange because we expect average and middle to be about the same  but they're not at all. This is the math underlying the       rule. Right  Whenever you hear anybody talking about the       rule  this is what's going on. Right     percent of the merchandise accounts for    percent of the revenue     percent of the users use    percent of the resources    this is the shape people are talking about when that happens. Institutions only have two tools  carrots and sticks. And the    percent zone is a no carrot and no stick zone. The costs of running the institution mean that you cannot take on the work of those people easily in an institutional frame. The institutional model always pushes leftwards  treating these people as employees. The institutional response is  I can get    percent of the value for    percent of the hires    great  that's what I'll do. The cooperative infrastructure model says  why do you want to give up a quarter of the value  If your system is designed so that you have to give up a quarter of the value  re engineer the system. Don't take on the cost that prevents you from getting to the contributions of these people. Build the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount. So the coordination response asks not  how are these people as employees  but rather  what is their contribution like  Right  We have over here Psycho Milt  a Flickr user  who has contributed one  and only one  photo titled  Iraq.  And here's the photo. Right. Labeled   Bad Day at Work.  Right  So the question is  do you want that photo  Yes or no. The question is not  is Psycho Milt a good employee  And the tension here is between institution as enabler and institution as obstacle. When you're dealing with the left hand edge of one of these distributions  when you're dealing with the people who spend a lot of time producing a lot of the material you want  that's an institution as enabler world. You can hire those people as employees  you can coordinate their work and you can get some output. But when you're down here  where the Psycho Milts of the world are adding one photo at a time  that's institution as obstacle. Institutions hate being told they're obstacles. One of the first things that happens when you institutionalize a problem is that the first goal of the institution immediately shifts from whatever the nominal goal was to self preservation. And the actual goal of the institution goes to two through n. Right  So  when institutions are told they are obstacles  and that there are other ways of coordinating the value  they go through something a little bit like the Kubler Ross stages       of reaction  being told you have a fatal illness  denial  anger  bargaining  acceptance. Most of the cooperative systems we've seen haven't been around long enough to have gotten to the acceptance phase. Many  many institutions are still in denial  but we're seeing recently a lot of both anger and bargaining. There's a wonderful  small example going on right now. In France  a bus company is suing people for forming a carpool  right  because the fact that they have coordinated themselves to create cooperative value is depriving them of revenue. You can follow this in the Guardian. It's actually quite entertaining. The bigger question is  what do you do about the value down here  Right  How do you capture that  And institutions  as I've said  are prevented from capturing that. Steve Ballmer  now CEO of Microsoft  was criticizing Linux a couple of years ago  and he said   Oh  this business of thousands of programmers contributing to Linux  this is a myth. We've looked at who's contributed to Linux  and most of the patches have been produced by programmers who've only done one thing.  Right  You can hear this distribution under that complaint. And you can see why  from Ballmer's point of view  that's a bad idea  right  We hired this programmer  he came in  he drank our Cokes and played Foosball for three years and he had one idea. Right  Bad hire. Right  The Psycho Milt question is  was it a good idea  What if it was a security patch  What if it was a security patch for a buffer overflow exploit  of which Windows has not some   but  several  Do you want that patch  right  The fact that a single programmer can  without having to move into a professional relation to an institution  improve Linux once and never be seen from again  should terrify Ballmer. Because this kind of value is unreachable in classic institutional frameworks  but is part of cooperative systems of open source software  of file sharing  of the Wikipedia. I've used a lot of examples from Flickr  but there are actually stories about this from all over. Meetup  a service founded so that users could find people in their local area who share their interests and affinities and actually have a real world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub or what have you. When Scott Heiferman founded Meetup  he thought it would be used for  you know  train spotters and cat fanciers    classic affinity groups. The inventors don't know what the invention is. Number one group on Meetup right now  most chapters in most cities with most members  most active  Stay at home moms. Right  In the suburbanized  dual income United States  stay at home moms are actually missing the social infrastructure that comes from extended family and local  small scale neighborhoods. So they're reinventing it  using these tools. Meetup is the platform  but the value here is in social infrastructure. If you want to know what technology is going to change the world  don't pay attention to    year old boys    pay attention to young mothers  because they have got not an ounce of support for technology that doesn't materially make their lives better. This is so much more important than Xbox  but it's a lot less glitzy. I think this is a revolution. I think that this is a really profound change in the way human affairs are arranged. And I use that word advisedly. It's a revolution in that it's a change in equilibrium. It's a whole new way of doing things  which includes new downsides. In the United States right now  a woman named Judith Miller is in jail for not having given to a Federal Grand Jury her sources    she's a reporter for the New York Times    her sources  in a very abstract and hard to follow case. And journalists are in the street rallying to improve the shield laws. The shield laws are our laws    pretty much a patchwork of state laws    that prevent a journalist from having to betray a source. This is happening  however  against the background of the rise of Web logging. Web logging is a classic example of mass amateurization. It has de professionalized publishing. Want to publish globally anything you think today  It is a one button operation that you can do for free. That has sent the professional class of publishing down into the ranks of mass amateurization. And so the shield law  as much as we want it    we want a professional class of truth tellers    it is becoming increasingly incoherent  because the institution is becoming incoherent. There are people in the States right now tying themselves into knots  trying to figure out whether or not bloggers are journalists. And the answer to that question is  it doesn't matter  because that's not the right question. Journalism was an answer to an even more important question  which is  how will society be informed  How will they share ideas and opinions  And if there is an answer to that that happens outside the professional framework of journalism  it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distributed class. So as much as we want the shield laws  the background    the institution to which they were attached    is becoming incoherent. Here's another example. Pro ana  the pro ana groups. These are groups of teenage girls who have taken on Web logs  bulletin boards  other kinds of cooperative infrastructure  and have used it to set up support groups for remaining anorexic by choice. They post pictures of thin models  which they call  thinspiration.  They have little slogans  like  Salvation through Starvation.  They even have Lance Armstrong style bracelets  these red bracelets  which signify  in the small group  I am trying to maintain my eating disorder. They trade tips  like  if you feel like eating something  clean a toilet or the litter box. The feeling will pass. We're used to support groups being beneficial. We have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial. But it turns out that the logic of the support group is value neutral. A support group is simply a small group that wants to maintain a way of living in the context of a larger group. Now  when the larger group is a bunch of drunks  and the small group wants to stay sober  then we think  that's a great support group. But when the small group is teenage girls who want to stay anorexic by choice  then we're horrified. What's happened is that the normative goals of the support groups that we're used to  came from the institutions that were framing them  and not from the infrastructure. Once the infrastructure becomes generically available  the logic of the support group has been revealed to be accessible to anyone  including people pursuing these kinds of goals. So  there are significant downsides to these changes as well as upsides. And of course  in the current environment  one need allude only lightly to the work of non state actors trying to influence global affairs  and taking advantage of these. This is a social map of the hijackers and their associates who perpetrated the      attack. It was produced by analyzing their communications patterns using a lot of these tools. And doubtless the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for the attacks of last week. Now  this is the part of the talk where I tell you what's going to come as a result of all of this  but I'm running out of time  which is good  because I don't know. Right. As with the printing press  if it's really a revolution  it doesn't take us from Point A to Point B. It takes us from Point A to chaos. The printing press precipitated     years of chaos  moving from a world where the Catholic Church was the sort of organizing political force to the Treaty of Westphalia  when we finally knew what the new unit was  the nation state. Now  I'm not predicting     years of chaos as a result of this.   .    years in which loosely coordinated groups are going to be given increasingly high leverage  and the more those groups forego traditional institutional imperatives    like deciding in advance what's going to happen  or the profit motive    the more leverage they'll get. And institutions are going to come under an increasing degree of pressure  and the more rigidly managed  and the more they rely on information monopolies  the greater the pressure is going to be. And that's going to happen one arena at a time  one institution at a time. The forces are general  but the results are going to be specific. And so the point here is not   This is wonderful   or  We're going to see a transition from only institutions to only cooperative framework.  It's going to be much more complicated than that. But the point is that it's going to be a massive readjustment. And since we can see it in advance and know it's coming  my argument is essentially  we might as well get good at it. Thank you very much. How will we be remembered in     years  I happen to live in a little town  Princeton  in New Jersey  which every year celebrates the great event in Princeton history  the Battle of Princeton  which was  in fact  a very important battle. It was the first battle that George Washington won  in fact  and was pretty much of a turning point in the war of independence. It happened     years ago. It was actually a terrible disaster for Princeton. The town was burned down  it was in the middle of winter  and it was a very  very severe winter. And about a quarter of all the people in Princeton died that winter from hunger and cold  but nobody remembers that. What they remember is  of course  the great triumph  that the Brits were beaten  and we won  and that the country was born. And so I agree very emphatically that the pain of childbirth is not remembered. It's the child that's remembered. And that's what we're going through at this time. I wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology  because I think I know very little about that    I'm not a biologist    so everything I know about it can be said in one minute. What I'm saying is that we should follow the model that has been so successful with the electronic industry  that what really turned computers into a great success  in the world as a whole  is toys. As soon as computers became toys  when kids could come home and play with them  then the industry really took off. And that has to happen with biotech. There's a huge       there's a huge community of people in the world who are practical biologists  who are dog breeders  pigeon breeders  orchid breeders  rose breeders  people who handle biology with their hands  and who are dedicated to producing beautiful things  beautiful creatures  plants  animals  pets. These people will be empowered with biotech  and that will be an enormous positive step to acceptance of biotechnology. That will blow away a lot of the opposition. When people have this technology in their hands  you have a do it yourself biotech kit  grow your own    grow your dog  grow your own cat. Just buy the software  you design it. I won't say anymore  you can take it on from there. It's going to happen  and I think it has to happen before the technology becomes natural  becomes part of the human condition  something that everybody's familiar with and everybody accepts. So  let's leave that aside. I want to talk about something quite different  which is what I know about  and that is astronomy. And I'm interested in searching for life in the universe. And it's open to us to introduce a new way of doing that  and that's what I'll talk about for    minutes  or whatever the time remains. The important fact is  that most of the real estate that's accessible to us    I'm not talking about the stars  I'm talking about the solar system  the stuff that's within reach for spacecraft and within reach of our earthbound telescopes    most of the real estate is very cold and very far from the Sun. If you look at the solar system  as we know it today  it has a few planets close to the Sun. That's where we live. It has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between the orbit of the Earth out through    to the orbit of Jupiter. The asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate  but not very large. And it's not very promising for life  since most of it consists of rock and metal  mostly rock. It's not only cold  but very dry. So the asteroids we don't have much hope for. There stand some interesting places a little further out  the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Particularly  there's a place called Europa  which is    Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter  where we see a very level ice surface  which looks as if it's floating on top of an ocean. So  we believe that on Europa there is  in fact  a deep ocean. And that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore. Ocean    probably the most likely place for life to originate  just as it originated on the Earth. So we would love to explore Europa  to go down through the ice  find out who is swimming around in the ocean  whether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters    whatever there may be that's exciting     or cephalopods. But that's hard to do. Unfortunately  the ice is thick. We don't know just how thick it is  probably miles thick  so it's very expensive and very difficult to go down there    send down your submarine or whatever it is    and explore. That's something we don't yet know how to do. There are plans to do it  but it's hard. Go out a bit further  you'll find that beyond the orbit of Neptune  way out  far from the Sun  that's where the real estate really begins. You'll find millions or trillions or billions of objects which  in what we call the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud    these are clouds of small objects which appear as comets when they fall close to the Sun. Mostly  they just live out there in the cold of the outer solar system  but they are biologically very interesting indeed  because they consist primarily of ice with other minerals  which are just the right ones for developing life. So if life could be established out there  it would have all the essentials    chemistry and sunlight    everything that's needed. So  what I'm proposing is that there is where we should be looking for life  rather than on Mars  although Mars is  of course  also a very promising and interesting place. But we can look outside  very cheaply and in a simple fashion. And that's what I'm going to talk about. There is a    imagine that life originated on Europa  and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years. It's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface  just as it did on the Earth. Staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for   billion years  finally came out onto the land. And then of course it had great    much greater freedom  and a much greater variety of creatures developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean. And the step from the ocean to the land was not easy  but it happened. Now  if life had originated on Europa in the ocean  it could also have moved out onto the surface. There wouldn't have been any air there    it's a vacuum. It is out in the cold  but it still could have come. You can imagine that the plants growing up like kelp through cracks in the ice  growing on the surface. What would they need in order to grow on the surface  They'd need  first of all  to have a thick skin to protect themselves from losing water through the skin. So they would have to have something like a reptilian skin. But better    what is more important is that they would have to concentrate sunlight. The sunlight in Jupiter  on the satellites of Jupiter  is    times fainter than it is here  since Jupiter is five times as far from the Sun. So they would have to have    these creatures  which I call sunflowers  which I imagine living on the surface of Europa  would have to have either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight  so they could keep themselves warm on the surface. Otherwise  they would be at a temperature of minus      which is certainly not favorable for developing life  at least of the kind we know. But if they just simply could grow  like leaves  little lenses and mirrors to concentrate sunlight  then they could keep warm on the surface. They could enjoy all the benefits of the sunlight and have roots going down into the ocean  life then could flourish much more. So  why not look  Of course  it's not very likely that there's life on the surface of Europa. None of these things is likely  but my  my philosophy is  look for what's detectable  not for what's probable. There's a long history in astronomy of unlikely things turning out to be there. And I mean  the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole. This was    originally  when radio astronomy began  Mr. Jansky  at the Bell labs  detected radio waves coming from the sky. And the regular astronomers were scornful about this. They said   It's all right  you can detect radio waves from the Sun  but the Sun is the only object in the universe that's close enough and bright enough actually to be detectable. You can easily calculate that radio waves from the Sun are fairly faint  and everything else in the universe is millions of times further away  so it certainly will not be detectable. So there's no point in looking.  And that  of course  that set back the progress of radio astronomy by about    years. Since there was nothing there  you might as well not look. Well  of course  as soon as anybody did look  which was after about    years  when radio astronomy really took off. Because it turned out the universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things radiating in the radio spectrum  much brighter than the Sun. So  the same thing could be true for this kind of life  which I'm talking about  on cold objects  that it could in fact be very abundant all over the universe  and it's not been detected just because we haven't taken the trouble to look. So  the last thing I want to talk about is how to detect it. There is something called pit lamping. That's the phrase which I learned from my son George  who is there in the audience. You take    that's a Canadian expression. If you happen to want to hunt animals at night  you take a miner's lamp  which is a pit lamp. You strap it onto your forehead  so you can see the reflection in the eyes of the animal. So  if you go out at night  you shine a flashlight  the animals are bright. You see the red glow in their eyes  which is the reflection of the flashlight. And then  if you're one of these unsporting characters  you shoot the animals and take them home. And of course  that spoils the game for the other hunters who hunt in the daytime  so in Canada that's illegal. In New Zealand  it's legal  because the New Zealand farmers use this as a way of getting rid of rabbits  because the rabbits compete with the sheep in New Zealand. So  the farmers go out at night with heavily armed jeeps  and shine the headlights  and anything that doesn't look like a sheep  you shoot. So I have proposed to apply the same trick to looking for life in the universe. That if these creatures who are living on cold surfaces    either on Europa  or further out  anywhere where you can live on a cold surface    those creatures must be provided with reflectors. In order to concentrate sunlight  they have to have lenses and mirrors    in order to keep themselves warm. And then  when you shine sunlight at them  the sunlight will be reflected back  just as it is in the eyes of an animal. So these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings. And the further out you go in this  away from the Sun  the more powerful this reflection will be. So actually  this method of hunting for life gets stronger and stronger as you go further away  because the optical reflectors have to be more powerful so the reflected light shines out even more in contrast against the dark background. So as you go further away from the Sun  this becomes more and more powerful. So  in fact  you can look for these creatures with telescopes from the Earth. Why aren't we doing it  Simply because nobody thought of it yet. But I hope that we shall look  and with any    we probably won't find anything  none of these speculations may have any basis in fact. But still  it's a good chance. And of course  if it happens  it will transform our view of life altogether. Because it means that    the way life can live out there  it has enormous advantages as compared with living on a planet. It's extremely hard to move from one planet to another. We're having great difficulties at the moment and any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck. Especially if you breathe air  it's very hard to get from planet A to planet B  because there's no air in between. But if you breathe air       you're dead       as soon as you're off the planet  unless you have a spaceship. But if you live in a vacuum  if you live on the surface of one of these objects  say  in the Kuiper Belt  this    an object like Pluto  or one of the smaller objects in the neighborhood of Pluto  and you happened    if you're living on the surface there  and you get knocked off the surface by a collision  then it doesn't change anything all that much. You still are on a piece of ice  you can still have sunlight and you can still survive while you're traveling from one place to another. And then if you run into another object  you can stay there and colonize the other object. So life will spread  then  from one object to another. So if it exists at all in the Kuiper Belt  it's likely to be very widespread. And you will have then a great competition amongst species    Darwinian evolution    so there'll be a huge advantage to the species which is able to jump from one place to another without having to wait for a collision. And there'll be advantages for spreading out long  sort of kelp like forest of vegetation. I call these creatures sunflowers. They look like  maybe like sunflowers. They have to be all the time pointing toward the Sun  and they will be able to spread out in space  because gravity on these objects is weak. So they can collect sunlight from a big area. So they will  in fact  be quite easy for us to detect. So  I hope in the next    years  we'll find these creatures  and then  of course  our whole view of life in the universe will change. If we don't find them  then we can create them ourselves. That's another wonderful opportunity that's opening. We can    as soon as we have a little bit more understanding of genetic engineering  one of the things you can do with your take it home  do it yourself genetic engineering kit    is to design a creature that can live on a cold satellite  a place like Europa  so we could colonize Europa with our own creatures. That would be a fun thing to do. In the long run  of course  it would also make it possible for us to move out there. What's going to happen in the end  it's not going to be just humans colonizing space  it's going to be life moving out from the Earth  moving it into its kingdom. And the kingdom of life  of course  is going to be the universe. And if life is already there  it makes it much more exciting  in the short run. But in the long run  if there's no life there  we create it ourselves. We transform the universe into something much more rich and beautiful than it is today. So again  we have a big and wonderful future to look forward. Thank you. I and my colleagues Art Aron and Lucy Brown and others  have put    people who are madly in love into a functional MRI brain scanner.    who were happily in love     who had just been dumped  and we're just starting our third experiment  studying people who report that they're still in love after    to    years of marriage. So  this is the short story of that research. In the jungles of Guatemala  in Tikal  stands a temple. It was built by the grandest Sun King  of the grandest city state  of the grandest civilization of the Americas  the Mayas. His name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil. He stood over six feet tall. He lived into his   s  and he was buried beneath this monument in     AD. And Mayan inscriptions proclaim that he was deeply in love with his wife. So  he built a temple in her honor  facing his. And every spring and autumn  exactly at the equinox  the sun rises behind his temple  and perfectly bathes her temple with his shadow. And as the sun sets behind her temple in the afternoon  it perfectly bathes his temple with her shadow. After       years  these two lovers still touch and kiss from their tomb. Around the world  people love. They sing for love  they dance for love  they compose poems and stories about love. They tell myths and legends about love. They pine for love  they live for love  they kill for love  and they die for love. As Walt Whitman once said  he said   Oh  I would stake all for you.  Anthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in     societies. They've never found a society that did not have it. But love isn't always a happy experience. In one study of college students  they asked a lot of questions about love  but the two that stood out to me the most were   Have you ever been rejected by somebody who you really loved   And the second question was   Have you ever dumped somebody who really loved you   And almost    percent of both men and women said yes to both. Almost nobody gets out of love alive. So  before I start telling you about the brain  I want to read for you what I think is the most powerful love poem on Earth. There's other love poems that are  of course  just as good  but I don't think this one can be surpassed. It was told by an anonymous Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska to a missionary in       and here it is. I've never had the opportunity to say it before.  Fire runs through my body with the pain of loving you. Pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you. Pain like a boil about to burst with my love for you  consumed by fire with my love for you. I remember what you said to me. I am thinking of your love for me. I am torn by your love for me. Pain and more pain    where are you going with my love  I am told you will go from here. I am told you will leave me here. My body is numb with grief. Remember what I said  my love. Goodbye  my love  goodbye.  Emily Dickinson once wrote   Parting is all we need to know of hell.  How many people have suffered in all the millions of years of human evolution  How many people around the world are dancing with elation at this very minute  Romantic love is one of the most powerful sensations on Earth. So  several years ago  I decided to look into the brain and study this madness. Our first study of people who were happily in love has been widely publicized  so I'm only going to say a very little about it. We found activity in a tiny  little factory near the base of the brain called the ventral tegmental area. We found activity in some cells called the A   cells  cells that actually make dopamine  a natural stimulant  and spray it to many brain regions. Indeed  this part  the VTA  is part of the brain's reward system. It's way below your cognitive thinking process. It's below your emotions. It's part of what we call the reptilian core of the brain  associated with wanting  with motivation  with focus and with craving. In fact  the same brain region where we found activity becomes active also when you feel the rush of cocaine. But romantic love is much more than a cocaine high    at least you come down from cocaine. Romantic love is an obsession. It possesses you. You lose your sense of self. You can't stop thinking about another human being. Somebody is camping in your head. As an eighth century Japanese poet said   My longing had no time when it ceases.  Wild is love. And the obsession can get worse when you've been rejected. So  right now  Lucy Brown and I  the neuroscientist on our project  are looking at the data of the people who were put into the machine after they had just been dumped. It was very difficult actually  putting these people in the machine  because they were in such bad shape. So anyway  we found activity in three brain regions. We found activity in the brain region  in exactly the same brain region associated with intense romantic love. What a bad deal. You know  when you've been dumped  the one thing you love to do is just forget about this human being  and then go on with your life    but no  you just love them harder. As the poet Terence  the Roman poet once said  he said   The less my hope  the hotter my love.  And indeed  we now know why. Two thousand years later  we can explain this in the brain. That brain system    the reward system for wanting  for motivation  for craving  for focus    becomes more active when you can't get what you want. In this case  life's greatest prize  an appropriate mating partner. We found activity in other brain regions also    in a brain region associated with calculating gains and losses. You know  you're lying there  you're looking at the picture  and you're in this machine  and you're calculating  you know  what went wrong. How  you know  what have I lost  As a matter of fact  Lucy and I have a little joke about this. It comes from a David Mamet play  and there's two con artists in the play  and the woman is conning the man  and the man looks at the woman and says   Oh  you're a bad pony  I'm not going to bet on you.  And indeed  it's this part of the brain  the core of the nucleus accumbens  actually  that is becoming active as you're measuring your gains and losses. It's also the brain region that becomes active when you're willing to take enormous risks for huge gains and huge losses. Last but not least  we found activity in a brain region associated with deep attachment to another individual. No wonder people suffer around the world  and we have so many crimes of passion. When you've been rejected in love  not only are you engulfed with feelings of romantic love  but you're feeling deep attachment to this individual. Moreover  this brain circuit for reward is working  and you're feeling intense energy  intense focus  intense motivation and the willingness to risk it all to win life's greatest prize. So  what have I learned from this experiment that I would like to tell the world  Foremost  I have come to think that romantic love is a drive  a basic mating drive. Not the sex drive    the sex drive gets you out there  looking for a whole range of partners. Romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy on just one at a time  conserve your mating energy  and start the mating process with this single individual. I think of all the poetry that I've read about romantic love  what sums it up best is something that is said by Plato  over       years ago. He said   The god of love lives in a state of need. It is a need. It is an urge. It is a homeostatic imbalance. Like hunger and thirst  it's almost impossible to stamp out.  I've also come to believe that romantic love is an addiction  a perfectly wonderful addiction when it's going well  and a perfectly horrible addiction when it's going poorly. And indeed  it has all of the characteristics of addiction. You focus on the person  you obsessively think about them  you crave them  you distort reality  your willingness to take enormous risks to win this person. And it's got the three main characteristics of addiction  tolerance  you need to see them more  and more  and more  withdrawals  and last  relapse. I've got a girlfriend who's just getting over a terrible love affair. It's been about eight months  she's beginning to feel better. And she was driving along in her car the other day  and suddenly she heard a song on the car radio that reminded her of this man. And she    not only did the instant craving come back  but she had to pull over from the side of the road and cry. So  one thing I would like the medical community  and the legal community  and even the college community  to see if they can understand  that indeed  romantic love is one of the most addictive substances on Earth. I would also like to tell the world that animals love. There's not an animal on this planet that will copulate with anything that comes along. Too old  too young  too scruffy  too stupid  and they won't do it. Unless you're stuck in a laboratory cage    and you know  if you spend your entire life in a little box  you're not going to be as picky about who you have sex with    but I've looked in a hundred species  and everywhere in the wild  animals have favorites. As a matter of fact ethologists know this. There are over eight words for what they call  animal favoritism   selective proceptivity  mate choice  female choice  sexual choice. And indeed  there are now three academic articles in which they've looked at this attraction  which may only last for a second  but it's a definite attraction  and either this same brain region  this reward system  or the chemicals of that reward system are involved. In fact  I think animal attraction can be instant    you can see an elephant instantly go for another elephant. And I think that this is really the origin of what you and I call  love at first sight.  People have often asked me whether what I know about love has spoiled it for me. And I just simply say   Hardly.  You can know every single ingredient in a piece of chocolate cake  and then when you sit down and eat that cake  you can still feel that joy. And certainly  I make all the same mistakes that everybody else does too  but it's really deepened my understanding and compassion  really  for all human life. As a matter of fact  in New York  I often catch myself looking in baby carriages and feeling a little sorry for the tot. And in fact  sometimes I feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate  when I think of how intense this brain system is. Our newest experiment has been hatched by my colleague  Art Aron    putting people who are reporting that they are still in love  in a long term relationship  into the functional MRI. We've put five people in so far  and indeed  we found exactly the same thing. They're not lying. The brain areas associated with intense romantic love still become active     years later. There are still many questions to be answered and asked about romantic love. The question that I'm working on right this minute    and I'm only going to say it for a second  and then end    is  why do you fall in love with one person  rather than another  I never would have even thought to think of this  but Match.com  the Internet dating site  came to me three years ago and asked me that question. And I said  I don't know. I know what happens in the brain  when you do become in love  but I don't know why you fall in love with one person rather than another. And so  I've spent the last three years on this. And there are many reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another  that psychologists can tell you. And we tend to fall in love with somebody from the same socioeconomic background  the same general level of intelligence  the same general level of good looks  the same religious values. Your childhood certainly plays a role  but nobody knows how. And that's about it  that's all they know. No  they've never found the way two personalities fit together to make a good relationship. So  it began to occur to me that maybe your biology pulls you towards some people rather than another. And I have concocted a questionnaire to see to what degree you express dopamine  serotonin  estrogen and testosterone. I think we've evolved four very broad personality types associated with the ratios of these four chemicals in the brain. And on this dating site that I have created  called Chemistry.com  I ask you first a series of questions to see to what degree you express these chemicals  and I'm watching who chooses who to love. And  .  million people have taken the questionnaire in America. About         people have taken it in    other countries. I'm putting the data together now  and at some point    there will always be magic to love  but I think I will come closer to understanding why it is you can walk into a room and everybody is from your background  your same general level of intelligence  your same general level of good looks  and you don't feel pulled towards all of them. I think there's biology to that. I think we're going to end up  in the next few years  to understand all kinds of brain mechanisms that pull us to one person rather than another. So  I will close with this. These are my older people. Faulkner once said   The past is not dead  it's not even the past.  Indeed  we carry a lot of luggage from our yesteryear in the human brain. And so  there's one thing that makes me pursue my understanding of human nature  and this reminds me of it. These are two women. Women tend to get intimacy differently than men do. Women get intimacy from face to face talking. We swivel towards each other  we do what we call the  anchoring gaze  and we talk. This is intimacy to women. I think it comes from millions of years of holding that baby in front of your face  cajoling it  reprimanding it  educating it with words. Men tend to get intimacy from side by side doing. As soon as one guy looks up  the other guy will look away. I think it comes from millions of years of standing behind that    sitting behind the bush  looking straight ahead  trying to hit that buffalo on the head with a rock. I think  for millions of years  men faced their enemies  they sat side by side with friends. So my final statement is  love is in us. It's deeply embedded in the brain. Our challenge is to understand each other. Thank you. As a clergyman  you can imagine how out of place I feel. I feel like a fish out of water  or maybe an owl out of the air. I was preaching in San Jose some time ago  and my friend Mark Kvamme  who helped introduce me to this conference  brought several CEOs and leaders of some of the companies here in the Silicon Valley to have breakfast with me  or I with them. And I was so stimulated. And had such    it was an eye opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology and science. I know that we're near the end of this conference  and some of you may be wondering why they have a speaker from the field of religion. Richard can answer that  because he made that decision. But some years ago I was on an elevator in Philadelphia  coming down. I was to address a conference at a hotel. And on that elevator a man said   I hear Billy Graham is staying in this hotel.  And another man looked in my direction and said   Yes  there he is. He's on this elevator with us.  And this man looked me up and down for about    seconds  and he said   My  what an anticlimax   I hope that you won't feel that these few moments with me is not a    is an anticlimax  after all these tremendous talks that you've heard  and addresses  which I intend to listen to every one of them. But I was on an airplane in the east some years ago  and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of Charlotte  North Carolina. His name was John Belk. Some of you will probably know him. And there was a drunk man on there  and he got up out of his seat two or three times  and he was making everybody upset by what he was trying to do. And he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by  and everybody was upset with him. And finally  John Belk said   Do you know who's sitting here   And the man said   No  who   He said   It's Billy Graham  the preacher.  He said   You don't say   And he turned to me  and he said   Put her there   He said   Your sermons have certainly helped me.  And I suppose that that's true with thousands of people. I know that as you have been peering into the future  and as we've heard some of it here tonight  I would like to live in that age and see what is going to be. But I won't  because I'm    years old. This is my eightieth year  and I know that my time is brief. I have phlebitis at the moment  in both legs  and that's the reason that I had to have a little help in getting up here  because I have Parkinson's disease in addition to that  and some other problems that I won't talk about. But this is not the first time that we've had a technological revolution. We've had others. And there's one that I want to talk about. In one generation  the nation of the people of Israel had a tremendous and dramatic change that made them a great power in the Near East. A man by the name of David came to the throne  and King David became one of the great leaders of his generation. He was a man of tremendous leadership. He had the favor of God with him. He was a brilliant poet  philosopher  writer  soldier    with strategies in battle and conflict that people study even today. But about two centuries before David  the Hittites had discovered the secret of smelting and processing of iron  and  slowly  that skill spread. But they wouldn't allow the Israelis to look into it  or to have any. But David changed all of that  and he introduced the Iron Age to Israel. And the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron  and which archaeologists have found  that in present day Palestine  there are evidences of that generation. Now  instead of crude tools made of sticks and stones  Israel now had iron plows  and sickles  and hoes and military weapons. And in the course of one generation  Israel was completely changed. The introduction of iron  in some ways  had an impact a little bit like the microchip has had on our generation. And David found that there were many problems that technology could not solve. There were many problems still left. And they're still with us  and you haven't solved them  and I haven't heard anybody here speak to that. How do we solve these three problems that I'd like to mention  The first one that David saw was human evil. Where does it come from  How do we solve it  Over again and again in the Psalms  which Gladstone said was the greatest book in the world  David describes the evils of the human race. And yet he says   He restores my soul.  Have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are  On one hand  we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology  as this conference vividly demonstrates. We've seen under the sea  three miles down  or galaxies hundreds of billions of years out in the future. But on the other hand  something is wrong. Our battleships  our soldiers  are on a frontier now  almost ready to go to war with Iraq. Now  what causes this  Why do we have these wars in every generation  and in every part of the world  And revolutions  We can't get along with other people  even in our own families. We find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self destructive habits we can't break. Racism and injustice and violence sweep our world  bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death. Even the most sophisticated among us seem powerless to break this cycle. I would like to see Oracle take up that  or some other technological geniuses work on this. How do we change man  so that he doesn't lie and cheat  and our newspapers are not filled with stories of fraud in business or labor or athletics or wherever  The Bible says the problem is within us  within our hearts and our souls. Our problem is that we are separated from our Creator  which we call God  and we need to have our souls restored  something only God can do. Jesus said   For out of the heart come evil thoughts  murders  sexual immorality  theft  false testimonies  slander.  The British philosopher Bertrand Russell was not a religious man  but he said   It's in our hearts that the evil lies  and it's from our hearts that it must be plucked out.  Albert Einstein    I was just talking to someone  when I was speaking at Princeton  and I met Mr. Einstein. He didn't have a doctor's degree  because he said nobody was qualified to give him one. But he made this statement. He said   It's easier to denature plutonium than to denature the evil spirit of man.  And many of you  I'm sure  have thought about that and puzzled over it. You've seen people take beneficial technological advances  such as the Internet we've heard about tonight  and twist them into something corrupting. You've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses that bring down whole systems. The Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology  horribly used. The problem is not technology. The problem is the person or persons using it. King David said that he knew the depths of his own soul. He couldn't free himself from personal problems and personal evils that included murder and adultery. Yet King David sought God's forgiveness  and said   You can restore my soul.  You see  the Bible teaches that we're more than a body and a mind. We are a soul. And there's something inside of us that is beyond our understanding. That's the part of us that yearns for God  or something more than we find in technology. Your soul is that part of you that yearns for meaning in life  and which seeks for something beyond this life. It's the part of you that yearns  really  for God. I find  that  young people all over the world are searching for something. They don't know what it is. I speak at many universities  and I have many questions and answer periods  and whether it's Cambridge  or Harvard  or Oxford    I've spoken at all of those universities. I'm going to Harvard in about three or four    no  it's about two months from now    to give a lecture. And I'll be asked the same questions that I was asked the last few times I've been there. And it'll be on these questions  where did I come from  Why am I here  Where am I going  What's life all about  Why am I here  Even if you have no religious belief  there are times when you wonder that there's something else. Thomas Edison also said   When you see everything that happens in the world of science  and in the working of the universe  you cannot deny that there's a captain on the bridge.  I remember once  I sat beside Mrs. Gorbachev at a White House dinner. I went to Ambassador Dobrynin  whom I knew very well. And I'd been to Russia several times under the Communists  and they'd given me marvelous freedom that I didn't expect. And I knew Mr. Dobrynin very well  and I said   I'm going to sit beside Mrs. Gorbachev tonight. What shall I talk to her about   And he surprised me with the answer. He said   Talk to her about religion and philosophy. That's what she's really interested in.  I was a little bit surprised  but that evening that's what we talked about  and it was a stimulating conversation. And afterward  she said   You know  I'm an atheist  but I know that there's something up there higher than we are.  The second problem that King David realized he could not solve was the problem of human suffering. Writing the oldest book in the world was Job  and he said   Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward.  Yes  to be sure  science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering. But I'm    in a few months  I'll be    years of age. I admit that I'm very grateful for all the medical advances that have kept me in relatively good health all these years. My doctors at the Mayo Clinic urged me not to take this trip out here to this    to be here. I haven't given a talk in nearly four months. And when you speak as much as I do  three or four times a day  you get rusty. That's the reason I'm using this podium and using these notes. Every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere  I'm ad libbing. I'm not reading. I never read an address. I never read a speech or a talk or a lecture. I talk ad lib. But tonight  I've got some notes here so that if I begin to forget  which I do sometimes  I've got something I can turn to. But even here among us  most    in the most advanced society in the world  we have poverty. We have families that self destruct  friends that betray us. Unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us. I've never met a person in the world that didn't have a problem or a worry. Why do we suffer  It's an age old question that we haven't answered. Yet David again and again said that he would turn to God. He said   The Lord is my shepherd.  The final problem that David knew he could not solve was death. Many commentators have said that death is the forbidden subject of our generation. Most people live as if they're never going to die. Technology projects the myth of control over our mortality. We see people on our screens. Marilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person  and our    many young people think she's still alive. They don't know that she's dead. Or Clark Gable  or whoever it is. The old stars  they come to life. And they're    they're just as great on that screen as they were in person. But death is inevitable. I spoke some time ago to a joint session of Congress  last year. And we were meeting in that room  the statue room. About     of them were there. And I said   There's one thing that we have in common in this room  all of us together  whether Republican or Democrat  or whoever.  I said   We're all going to die. And we have that in common with all these great men of the past that are staring down at us.  And it's often difficult for young people to understand that. It's difficult for them to understand that they're going to die. As the ancient writer of Ecclesiastes wrote  he said  there's every activity under heaven. There's a time to be born  and there's a time to die. I've stood at the deathbed of several famous people  whom you would know. I've talked to them. I've seen them in those agonizing moments when they were scared to death. And yet  a few years earlier  death never crossed their mind. I talked to a woman this past week whose father was a famous doctor. She said he never thought of God  never talked about God  didn't believe in God. He was an atheist. But she said  as he came to die  he sat up on the side of the bed one day  and he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain. And he said  for the first time in his life he'd thought about the inevitable  and about God. Was there a God  A few years ago  a university student asked me   What is the greatest surprise in your life   And I said   The greatest surprise in my life is the brevity of life. It passes so fast.  But it does not need to have to be that way. Wernher von Braun  in the aftermath of World War II concluded  quote   science and religion are not antagonists. On the contrary  they're sisters.  He put it on a personal basis. I knew Dr. von Braun very well. And he said   Speaking for myself  I can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos serves only to confirm a belief in the certainty of a creator.  He also said   In our search to know God  I've come to believe that the life of Jesus Christ should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration. The reality of this life and His resurrection is the hope of mankind.  I've done a lot of speaking in Germany and in France  and in different parts of the world        countries it's been my privilege to speak in. And I was invited one day to visit Chancellor Adenauer  who was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern Germany  since the war. And he once    and he said to me  he said   Young man.  He said   Do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ   And I said   Sir  I do.  He said   So do I.  He said   When I leave office  I'm going to spend my time writing a book on why Jesus Christ rose again  and why it's so important to believe that.  In one of his plays  Alexander Solzhenitsyn depicts a man dying  who says to those gathered around his bed   The moment when it's terrible to feel regret is when one is dying.  How should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying  Blaise Pascal asked exactly that question in seventeenth century France. Pascal has been called the architect of modern civilization. He was a brilliant scientist at the frontiers of mathematics  even as a teenager. He is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory  and a creator of the first model of a computer. And of course  you are all familiar with the computer language named for him. Pascal explored in depth our human dilemmas of evil  suffering and death. He was astounded at the phenomenon we've been considering  that people can achieve extraordinary heights in science  the arts and human enterprise  yet they also are full of anger  hypocrisy and have    and self hatreds. Pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and self delusion. On November           Pascal had a profound religious experience. He wrote in his journal these words   I submit myself  absolutely  to Jesus Christ  my redeemer.  A French historian said  two centuries later   Seldom has so mighty an intellect submitted with such humility to the authority of Jesus Christ.  Pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God could bring us back into harmony  but he believed that his own sins and failures could be forgiven  and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven. He experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason. It was he who penned the well known words   The heart has its reasons  which reason knows not of.  Equally well known is Pascal's Wager. Essentially  he said this   if you bet on God  and open yourself to his love  you lose nothing  even if you're wrong. But if instead you bet that there is no God  then you can lose it all  in this life and the life to come.  For Pascal  scientific knowledge paled beside the knowledge of God. The knowledge of God was far beyond anything that ever crossed his mind. He was ready to face him when he died at the age of   . King David lived to be     a long time in his era. Yet he too had to face death  and he wrote these words   even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death  I will fear no evil  for you are with me.  This was David's answer to three dilemmas of evil  suffering and death. It can be yours  as well  as you seek the living God and allow him to fill your life and give you hope for the future. When I was    years of age  I was born and reared on a farm in North Carolina. I milked cows every morning  and I had to milk the same cows every evening when I came home from school. And there were    of them that I had    that I was responsible for  and I worked on the farm and tried to keep up with my studies. I didn't make good grades in high school. I didn't make them in college  until something happened in my heart. One day  I was faced face to face with Christ. He said   I am the way  the truth and the life.  Can you imagine that   I am the truth. I'm the embodiment of all truth.  He was a liar. Or he was insane. Or he was what he claimed to be. Which was he  I had to make that decision. I couldn't prove it. I couldn't take it to a laboratory and experiment with it. But by faith I said  I believe him  and he came into my heart and changed my life. And now I'm ready  when I hear that call  to go into the presence of God. Thank you  and God bless all of you. Thank you for the privilege. It was great. Richard Wurman  You did it. Thanks. I thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write. And I like to immerse myself in my topics. I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig. And I see my life as a series of experiments. So  I work for Esquire magazine  and a couple of years ago  I wrote an article called  My Outsourced Life   where I hired a team of people in Bangalore  India  to live my life for me. So  they answered my emails. They answered my phone. They argued with my wife for me  and they read my son bedtime stories. It was the best month of my life  because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies. It was a wonderful experience. More recently  I wrote an article for Esquire called    about radical honesty. And this is a movement where    this is started by a psychologist in Virginia  who says that you should never  ever lie  except maybe during poker and golf  his only exceptions. And  more than that  whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth. So  I decided I would try this for a month. This was the worst month of my life. I do not recommend this at all. To give you a sense of the experience  the article was called   I Think You're Fat.  So  that was hard. My most recent book    my previous book was called  The Know It All   and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world  or more precisely from Aak  which is a type of East Asian music  all the way to Zwyiec  which is    well  I don't want to ruin the ending. It's a very exciting twist ending  like an O. Henry novel  so I won't ruin it. But I love that one  because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could absorb. Although  listening to Kevin Kelly  you don't have to remember anything. You can just Google it. So  I wasted some time there. I love those experiments  but I think that the most profound and life changing experiment that I've done is my most recent experiment  where I spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the Bible   The Year of Living Biblically.  And I undertook this for two reasons. The first was that I grew up with no religion at all. As I say in my book  I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian. So  not very. But I've become increasingly interested in religion. I do think it's the defining issue of our time  or one of the main ones. And I have a son. I want to know what to teach him. So  I decided to dive in head first  and try to live the Bible. The second reason I undertook this is because I'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism  religious fundamentalism  and people who say they take the Bible literally  which is  according to some polls  as high as    or    percent of America. So I decided  what if you really did take the Bible literally  I decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the Bible literally  without picking and choosing. The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles. I had Christian bibles. I had Jewish bibles. A friend of mine sent me something called a hip hop bible  where the twenty third Psalm is rendered as   The Lord is all that   as opposed to what I knew it as   The Lord is my shepherd.  Then I went down and I read several versions  and I wrote down every single law that I could find. And this was a very long list    over     rules. And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of    The Ten Commandments  love your neighbor  be fruitful and multiply. So I wanted to follow those. And actually  I take my projects very seriously  because I had twins during my year  so I definitely take my projects seriously. But I also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible. There is the law in Leviticus   You cannot shave the corners of your beard.  I didn't know where my corners were  so I decided to let the whole thing grow  and this is what I looked like by the end. As you can imagine  I spent a lot of time at airport security. My wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months. So  certainly the challenge was there. The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers  so I thought   Sounds strange  but I'll try it.  You only know if you try it. I got rid of all my poly cotton T shirts. The Bible says that if two men are in a fight  and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man  then her hand shall be cut off. So  I wanted to follow that rule. That one I followed by default  by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby  looking like she had a strong grip. So    oh  there's another shot of my beard. I will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing  and incredibly challenging. And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging. The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day. You know  I could spend a year not killing  but spending a year not gossiping  not coveting  not lying    you know  I live in New York  and I work as a journalist  so this was        percent of my day I had to do it. But it was really interesting  because I was able to make some progress  because I couldn't believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts. This was one of the huge lessons of the year  is that I almost pretended to be a better person  and I became a little bit of a better person. So I had always thought  you know   You change your mind  and you change your behavior   but it's often the other way around. You change your behavior  and you change your mind. So  you know  if you want to become more compassionate  you visit sick people in the hospital  and you will become more compassionate. You donate money to a cause  and you become emotionally involved in that cause. So  it really was cognitive psychology    you know  cognitive dissonance    that I was experiencing. The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology  very primitive cognitive psychology. In the Proverbs  it says that if you smile  you will become happier  which  as we know  is actually true. The second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty first century America. And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers. But it's a big part of the Bible  so I figured I had to address it. So  I was able to stone one adulterer. It happened    I was in the park  and I was dressed in my biblical clothing  so sandals and sort of a white robe  you know  because again  the outer affects the inner. I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind. And this man came up to me and he said   Why are you dressed like that   And I explained my project  and he said   Well  I am an adulterer  are you going to stone me   And I said   Well  that would be great   And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket that I had been carrying around for weeks  hoping for just this interaction    and  you know  they were pebbles    but he grabbed them out of my hand. He was actually an elderly man  mid   s  just so you know. But he's still an adulterer  and still quite angry. He grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face  and I felt that I could    eye for an eye    I could retaliate  and throw one back at him. So that was my experience stoning  and it did allow me to talk about  in a more serious way  these big issues. How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places  and yet so incredibly wise in others  How should we view the Bible  Should we view it  you know  as original intent  like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible  How was the Bible written  And actually  since this is a tech crowd  I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me of the Wikipedia  because it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years. And it's sort of evolved. It's not a book that was written and came down from on high. So I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take aways  the bigger lessons that I learned from my year. The first is  thou shalt not take the Bible literally. This became very  very clear  early on. Because if you do  then you end up acting like a crazy person  and stoning adulterers  or    here's another example. Well  that's another. I did spend some time shepherding. It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it. But this one is    the Bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month  and more than that  you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat. And my wife thought this was very offensive  so she sat in every seat in our apartment  and I had to spend much of the year standing until I bought my own seat and carried it around. So  you know  I met with creationists. I went to the creationists' museum. And these are the ultimate literalists. And it was fascinating  because they were not stupid people at all. I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist. It's just that their faith is so strong in this literal interpretation of the Bible that they distort all the data to fit their model. And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this. And I will say  though  the museum is gorgeous. They really did a fantastic job. If you're ever in Kentucky  there's  you can see a movie of the flood  and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes. So  whatever you think of creationism    and I think it's crazy    they did a great job. Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks. And this one was a big lesson because I was praying  giving these prayers of thanksgiving  which was odd for an agnostic. But I was saying thanks all the time  every day  and I started to change my perspective. And I started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day  that I didn't even notice  that I took for granted  as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong. So  this is actually a key to happiness for me  is to just remember when I came over here  the car didn't flip over  and I didn't trip coming up the stairs. It's a remarkable thing. Third  that thou shall have reverence. This one was unexpected because I started the year as an agnostic  and by the end of the year  I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic  which I love. And I'm trying to start it as a movement. So  if anyone wants to join  the basic idea is  whether or not there is a God  there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness  and that our rituals can be sacred. The Sabbath can be sacred. This was one of the great things about my year  doing the Sabbath  because I am a workaholic  so having this one day where you cannot work  it really  that changed my life. So  this idea of sacredness  whether or not there is a God. Thou shall not stereotype. This one happened because I spent a lot of time with various religious communities throughout America because I wanted it to be more than about my journey. I wanted it to be about religion in America. So  I spent time with evangelical Christians  and Hasidic Jews  and the Amish. I'm very proud because I think I'm the only person in America to out Bible talk a Jehovah's Witness. After three and a half hours  he looked at his watch  he's like   I gotta go.  Oh  thank you very much. Thank you. Bless you  bless you. But it was interesting because I had some very preconceived notions about  for instance  evangelical Christianity  and I found that it's such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it. There's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians  and they focus on the red words in the Bible  which are the ones that Jesus spoke. That's how they printed them in the old Bibles. And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality. They have a pamphlet that says   Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality   and you open it up  and there's nothing in it. So  they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts  helping poor people. So  this was very inspiring to me. I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo. They're very inspiring leaders  even though I disagree with much of what they say. Also  thou shalt not disregard the irrational. This one was very unexpected because  you know  I grew up with the scientific worldview  and I was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces. And the thing is  if they're not harmful  they're not to be completely dismissed. Because I learned that    I was thinking  I was doing all these rituals  these biblical rituals  separating my wool and linen  and I would ask these religious people  Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this  Why would God care   And they said   We don't know  but it's just rituals that give us meaning.  And I would say   But that's crazy.  And they would say   Well  what about you  You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake. If a guy from Mars came down and saw  here's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics  would the Martians say  'Well  that guy  he makes sense  but that guy's crazy '  So no  I think that rituals are  by nature  irrational. So the key is to choose the right rituals  the ones that are not harmful    but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed. And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose. And this one I learned because I tried to follow everything in the Bible. And I failed miserably. Because you can't. You have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible is going to be picking and choosing. The key is to pick and choose the right parts. There's the phrase called cafeteria religion  and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way  and they'll say   Oh  it's just cafeteria religion. You're just picking and choosing.  But my argument is   What's wrong with cafeterias   I've had some great meals at cafeterias. I've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave. So  it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion  about tolerance  about loving your neighbor  as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin  or intolerance  or violence  which are very much in the Bible as well. So if we are to find any meaning in this book  then we have to really engage it  and wrestle with it. And I thought I'd end with just a couple more. There's me reading the Bible. That's how I hailed taxicabs. Seriously  and it worked. And yes  that was actually a rented sheep  so I had to return that in the morning  but it served well for a day. So  anyway  thank you so much for letting me speak. Brain magic. What's brain magic all about  Brain magic to me indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind reading effects. So unlike traditional magic  it uses the power of words  linguistic deception  non verbal communication and various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense. I'm going to show you all how easy it is to manipulate the human mind once you know how. I want everybody downstairs also to join in with me and everybody. I want everybody to put out your hands like this for me  first of all. OK  clap them together  once. OK  reverse your hands. Now  follow my actions exactly. Now about half the audience has their left hand up. Why is that  OK  swap them around  put your right hand up. Cross your hands over  so your right hand goes over  interlace your fingers like this  then make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb    that's very important. Yours is the other way around  so swap it around. Excellent  OK. Extend your fingers like this for me. All right. Tap them together once. OK  now  if you did not allow me to deceive your minds  you would all be able to do this. Now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind  once you know how. Now  I remember when I was about     I read a copy of Life magazine  which detailed a story about a    year old blind Russian woman who could sense printed letters    there's still people trying to do it       who could sense printed letters and even sense colors  just by touch. And she was completely blind. She could also read the serial numbers on bills when they were placed  face down  on a hard surface. Now  I was fascinated  but at the same time  skeptical. How could somebody read using their fingertips  You know  if you actually think about it  if somebody is totally blind    a guy yesterday did a demonstration in one of the rooms  where people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things. And it's just a really weird thing to try and figure out. How could somebody read using their fingertips  Now earlier on  as part of a TV show that I have coming up on MTV  I attempted to give a similar demonstration of what is now known as second sight. So  let's take a look. I'm going to guide you into the car. Kathryn Thomas   Laughter  Man  You're OK  keep on going. KT  How are you  Keith Barry  Kathryn  it's Keith here. I'm going to take you to a secret location  OK  Kathryn  there was no way you could see through that blindfold. KT  OK  but don't say my name like that. KB  But you're OK  KT  Yes. KB  No way to see through it  KT  No. KB  I'll take it off. Do you want to take the rest off  Take it off  you're OK. We'll stop for a second. KT  I'm so afraid of what I'm going to see. KB  You're fine  take it off. You're OK. You're safe. Have you ever heard of second sight  KT  No. KB  Second sight is whereby a mind control expert can see through somebody else's eyes. And I'm going to try that right now. KT  God. KB  Are you ready  Where is it  There's no way    KT   Beep  KT  Oh  my God  KB  Don't say anything  I'm trying to see through your eyes. I can't see. KT  There's a wall  there's a wall. KB  Look at the road  look at the road. KT  OK  OK  OK. Oh  my God  KB  Now  anything coming at all  KT  No. KB  Sure there's not  KT  No  no  I'm just still looking at the road. I'm looking at the road  all the time. I'm not taking my eyes off the road. KT  Oh  my God  KB  Where are we  Where are we  We're going uphill  are we going uphill  KT  Look at the road     Beep  Still got that goddamn blindfold on. KB  What  KT  How are you doing this  KB  Just don't break my concentration. We're OK  though  KT  Yes. That's so weird. We're nearly there. Oh  my God  Oh  my God  KB  And I've stopped. KT  That is weird. You're like a freak ass of nature. That was the most scary thing I've ever done in my life  KB  Thank you. By the way  two days ago  we were going to film this down there  at the race course  and we got a guy into a car  and we got a camera man in the back  but halfway through the drive  he told me he had  I think it was a nine millimeter  stuck to his leg. So  I stopped pretty quick  and that was it. So  do you believe it's possible to see through somebody else's eyes  That's the question. Now  most people here would automatically say no. OK  but I want you to realize some facts. I couldn't see through the blindfold. The car was not gimmicked or tricked in any way. The girl  I'd never met before  all right. So  I want you to just think about it for a moment. A lot of people try to come up with a logical solution to what just happened  all right. But because your brains are not trained in the art of deception  the solutions you come up with will     percent of the time  be way off the mark. This is because magic is all about directing attention. If  for instance  I didn't want you to look at my right hand  then I don't look at it. But if I wanted you to look at my right hand  then I look at it  too. You see  it's very simple  once you know how  but very complicated in other ways. I'm going to give you some demonstrations right now. I need two people to help me out real quick. Can you come up  And let's see  down at the end  here  can you also come up  real quick  Do you mind  Yes  at the end. OK  give them a round of applause as they come up. You might want to use the stairs  there. It's very important for everybody here to realize I haven't set anything up with you. You don't know what will happen  right  Would you mind just standing over here for a moment  Your name is  Nicole  Nicole. KB  Nicole  and  KB  Actually  here's the thing  answer it  answer it  answer it. Is it a girl  Man  They've already gone. KB  OK  swap over positions. Can you stand over here  This will make it easier. Pity  I would have told them it was the ace of spades. OK  a little bit closer. OK  a little bit closer  come over    they look really nervous up here. Do you believe in witchcraft  Nicole  No. KB  Voodoo  Nicole  No. KB  Things that go bump in the night  Nicole  No. KB  Besides  who's next  no  OK. I want you to just stand exactly like this for me  pull up your sleeves  if you don't mind. OK  now  I want you to be aware of all the different sensations around you  because we'll try a voodoo experiment. I want you to be aware of the sensations  but don't say anything until I ask you  and don't open your eyes until I ask you. From this point onwards  close your eyes  do not say anything  do not open them  be aware of the sensations. Yes or no  did you feel anything  Nicole  Yes. KB  You did feel that  What did you feel  Nicole  A touch on my back. KB  How many times did you feel it  Nicole  Twice. KB  Twice. OK  extend your left arm out in front of you. Extend your left arm  OK. OK  keep it there. Be aware of the sensations  don't say anything  don't open your eyes  OK. Did you feel anything  there  Nicole  Yes. KB  What did you feel  Nicole  Three    KB  Like a tickling sensation  Nicole  Yes. KB  Can you show us where  OK  excellent. Open your eyes. I never touched you. I just touched his back  and I just touched his arm. A voodoo experiment. Yeah  I walk around nightclubs all night like this. You just take a seat over here for a second. I'm going to use you again  in a moment. Can you take a seat right over here  if you don't mind. Sit right here. Man  OK. KB  OK  take a seat. Excellent  OK. Now  what I want you to do is look directly at me  OK  just take a deep breath in through your nose  letting it out through your mouth  and relax. Allow your eyes to close  on five  four  three  two  one. Close your eyes right now. OK  now  I'm not hypnotizing you  I'm merely placing you in a heightened state of synchronicity  so our minds are along the same lines. And as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind  I'm going to take your left hand  and just place it up here. I want you to hold it there just for a moment  and I only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness  and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop. That's it  all the way down  all the way down. and further  and further. Excellent. I want you to allow your hand to stick firmly to the tabletop. OK  now  allow it to stay there. OK  now  in a moment  you'll feel a certain pressure  OK  and I want you to be aware of the pressure. Just be aware of the pressure. And I only want you to allow your hand to float slowly back up from the tabletop as you feel the pressure release  but only when you feel the pressure release. Do you understand  Just answer yes or no. Man  Yes. KB  Hold it right there. And only when you feel the pressure go back  allow your hand to drift back to the tabletop  but only when you feel the pressure. OK  that was wonderfully done. Let's try it again. Excellent. Now that you've got the idea  let's try something even more interesting. Allow it to stick firmly to the tabletop  keep your eyes closed. Can you stand up  Just stand  stage forward. I want you to point directly at his forehead. OK. Imagine a connection between you and him. Only when you want the pressure to be released  make an upward gesture  like this  but only when you want it to be released. You can wait as long as you want  but only when you want the pressure released. OK  let's try it again. OK  now  imagine the connection  OK. Point directly at his forehead. Only when you want the pressure released  we'll try it again. OK  it worked that time  excellent. And hold it there  both of you. Only when you want the pressure to go back  make a downward gesture. You can wait as long as you want. You did it pretty quickly  but it went down  OK. Now  I want you to be aware that in a moment  when I snap my fingers  your eyes will open  again. It's OK to remember to forget  or forget to remember what happened. Most people ask you   What the hell just happened up here   But it's OK that even though you're not hypnotized  you will forget everything that happened. On five  four  three  two  one    open your eyes  wide awake. Give them a round of applause  as they go back to their seats. OK  you can go back. I once saw a film called  The Gods Are Crazy.  Has anybody here seen that film  Yeah. Remember when they threw the Coke out of the airplane  and it landed on the ground  and it didn't break  Now  see  that's because Coke bottles are solid. It's nearly impossible to break a Coke bottle. Do you want to try it  Good job. She's not taking any chances. You see  psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes. For some magicians or mentalists  sometimes the spoon will bend or melt  sometimes it will not. Sometimes the object will slide across the table  sometimes it will not. It depends on how much energy you have that day  so on and so forth. We're going to try an experiment in psychokinesis  right now. Come right over here  next to me. Excellent. Now  have a look at the Coke bottle. Make sure it is solid  there's only one hole  and it's a normal Coke bottle. And you can whack it against the table  if you want  be careful. Even though it's solid  I'm standing away. I want you to pinch right here with two fingers and your thumb. Excellent. Now  I've got a shard of glass here  OK. I want you to examine the shard of glass. Careful  it's sharp. Just hold on to it for a moment. Now  hold it out here. I want you to imagine  right now  a broken relationship from many years ago. I want you to imagine all the negative energy from that broken relationship  from that guy  being imparted into the broken piece of glass  which will represent him  OK. But I want you to take this very seriously. Stare at the glass  ignore everybody right here. In a moment  you'll feel a certain sensation  OK  and when you feel that sensation  I want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle. Think of that guy  that ba    that guy. I'm trying to be good here. OK  and when you feel the sensation    it might take a while    drop it into the glass. OK  drop it in. Now  imagine all that negative energy in there. Imagine his name and imagine him inside the glass. And I want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side. That was a lot of negative energy  built up in there. I also want you to look at me and think of his name. OK  think of how many letters in the title of his name. There's five letters in the title. You didn't react to that  so it's four letters. Think of one of the letters in the title. There's a K in his name  there is a K. I knew that because my name starts with a K also  but his name doesn't start with a K  it starts with an M. Tell Mike I said hello  the next time you see him. Was that his name  Nicole  Mm hmm. KB  OK  give her a round of applause. Thank you. I've got one more thing to share with you right now. Actually  Chris  I was going to pick you for this  but instead of picking you  can you hop up here and pick a victim for this next experiment  And it should be a male victim  that's the only thing. Chris Anderson  Oh  OK. KB  I was going to use you  but I decided I might want to come back another year. CA  Well  to reward him for saying  eureka   and for selecting Michael Mercil to come and talk to us    Steve Jurvetson. KB  OK  Steve  come on up here. CA  You knew  KB  OK  Steve  I want you to take a seat  right behind here. Excellent. Now  Steve    oh  you can check underneath. Go ahead  I've no fancy assistants underneath there. They insist that because I was a magician  put a nice  black tablecloth on. There you are  OK. I've got four wooden plinths here  Steve. One  two  three and four. Now  they're all the exact same except this one obviously has a stainless steel spike sticking out of it. I want you to examine it  and make sure it's solid. Happy  Steve Jurvetson  Mmm  yes. KB  OK. Now  Steve  I'm going to stand in front of the table  When I stand in front of the table  I want you to put the cups on the plinths  in any order you want  and then mix them all up  so nobody has any idea where the spike is  all right  SJ  No one in the audience  KB  Yes  and just to help you out  I'll block them from view  so nobody can see what you're doing. I'll also look away. So  go ahead and mix them up  now. OK  and tell me when you're done. KB  You done  SJ  Almost. KB  Almost  oh. OK  you're making sure that's well hidden. Oh  we've got one here  we've got one here. So  all right  we'll leave them like that. I'm going to have the last laugh  though. Now  Steve  you know where the spike is  but nobody else  does  Correct  But I don't want you to know either  so swivel around on your chair. They'll keep an eye on me to make sure I don't do anything funny. No  stay around  OK. Now  Steve  look back. Now you don't know where the spike is  and I don't know where it is either. Now  is there any way to see through this blindfold  SJ  Put this on  KB  No  just  is there any way to see through it  No  SJ  No  I can't see through it. KB  Excellent. Now  I'm going to put on the blindfold. Don't stack them up  OK. Give them an extra mix up. Don't move the cups  I don't want anybody to see where the spike is  but give the plinths an extra mix up  and then line them up. I'll put the blindfold on. Give them an extra mix up. No messing around this time. OK  go ahead  mix them up. My hand is at risk here. Tell me when you're done. SJ  Done. KB  OK  where are you  Put out your hand. Your right hand. Tell me when I'm over a cup. SJ  You're over a cup. KB  I'm over a cup  right now  SJ  Mm hmm. KB  Now  Steve  do you think it's here  Yes or no  SJ  Oh  KB  I told you I'd have the last laugh. SJ  I don't think it's there. KB  No  Good decision. Now  if I go this way  is there another cup over here  SJ  Can we do the left hand  KB  Oh  no  no  no. He asked me could he do the left hand. Absolutely not. KB  If I go this way  is there another cup  SJ  Yes. KB  Tell me when to stop. SJ  OK. KB  There  SJ  Yes  there's one. KB  OK. Do you think it's here  yes or no  This is your decision  not mine. SJ  I'm going to say no. KB  Good decision. OK  give me both hands. Now  put them on both cups. Do you think the spike is under your left or your right hand  SJ  Neither. KB  Neither  oh  OK. But if you were to guess. SJ  Under my right hand. KB  Under your right hand  Now  remember  you made all the decisions all along. Psychologists  figure this out. Have a look. SJ  Oh  KB  Thank you. If anybody wants to see some sleight of hand later on  I'll be outside. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. When I was president of the American Psychological Association  they tried to media train me  and an encounter I had with CNN summarizes what I'm going to be talking about today  which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic. The editor of Discover told us    of them  I'm going to give you the eleventh. So they came to me    CNN    and they said   Professor Seligman  would you tell us about the state of psychology today  We'd like to interview you about that.  And I said   Great.  And she said   But this is CNN  so you only get a sound bite.  So I said   Well  how many words do I get   And she said   Well  one.  And cameras rolled  and she said   Professor Seligman  what is the state of psychology today    Good.   Cut. Cut. That won't do. We'd really better give you a longer sound bite.   Well  how many words do I get this time    I think  well  you get two. Doctor Seligman  what is the state of psychology today    Not good.   Look  Doctor Seligman  we can see you're really not comfortable in this medium. We'd better give you a real sound bite. This time you can have three words. Professor Seligman  what is the state of psychology today    Not good enough.  And that's what I'm going to be talking about. I want to say why psychology was good  why it was not good and how it may become  in the next    years  good enough. And by parallel summary  I want to say the same thing about technology  about entertainment and design  because I think the issues are very similar. So  why was psychology good  Well  for more than    years  psychology worked within the disease model. Ten years ago  when I was on an airplane and I introduced myself to my seatmate  and told them what I did  they'd move away from me. And because  quite rightly  they were saying psychology is about finding what's wrong with you. Spot the loony. And now  when I tell people what I do  they move toward me. And what was good about psychology  about the    billion dollar investment NIMH made  about working in the disease model  about what you mean by psychology  is that     years ago  none of the disorders were treatable    it was entirely smoke and mirrors. And now     of the disorders are treatable  two of them actually curable. And the other thing that happened is that a science developed  a science of mental illness. That we found out that we could take fuzzy concepts    like depression  alcoholism    and measure them with rigor. That we could create a classification of the mental illnesses. That we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses. We could look across time at the same people    people  for example  who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia    and ask what the contribution of mothering  of genetics are  and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses. And best of all  we were able  in the last    years  to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments. And then we were able to test them rigorously  in random assignment  placebo controlled designs  throw out the things that didn't work  keep the things that actively did. And the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry  over the last    years  can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable. And I think that's terrific. I'm proud of it. But what was not good  the consequences of that were three things. The first was moral  that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists  pathologizers  that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble  bricks fell on you. And we forgot that people made choices and decisions. We forgot responsibility. That was the first cost. The second cost was that we forgot about you people. We forgot about improving normal lives. We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier  more fulfilled  more productive. And  genius    high talent   became a dirty word. No one works on that. And the third problem about the disease model is  in our rush to do something about people in trouble  in our rush to do something about repairing damage  it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier  positive interventions. So that was not good. And so  that's what led people like Nancy Etcoff  Dan Gilbert  Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call positive psychology  which has three aims. The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness. It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage. It should be interested in the best things in life. And it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling  and with genius  with nurturing high talent. So in the last    years and the hope for the future  we've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology  a science of what makes life worth living. It turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness. And any of you  for free  can go to that website and take the entire panoply of tests of happiness. You can ask  how do you stack up for positive emotion  for meaning  for flow  against literally tens of thousands of other people  We created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities  a classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex ratio  how they're defined  how to diagnose them  what builds them and what gets in their way. We found that we could discover the causation of the positive states  the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity as a cause of happiness. I've spent my life working on extremely miserable people  and I've asked the question  how do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you  And starting about six years ago  we asked about extremely happy people. And how do they differ from the rest of us  And it turns out there's one way. They're not more religious  they're not in better shape  they don't have more money  they're not better looking  they don't have more good events and fewer bad events. The one way in which they differ  they're extremely social. They don't sit in seminars on Saturday morning. They don't spend time alone. Each of them is in a romantic relationship and each has a rich repertoire of friends. But watch out here. This is merely correlational data  not causal  and it's about happiness in the first Hollywood sense I'm going to talk about  happiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer. And I'm going to suggest to you that's not nearly enough  in just a moment. We found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries  from the Buddha to Tony Robbins. About     interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy. And we find that we've been able to manualize many of them  and we actually carry out random assignment efficacy and effectiveness studies. That is  which ones actually make people lastingly happier  In a couple of minutes  I'll tell you about some of those results. But the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have  in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill  and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable  is can psychology actually make people happier  And to ask that question    happy is not a word I use very much    we've had to break it down into what I think is askable about happy. And I believe there are three different    and I call them different because different interventions build them  it's possible to have one rather than the other    three different happy lives. The first happy life is the pleasant life. This is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can  and the skills to amplify it. The second is a life of engagement    a life in your work  your parenting  your love  your leisure  time stops for you. That's what Aristotle was talking about. And third  the meaningful life. So I want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them. The first life is the pleasant life and it's simply  as best we can find it  it's having as many of the pleasures as you can  as much positive emotion as you can  and learning the skills    savoring  mindfulness    that amplify them  that stretch them over time and space. But the pleasant life has three drawbacks  and it's why positive psychology is not happy ology and why it doesn't end here. The first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life  your experience of positive emotion  is heritable  about    percent heritable  and  in fact  not very modifiable. So the different tricks that Matthieu  Ricard  and I and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are    to    percent tricks  getting more of it. Second is that positive emotion habituates. It habituates rapidly  indeed. It's all like French vanilla ice cream  the first taste is a     percent  by the time you're down to the sixth taste  it's gone. And  as I said  it's not particularly malleable. And this leads to the second life. And I have to tell you about my friend  Len  to talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion  more than building pleasure. In two of the three great arenas of life  by the time Len was     Len was enormously successful. The first arena was work. By the time he was     he was an options trader. By the time he was     he was a multimillionaire and the head of an options trading company. Second  in play    he's a national champion bridge player. But in the third great arena of life  love  Len is an abysmal failure. And the reason he was  was that Len is a cold fish. Len is an introvert. American women said to Len  when he dated them   You're no fun. You don't have positive emotion. Get lost.  And Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst  who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him. But it turned out there wasn't any sexual trauma. It turned out that    Len grew up in Long Island and he played football and watched football  and played bridge    Len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities. The question is  is Len unhappy  And I want to say not. Contrary to what psychology told us about the bottom    percent of the human race in positive affectivity  I think Len is one of the happiest people I know. He's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness and that's because Len  like most of you  is enormously capable of flow. When he walks onto the floor of the American Exchange at      in the morning  time stops for him. And it stops till the closing bell. When the first card is played  until    days later  the tournament is over  time stops for Len. And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about  about flow. And it's distinct from pleasure in a very important way. Pleasure has raw feels  you know it's happening. It's thought and feeling. But what Mike told you yesterday    during flow  you can't feel anything. You're one with the music. Time stops. You have intense concentration. And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life. And we think there's a recipe for it  and it's knowing what your highest strengths are. And again  there's a valid test of what your five highest strengths are. And then re crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can. Re crafting your work  your love  your play  your friendship  your parenting. Just one example. One person I worked with was a bagger at Genuardi's. Hated the job. She's working her way through college. Her highest strength was social intelligence  so she re crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer's day. Now obviously she failed. But what she did was to take her highest strengths  and re craft work to use them as much as possible. What you get out of that is not smiley ness. You don't look like Debbie Reynolds. You don't giggle a lot. What you get is more absorption. So  that's the second path. The first path  positive emotion. The second path is eudaimonian flow. And the third path is meaning. This is the most venerable of the happinesses  traditionally. And meaning  in this view  consists of    very parallel to eudaimonia    it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are  and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are. I mentioned that for all three kinds of lives  the pleasant life  the good life  the meaningful life  people are now hard at work on the question  are there things that lastingly change those lives  And the answer seems to be yes. And I'll just give you some samples of it. It's being done in a rigorous manner. It's being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works. So we do random assignment  placebo controlled  long term studies of different interventions. And just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect  when we teach people about the pleasant life  how to have more pleasure in your life  one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills  the savoring skills  and you're assigned to design a beautiful day. Next Saturday  set a day aside  design yourself a beautiful day  and use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures. And we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced. Gratitude visit. I want you all to do this with me now  if you would. Close your eyes. I'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction  and who you never properly thanked. The person has to be alive. OK. Now  OK  you can open your eyes. I hope all of you have such a person. Your assignment  when you're learning the gratitude visit  is to write a     word testimonial to that person  call them on the phone in Phoenix  ask if you can visit  don't tell them why  show up at their door  you read the testimonial    everyone weeps when this happens. And what happens is when we test people one week later  a month later  three months later  they're both happier and less depressed. Another example is a strength date  in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test  and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths  and we find this is a strengthener of relationships. And fun versus philanthropy. But it's so heartening to be in a group like this  in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy. Well  my undergraduates and the people I work with haven't discovered this  so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun  and to contrast it. And what you find is when you do something fun  it has a square wave walk set. When you do something philanthropic to help another person  it lasts and it lasts. So those are examples of positive interventions. So  the next to last thing I want to say is we're interested in how much life satisfaction people have. And this is really what you're about. And that's our target variable. And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives  how much life satisfaction do you get  So we ask    and we've done this in    replications involving thousands of people    to what extent does the pursuit of pleasure  the pursuit of positive emotion  the pleasant life  the pursuit of engagement  time stopping for you  and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction  And our results surprised us  but they were backward of what we thought. It turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction. The pursuit of meaning is the strongest. The pursuit of engagement is also very strong. Where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement and you have meaning  then pleasure's the whipped cream and the cherry. Which is to say  the full life    the sum is greater than the parts  if you've got all three. Conversely  if you have none of the three  the empty life  the sum is less than the parts. And what we're asking now is does the very same relationship  physical health  morbidity  how long you live and productivity  follow the same relationship  That is  in a corporation  is productivity a function of positive emotion  engagement and meaning  Is health a function of positive engagement  of pleasure  and of meaning in life  And there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes. So  Chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard  and so this was amazing for me. I've never been in a gathering like this. I've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much  which was one of the remarkable things. But I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel to the problems of technology  entertainment and design in the following way. We all know that technology  entertainment and design have been and can be used for destructive purposes. We also know that technology  entertainment and design can be used to relieve misery. And by the way  the distinction between relieving misery and building happiness is extremely important. I thought  when I first became a therapist    years ago  that if I was good enough to make someone not depressed  not anxious  not angry  that I'd make them happy. And I never found that. I found the best you could ever do was to get to zero. But they were empty. And it turns out the skills of happiness  the skills of the pleasant life  the skills of engagement  the skills of meaning  are different from the skills of relieving misery. And so  the parallel thing holds with technology  entertainment and design  I believe. That is  it is possible for these three drivers of our world to increase happiness  to increase positive emotion  and that's typically how they've been used. But once you fractionate happiness the way I do    not just positive emotion  that's not nearly enough    there's flow in life  and there's meaning in life. As Laura Lee told us  design  and  I believe  entertainment and technology  can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well. So in conclusion  the eleventh reason for optimism  in addition to the space elevator  is that I think with technology  entertainment and design  we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet. And if technology can  in the next decade or two  increase the pleasant life  the good life and the meaningful life  it will be good enough. If entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion  meaning  eudaimonia  it will be good enough. And if design can increase positive emotion  eudaimonia  and flow and meaning  what we're all doing together will become good enough. Thank you. My search is always to find ways to chronicle  to share and to document stories about people  just everyday people. Stories that offer transformation  that lean into transcendence  but that are never sentimental  that never look away from the darkest things about us. Because I really believe that we're never more beautiful than when we're most ugly. Because that's really the moment we really know what we're made of. As Chris said  I grew up in Nigeria with a whole generation    in the '  s    of students who were protesting a military dictatorship  which has finally ended. So it wasn't just me  there was a whole generation of us. But what I've come to learn is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures  but in the simple accumulation of gentle  soft  almost invisible acts of compassion  everyday acts of compassion. In South Africa  they have a phrase called Ubuntu. Ubuntu comes out of a philosophy that says  the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me. But if you're like me  my humanity is more like a window. I don't really see it  I don't pay attention to it until there's  you know  like a bug that's dead on the window. Then suddenly I see it  and usually  it's never good. It's usually when I'm cussing in traffic at someone who is trying to drive their car and drink coffee and send emails and make notes. So what Ubuntu really says is that there is no way for us to be human without other people. It's really very simple  but really very complicated. So  I thought I should start with some stories. I should tell you some stories about remarkable people  so I thought I'd start with my mother. And she was dark  too. My mother was English. My parents met in Oxford in the '  s  and my mother moved to Nigeria and lived there. She was five foot two  very feisty and very English. This is how English my mother is    or was  she just passed. She came out to California  to Los Angeles  to visit me  and we went to Malibu  which she thought was very disappointing. And then we went to a fish restaurant  and we had Chad  the surfer dude  serving us  and he came up and my mother said   Do you have any specials  young man   And Chad says   Sure  like  we have this  like  salmon  that's  like  rolled in this  like  wasabi  like  crust. It's totally rad.  And my mother turned to me and said   What language is he speaking   I said   English  mum.  And she shook her head and said   Oh  these Americans. We gave them a language  why don't they use it   So  this woman  who converted from the Church of England to Catholicism when she married my father    and there's no one more rabid than a Catholic convert    decided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria  particularly among Igbo women  the Billings ovulation method  which was the only approved birth control by the Catholic Church. But her Igbo wasn't too good. So she took me along to translate. I was seven. So  here are these women  who never discuss their period with their husbands  and here I am telling them   Well  how often do you get your period   And   Do you notice any discharges   And   How swollen is your vulva   She never would have thought of herself as a feminist  my mother  but she always used to say   Anything a man can do  I can fix.  And when my father complained about this situation  where she's taking a seven year old boy to teach this birth control  you know  he used to say   Oh  you're turning him into    you're teaching him how to be a woman.  My mother said   Someone has to.  This woman    during the Biafran war  we were caught in the war. It was my mother with five little children. It takes her one year  through refugee camp after refugee camp  to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country. At every single refugee camp  she has to face off soldiers who want to take my elder brother Mark  who was nine  and make him a boy soldier. Can you imagine this five foot two woman  standing up to men with guns who want to kill us  All through that one year  my mother never cried one time  not once. But when we were in Lisbon  in the airport  about to fly to England  this woman saw my mother wearing this dress  which had been washed so many times it was basically see through  with five really hungry looking kids  came over and asked her what had happened. And she told this woman. And so this woman emptied out her suitcase and gave all of her clothes to my mother  and to us  and the toys of her kids  who didn't like that very much  but    that was the only time she cried. And I remember years later  I was writing about my mother  and I asked her   Why did you cry then   And she said   You know  you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble  any kind of horror. But the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger will unstitch you.  The old women in my father's village  after this war had happened  memorized the names of every dead person  and they would sing these dirges  made up of these names. Dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you. And they would sing them only when they planted the rice  as though they were seeding the hearts of the dead into the rice. But when it came for harvest time  they would sing these joyful songs  that were made up of the names of every child who had been born that year. And then the next planting season  when they sang the dirge  they would remove as many names of the dead that equaled as many people that were born. And in this way  these women enacted a lot of transformation  beautiful transformation. Did you know  that before the genocide in Rwanda  the word for rape and the word for marriage was the same one  But today  women are rebuilding Rwanda. Did you also know that after apartheid  when the new government went into the parliament houses  there were no female toilets in the building  Which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men. All of this to say  that despite the horror  and despite the death  women are never really counted. Their humanity never seems to matter very much to us. When I was growing up in Nigeria    and I shouldn't say Nigeria  because that's too general  but in Afikpo  the Igbo part of the country where I'm from    there were always rites of passage for young men. Men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women  that's essentially what it is. And a lot of rituals involved killing  killing little animals  progressing along  so when I turned       and  I mean  it made sense  it was an agrarian community  somebody had to kill the animals  there was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at    so when I turned     it was my turn now to kill a goat. And I was this weird  sensitive kid  who couldn't really do it  but I had to do it. And I was supposed to do this alone. But a friend of mine  called Emmanuel  who was significantly older than me  who'd been a boy soldier during the Biafran war  decided to come with me. Which sort of made me feel good  because he'd seen a lot of things. Now  when I was growing up  he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people  and their intestines would fall out  but they would keep running. So  this guy comes with me. And I don't know if you've ever heard a goat  or seen one    they sound like human beings  that's why we call tragedies  a song of a goat.  My friend Brad Kessler says that we didn't become human until we started keeping goats. Anyway  a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes. So when I tried to kill this goat and I couldn't  Emmanuel bent down  he puts his hand over the mouth of the goat  covers its eyes  so I don't have to look into them  while I kill the goat. It didn't seem like a lot  for this guy who'd seen so much  and to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed such a quotidian experience  still found it in himself to try to protect me. I was a wimp. I cried for a very long time. And afterwards  he didn't say a word. He just sat there watching me cry for an hour. And then afterwards he said to me   It will always be difficult  but if you cry like this every time  you will die of heartbreak. Just know that it is enough sometimes to know that it is difficult.  Of course  talking about goats makes me think of sheep  and not in good ways. So  I was born two days after Christmas. So growing up  you know  I had a cake and everything  but I never got any presents  because  born two days after Christmas. So  I was about nine  and my uncle had just come back from Germany  and we had the Catholic priest over  my mother was entertaining him with tea. And my uncle suddenly says   Where are Chris' presents   And my mother said   Don't talk about that in front of guests.  But he was desperate to show that he'd just come back  so he summoned me up  and he said   Go into the bedroom  my bedroom. Take anything you want out of the suitcase. It's your birthday present.  I'm sure he thought I'd take a book or a shirt  but I found an inflatable sheep. So  I blew it up and ran into the living room  my finger where it shouldn't have been  I was waving this buzzing sheep around  and my mother looked like she was going to die of shock. And Father McGetrick was completely unflustered  just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said   It's all right Daphne  I'm Scottish.  My last days in prison  the last    months  my cellmate    for the last year  the first year of the last    months    my cellmate was    years old. The name was John James  and in those days  if a family member committed a crime  the military would hold you as ransom till your family turned themselves in. So  here was this    year old kid on death row. And not everybody on death row was a political prisoner. There were some really bad people there. And he had smuggled in two comics  two comic books     Spiderman  and  X Men.  He was obsessed. And when he got tired of reading them  he started to teach the men in death row how to read  with these comic books. And so  I remember night after night  you'd hear all these men  these really hardened criminals  huddled around John James  reciting   Take that  Spidey   It's incredible. I was really worried. He didn't know what death row meant. I'd been there twice  and I was terribly afraid that I was going to die. And he would always laugh  and say   Come on  man  we'll make it out.  Then I'd say   How do you know   And he said   Oh  I heard it on the grapevine.  They killed him. They handcuffed him to a chair  and they tacked his penis to a table with a six inch nail  then left him there to bleed to death. That's how I ended up in solitary  because I let my feelings be known. All around us  everywhere  there are people like this. The Igbo used to say that they built their own gods. They would come together as a community  and they would express a wish. And their wish would then be brought to a priest  who would find a ritual object  and the appropriate sacrifices would be made  and the shrine would be built for the god. But if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice  the Igbos would destroy the god. They would knock down the shrine  and they would stop saying the god's name. This is how they came to reclaim their humanity. Every day  all of us here  we're building gods that have gone rampant  and it's time we started knocking them down and forgetting their names. It doesn't require a tremendous thing. All it requires is to recognize among us  every day    the few of us that can see    are surrounded by people like the ones I've told you. There are some of you in this room  amazing people  who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity. I want to end with a poem by an American poet called Lucille Clifton. The poem is called  Libation   and it's for my friend Vusi who is in the audience here somewhere.  Libation  North Carolina      . I offer to this ground  this gin. I imagine an old man crying here  out of the sight of the overseer. He pushes his tongue through a hole where his tooth would be  if he were whole. It aches in that space where his tooth would be  where his land would be  his house  his wife  his son  his beautiful daughter. He wipes sorrow from his face  and puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue  and tastes the salt. I call a name that could be his. This is for you  old man. This gin  this salty earth.  Thank you. Who are we  That is the big question. And essentially we are just an upright walking  big brained  super intelligent ape. This could be us. We belong to the family called the Hominidae. We are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens  and it's important to remember that  in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet Earth. We are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today. And that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times. We're one species out of approximately  or let's say  at least    upright walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years. But as far as we know  we're the only upright walking ape that exists on planet Earth today  except for the bonobos. And it's important to remember that  because the bonobos are so human  and they share    percent of their genes with us. And we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes. It's important to remember that we evolved. Now  I know that's a dirty word for some people  but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas  the chimpanzee and also the bonobos. We have a common past  and we have a common future. And it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today. And it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity  and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family  as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past. And this is how we look for them. A group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly out across vast areas of Africa  looking for small fragments of bone  fossil bone  that may be on the surface. And that's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in Northern Kenya  looking for fossils. I doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture  but if you look very carefully  there is a jaw  a lower jaw  of a  .  million year old upright walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side. It's extremely time consuming  labor intensive and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people  to begin to piece together our past. We still really haven't got a very complete picture of it. When we find a fossil  we mark it. Today  we've got great technology  we have GPS. We mark it with a GPS fix  and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen  so we could essentially put it back on the surface  exactly where we found it. And we can bring all this information into big GIS packages  today. When we then find something very important  like the bones of a human ancestor  we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly  using dental picks and fine paintbrushes. And all the sediment is then put through these screens  and where we go again through it very carefully  looking for small bone fragments  and it's then washed. And these things are so exciting. They are so often the only  or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains. And here's a very special moment  when my mother and myself were digging up some remains of human ancestors. And it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother. Not many people can say that. But now  let me take you back to Africa  two million years ago. I'd just like to point out  if you look at the map of Africa  it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape. Now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley. It essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden  or runs down to Lake Malawi. And the Rift Valley is a depression. It's a basin  and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin  carrying sediment  preserving the bones of animals that lived there. If you want to become a fossil  you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried. You then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface. And then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you. OK  so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors  because it's incredibly difficult  A  for these things to become    to be    preserved  and secondly  for them to have been brought back up to the surface. And we really have only spent    years looking for these remains  and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story. So  let's go to Lake Turkana  which is one such lake basin in the very north of our country  Kenya. And if you look north here  there's a big river that flows into the lake that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there. Fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin  which represents some        square miles. That's a huge job that we've got on our hands. Two million years ago at Lake Turkana  Homo erectus  one of our human ancestors  actually lived in this region. You can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working in the north. But  essentially  two million years ago  Homo erectus  up in the far right corner  lived alongside three other species of human ancestor. And here is a skull of a Homo erectus  which I just pulled off the shelf there. But it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm. In fact  if you go back in time  it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time. Where did these things come from  That's what we're still trying to find answers to  and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species  and our ancestors are no exception. Here's some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from Lake Turkana. But I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya  essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana in search of human remains. And we were able to dig up  when we got old enough  fossils such as this  a slender snouted crocodile. And we dug up giant tortoises  and elephants and things like that. But when I was     as I was in this picture  a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side  when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus. I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well  because I was the same age that he was when he died. And I imagined him to be tall  dark skinned. His brothers certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey  probably sweating heavily as they did so. He was very able to use stones effectively as tools. And this individual himself  this one that I'm holding up here  actually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child. He had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female  and probably much smaller  members of his family group  to have got to where he did in life  age   . Unfortunately for him  he fell into a swamp and couldn't get out. Essentially  his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved. And he remained there until  .  million years later  when this very famous fossil hunter  Kamoya Kimeu  walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles  recognized it as being hominid. It's actually this little piece up here on the top. Well  an excavation was begun immediately  and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment. And what was so fun about it was this  the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree  and fairly recently the tree had grown up  but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside  and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this  holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope. We began to find limb bones  we found finger bones  the bones of the pelvis  vertebrae  ribs  the collar bones  things that had never  ever been seen before in Homo erectus. It was truly exciting. He had a body very similar to our own  and he was on the threshold of becoming human. Well  shortly afterwards  members of his species started to move northwards out of Africa  and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus in Georgia  China and also in parts of Indonesia. So  Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe. Some exciting finds  again  as I mentioned  from Dmanisi  in the Republic of Georgia. But also  surprising finds recently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia  where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated  and have become dwarfed  and they're only about a meter in height. But they lived only        years ago  and that is truly extraordinary to think about. Just to put this in terms of generations  because people do find it hard to think of time  Homo erectus left Africa        generations ago. We evolved essentially from an African stock. Again  at about         years as a fully fledged us. And we only left Africa about        years ago. And until        years ago  at least three upright walking apes shared the planet Earth. The question now is  well  who are we  We're certainly a polluting  wasteful  aggressive species  with a few nice things thrown in  perhaps. For the most part  we're not particularly pleasant at all. We have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors. Is this a good evolutionary adaptation  or is it going to lead us to being the shortest lived hominid species on planet Earth  And what is it that really makes us us  I think it's our collective intelligence. It's our ability to write things down  our language and our consciousness. From very primitive beginnings  with a very crude tool kit of stones  we now have a very advanced tool kit  and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels  we've got buggies to Mars  we've mapped the human genome  and recently even created synthetic life  thanks to Craig Venter. And we've also managed to communicate with people all over the world  from extraordinary places. Even from within an excavation in northern Kenya  we can talk to people about what we're doing. As Al Gore so clearly has reminded us  we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet. Human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth  if you look at the fossil record  for about  on average  a million years at a time. We've only been around for the past         years as a species  yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people. And last year  our population grew by    million. I mean  these are extraordinary numbers. You can see here  again  taken from Al Gore's book. But what's happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth. We have to control our numbers  and I think this is as important as anything else that's being done in the world today. But we have to control our numbers  because we can't really hold it together as a species. My father so appropriately put it  that  We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species.  Can we hold it together  It's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa. We all have an African origin. We have a common past and we share a common future. Evolutionarily speaking  we're just a blip. We're sitting on the edge of a precipice  and we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today. We could tell every single human being out there  if we really wanted to. But will we do that  or will we just let nature take its course  Well  to end on a very positive note  I think evolutionarily speaking  this is probably a fairly good thing  in the end. I'll leave it at that  thank you very much. So I'm going to talk today about collecting stories in some unconventional ways. This is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life. You might enjoy the awkwardly tight  cut off pajama bottoms with balloons. Anyway  it was a time when I was mainly interested in collecting imaginary stories. So this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made. And recently I've been much more interested in collecting stories from reality    so  real stories. And specifically  I'm interested in collecting my own stories  stories from the Internet  and then recently  stories from life  which is kind of a new area of work that I've been doing recently. So I'll be talking about each of those today. So  first of all  my own stories. These are two of my sketchbooks. I have many of these books  and I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years. They accompany me wherever I go in my life  and I fill them with all sorts of things  records of my lived experience  so watercolor paintings  drawings of what I see  dead flowers  dead insects  pasted ticket stubs  rusting coins  business cards  writings. And in these books  you can find these short  little glimpses of moments and experiences and people that I meet. And  you know  after keeping these books for a number of years  I started to become very interested in collecting not only my own personal artifacts  but also the artifacts of other people. So  I started collecting found objects. This is a photograph I found lying in a gutter in New York City about    years ago. On the front  you can see the tattered black and white photo of a woman's face  and on the back it says   To Judy  the girl with the Bill Bailey voice. Have fun in whatever you do.  And I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life. As opposed to knowing the whole story  just knowing a little bit of the story  and then letting your own mind fill in the rest. And that idea of a partial glimpse is something that will come back in a lot of the work I'll be showing later today. So  around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University  and I noticed that it was suddenly possible to collect these sorts of personal artifacts  not just from street corners  but also from the Internet. And that suddenly  people  en masse  were leaving scores and scores of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives. Blog posts  photographs  thoughts  feelings  opinions  all of these things were being expressed by people online  and leaving behind trails. So  I started to write computer programs that study very  very large sets of these online footprints. One such project is about a year and a half old. It's called  We Feel Fine.  This is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes  searching for occurrences of the phrases  I feel  and  I am feeling.  And when it finds one of those phrases  it grabs the full sentence up to the period and also tries to identify demographic information about the author. So  their gender  their age  their geographic location and what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence. It collects about        such sentences a day and it's been running for about a year and a half  having collected over    and a half million feelings now. This is  then  how they're presented. These dots here represent some of the English speaking world's feelings from the last few hours  each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger. And the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside  so the bright ones are happy  and the dark ones are sad. And the diameter of each dot corresponds to the length of the sentence inside. So the small ones are short  and the bigger ones are longer.  I feel fine with the body I'm in  there'll be no easy excuse for why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend   from a twenty two year old in Japan.  I got this on some trading locally  but really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap.  Also  some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts. And when that happens  these montage compositions are automatically created  which consist of the sentence and images being combined. And any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside.  I feel good.   I feel rough now  and I probably gained         pounds  but it was worth it.   I love how they were able to preserve most in everything that makes you feel close to nature    butterflies  man made forests  limestone caves and hey  even a huge python.  So the next movement is called mobs. This provides a slightly more statistical look at things. This is showing the world's most common feelings overall right now  dominated by better  then bad  then good  then guilty  and so on. Weather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits of the weather they represent. So the sunny ones swirl around  the cloudy ones float along  the rainy ones fall down  and the snowy ones flutter to the ground. You can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside. Finally  location causes the feelings to move to their spots on a world map  giving you a sense of their geographic distribution. So I'll show you now some of my favorite montages from  We Feel Fine.  These are the images that are automatically constructed.  I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe.   I've kissed numerous other boys and it hasn't felt good  the kisses felt messy and wrong  but kissing Lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual.   I can feel my cancer grow.   I feel pretty.   I feel skinny  but I'm not.   I'm     and a recovering meth and heroin addict  and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive.   I can't wait to see them racing for the first time at Daytona next month  because I feel the need for speed.   I feel sassy.   I feel so sexy in this new wig.  As you can see   We Feel Fine  collects very  very small scale personal stories. Sometimes  stories as short as two or three words. So  really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story. And recently  I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story. And that's led me to doing some work with the physical world  not with the Internet  and only using the Internet at the very last moment  as a presentation medium. So these are some newer projects that actually aren't even launched publicly yet. The first such one is called  The Whale Hunt.  Last May  I spent nine days living up in Barrow  Alaska  the northernmost settlement in the United States  with a family of Inupiat Eskimos  documenting their annual spring whale hunt. This is the whaling camp here  we're about six miles from shore  camping on five and a half feet of thick  frozen pack ice. And that water that you see there is the open lead  and through that lead  bowhead whales migrate north each springtime. And the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here  waits for a whale to come close enough to attack. And when it does  it throws a harpoon at it  and then hauls the whale up under the ice  and cuts it up. And that would provide the community's food supply for a long time. So I went up there  and I lived with these guys out in their whaling camp here  and photographed the entire experience  beginning with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York  and ending with the butchering of the second whale  seven and a half days later. I photographed that entire experience at five minute intervals. So every five minutes  I took a photograph. When I was awake  with the camera around my neck. When I was sleeping  with a tripod and a timer. And then in moments of high adrenaline  like when something exciting was happening  I would up that photographic frequency to as many as    photographs in five minutes. So what this created was a photographic heartbeat that sped up and slowed down  more or less matching the changing pace of my own heartbeat. That was the first concept here. The second concept was to use this experience to think about the fundamental components of any story. What are the things that make up a story  So  stories have characters. Stories have concepts. Stories take place in a certain area. They have contexts. They have colors. What do they look like  They have time. When did it take place  Dates    when did it occur  And in the case of the whale hunt  also this idea of an excitement level. The thing about stories  though  in most of the existing mediums that we're accustomed to    things like novels  radio  photographs  movies  even lectures like this one    we're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position  some kind of omniscient  external body through whose eyes you see the story. We're very used to this. But if you think about real life  it's not like that at all. I mean  in real life  things are much more nuanced and complex  and there's all of these overlapping stories intersecting and touching each other. And so I thought it would be interesting to build a framework to surface those types of stories. So  in the case of  The Whale Hunt   how could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford  involving the concepts of wildlife  tools and blood  taking place on the Arctic Ocean  dominated by the color red  happening around    a.m. on May    with an excitement level of high  So  how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story  I built a web interface for viewing  The Whale Hunt  that attempts to do just this. So these are all       pictures taken up there. This is my studio in Brooklyn. This is the Arctic Ocean  and the butchering of the second whale  seven days later. You can start to see some of the story here  told by color. So this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper in the basement apartment where I was staying. And things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean. Introduction of red down here  when whales are being cut up. You can see a timeline  showing you the exciting moments throughout the story. These are organized chronologically. Wheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same  so these are also all the photographs organized chronologically. And any of these can be clicked  and then the narrative is entered at that position. So here I am sleeping on the airplane heading up to Alaska. That's  Moby Dick.  This is the food we ate. This is in the Patkotak's family living room in their house in Barrow. The boxed wine they served us. Cigarette break outside    I don't smoke. This is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping. This is out at whale camp  on the Arctic Ocean. This graph that I'm clicking down here is meant to be reminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph  showing the exciting moments of adrenaline. This is the ice starting to freeze over. The snow fence they built. And so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub stories. So  here you see the cast. These are all of the people in  The Whale Hunt  and the two whales that were killed down here. And we could do something as arbitrary as  say  extract the story of Rony  involving the concepts of blood and whales and tools  taking place on the Arctic Ocean  at Ahkivgaq camp  with the heartbeat level of fast. And now we've whittled down that whole story to just    matching photographs  and then we can enter the narrative at that position. And you can see Rony cutting up the whale here. These whales are about    feet long  and weighing over    tons. And they provide the food source for the community for much of the year. Skipping ahead a bit more here  this is Rony on the whale carcass. They use no chainsaws or anything  it's entirely just blades  and an incredibly efficient process. This is the guys on the rope  pulling open the carcass. This is the muktuk  or the blubber  all lined up for community distribution. It's baleen. Moving on. So what I'm going to tell you about next is a very new thing. It's not even a project yet. So  just yesterday  I flew in here from Singapore  and before that  I was spending two weeks in Bhutan  the small Himalayan kingdom nestled between Tibet and India. And I was doing a project there about happiness  interviewing a lot of local people. So Bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base most of their high level governmental decisions around the concept of gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product  and they've been doing this since the '  s. And it leads to just a completely different value system. It's an incredibly non materialistic culture  where people don't have a lot  but they're incredibly happy. So I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas. So  I did a number of things. I asked people a number of set questions  and took a number of set photographs  and interviewed them with audio  and also took pictures. I would start by asking people to rate their happiness between one and     which is kind of inherently absurd. And then when they answered  I would inflate that number of balloons and give them that number of balloons to hold. So  you have some really happy person holding    balloons  and some really sad soul holding one balloon. But you know  even holding one balloon is like  kind of happy. And then I would ask them a number of questions like what was the happiest day in their life  what makes them happy. And then finally  I would ask them to make a wish. And when they made a wish  I would write their wish onto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it. So I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets of some of the interviews that I did  some of the people I spoke with. This is an    year old student. He was playing cops and robbers with his friends  running around town  and they all had plastic toy guns. His wish was to become a police officer. He was getting started early. Those were his hands. I took pictures of everybody's hands  because I think you can often tell a lot about somebody from how their hands look. I took a portrait of everybody  and asked everybody to make a funny face. A    year old student. Her wish was to have been born a boy. She thinks that women have a pretty tough go of things in Bhutan  and it's a lot easier if you're a boy. A    year old cell phone shop owner. If you knew what Paro looked like  you'd understand how amazing it is that there's a cell phone shop there. He wanted to help poor people. A    year old farmer. She was chaffing wheat  and that pile of wheat behind her had taken her about a week to make. She wanted to keep farming until she dies. You can really start to see the stories told by the hands here. She was wearing this silver ring that had the word  love  engraved on it  and she'd found it in the road somewhere. A    year old quarry worker. This guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight  but he just wanted to spend his life as a farmer. A    year old monk. He was very happy. He wanted to live a long life at the monastery. He had this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face  which I'm told is very good luck. He was kind of too shy to make a funny face. A    year old student. She wanted to become an independent woman. I asked her about that  and she said she meant that she doesn't want to be married  because  in her opinion  when you get married in Bhutan as a woman  your chances to live an independent life kind of end  and so she had no interest in that. A    year old truck driver. There are these terrifyingly huge Indian trucks that come careening around one lane roads with two lane traffic  with       foot drop offs right next to the road  and he was driving one of these trucks. But all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life  like other people. A    year old road sweeper. I caught her on her lunch break. She'd built a little fire to keep warm  right next to the road. Her wish was to marry someone with a car. She wanted a change in her life. She lives in a little worker's camp right next to the road  and she wanted a different lot on things. An    year old itinerant farmer. I saw this guy on the side of the road  and he actually doesn't have a home. He travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work  and then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at. So his wish was to come with me  so that he had somewhere to live. He had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his gho and started brandishing when I asked him to make a funny face. It was all good natured. A    year old. He wanted to join a school and learn to read  but his parents didn't have enough money to send him to school. He was eating this orange  sugary candy that he kept dipping his fingers into  and since there was so much saliva on his hands  this orange paste started to form on his palms. A    year old road worker. One of the more touchy political subjects in Bhutan is the use of Indian cheap labor that they import from India to build the roads  and then they send these people home once the roads are built. So these guys were in a worker's gang mixing up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway. His wish was to make some money and open a store. A    year old farmer. She was selling oranges on the side of the road. I asked her about her wish  and she said   You know  maybe I'll live  maybe I'll die  but I don't have a wish.  She was chewing betel nut  which caused her teeth over the years to turn very red. Finally  this is a    year old nun I spoke to. Her wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet. I asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said   Well  you know  of course  it's impermanent  but my plan is to live here until I'm     and then enter a hermitage.  And I said   You mean  like a cave   And she said   Yeah  like a cave.  And I said   Wow  and how long will you live in the cave   And she said   Well  you know  I think I'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave.  I just thought that was amazing. I mean  she spoke in a way    with amazing English  and amazing humor  and amazing laughter    that made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into on the streets of New York  or in Vermont  where I'm from. But here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years. I asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there  you know. What if she saw the truth after just one year  what would she do for the next    years in her life  And this is what she said. Woman  I think I'm going to stay for   . Maybe    maybe I'll die. Jonathan Harris  Maybe you'll die  Woman  Yes. JH     years  Woman  Yes  yes. JH     years  that's a long time. Woman  Yes  not maybe one     years  maybe I can die within one year  or something like that. JH  Are you hoping to  Woman  Ah  because you know  it's impermanent. JH  Yeah  but    yeah  OK. Do you hope    would you prefer to live in the cave for    years  or to live for one year  Woman  But I prefer for maybe    to   . JH     to     Yeah. Woman  Yes. From then  I'm going to the heaven. JH  Well  I wish you the best of luck with it. Woman  Thank you. JH  I hope it's everything that you hope it will be. So thank you again  so much. Woman  You're most welcome. JH  So if you caught that  she said she hoped to die when she was around   . That was enough life for her. So  the last thing we did  very quickly  is I took all those wish balloons    there were     interviews      wishes    and I brought them up to a place called Dochula  which is a mountain pass in Bhutan  at        feet  one of the more sacred places in Bhutan. And up there  there are thousands of prayer flags that people have spread out over the years. And we re inflated all of the balloons  put them up on a string  and hung them up there among the prayer flags. And they're actually still flying up there today. So if any of you have any Bhutan travel plans in the near future  you can go check these out. Here are some images from that. We said a Buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true. You can start to see some familiar balloons here.  To make some money and to open a store  was the Indian road worker. Thanks very much. To be new at TED    it's like being the last high school virgin. You know that all of the cool people are    they're doing it. And you're on the outside  you're at home. You're like the Raspyni Brothers  where you've got your balls in cold water. And    you just play with your fingers all day. And then you get invited. And you're on the inside  and it's everything you hoped it would be. It's exciting and there's music playing all of the time and then suddenly it's over. And it's only taken five minutes. And you want to go back and do it again. But I really appreciate being here. And thank you  Chris  and also  thank you  Deborah Patton  for making this possible. So anyway  today we'll talk about architecture a little bit  within the subject of creation and optimism. And if you put creation and optimism together  you've got two choices that you can talk about. You can talk about creationism    which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience  at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it    or you can talk about optimisations  spelled the British way  with an S  instead of a Z. And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today. But any kind of conversation about architecture    which is  in fact  what you were just talking about  what was going on here  setting up TED  small scale architecture    at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this  the World Trade Center  and what's been going on there  what it means to us. Because if architecture is what I believe it to be  which is the built form of our cultural ambitions  what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us  And our own opportunity to make something new there  This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time. I think that the World Trade Center in  rather an unfortunate way  brought architecture into focus in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time  and made it a subject for common conversation. I don't remember  in my    year career of practicing and writing about architecture  a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning  fire exiting  safety concerns and whether carpet burns. These are just not things we talked about very often. And yet  now  it's talked about all the time. At the point where you can weaponize your buildings  you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way. And so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way  we're going to think about it like this. How many of you saw USA Today  today  There it is. Looks like that. There's the World Trade Center site  on the front cover. They've made a selection. They've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind  the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture. Child prodigy piano player  he started on the squeezebox  and moved to a little more serious issue  a bigger instrument  and now to an even larger instrument  upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic  as you see here. He was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition  after six previous firms struck out with things that were so stupid and banal that even the city of New York was forced to go   Oh  I'm really sorry  we screwed up.  Right. Can we do this again from the top  except use some people with a vague hint of talent  instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time  real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities. Let's bring in some real architects for a change. And so we got this  or we had a choice of that. Oh  stop clapping. It's too late. That is gone. This was a scheme by a team called THINK  a New York based team  and then there was that one  which was the Libeskind scheme. This one  this is going to be the new World Trade Center  a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it. Now  I don't know what you think  but I think this is a pretty stupid decision  because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever. But that's what we're going to do. But I want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents  and that these two things talk about very specifically. And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects  in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic solution to everything    that there is a large  technical answer that can solve all problems  be they social  be they physical  be they chemical    or something that's more of a romantic solution. Now  I don't mean romantic as in  this is a nice place to take someone on a date. I mean romantic in the sense of  there are things larger and grander than us. So  in the American tradition  the difference between the technocratic and the romantic  would be the difference between Thomas Jefferson's Cartesian grids spreading across the United States  that gives us basically the whole shape of every western state in the United States  as a really  truly  technocratic solution  a bowing to the    in Jefferson's time    current  popular philosophy of rationalism. Or the way we went to describe that later  manifest destiny. Now  which would you rather be  A grid  or manifest destiny  Manifest destiny. It's a big deal. It sounds big  it sounds important  it sounds solid. It sounds American. Ballsy  serious  male. And that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time. I mean  it goes on in our private lives  too  every single day. We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT  don't we  Everyone here must own one  or at least they craved one the moment they saw one. And then they hopped in it  turned the little electronic key  rather than the real key  zipped home on their new superhighway  and drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle. Why  Why  Why do you want to do that  Why do we all want to do that  I even owned a Tudor thing once myself. It's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger  sort of more romantic image of where we are. So we're going to go straight into this. Can I have the lights off for a moment  I'm going to talk about two architects very  very briefly that represent the current split  architecturally  between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution and a romantic solution. And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today. One very young  one a little more mature. This is the work of a firm called SHoP  and what you're seeing here  is their isometric drawings of what will be a large scale camera obscura in a public park. Does everybody know what a camera obscura is  Yeah  it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world    it's sort of a little movie  without any moving parts    and projects it on a page  and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it. This is just the outline of it  and you can see  does it look like a regular building  No. It's actually non orthogonal  it's not up and down  square  rectangular  anything like that  that you'd see in a normal shape of a building. The computer revolution  the technocratic  technological revolution  has allowed us to jettison normal shaped buildings  traditionally shaped buildings  in favor of non orthogonal buildings such as this. What's interesting about it is not the shape. What's interesting about it is how it's made. How it's made. A brand new way to put buildings together  something called mass customization. No  it is not an oxymoron. What makes the building expensive  in the traditional sense  is making individual parts custom  that you can't do over and over again. That's why we all live in developer houses. They all want to save money by building the same thing     times. That's because it's cheaper. Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer  a program that says  manufacture these parts. The computer then talks to a machine    a computer operated machine  a cad cam machine    that can make a zillion different changes  at a moment's notice  because the computer is just a machine. It doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts. It doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time. It's not a laborer    it's simply an electronic lathe  so the parts can all be cut at the same time. Meanwhile  instead of sending someone working drawings  which are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life  what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions  like you used to get when you were a child  when you bought little models that said   Bolt A to B  and C to D.  And so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off site and delivered on a truck to the site  to that builder  and a set of these instruction manuals. Just simple  Bolt A to B  and they will be able to put them together. Here's the little drawing that tells them how that works    and that's what will happen in the end. You're underneath it  looking up into the lens of the camera obscura. Lest you think this is all fiction  lest you think this is all fantasy  or romance  these same architects were asked to produce something for the central courtyard of PS   which is a museum in Brooklyn  New York  as part of their young architects summer series. And they said  well  it's summer  what do you do  In the summer  you go to the beach. And when you go to the beach  what do you get  You get sand dunes. So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana. So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune. They took photographs  they fed the photographs into their computer program  and that computer program shaped a sand dune and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into    at their instructions  using standard software with slight modifications    a set of instructions for pieces of wood. And those are the pieces of wood. Those are the instructions. These are the pieces  and here's a little of that blown up. What you can see is there's about six different colors  and each color represents a type of wood to be cut  a piece of wood to be cut. All of which were delivered by flat bed  on a truck  and hand assembled in    hours by a team of eight people  only one of whom had ever seen the plans before. Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before. And here comes dune scape  coming up out of the courtyard  and there it is fully built. There are only    different pieces of wood  only    different assembly parts here. Looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside. It has its own built in swimming pool  very  very cool. It's a great place for parties    it was  it was only up for six weeks. It's got little dressing rooms and cabanas  where lots of interesting things went on  all summer long. Now  lest you think that this is only for the light at heart  or just temporary installations  this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center  replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street  that very important pedestrian connection between the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side. They were asked to design  replace that bridge in six weeks  building it  including all of the parts  manufactured. And they were able to do it. That was their design  using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts  a couple of struts  like this  some exterior cladding material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off site and delivered by truck. They were able to create that. They were able to create something wonderful. They're now building a    story building on the side of New York  using the same technology. Here we're going to walk across the bridge at night. It's self lit  you don't need any overhead lighting  so the neighbors don't complain about metal halide lighting in their face. Here it is going across. And there  down the other side  and you get the same kind of grandeur. Now  let me show you  quickly  the opposite  if I may. Woo  pretty  huh. This is the other side of the coin. This is the work of David Rockwell from New York City  whose work you can see out here today. The current king of the romantics  who approaches his work in a very different fashion. It's not to create a technological solution  it's to seduce you into something that you can do  into something that will please you  something that will lift your spirits  something that will make you feel as if are in another world    such as his Nobu restaurant in New York  which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition.  When it's all said and done  it's got to look like seaweed   said the owner. Or his restaurant  Pod  in Philadelphia  Pennsylvania. I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white. Every single surface of this restaurant is white. The reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting. It's all about sensuality. It's all about transforming. Watch this    I'm not touching any buttons  ladies and gentlemen. This is happening by itself. It transforms through the magic of lighting. It's all about sensuality. It's all about touch. Rosa Mexicano restaurant  where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco  up on the Upper West Side  with this wall of cliff divers who    there you go  like that. Let's see it one more time. Okay  just to make sure that you've enjoyed it. And finally  it's about comfort  it's about making you feel good in places that you wouldn't have felt good before. It's about bringing nature to the inside. In the Guardian Tower of New York  converted to a W Union Square    I'm sorry I'm rushing    where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space of the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself. It's about stimulation. This is a wine buying experience simplified by color and taste. Fizzy  fresh  soft  luscious  juicy  smooth  big and sweet wines  all explained to you by color and texture on the wall. And finally  it's about entertainment  as in his headquarters for the Cirque du Soleil  Orlando  Florida  where you're asked to enter the Greek theater  look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil. And I think I'll probably leave it at that. Thank you very much. The Internet  the Web as we know it  the kind of Web    the things we're all talking about    is already less than       days old. So all of the things that we've seen come about  starting  say  with satellite images of the whole Earth  which we couldn't even imagine happening before  all these things rolling into our lives  just this abundance of things that are right before us  sitting in front of our laptop  or our desktop. This kind of cornucopia of stuff just coming and never ending is amazing  and we're not amazed. It's really amazing that all this stuff is here. It's in       days  all this stuff has come. And I know that    years ago  if I had told you that this was all coming  you would have said that that's impossible. There's simply no economic model that that would be possible. And if I told you it was all coming for free  you would say  this is simply    you're dreaming. You're a Californian utopian. You're a wild eyed optimist. And yet it's here. The other thing that we know about it was that    years ago  as I looked at what even Wired was talking about  we thought it was going to be TV  but better. That was the model. That was what everybody was suggesting was going to be coming. And it turns out that that's not what it was. First of all  it was impossible  and it's not what it was. And so one of the things that I think we're learning    if you think about  like  Wikipedia  it's something that was simply impossible. It's impossible in theory  but possible in practice. And if you take all these things that are impossible  I think one of the things that we're learning from this era  from this last decade  is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible  because we're unprepared for it. So  I'm curious about what's going to happen in the next       days. But if that's happened in the last       days  what's going to happen in the next       days  So  I have a kind of a simple story  and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making  this thing that has happened in       days    that's all these computers  all these handhelds  all these cell phones  all these laptops  all these servers    basically what we're getting out of all these connections is we're getting one machine. If there is only one machine  and our little handhelds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines  but that we're basically constructing a single  global machine. And so I began to think about that. And it turned out that this machine happens to be the most reliable machine that we've ever made. It has not crashed  it's running uninterrupted. And there's almost no other machine that we've ever made that runs the number of hours  the number of days.       days without interruption    that's just unbelievable. And of course  the Internet is longer than just       days  the Web is only       days. So  I was trying to basically make measurements. What are the dimensions of this machine  And I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are all around the globe on all the computers. And there is a     billion clicks per day. And there's    trillion links between all the Web pages of the world. And so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions  and I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan  the photographer  talking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless  Well  here's a list of them. They're hard to tell  but there's one billion PC chips on the Internet  if you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet. There's two million emails per second. So it's a very big number. It's just a huge machine  and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet. So here's the specifications  just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it      quadrillion transistors     trillion links  emails running at two megahertz itself     kilohertz text messaging      exabyte storage. That's a big disk. That's a lot of storage  memory. Nine exabyte RAM. And the total traffic on this is running at seven terabytes per second. Brewster was saying the Library of Congress is about twenty terabytes. So every second  half of the Library of Congress is swooshing around in this machine. It's a big machine. So I did something else. I figured out     billion clicks per day     trillion links is almost the same as the number of synapses in your brain. A quadrillion transistors is almost the same as the number of neurons in your brain. So to a first approximation  we have these things    twenty petahertz synapse firings. Of course  the memory is really huge. But to a first approximation  the size of this machine is the size    and its complexity  kind of    to your brain. Because in fact  that's how your brain works    in kind of the same way that the Web works. However  your brain isn't doubling every two years. So if we say this machine right now that we've made is about one HB  one human brain  if we look at the rate that this is increasing     years from now  there'll be six billion HBs. So by the year       the total processing of this machine will exceed a total processing power of humanity  in raw bits and stuff. And this is  I think  where Ray Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we're going to cross. So  what about that  Well  here's a couple of things. I have three kind of general things I would like to say  three consequences of this. First  that basically what this machine is doing is embodying. We're giving it a body. And that's what we're going to do in the next       days    we're going to give this machine a body. And the second thing is  we're going to restructure its architecture. And thirdly  we're going to become completely codependent upon it. So let me go through those three things. First of all  we have all these things in our hands. We think they're all separate devices  but in fact  every screen in the world is looking into the one machine. These are all basically portals into that one machine. The second thing is that    some people call this the cloud  and you're kind of touching the cloud with this. And so in some ways  all you really need is a cloudbook. And the cloudbook doesn't have any storage. It's wireless. It's always connected. There's many things about it. It becomes very simple  and basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine  you're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way. So the machine is computing. And in some ways  it's sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing. But everything  all the cameras  and the microphones  and the sensors in cars and everything is connected to this machine. And everything will go through the Web. And we're seeing that already with  say  phones. Right now  phones don't go through the Web  but they are beginning to  and they will. And if you imagine what  say  just as an example  what Google Labs has in terms of experiments with Google Docs  Google Spreadsheets  blah  blah  blah    all these things are going to become Web based. They're going through the machine. And I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web. Right now  it's not. If you do spreadsheets and things at work  a Word document  they aren't on the Web  but they are going to be. They're going to be part of this machine. They're going to speak the Web language. They're going to talk to the machine. The Web  in some sense  is kind of like a black hole that's sucking up everything into it. And so every thing will be part of the Web. So every item  every artifact that we make  will have embedded in it some little sliver of Web ness and connection  and it will be part of this machine  so that our environment    kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense    our environment becomes the Web. Everything is connected. Now  with RFIDs and other things    whatever technology it is  it doesn't really matter. The point is that everything will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine  and so we have  basically  an Internet of things. So you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels  and a car as a chip with wheels  because basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars is the embedded intelligence and electronics in it  and not the materials. A lot of people think about the new economy as something that was going to be a disembodied  alternative  virtual existence  and that we would have the old economy of atoms. But in fact  what the new economy really is is the marriage of those two  where we embed the information  and the digital nature of things into the material world. That's what we're looking forward to. That is where we're going    this union  this convergence of the atomic and the digital. And so one of the consequences of that  I believe  is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now    TV  film  video    that basically becomes one media platform. And while there's many differences in some senses  they will share more and more in common with each other. So that the laws of media  such as the fact that copies have no value  the value's in the uncopiable things  the immediacy  the authentication  the personalization. The media wants to be liquid. The reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them  not so that they are  free  as in  beer   but  free  as in  freedom.  And the network effects rule  meaning that the more you have  the more you get. The first fax machine    the person who bought the first fax machine was an idiot  because there was nobody to fax to. But here she became an evangelist  recruiting others to get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable. Those are the effects that we're going to see. Attention is the currency. So those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media. And the other thing about this embodiment is that there's kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal. McLuhan was saying   Machines are the extensions of the human senses.  And I'm saying   Humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine   in a certain sense. So we have a trillion eyes  and ears  and touches  through all our digital photographs and cameras. And we see that in things like Flickr  or Photosynth  this program from Microsoft that will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place from the thousands of tourist snapshots of it. In a certain sense  the machine is seeing through the pixels of individual cameras. Now  the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring  that what the Web is doing is restructuring. And I have to warn you  that what we'll talk about is    I'm going to give my explanation of a term you're hearing  which is a  semantic Web.  So first of all  the first stage that we've seen of the Internet was that it was going to link computers. And that's what we called the Net  that was the Internet of nets. And we saw that  where you have all the computers of the world. And if you remember  it was a kind of green screen with cursors  and there was really not much to do  and if you wanted to connect it  you connected it from one computer to another computer. And what you had to do was    if you wanted to participate in this  you had to share packets of information. So you were forwarding on. You didn't have control. It wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line  you had to share packets. The second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages. So in the old one  if I wanted to go on to an airline Web page  I went from my computer  to an FTP site  to another airline computer. Now we have pages    the unit has been resolved into pages  so one page links to another page. And if I want to go in to book a flight  I go into the airline's flight page  the website of the airline  and I'm linking to that page. And what we're sharing were links  so you had to be kind of open with links. You couldn't deny    if someone wanted to link to you  you couldn't stop them. You had to participate in this idea of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody. So that's what we were doing. We're now entering to the third stage  which is what I'm talking about  and that is where we link the data. So  I don't know what the name of this thing is. I'm calling it the one machine. But we're linking data. So we're going from machine to machine  from page to page  and now data to data. So the difference is  is that rather than linking from page to page  we're actually going to link from one idea on a page to another idea  rather than to the other page. So every idea is basically being supported    or every item  or every noun    is being supported by the entire Web. It's being resolved at the level of items  or ideas  or words  if you want. So besides physically coming out again into this idea that it's not just virtual  it's actually going out to things. So something will resolve down to the information about a particular person  so every person will have a unique ID. Every person  every item will have a something that will be very specific  and will link to a specific representation of that idea or item. So now  in this new one  when I link to it  I would link to my particular flight  my particular seat. And so  giving an example of this thing  I live in Pacifica  rather than    right now Pacifica is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere. The Web doesn't know that that is actually a town  and that it's a specific town that I live in  but that's what we're going to be talking about. It's going to link directly to    it will know  the Web will be able to read itself and know that that actually is a place  and that whenever it sees that word   Pacifica   it knows that it actually has a place  latitude  longitude  a certain population. So here are some of the technical terms  all three letter things  that you'll see a lot more of. All these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data. So I'll give you one kind of an example. There's like a billion social sites on the Web. Each time you go into there  you have to tell it again who you are and all your friends are. Why should you be doing that  You should just do that once  and it should know who all your friends are. So that's what you want  is all your friends are identified  and you should just carry these relationships around. All this data about you should just be conveyed  and you should do it once and that's all that should happen. And you should have all the networks of all the relationships between those pieces of data. That's what we're moving into    where it sort of knows these things down to that level. A semantic Web  Web  .   giant global graph    we're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing. But what's it's doing is sharing data. So you have to be open to having your data shared  which is a much bigger step than just sharing your Web page  or your computer. And all these things that are going to be on this are not just pages  they are things. Everything we've described  every artifact or place  will be a specific representation  will have a specific character that can be linked to directly. So we have this database of things. And so there's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to  that we won't see in the next    years  or       days  but I think that's where we're going to. And as the Internet of things    where I'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane    that that physical thing becomes part of the Web. And so we are in the middle of this thing that's completely linked  down to every object in the little sliver of a connection that it has. So  the last thing I want to talk about is this idea that we're going to be codependent. It's always going to be there  and the closer it is  the better. If you allow Google to  it will tell you your search history. And I found out by looking at it that I search most at    o'clock in the morning. So I am open  and being transparent to that. And I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency. That is going to be the price. If you want to have total personalization  you have to be totally transparent. Google. I can't remember my phone number  I'll just ask Google. We're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point where I don't even try to remember things    I'll just Google it. It's easier to do that. And we kind of object at first  saying   Oh  that's awful.  But if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology  called the alphabet  and writing  we're totally dependent on it  and it's transformed culture. We cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing. And so in the same way  we're going to not imagine ourselves without this other machine being there. And what is happening with this is some kind of AI  but it's not the AI in conscious AI  as being an expert  Larry Page told me that that's what they're trying to do  and that's what they're trying to do. But when six billion humans are Googling  who's searching who  It goes both ways. So we are the Web  that's what this thing is. We are going to be the machine. So the next       days  it's not going to be the Web and only better. Just like it wasn't TV and only better. The next       days  it's not just going to be the Web but only better    it's going to be something different. And I think it's going to be smarter. It'll have an intelligence in there  that's not  again  conscious. But it'll anticipate what we're doing  in a good sense. Secondly  it's become much more personalized. It will know us  and that's good. And again  the price of that will be transparency. And thirdly  it's going to become more ubiquitous in terms of filling your entire environment  and we will be in the middle of it. And all these devices will be portals into that. So the single idea that I wanted to leave with you is that we have to begin to think about this as not just  the Web  only better   but a new kind of stage in this development. It looks more global. If you take this whole thing  it is a very big machine  very reliable machine  more reliable than its parts. But we can also think about it as kind of a large organism. So we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system  more as if this wasn't a large organism that we are going to be interacting with. It's a  One.  And I don't know what else to call it  than the One. We'll have a better word for it. But there's a unity of some sort that's starting to emerge. And again  I don't want to talk about consciousness  I want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria  or a volvox  which is what that organism is. So  to do  action  take away. So  here's what I would say  there's only one machine  and the Web is its OS. All screens look into the One. No bits will live outside the Web. To share is to gain. Let the One read it. It's going to be machine readable. You want to make something that the machine can read. And the One is us. We are in the One. I appreciate your time. I got my first computer when I was a teenager growing up in Accra  and it was a really cool device. You could play games with it. You could program it in BASIC. And I was fascinated. So I went into the library to figure out how did this thing work. I read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth between the memory  the RAM and the ALU  the arithmetic and logic unit. And I thought to myself  this CPU really has to work like crazy just to keep all this data moving through the system. But nobody was really worried about this. When computers were first introduced  they were said to be a million times faster than neurons. People were really excited. They thought they would soon outstrip the capacity of the brain. This is a quote  actually  from Alan Turing   In    years  it will be as easy to ask a computer a question as to ask a person.  This was in     . And now  in       it's still not true. And so  the question is  why aren't we really seeing this kind of power in computers that we see in the brain  What people didn't realize  and I'm just beginning to realize right now  is that we pay a huge price for the speed that we claim is a big advantage of these computers. Let's take a look at some numbers. This is Blue Gene  the fastest computer in the world. It's got         processors  they can basically process    quadrillion bits of information per second. That's    to the sixteenth. And they consume one and a half megawatts of power. So that would be really great  if you could add that to the production capacity in Tanzania. It would really boost the economy. Just to go back to the States  if you translate the amount of power or electricity this computer uses to the amount of households in the States  you get       households in the U.S. That's how much power this computer uses. Now  let's compare this with the brain. This is a picture of  actually Rory Sayres' girlfriend's brain. Rory is a graduate student at Stanford. He studies the brain using MRI  and he claims that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned. So that's true love  right there. Now  how much computation does the brain do  I estimate    to the    bits per second  which is actually about very similar to what Blue Gene does. So that's the question. The question is  how much    they are doing a similar amount of processing  similar amount of data    the question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use  And it's actually as much as your laptop computer  it's just    watts. So what we are doing right now with computers with the energy consumed by       houses  the brain is doing with the energy consumed by your laptop. So the question is  how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency  And let me just summarize. So the bottom line  the brain processes information using         times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have. How is the brain able to do this  Let's just take a look about how the brain works  and then I'll compare that with how computers work. So  this clip is from the PBS series   The Secret Life of the Brain.  It shows you these cells that process information. They are called neurons. They send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other  and where they contact each other  those little pulses of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other. That process is called a synapse. You've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other    about     million of them  sending about    quadrillion of these pulses around every second. And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this. How does that compare with the way computers work  In the computer  you have all the data going through the central processing unit  and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck  whereas in the brain  what you have is these neurons  and the data just really flows through a network of connections among the neurons. There's no bottleneck here. It's really a network in the literal sense of the word. The net is doing the work in the brain. If you just look at these two pictures  these kind of words pop into your mind. This is serial and it's rigid    it's like cars on a freeway  everything has to happen in lockstep    whereas this is parallel and it's fluid. Information processing is very dynamic and adaptive. So I'm not the first to figure this out. This is a quote from Brian Eno   the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them.  Brian actually said this in     . And nobody was listening then  but now people are beginning to listen because there's a pressing  technological problem that we face. And I'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides. This is    it's actually really this remarkable convergence between the devices that we use to compute in computers  and the devices that our brains use to compute. The devices that computers use are what's called a transistor. This electrode here  called the gate  controls the flow of current from the source to the drain    these two electrodes. And that current  electrical current  is carried by electrons  just like in your house and so on. And what you have here is  when you actually turn on the gate  you get an increase in the amount of current  and you get a steady flow of current. And when you turn off the gate  there's no current flowing through the device. Your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one  and the absence of current to represent a zero. Now  what's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller  they no longer behave like this. In fact  they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute  which is called an ion channel. And this is a little protein molecule. I mean  neurons have thousands of these. And it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it. And these are individual potassium ions that are flowing through that pore. Now  this pore can open and close. But  when it's open  because these ions have to line up and flow through  one at a time  you get a kind of sporadic  not steady    it's a sporadic flow of current. And even when you close the pore    which neurons can do  they can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity    even when it's closed  because these ions are so small  they can actually sneak through  a few can sneak through at a time. So  what you have is that when the pore is open  you get some current sometimes. These are your ones  but you've got a few zeros thrown in. And when it's closed  you have a zero  but you have a few ones thrown in. Now  this is starting to happen in transistors. And the reason why that's happening is that  right now  in         the technology that we are using    a transistor is big enough that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously  side by side. In fact  there's about    electrons can all be flowing this way. And that means that a transistor corresponds to about    ion channels in parallel. Now  in a few years time  by       we will shrink transistors so much. This is what Intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip. Or your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte of stuff on them    before  it was    . Transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen  and technology has really benefitted from that. But what's happening now is that in       the transistor is going to become so small  that it corresponds to only one electron at a time can flow through that channel  and that corresponds to a single ion channel. And you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel. The current will turn on and off at random  even when it's supposed to be on. And that means your computer is going to get its ones and zeros mixed up  and that's going to crash your machine. So  we are at the stage where we don't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices. And the only kind of thing    the only thing we know right now that can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain. OK  so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory  it sends it into the processor or the ALU  and then it puts the result back into memory. That's the red path that's highlighted. The way brains work  I told you all  you have got all these neurons. And the way they represent information is they break up that data into little pieces that are represented by pulses and different neurons. So you have all these pieces of data distributed throughout the network. And then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity  just by it flowing through the network. So you set up these connections such that the input pattern just flows and generates the output pattern. What you see here is that there's these redundant connections. So if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered  it doesn't show up over here  these two pieces can activate the missing part with these redundant connections. So even when you go to these crappy devices where sometimes you want a one and you get a zero  and it doesn't show up  there's redundancy in the network that can actually recover the missing information. It makes the brain inherently robust. What you have here is a system where you store data locally. And it's brittle  because each of these steps has to be flawless  otherwise you lose that data  whereas in the brain  you have a system that stores data in a distributed way  and it's robust. What I want to basically talk about is my dream  which is to build a computer that works like the brain. This is something that we've been working on for the last couple of years. And I'm going to show you a system that we designed to model the retina  which is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball. We didn't do this by actually writing code  like you do in a computer. In fact  the processing that happens in that little piece of brain is very similar to the kind of processing that computers do when they stream video over the Internet. They want to compress the information    they just want to send the changes  what's new in the image  and so on    and that is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve  to send to the rest of the brain. Instead of doing this in software  or doing those kinds of algorithms  we went and talked to neurobiologists who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina. And they figured out all the different cells  and they figured out the network  and we just took that network and we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip. So now the neurons are represented by little nodes or circuits on the chip  and the connections among the neurons are represented  actually modeled by transistors. And these transistors are behaving essentially just like ion channels behave in the brain. It will give you the same kind of robust architecture that I described. Here is actually what our artificial eye looks like. The retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here. And the chip    I'm going to show you a video that the silicon retina put out of its output when it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul  who's the student who designed this chip. Let me explain what you're going to see  OK  because it's putting out different kinds of information  it's not as straightforward as a camera. The retina chip extracts four different kinds of information. It extracts regions with dark contrast  which will show up on the video as red. And it extracts regions with white or light contrast  which will show up on the video as green. This is Kareem's dark eyes and that's the white background that you see here. And then it also extracts movement. When Kareem moves his head to the right  you will see this blue activity there  it represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image  that's where it's going from dark to light. And you also see this yellow activity  which represents regions where contrast is decreasing  it's going from light to dark. And these four types of information    your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it  and         of those fibers send these four types of information. So we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve. What you notice here is that these snapshots taken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse  right  It doesn't light up green everywhere in the background  only on the edges  and then in the hair  and so on. And this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send  they want to make it very sparse  because that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing  and it's doing it just with the circuitry  and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there  which we've captured on the chip. But the point that I want to make    I'll show you up here. So this image here is going to look like these ones  but here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image  so  you know  you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there. And so  here you go. Yes  so that's the idea. When you stand still  you just see the light and dark contrasts. But when it's moving back and forth  the retina picks up these changes. And that's why  you know  when you're sitting here and something happens in your background  you merely move your eyes to it. There are these cells that detect change and you move your attention to it. So those are very important for catching somebody who's trying to sneak up on you. Let me just end by saying that this is what happens when you put Africa in a piano  OK. This is a steel drum here that has been modified  and that's what happens when you put Africa in a piano. And what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer  and come up with a new kind of computer that will generate thought  imagination  be creative and things like that. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Question for you  Kwabena. Do you put together in your mind the work you're doing  the future of Africa  this conference    what connections can we make  if any  between them  Kwabena Boahen  Yes  like I said at the beginning  I got my first computer when I was a teenager  growing up in Accra. And I had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it. It was very brute force  it was very inelegant. I don't think that I would've had that reaction  if I'd grown up reading all this science fiction  hearing about RD D   whatever it was called  and just    you know  buying into this hype about computers. I was coming at it from a different perspective  where I was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem. And I think a lot of people in Africa have this different perspective  and I think that's going to impact technology. And that's going to impact how it's going to evolve. And I think you're going to be able to see  use that infusion  to come up with new things  because you're coming from a different perspective. I think we can contribute. We can dream like everybody else. CA  Thanks Kwabena  that was really interesting. Thank you. My talk is  Flapping Birds and Space Telescopes.  And you would think that should have nothing to do with one another  but I hope by the end of these    minutes  you'll see a little bit of a relation. It ties to origami. So let me start. What is origami  Most people think they know what origami is. It's this  flapping birds  toys  cootie catchers  that sort of thing. And that is what origami used to be. But it's become something else. It's become an art form  a form of sculpture. The common theme    what makes it origami    is folding is how we create the form. You know  it's very old. This is a plate from     . It shows these women playing with these toys. If you look close  it's this shape  called a crane. Every Japanese kid learns how to fold that crane. So this art has been around for hundreds of years  and you would think something that's been around that long    so restrictive  folding only    everything that could be done has been done a long time ago. And that might have been the case. But in the twentieth century  a Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along  and he created tens of thousands of new designs. But even more importantly  he created a language  a way we could communicate  a code of dots  dashes and arrows. Harkening back to Susan Blackmore's talk  we now have a means of transmitting information with heredity and selection  and we know where that leads. And where it has led in origami is to things like this. This is an origami figure    one sheet  no cuts  folding only  hundreds of folds. This  too  is origami  and this shows where we've gone in the modern world. Naturalism. Detail. You can get horns  antlers    even  if you look close  cloven hooves. And it raises a question  what changed  And what changed is something you might not have expected in an art  which is math. That is  people applied mathematical principles to the art  to discover the underlying laws. And that leads to a very powerful tool. The secret to productivity in so many fields    and in origami    is letting dead people do your work for you. Because what you can do is take your problem  and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved  and use their solutions. And I want to tell you how we did that in origami. Origami revolves around crease patterns. The crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint for an origami figure. And you can't just draw them arbitrarily. They have to obey four simple laws. And they're very simple  easy to understand. The first law is two colorability. You can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting. The directions of the folds at any vertex    the number of mountain folds  the number of valley folds    always differs by two. Two more or two less. Nothing else. If you look at the angles around the fold  you find that if you number the angles in a circle  all the even numbered angles add up to a straight line  all the odd numbered angles add up to a straight line. And if you look at how the layers stack  you'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets  a sheet can never penetrate a fold. So that's four simple laws. That's all you need in origami. All of origami comes from that. And you'd think   Can four simple laws give rise to that kind of complexity   But indeed  the laws of quantum mechanics can be written down on a napkin  and yet they govern all of chemistry  all of life  all of history. If we obey these laws  we can do amazing things. So in origami  to obey these laws  we can take simple patterns    like this repeating pattern of folds  called textures    and by itself it's nothing. But if we follow the laws of origami  we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very  very simple  but when we put it together  we get something a little different. This fish      scales    again  it is one uncut square  only folding. And if you don't want to fold     scales  you can back off and just do a few things  and add plates to the back of a turtle  or toes. Or you can ramp up and go up to    stars on a flag  with    stripes. And if you want to go really crazy        scales on a rattlesnake. And this guy's on display downstairs  so take a look if you get a chance. The most powerful tools in origami have related to how we get parts of creatures. And I can put it in this simple equation. We take an idea  combine it with a square  and you get an origami figure. What matters is what we mean by those symbols. And you might say   Can you really be that specific  I mean  a stag beetle    it's got two points for jaws  it's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail   And yeah  you really can. So how do we do that  Well  we break it down into a few smaller steps. So let me stretch out that equation. I start with my idea. I abstract it. What's the most abstract form  It's a stick figure. And from that stick figure  I somehow have to get to a folded shape that has a part for every bit of the subject  a flap for every leg. And then once I have that folded shape that we call the base  you can make the legs narrower  you can bend them  you can turn it into the finished shape. Now the first step  pretty easy. Take an idea  draw a stick figure. The last step is not so hard  but that middle step    going from the abstract description to the folded shape    that's hard. But that's the place where the mathematical ideas can get us over the hump. And I'm going to show you all how to do that so you can go out of here and fold something. But we're going to start small. This base has a lot of flaps in it. We're going to learn how to make one flap. How would you make a single flap  Take a square. Fold it in half  fold it in half  fold it again  until it gets long and narrow  and then we'll say at the end of that  that's a flap. I could use that for a leg  an arm  anything like that. What paper went into that flap  Well  if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern  you can see that the upper left corner of that shape is the paper that went into the flap. So that's the flap  and all the rest of the paper's left over. I can use it for something else. Well  there are other ways of making a flap. There are other dimensions for flaps. If I make the flaps skinnier  I can use a bit less paper. If I make the flap as skinny as possible  I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed. And you can see there  it needs a quarter circle of paper to make a flap. There's other ways of making flaps. If I put the flap on the edge  it uses a half circle of paper. And if I make the flap from the middle  it uses a full circle. So  no matter how I make a flap  it needs some part of a circular region of paper. So now we're ready to scale up. What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps  What do I need  I need a lot of circles. And in the     s  origami artists discovered these principles and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures just by packing circles. And here's where the dead people start to help us out  because lots of people have studied the problem of packing circles. I can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists looking at disc packings and arrangements. And I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes. So we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles  you decorate the patterns of circles with lines according to more rules. That gives you the folds. Those folds fold into a base. You shape the base. You get a folded shape    in this case  a cockroach. And it's so simple. It's so simple that a computer could do it. And you say   Well  you know  how simple is that   But computers    you need to be able to describe things in very basic terms  and with this  we could. So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago called TreeMaker  and you can download it from my website. It's free. It runs on all the major platforms    even Windows. And you just draw a stick figure  and it calculates the crease pattern. It does the circle packing  calculates the crease pattern  and if you use that stick figure that I just showed    which you can kind of tell  it's a deer  it's got antlers    you'll get this crease pattern. And if you take this crease pattern  you fold on the dotted lines  you'll get a base that you can then shape into a deer  with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted. And if you want a different deer  not a white tailed deer  but you want a mule deer  or an elk  you change the packing  and you can do an elk. Or you could do a moose. Or  really  any other kind of deer. These techniques revolutionized this art. We found we could do insects  spiders  which are close  things with legs  things with legs and wings  things with legs and antennae. And if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square wasn't interesting enough  then you could do two praying mantises from a single uncut square. She's eating him. I call it  Snack Time.  And you can do more than just insects. This    you can put details  toes and claws. A grizzly bear has claws. This tree frog has toes. Actually  lots of people in origami now put toes into their models. Toes have become an origami meme  because everyone's doing it. You can make multiple subjects. So these are a couple of instrumentalists. The guitar player from a single square  the bass player from a single square. And if you say   Well  but the guitar  bass    that's not so hot. Do a little more complicated instrument.  Well  then you could do an organ. And what this has allowed is the creation of origami on demand. So now people can say   I want exactly this and this and this   and you can go out and fold it. And sometimes you create high art  and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work. But I want to show you some examples. Everything you'll see here  except the car  is origami. Just to show you  this really was folded paper. Computers made things move  but these were all real  folded objects that we made. And we can use this not just for visuals  but it turns out to be useful even in the real world. Surprisingly  origami and the structures that we've developed in origami turn out to have applications in medicine  in science  in space  in the body  consumer electronics and more. And I want to show you some of these examples. One of the earliest was this pattern  this folded pattern  studied by Koryo Miura  a Japanese engineer. He studied a folding pattern  and realized this could fold down into an extremely compact package that had a very simple opening and closing structure. And he used it to design this solar array. It's an artist's rendition  but it flew in a Japanese telescope in     . Now  there is actually a little origami in the James Webb Space Telescope  but it's very simple. The telescope  going up in space  it unfolds in two places. It folds in thirds. It's a very simple pattern    you wouldn't even call that origami. They certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists. But if you want to go higher and go larger than this  then you might need some origami. Engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab had an idea for a telescope much larger. They called it the Eyeglass. The design called for geosynchronous orbit        miles up      meter diameter lens. So  imagine a lens the size of a football field. There were two groups of people who were interested in this  planetary scientists  who want to look up  and then other people  who wanted to look down. Whether you look up or look down  how do you get it up in space  You've got to get it up there in a rocket. And rockets are small. So you have to make it smaller. How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller  Well  about the only way is to fold it up somehow. So you have to do something like this. This was a small model. Folded lens  you divide up the panels  you add flexures. But this pattern's not going to work to get something     meters down to a few meters. So the Livermore engineers  wanting to make use of the work of dead people  or perhaps live origamists  said   Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing.  So they looked into the origami community  we got in touch with them  and I started working with them. And we developed a pattern together that scales to arbitrarily large size  but that allows any flat ring or disc to fold down into a very neat  compact cylinder. And they adopted that for their first generation  which was not     meters    it was a five meter. But this is a five meter telescope    has about a quarter mile focal length. And it works perfectly on its test range  and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle. Now  there is other origami in space. Japan Aerospace  Exploration  Agency flew a solar sail  and you can see here that the sail expands out  and you can still see the fold lines. The problem that's being solved here is something that needs to be big and sheet like at its destination  but needs to be small for the journey. And that works whether you're going into space  or whether you're just going into a body. And this example is the latter. This is a heart stent developed by Zhong You at Oxford University. It holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination  but it needs to be much smaller for the trip there  through your blood vessels. And this stent folds down using an origami pattern  based on a model called the water bomb base. Airbag designers also have the problem of getting flat sheets into a small space. And they want to do their design by simulation. So they need to figure out how  in a computer  to flatten an airbag. And the algorithms that we developed to do insects turned out to be the solution for airbags to do their simulation. And so they can do a simulation like this. Those are the origami creases forming  and now you can see the airbag inflate and find out  does it work  And that leads to a really interesting idea. You know  where did these things come from  Well  the heart stent came from that little blow up box that you might have learned in elementary school. It's the same pattern  called the water bomb base. The airbag flattening algorithm came from all the developments of circle packing and the mathematical theory that was really developed just to create insects    things with legs. The thing is  that this often happens in math and science. When you get math involved  problems that you solve for aesthetic value only  or to create something beautiful  turn around and turn out to have an application in the real world. And as weird and surprising as it may sound  origami may someday even save a life. Thanks.
