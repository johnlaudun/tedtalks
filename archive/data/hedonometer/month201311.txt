It is said that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence  and I believe this is true  especially when I hear President Obama often talk about the Korean education system as a benchmark of success. Well  I can tell you that  in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the Korean school system  also known as pressure cooker  not everyone can do well in that environment. While many people responded in different ways about our education system  my response to the high pressure environment was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building. Why bows  I'm not quite sure. Perhaps  in the face of constant pressure  my caveman instinct of survival has connected with the bows. If you think about it  the bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times. The area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the Joseon dynasty  where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves. In order to raise the historical awareness of this fact  the government has planted mulberry trees. The seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the      Olympics. The area near these walls  which nobody bothers to pay attention to  had been left free from major intervention  and this is where I first found my treasures. As I fell deeper into bow making  I began to search far and beyond my neighborhood. When I went on school field trips  family vacations  or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes  I wandered around wooded areas and gathered tree branches with the tools that I sneaked inside my school bag. And they would be somethings like saws  knives  sickles and axes that I covered up with a piece of towel. I would bring the branches home  riding buses and subways  barely holding them in my hands. And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach. Airport security. In the privacy of my room  covered in sawdust  I would saw  trim and polish wood all night long until a bow took shape. One day  I was changing the shape of a bamboo piece and ended up setting the place on fire. Where  The rooftop of my apartment building  a place where    families call home. A customer from a department store across from my building called      and I ran downstairs to tell my mom with half of my hair burned. I want to take this opportunity to tell my mom  in the audience today  Mom  I was really sorry  and I will be more careful with open fire from now on. My mother had to do a lot of explaining  telling people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson. I also researched extensively on bows around the world. In that process  I tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow. I also worked with many different types of wood  such as maple  yew and mulberry  and did many shooting experiments in the wooded area near the urban expressway that I mentioned before. The most effective bow for me would be like this. One  Curved tips can maximize the springiness when you draw and shoot the arrow. Two  Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight  which means more power. Three  Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage. And four  Horn used to store energy in compression. After fixing  breaking  redesigning  mending  bending and amending  my ideal bow began to take shape  and when it was finally done  it looked like this. I was so proud of myself for inventing a perfect bow on my own. This is a picture of Korean traditional bows taken from a museum  and see how my bow resembles them. Thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention.  Laughter  Through bowmaking  I came in contact with part of my heritage. Learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me. You see  I searched far and wide  but never bothered to look close and near. From this realization  I began to take interest in Korean history  which had never inspired me before. In the end  the grass is often greener on my side of the fence  although we don't realize it. Now  I am going to show you how my bow works. And let's see how this one works. This is a bamboo bow  with    pound draw weights. A bow may function in a simple mechanism  but in order to make a good bow  a great amount of sensitivity is required. You need to console and communicate with the wood material. Each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being  and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow. I may be an  odd  student with unconventional interests  but I hope I am making a contribution by sharing my story with all of you. My ideal world is a place where no one is left behind  where everyone is needed exactly where they are  like the fibers and the tendons in a bow  a place where the strong is flexible and the vulnerable is resilient. The bow resembles me  and I resemble the bow. Now  I am shooting a part of myself to you. No  better yet  a part of my mind has just been shot over to your mind. Did it strike you  Thank you. In December of       the city of Apatzing n in the coastal state of Michoac n  in Mexico  awoke to gunfire. For two straight days  the city became an open battlefield between the federal forces and a well organized group  presumably from the local criminal organization  La Familia Michoacana  or the Michoac n family. The citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire but also explosions and burning trucks used as barricades across the city  so truly like a battlefield. After these two days  and during a particularly intense encounter  it was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana  Nazario Moreno  was killed. In response to this terrifying violence  the mayor of Apatzing n decided to call the citizens to a march for peace. The idea was to ask for a softer approach to criminal activity in the state. And so  the day of the scheduled procession  thousands of people showed up. As the mayor was preparing to deliver the speech starting the march  his team noticed that  while half of the participants were appropriately dressed in white  and bearing banners asking for peace  the other half was actually marching in support of the criminal organization and its now presumed defunct leader. Shocked  the mayor decided to step aside rather than participate or lead a procession that was ostensibly in support of organized crime. And so his team stepped aside. The two marches joined together  and they continued their path towards the state capital. This story of horrific violence followed by a fumbled approach by federal and local authorities as they tried to engage civil society  who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization  is a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today  where we see that our current understanding of drug violence and what leads to it is probably at the very least incomplete. If you decided to spend    minutes trying to figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico by  say  just researching online  the first thing you would find out is that while the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal  there are some that are more and there are some that are much less equal than others  because you will quickly find out that in the past six years anywhere between    and         people have lost their lives in drug related violence. To put these numbers in perspective  this is eight times larger than the number of casualties in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. It's also shockingly close to the number of people who have died in the Syrian civil war  which is an active civil war. This is happening just south of the border. Now as you're reading  however  you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly become numb to the numbers of deaths  because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers of faceless  nameless dead people. Implicitly or explicitly  there is a narrative that all the people who are dying were somehow involved in the drug trade  and we infer this because they were either tortured or executed in a professional manner  or  most likely  both. And so clearly they were criminals because of the way they died. And so the narrative is that somehow these people got what they were deserved. They were part of the bad guys. And that creates some form of comfort for a lot of people. However  while it's easier to think of us  the citizens  the police  the army  as the good guys  and them  the narcos  the carteles  as the bad guys  if you think about it  the latter are only providing a service to the former. Whether we like it or not  the U.S. is the largest market for illegal substances in the world  accounting for more than half of global demand. It shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico that is its only route of access from the South  and so  as the former dictator of Mexico  Porfirio Diaz  used to say   Poor Mexico  so far from God and so close to the United States.  The U.N. estimates that there are    million users of illegal drugs in the United States. Using very  very conservative assumptions  this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side of anywhere between    and     billion dollars. If we assume that the narcos only have access to the wholesale part  which we know is false  that still leaves you with yearly revenues of anywhere between    billion and    billion dollars. To put these numbers in perspective  Microsoft has yearly revenues of    billion dollars. And it so happens that this is a product that  because of its nature  a business model to address this market requires you to guarantee to your producers that their product will be reliably placed in the markets where it is consumed. And the only way to do this  because it's illegal  is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors that are used to transport drugs. Hence the violence. If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence  you will see that it almost perfectly aligns with the most efficient routes of transportation from the south to the north. The only thing that the cartels are doing is that they're trying to protect their business. It's not only a multi billion dollar market  but it's also a complex one. For example  the coca plant is a fragile plant that can only grow in certain latitudes  and so it means that a business model to address this market requires you to have decentralized  international production  that by the way needs to have good quality control  because people need a good high that is not going to kill them and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it. And so that means they need to secure production and quality control in the south  and you need to ensure that you have efficient and effective distribution channels in the markets where these drugs are consumed. I urge you  but only a little bit  because I don't want to get you in trouble  to just ask around and see how difficult it would be to get whatever drug you want  wherever you want it  whenever you want it  anywhere in the U.S.  and some of you may be surprised to know that there are many dealers that offer a service where if you send them a text message  they guarantee delivery of the drug in    minutes or less. Think about this for a second. Think about the complexity of the distribution network that I just described. It's very difficult to reconcile this with the image of faceless  ignorant goons that are just shooting each other  very difficult to reconcile. Now  as a business professor  and as any business professor would tell you  an effective organization requires an integrated strategy that includes a good organizational structure  good incentives  a solid identity and good brand management. This leads me to the second thing that you would learn in your    minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico. Because you would quickly realize  and maybe be confused by the fact  that there are three organizations that are constantly named in the articles. You will hear about Los Zetas  the Knights Templar  which is the new brand for the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning  and the Sinaloa Federation. You will read that Los Zetas is this assortment of sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter and they silence the press  and this is somewhat true  or mostly true. But this is the result of a very careful branding and business strategy. You see  Los Zetas is not just this random assortment of individuals  but was actually created by another criminal organization  the Gulf Cartel  that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico. When that corridor became contested  they decided that they wanted to recruit a professional enforcement arm. So they recruited Los Zetas  an entire unit of elite paratroopers from the Mexican Army. They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel  so much so that at some point  they decided to just take over the operations  which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets  because they grow up. Because the Zetas organization was founded in treason  they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution in the most profitable markets like cocaine  but what they did have  and this is again based on their military origin  was a perfectly structured chain of command with a very clear hierarchy and a very clear promotion path that allowed them to supervise and operate across many  many markets very effectively  which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do. And so because they didn't have access to the more profitable drug markets  this pushed them and gave them the opportunity to diversify into other forms of crime. That includes kidnapping  prostitution  local drug dealing and human trafficking  including of migrants that go from the south to the U.S. So what they currently run is truly and quite literally a franchise business. They focus most of their recruiting on the army  and they very openly advertise for better salaries  better benefits  better promotion paths  not to mention much better food  than what the army can deliver. The way they operate is that when they arrive in a locality  they let people know that they are there  and they go to the most powerful local gang and they say   I offer you to be the local representative of the Zeta brand.  If they agree    and you don't want to know what happens if they don't    they train them and they supervise them on how to run the most efficient criminal operation for that town  in exchange for royalties. This kind of business model obviously depends entirely on having a very effective brand of fear  and so Los Zetas carefully stage acts of violence that are spectacular in nature  especially when they arrive first in a city  but again  that's just a brand strategy. I'm not saying they're not violent  but what I am saying is that even though you will read that they are the most violent of all  when you count  when you do the body count  they're actually all the same. In contrast to them  the Knights Templar that arose in Michoac n emerged in reaction to the incursion of the Zetas into the state of Michoac n. Michoac n is a geographically strategic state because it has one of the largest ports in Mexico  and it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico  which then gives you direct access to the U.S. The Knights Templar realized very quickly that they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone  and so they developed a strategy as a social enterprise. They brand themselves as representative of and protecting of the citizens of Michoac n against organized crime. Their brand of social enterprise means that they require a lot of civic engagement  so they invest heavily in providing local services  like dealing with home violence  going after petty criminals  treating addicts  and keeping drugs out of the local markets where they are  and  of course  protecting people from other criminal organizations. Now  they kill a lot of people too  but when they kill them  they provide very careful narratives and descriptions for why they did them  through newspaper insertions  YouTube videos  and billboards that explain that the people who were killed were killed because they represented a threat not to us  as an organization  of course  but to you  as citizens. And so we're actually here to protect you. They  as social enterprises do  have created a moral and ethical code that they advertise around  and they have very strict recruiting practices. And here you have the types of explanations that they provide for some of their actions. They have actually retained access to the profitable drug trade  but the way they do it is  because they control all of Michoac n  and they control the Port of L zaro C rdenas  they leverage that to  for example  trade copper from Michoac n that is legally created and legally extracted with illegal ephedrine from China which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines that they produce  and then they have partnerships with larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation that place their products in the U.S. Finally  the Sinaloa Federation. When you read about them  you will often read about them with an undertone of reverence and admiration  because they are the most integrated and the largest of all the Mexican organizations  and  many people argue  the world. They started as just sort of a transport organization that specialized in smuggling between the U.S. and the Mexican borders  but now they have grown into a truly integrated multinational that has partnerships in production in the south and partnerships in global distribution across the planet. They have cultivated a brand of professionalism  business acumen and innovation. They have designed new drug products and new drug processes. They have designed narco tunnels that go across the border  and you can see that these are not  The Shawshank Redemption  types. They have invented narco submarines and boats that are not detected by radar. They have invented drones to transport drugs  catapults  you name it. One of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation actually made it to the Forbes list.       Joaquin Guzman Loera  Like any multinational would  they have specialized and focused only in the most profitable part of the business  which is high margin drugs like cocaine  heroine  methamphetamines. Like any traditional Latin American multinational would  the way they control their operations is through family ties. When they're entering a new market  they send a family member to supervise it  or  if they're partnering with a new organization  they create a family tie  either through marriages or other types of ties. Like any other multinational would  they protect their brand by outsourcing the more questionable parts of the business model  like for example  when they have to engage in violence against other criminal organizations  they recruit gangs and other smaller players to do the dirty work for them  and they try to separate their operations and their violence and be very discrete about this. To further strengthen their brand  they actually have professional P.R. firms that shape how the press talks about them. They have professional videographers on staff. They have incredibly productive ties with the security organizations on both sides of the border. And so  differences aside  what these three organizations share is on the one hand  a very clear understanding that institutions cannot be imposed from the top  but rather they are built from the bottom up one interaction at a time. They have created extremely coherent structures that they use to show the inconsistencies in government policies. And so what I want you to remember from this talk are three things. The first one is that drug violence is actually the result of a huge market demand and an institutional setup that forces the servicing of this market to necessitate violence to guarantee delivery routes. The second thing I want you to remember is that these are sophisticated  coherent organizations that are business organizations  and analyzing them and treating them as such is probably a much more useful approach. The third thing I want you to remember is that even though we're more comfortable with this idea of  them   a set of bad guys separated from us  we are actually accomplices to them  either through our direct consumption or through our acceptance of the inconsistency between our policies of prohibition and our actual behavior of tolerance or even encouragement of consumption. These organizations service  recruit from  and operate within our communities  so necessarily  they are much more integrated within them than we are comfortable acknowledging. And so to me the question is not whether these dynamics will continue the way they have. We see that the nature of this phenomenon guarantees that they will. The question is whether we are willing to continue our support of a failed strategy based on our stubborn  blissful  voluntary ignorance at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young. Thank you. I was about    years old on a camping trip with my dad in the Adirondack Mountains  a wilderness area in the northern part of New York State. It was a beautiful day. The forest was sparkling. The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass  and if it weren't for the path we were following  we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to ever walk that land. We got to our campsite. It was a lean to on a bluff looking over a crystal  beautiful lake  when I discovered a horror. Behind the lean to was a dump  maybe    feet square with rotting apple cores and balled up aluminum foil  and a dead sneaker. And I was astonished  I was very angry  and I was deeply confused. The campers who were too lazy to take out what they had brought in  who did they think would clean up after them  That question stayed with me  and it simplified a little. Who cleans up after us  However you configure or wherever you place the us  who cleans up after us in Istanbul  Who cleans up after us in Rio or in Paris or in London  Here in New York  the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us  to the tune of        tons of garbage and       tons of recyclables every day. I wanted to get to know them as individuals. I wanted to understand who takes the job. What's it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden  So I started a research project with them. I rode in the trucks and walked the routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city  and I learned a lot  but I was still an outsider. I needed to go deeper. So I took the job as a sanitation worker. I didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks. And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow. It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education. Everyone asks about the smell. It's there  but it's not as prevalent as you think  and on days when it is really bad  you get used to it rather quickly. The weight takes a long time to get used to. I knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden of bearing on your body tons of trash every week. Then there's the danger. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  sanitation work is one of the    most dangerous occupations in the country  and I learned why. You're in and out of traffic all day  and it's zooming around you. It just wants to get past you  so it's often the motorist is not paying attention. That's really bad for the worker. And then the garbage itself is full of hazards that often fly back out of the truck and do terrible harm. I also learned about the relentlessness of trash. When you step off the curb and you see a city from behind a truck  you come to understand that trash is like a force of nature unto itself. It never stops coming. It's also like a form of respiration or circulation. It must always be in motion. And then there's the stigma. You put on the uniform  and you become invisible until someone is upset with you for whatever reason like you've blocked traffic with your truck  or you're taking a break too close to their home  or you're drinking coffee in their diner  and they will come and scorn you  and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them. I find the stigma especially ironic  because I strongly believe that sanitation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city  for three reasons. They are the first guardians of public health. If they're not taking away trash efficiently and effectively every day  it starts to spill out of its containments  and the dangers inherent to it threaten us in very real ways. Diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries burst forth again and start to harm us. The economy needs them. If we can't throw out the old stuff  we have no room for the new stuff  so then the engines of the economy start to sputter when consumption is compromised. I'm not advocating capitalism  I'm just pointing out their relationship. And then there's what I call our average  necessary quotidian velocity. By that I simply mean how fast we're used to moving in the contemporary day and age. We usually don't care for  repair  clean  carry around our coffee cup  our shopping bag  our bottle of water. We use them  we throw them out  we forget about them  because we know there's a workforce on the other side that's going to take it all away. So I want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about sanitation that will perhaps help ameliorate the stigma and bring them into this conversation of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane. Their work  I think  is kind of liturgical. They're on the streets every day  rhythmically. They wear a uniform in many cities. You know when to expect them. And their work lets us do our work. They are almost a form of reassurance. The flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves  from our own dross  our cast offs  and that flow must be maintained always no matter what. On the day after September    in       I heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street  and I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs and there was a man doing his paper recycling route like he did every Wednesday. And I tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days  but I started to cry. And he looked at me  and he just nodded  and he said   We're going to be okay. We're going to be okay.  It was a little while later that I started my research with sanitation  and I met that man again. His name is Paulie  and we worked together many times  and we became good friends. I want to believe that Paulie was right. We are going to be okay. But in our effort to reconfigure how we as a species exist on this planet  we must include and take account of all the costs  including the very real human cost of the labor. And we also would be well informed to reach out to the people who do that work and get their expertise on how do we think about  how do we create systems around sustainability that perhaps take us from curbside recycling  which is a remarkable success across    years  across the United States and countries around the world  and lift us up to a broader horizon where we're looking at other forms of waste that could be lessened from manufacturing and industrial sources. Municipal waste  what we think of when we talk about garbage  accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream. It's a remarkable statistic. So in the flow of your days  in the flow of your lives  next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you  take a moment to acknowledge them. Take a moment to say thank you. I am a neuroscientist with a mixed background in physics and medicine. My lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology focuses on spinal cord injury  which affects more than        people around the world every year  with dramatic consequences for affected individuals  whose life literally shatters in a matter of a handful of seconds. And for me  the Man of Steel  Christopher Reeve  has best raised the awareness on the distress of spinal cord injured people. And this is how I started my own personal journey in this field of research  working with the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. I still remember this decisive moment. It was just at the end of a regular day of work with the foundation. Chris addressed us  the scientists and experts   You have to be more pragmatic. When leaving your laboratory tomorrow  I want you to stop by the rehabilitation center to watch injured people fighting to take a step  struggling to maintain their trunk. And when you go home  think of what you are going to change in your research on the following day to make their lives better.  These words  they stuck with me. This was more than    years ago  but ever since  my laboratory has followed the pragmatic approach to recovery after spinal cord injury. And my first step in this direction was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury while offering well controlled experimental conditions. And for this purpose  we placed two hemisections on opposite sides of the body. They completely interrupt the communication between the brain and the spinal cord  thus leading to complete and permanent paralysis of the leg. But  as observed  after most injuries in humans  there is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue through which recovery can occur. But how to make it happen  Well  the classical approach consists of applying intervention that would promote the growth of the severed fiber to the original target. And while this certainly remained the key for a cure  this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me. To reach clinical fruition rapidly  it was obvious  I had to think about the problem differently. It turned out that more than     years of research on spinal cord physiology  starting with the Nobel Prize Sherrington  had shown that the spinal cord  below most injuries  contained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks to coordinate locomotion  but because input from the brain is interrupted  they are in a nonfunctional state  like kind of dormant. My idea  We awaken this network. And at the time  I was a post doctoral fellow in Los Angeles  after completing my Ph.D. in France  where independent thinking is not necessarily promoted. I was afraid to talk to my new boss  but decided to muster up my courage. I knocked at the door of my wonderful advisor  Reggie Edgerton  to share my new idea. He listened to me carefully  and responded with a grin.  Why don't you try   And I promise to you  this was such an important moment in my career  when I realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas. And this was the idea  I'm going to use a simplistic metaphor to explain to you this complicated concept. Imagine that the locomotor system is a car. The engine is the spinal cord. The transmission is interrupted. The engine is turned off. How could we re engage the engine  First  we have to provide the fuel  second  press the accelerator pedal  third  steer the car. It turned out that there are known neural pathways coming from the brain that play this very function during locomotion. My idea  Replace this missing input to provide the spinal cord with the kind of intervention that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk. For this  I leveraged    years of past research in neuroscience  first to replace the missing fuel with pharmacological agents that prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire  and second  to mimic the accelerator pedal with electrical stimulation. So here imagine an electrode implanted on the back of the spinal cord to deliver painless stimulation. It took many years  but eventually we developed an electrochemical neuroprosthesis that transformed the neural network in the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state. Immediately  the paralyzed rat can stand. As soon as the treadmill belt starts moving  the animal shows coordinated movement of the leg  but without the brain. Here what I call  the spinal brain  cognitively processes sensory information arising from the moving leg and makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle in order to stand  to walk  to run  and even here  while sprinting  instantly stand if the treadmill stops moving. This was amazing. I was completely fascinated by this locomotion without the brain  but at the same time so frustrated. This locomotion was completely involuntary. The animal had virtually no control over the legs. Clearly  the steering system was missing. And it then became obvious from me that we had to move away from the classical rehabilitation paradigm  stepping on a treadmill  and develop conditions that would encourage the brain to begin voluntary control over the leg. With this in mind  we developed a completely new robotic system to support the rat in any direction of space. Imagine  this is really cool. So imagine the little     gram rat attached at the extremity of this     kilo robot  but the rat does not feel the robot. The robot is transparent  just like you would hold a young child during the first insecure steps. Let me summarize  The rat received a paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord. The electrochemical neuroprosthesis enabled a highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks. The robot provided the safe environment to allow the rat to attempt anything to engage the paralyzed legs. And for motivation  we used what I think is the most powerful pharmacology of Switzerland  fine Swiss chocolate. Actually  the first results were very  very  very disappointing. Here is my best physical therapist completely failing to encourage the rat to take a single step  whereas the same rat  five minutes earlier  walked beautifully on the treadmill. We were so frustrated. But you know  one of the most essential qualities of a scientist is perseverance. We insisted. We refined our paradigm  and after several months of training  the otherwise paralyzed rat could stand  and whenever she decided  initiated full weight bearing locomotion to sprint towards the rewards. This is the first recovery ever observed of voluntary leg movement after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord leading to complete and permanent paralysis. In fact    Thank you. In fact  not only could the rat initiate and sustain locomotion on the ground  they could even adjust leg movement  for example  to resist gravity in order to climb a staircase. I can promise you this was such an emotional moment in my laboratory. It took us    years of hard work to reach this goal. But the remaining question was  how  I mean  how is it possible  And here  what we found was completely unexpected. This novel training paradigm encouraged the brain to create new connections  some relay circuits that relay information from the brain past the injury and restore cortical control over the locomotor networks below the injury. And here  you can see one such example  where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red. This blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center  and what this constellation of synaptic contacts means is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center with only one relay neuron. But the remodeling was not restricted to the lesion area. It occurred throughout the central nervous system  including in the brain stem  where we observed up to     percent increase in the density of fibers coming from the brain. We did not aim to repair the spinal cord  yet we were able to promote one of the more extensive remodeling of axonal projections ever observed in the central nervous system of adult mammal after an injury. And there is a very important message hidden behind this discovery. They are the result of a young team of very talented people  physical therapists  neurobiologists  neurosurgeons  engineers of all kinds  who have achieved together what would have been impossible by single individuals. This is truly a trans disciplinary team. They are working so close to each other that there is horizontal transfer of DNA. We are creating the next generation of M.D.'s and engineers capable of translating discoveries all the way from bench to bedside. And me  I am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony. Now  I am sure you are all wondering  aren't you  will this help injured people  Me too  every day. The truth is that we don't know enough yet. This is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury  but I begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery and people's quality of life. I would like you all to take a moment and dream with me. Imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury. After a few weeks of recovery  we will implant a programmable pump to deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail directly to the spinal cord. At the same time  we will implant an electrode array  a sort of second skin covering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement  and this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator that delivers stimulations that are tailored to the person's needs. This defines a personalized electrochemical neuroprosthesis that will enable locomotion during training with a newly designed supporting system. And my hope is that after several months of training  there may be enough remodeling of residual connection to allow locomotion without the robot  maybe even without pharmacology or stimulation. My hope here is to be able to create the personalized condition to boost the plasticity of the brain and the spinal cord. And this is a radically new concept that may apply to other neurological disorders  what I termed  personalized neuroprosthetics   where by sensing and stimulating neural interfaces  I implanted throughout the nervous system  in the brain  in the spinal cord  even in peripheral nerves  based on patient specific impairments. But not to replace the lost function  no    to help the brain help itself. And I hope this enticed your imagination  because I can promise to you this is not a matter of whether this revolution will occur  but when. And remember  we are only as great as our imagination  as big as our dream. Thank you. The two most likely largest inventions of our generation are the Internet and the mobile phone. They've changed the world. However  largely to our surprise  they also turned out to be the perfect tools for the surveillance state. It turned out that the capability to collect data  information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what we've been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about Western intelligence agencies  mostly U.S. intelligence agencies  watching over the rest of the world. We've heard about these starting with the revelations from June  . Edward Snowden started leaking information  top secret classified information  from the U.S. intelligence agencies  and we started learning about things like PRISM and XKeyscore and others. And these are examples of the kinds of programs U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now  against the whole rest of the world. And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell  well it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist. We are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined. And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah. Due to be opened very soon  it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center. You could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting. And it's a pretty big building. How big  Well  I can give you the numbers            square meters    but that doesn't really tell you very much. Maybe it's better to imagine it as a comparison. You think about the largest IKEA store you've ever been in. This is five times larger. How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store  Right  It's pretty big. We estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year. And this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever  keep it for extended periods of time  keep it for years  keep it for decades. And this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all. And what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone. Well  not exactly everyone  because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners. They can monitor foreigners when foreigners' data connections end up in the United States or pass through the United States. And monitoring foreigners doesn't sound too bad until you realize that I'm a foreigner and you're a foreigner. In fact     percent of the planet are foreigners. Right  So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us  all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet. But don't get me wrong  There are actually types of surveillance that are okay. I love freedom  but even I agree that some surveillance is fine. If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer  or they're trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting  and they have leads and they have suspects  then it's perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect's phone  and to intercept his Internet communications. I'm not arguing that at all  but that's not what programs like PRISM are about. They are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings. They're about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent. So the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this  well  the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations  there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations  saying that we knew all this already  we knew it was happening  there's nothing new here. And that's not true. Don't let anybody tell you that we knew this already  because we did not know this already. Our worst fears might have been something like this  but we didn't know this was happening. Now we know for a fact it's happening. We didn't know about this. We didn't know about PRISM. We didn't know about XKeyscore. We didn't know about Cybertrans. We didn't know about DoubleArrow. We did not know about Skywriter    all these different programs run by U.S. intelligence agencies. But now we do. And we did not know that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose. And what that means is that you take something which is secure  an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file  nobody can decrypt that file. Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file  it's going to take millions of years. So that's basically perfectly safe  uncrackable. You take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose  making all of us less secure as an end result. A real world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because  you know  bad people might have house alarms  but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result. Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind. But of course  these intelligence agencies are doing their job. This is what they have been told to do  do signals intelligence  monitor telecommunications  monitor Internet traffic. That's what they're trying to do  and since most  a very big part of the Internet traffic today is encrypted  they're trying to find ways around the encryption. One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms  which is a great example about how U.S. intelligence agencies are running loose. They are completely out of control  and they should be brought back under control. So what do we actually know about the leaks  Everything is based on the files leaked by Mr. Snowden. The very first PRISM slides from the beginning of June detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers  and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to. They even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers. So for example  they name the collection from Microsoft started on September           for Yahoo on the March           and then others  Google  Facebook  Skype  Apple and so on. And every single one of these companies denies. They all say that this simply isn't true  that they are not giving backdoor access to their data. Yet we have these files. So is one of the parties lying  or is there some other alternative explanation  And one explanation would be that these parties  these service providers  are not cooperating. Instead  they've been hacked. That would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked. In this case  they've been hacked by their own government. That might sound outlandish  but we already have cases where this has happened  for example  the case of the Flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the U.S. government  and which  to spread  subverted the security of the Windows Update network  meaning here  the company was hacked by their own government. And there's more evidence supporting this theory as well. Der Spiegel  from Germany  leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies. Inside NSA  the unit is called TAO  Tailored Access Operations  and inside GCHQ  which is the U.K. equivalent  it's called NAC  Network Analysis Centre. And these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this GCHQ intelligence agency from the United Kingdom targeting a telecom here in Belgium. And what this really means is that an E.U. country's intelligence agency is breaching the security of a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose  and they discuss it in their slides completely casually  business as usual. Here's the primary target  here's the secondary target  here's the teaming. They probably have a team building on Thursday evening in a pub. They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art like  you know   Success   when they gain access to services like this. What the hell  And then there's the argument that okay  yes  this might be going on  but then again  other countries are doing it as well. All countries spy. And maybe that's true. Many countries spy  not all of them  but let's take an example. Let's take  for example  Sweden. I'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the United States. When your data traffic goes through Sweden  their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law to intercept that traffic. All right  how many Swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use  every day  U.S. based services  like  you know  run Windows or OSX  or use Facebook or LinkedIn  or store their data in clouds like iCloud or Skydrive or DropBox  or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support  And the answer is  every single Swedish business leader does that every single day. And then we turn it around. How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services  And the answer is zero. So this is not balanced. It's not balanced by any means  not even close. And when we do have the occasional European success story  even those  then  typically end up being sold to the United States. Like  Skype used to be secure. It used to be end to end encrypted. Then it was sold to the United States. Today  it no longer is secure. So once again  we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose  making all of us less secure as an outcome. And then the argument that the United States is only fighting terrorists. It's the war on terror. You shouldn't worry about it. Well  it's not the war on terror. Yes  part of it is war on terror  and yes  there are terrorists  and they do kill and maim  and we should fight them  but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of European leaders  to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil  to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament  and I don't think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the E.U. Parliament  right  It's not the war on terror. Part of it might be  and there are terrorists  but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them  Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists  And the same thing with the Bill of Rights and all the amendments and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the E.U. conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom  Do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat  we are ready to do anything at all  But people are scared about terrorists  and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide. Feel free to survey me if that helps. And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn't thought about this long enough. Because we have this thing called privacy  and if you really think that you have nothing to hide  please make sure that's the first thing you tell me  because then I know that I should not trust you with any secrets  because obviously you can't keep a secret. But people are brutally honest with the Internet  and when these leaks started  many people were asking me about this. And I have nothing to hide. I'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal. Yet  I have nothing that I would in particular like to share with an intelligence agency  especially a foreign intelligence agency. And if we indeed need a Big Brother  I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother than a foreign Big Brother. And when the leaks started  the very first thing I tweeted about this was a comment about how  when you've been using search engines  you've been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence. And two minutes later  I got a reply by somebody called Kimberly from the United States challenging me  like  why am I worried about this  What am I sending to worry about this  Am I sending naked pictures or something  And my answer to Kimberly was that what I'm sending is none of your business  and it should be none of your government's business either. Because that's what it's about. It's about privacy. Privacy is nonnegotiable. It should be built in to all the systems we use. And one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines. You show me your search history  and I'll find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes. We are more honest with search engines than we are with our families. Search engines know more about you than your family members know about you. And this is all the kind of information we are giving away  we are giving away to the United States. And surveillance changes history. We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon. Imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today. And let me actually quote the president of Brazil  Ms. Dilma Rousseff. She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance. Her email was read  and she spoke at the United Nations Headquarters  and she said   If there is no right to privacy  there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion  and therefore  there can be no effective democracy.  That's what it's about. Privacy is the building block of our democracies. And to quote a fellow security researcher  Marcus Ranum  he said that the United States is right now treating the Internet as it would be treating one of its colonies. So we are back to the age of colonization  and we  the foreign users of the Internet  we should think about Americans as our masters. So Mr. Snowden  he's been blamed for many things. Some are blaming him for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations    and blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore for causing global warming. So  what is there to be done  Should we worry. No  we shouldn't worry. We should be angry  because this is wrong  and it's rude  and it should not be done. But that's not going to really change the situation. What's going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the United States. And that's much easier said than done. How do you do that  A single country  any single country in Europe cannot replace and build replacements for the U.S. made operating systems and cloud services. But maybe you don't have to do it alone. Maybe you can do it together with other countries. The solution is open source. By building together open  free  secure systems  we can go around such surveillance  and then one country doesn't have to solve the problem by itself. It only has to solve one little problem. And to quote a fellow security researcher  Haroon Meer  one country only has to make a small wave  but those small waves together become a tide  and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time  and the tide we will build with secure  free  open source systems  will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state. Thank you very much. So why do we learn mathematics  Essentially  for three reasons  calculation  application  and last  and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it  inspiration. Mathematics is the science of patterns  and we study it to learn how to think logically  critically and creatively  but too much of the mathematics that we learn in school is not effectively motivated  and when our students ask   Why are we learning this   then they often hear that they'll need it in an upcoming math class or on a future test. But wouldn't it be great if every once in a while we did mathematics simply because it was fun or beautiful or because it excited the mind  Now  I know many people have not had the opportunity to see how this can happen  so let me give you a quick example with my favorite collection of numbers  the Fibonacci numbers.  Applause  Yeah  I already have Fibonacci fans here. That's great. Now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways. From the standpoint of calculation  they're as easy to understand as one plus one  which is two. Then one plus two is three  two plus three is five  three plus five is eight  and so on. Indeed  the person we call Fibonacci was actually named Leonardo of Pisa  and these numbers appear in his book  Liber Abaci   which taught the Western world the methods of arithmetic that we use today. In terms of applications  Fibonacci numbers appear in nature surprisingly often. The number of petals on a flower is typically a Fibonacci number  or the number of spirals on a sunflower or a pineapple tends to be a Fibonacci number as well. In fact  there are many more applications of Fibonacci numbers  but what I find most inspirational about them are the beautiful number patterns they display. Let me show you one of my favorites. Suppose you like to square numbers  and frankly  who doesn't   Laughter  Let's look at the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers. So one squared is one  two squared is four  three squared is nine  five squared is     and so on. Now  it's no surprise that when you add consecutive Fibonacci numbers  you get the next Fibonacci number. Right  That's how they're created. But you wouldn't expect anything special to happen when you add the squares together. But check this out. One plus one gives us two  and one plus four gives us five. And four plus nine is     nine plus    is     and yes  the pattern continues. In fact  here's another one. Suppose you wanted to look at adding the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers. Let's see what we get there. So one plus one plus four is six. Add nine to that  we get   . Add     we get   . Add     we get    . Now look at those numbers. Those are not Fibonacci numbers  but if you look at them closely  you'll see the Fibonacci numbers buried inside of them. Do you see it  I'll show it to you. Six is two times three     is three times five     is five times eight  two  three  five  eight  who do we appreciate  Fibonacci  Of course. Now  as much fun as it is to discover these patterns  it's even more satisfying to understand why they are true. Let's look at that last equation. Why should the squares of one  one  two  three  five and eight add up to eight times     I'll show you by drawing a simple picture. We'll start with a one by one square and next to that put another one by one square. Together  they form a one by two rectangle. Beneath that  I'll put a two by two square  and next to that  a three by three square  beneath that  a five by five square  and then an eight by eight square  creating one giant rectangle  right  Now let me ask you a simple question  what is the area of the rectangle  Well  on the one hand  it's the sum of the areas of the squares inside it  right  Just as we created it. It's one squared plus one squared plus two squared plus three squared plus five squared plus eight squared. Right  That's the area. On the other hand  because it's a rectangle  the area is equal to its height times its base  and the height is clearly eight  and the base is five plus eight  which is the next Fibonacci number    . Right  So the area is also eight times   . Since we've correctly calculated the area two different ways  they have to be the same number  and that's why the squares of one  one  two  three  five and eight add up to eight times   . Now  if we continue this process  we'll generate rectangles of the form    by        by     and so on. Now check this out. If you divide    by eight  you get  .   . And if you divide the larger number by the smaller number  then these ratios get closer and closer to about  .     known to many people as the Golden Ratio  a number which has fascinated mathematicians  scientists and artists for centuries. Now  I show all this to you because  like so much of mathematics  there's a beautiful side to it that I fear does not get enough attention in our schools. We spend lots of time learning about calculation  but let's not forget about application  including  perhaps  the most important application of all  learning how to think. If I could summarize this in one sentence  it would be this  Mathematics is not just solving for x  it's also figuring out why. Thank you very much.  Give me liberty or give me death.  When Patrick Henry  the governor of Virginia  said these words in       he could never have imagined just how much they would come to resonate with American generations to come. At the time  these words were earmarked and targeted against the British  but over the last     years  they've come to embody what many Westerners believe  that freedom is the most cherished value  and that the best systems of politics and economics have freedom embedded in them. Who could blame them  Over the past hundred years  the combination of liberal democracy and private capitalism has helped to catapult the United States and Western countries to new levels of economic development. In the United States over the past hundred years  incomes have increased    times  and hundreds of thousands of people have been moved out of poverty. Meanwhile  American ingenuity and innovation has helped to spur industrialization and also helped in the creation and the building of things like household appliances such as refrigerators and televisions  motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets. It's no surprise  then  that even at the depths of the private capitalism crisis  President Obama said   The question before us is not whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom is unmatched.  Thus  there's understandably a deep seated presumption among Westerners that the whole world will decide to adopt private capitalism as the model of economic growth  liberal democracy  and will continue to prioritize political rights over economic rights. However  to many who live in the emerging markets  this is an illusion  and even though the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  which was signed in       was unanimously adopted  what it did was to mask a schism that has emerged between developed and developing countries  and the ideological beliefs between political and economic rights. This schism has only grown wider. Today  many people who live in the emerging markets  where    percent of the world's population lives  believe that the Western obsession with political rights is beside the point  and what is actually important is delivering on food  shelter  education and healthcare.  Give me liberty or give me death  is all well and good if you can afford it  but if you're living on less than one dollar a day  you're far too busy trying to survive and to provide for your family than to spend your time going around trying to proclaim and defend democracy. Now  I know many people in this room and around the world will think   Well actually  this is hard to grasp   because private capitalism and liberal democracy are held sacrosanct. But I ask you today  what would you do if you had to choose  What if you had to choose between a roof over your head and the right to vote  Over the last    years  I've had the privilege to travel to over    countries  many of them in the emerging markets  in Latin America  Asia  and my own continent of Africa. I've met with presidents  dissidents  policymakers  lawyers  teachers  doctors and the man on the street  and through these conversations  it's become clear to me that many people in the emerging markets believe that there's actually a split occurring between what people believe ideologically in terms of politics and economics in the West and that which people believe in the rest of the world. Now  don't get me wrong. I'm not saying people in the emerging markets don't understand democracy  nor am I saying that they wouldn't ideally like to pick their presidents or their leaders. Of course they would. However  I am saying that on balance  they worry more about where their living standard improvements are going to come from  and how it is their governments can deliver for them  than whether or not the government was elected by democracy. The fact of the matter is that this has become a very poignant question because there is for the first time in a long time a real challenge to the Western ideological systems of politics and economics  and this is a system that is embodied by China. And rather than have private capitalism  they have state capitalism. Instead of liberal democracy  they have de prioritized the democratic system. And they have also decided to prioritize economic rights over political rights. I put it to you today that it is this system that is embodied by China that is gathering momentum amongst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow  because they believe increasingly that it is the system that will promise the best and fastest improvements in living standards in the shortest period of time. If you will indulge me  I will spend a few moments explaining to you first why economically they've come to this belief. First of all  it's China's economic performance over the past    years. She's been able to produce record economic growth and meaningfully move many people out of poverty  specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty by moving over     million people out of indigence. It's not just in economics  but it's also in terms of living standards. We see that in China     percent of people had secondary school access. Today  it's closer to    percent. So in its totality  economic improvement has been quite significant. Second  China has been able to meaningfully improve its income inequality without changing the political construct. Today  the United States and China are the two leading economies in the world. They have vastly different political systems and different economic systems  one with private capitalism  another one broadly with state capitalism. However  these two countries have the identical GINI Coefficient  which is a measure of income equality. Perhaps what is more disturbing is that China's income equality has been improving in recent times  whereas that of the United States has been declining. Thirdly  people in the emerging markets look at China's amazing and legendary infrastructure rollout. This is not just about China building roads and ports and railways in her own country    she's been able to build        kilometers of road network in China and surpass that of the United States    but even if you look to places like Africa  China has been able to help tar the distance of Cape Town to Cairo  which is       miles  or three times the distance of New York to California. Now this is something that people can see and point to. Perhaps it's no surprise that in a      Pew survey  when surveyed  Africans in    countries said they thought that the Chinese were doing amazing things to improve their livelihoods by wide margins  by as much as    percent. Finally  China is also providing innovative solutions to age old social problems that the world faces. If you travel to Mogadishu  Mexico City or Mumbai  you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics continue to be a stumbling block to the delivery of medicine and healthcare in the rural areas. However  through a network of state owned enterprises  the Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas  using their companies to help deliver on these healthcare solutions. Ladies and gentlemen  it's no surprise that around the world  people are pointing at what China is doing and saying   I like that. I want that. I want to be able to do what China's doing. That is the system that seems to work.  I'm here to also tell you that there are lots of shifts occurring around what China is doing in the democratic stance. In particular  there is growing doubt among people in the emerging markets  when people now believe that democracy is no longer to be viewed as a prerequisite for economic growth. In fact  countries like Taiwan  Singapore  Chile  not just China  have shown that actually  it's economic growth that is a prerequisite for democracy. In a recent study  the evidence has shown that income is the greatest determinant of how long a democracy can last. The study found that if your per capita income is about       dollars a year  your democracy will last about eight and a half years. If your per capita income is between       and       dollars per year  then you're likely to only get    years of democracy. And only if your per capita income is above       dollars a year will you have democracy come hell or high water. What this is telling us is that we need to first establish a middle class that is able to hold the government accountable. But perhaps it's also telling us that we should be worried about going around the world and shoehorning democracy  because ultimately we run the risk of ending up with illiberal democracies  democracies that in some sense could be worse than the authoritarian governments that they seek to replace. The evidence around illiberal democracies is quite depressing. Freedom House finds that although    percent of the world's countries today are democratic     percent of those countries are illiberal in the sense that people don't have free speech or freedom of movement. But also  we're finding from Freedom House in a study that they published last year that freedom has been on the decline every year for the past seven years. What this says is that for people like me who care about liberal democracy  is we've got to find a more sustainable way of ensuring that we have a sustainable form of democracy in a liberal way  and that has its roots in economics. But it also says that as China moves toward being the largest economy in the world  something that is expected to happen by experts in       that this schism between the political and economic ideologies of the West and the rest is likely to widen. What might that world look like  Well  the world could look like more state involvement and state capitalism  greater protectionisms of nation states  but also  as I just pointed out a moment ago  ever declining political rights and individual rights. The question that is left for us in general is  what then should the West be doing  And I suggest that they have two options. The West can either compete or cooperate. If the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model  and in effect go around the world and continue to try and push an agenda of private capitalism and liberal democracy  this is basically going against headwinds  but it also would be a natural stance for the West to take because in many ways it is the antithesis of the Chinese model of de prioritizing democracy  and state capitalism. Now the fact of the matter is  if the West decides to compete  it will create a wider schism. The other option is for the West to cooperate  and by cooperating I mean giving the emerging market countries the flexibility to figure out in an organic way what political and economic system works best for them. Now I'm sure some of you in the room will be thinking  well  this is like ceding to China  and this is a way  in other words  for the West to take a back seat. But I put it to you that if the United States and European countries want to remain globally influential  they may have to consider cooperating in the short term in order to compete  and by that  they might have to focus more aggressively on economic outcomes to help create the middle class and therefore be able to hold government accountable and create the democracies that we really want. The fact of the matter is that instead of going around the world and haranguing countries for engaging with China  the West should be encouraging its own businesses to trade and invest in these regions. Instead of criticizing China for bad behavior  the West should be showing how it is that their own system of politics and economics is the superior one. And instead of shoehorning democracy around the world  perhaps the West should take a leaf out of its own history book and remember that it takes a lot of patience in order to develop the models and the systems that you have today. Indeed  the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer reminds us that it took the United States nearly     years from the time that the Constitution was written for there to be equal rights in the United States. Some people would argue that today there is still no equal rights. In fact  there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law. At its very best  the Western model speaks for itself. It's the model that put food on the table. It's the refrigerators. It put a man on the moon. But the fact of the matter is  although people back in the day used to point at the Western countries and say   I want that  I like that   there's now a new person in town in the form of a country  China. Today  generations are looking at China and saying   China can produce infrastructure  China can produce economic growth  and we like that.  Because ultimately  the question before us  and the question before seven billion people on the planet is  how can we create prosperity  People who care and will pivot towards the model of politics and economics in a very rational way  to those models that will ensure that they can have better living standards in the shortest period of time. As you leave here today  I would like to leave you with a very personal message  which is what it is that I believe we should be doing as individuals  and this is really about being open minded  open minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams of creating prosperity for people around the world  creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty for hundreds of millions of people  has to be based in being open minded  because these systems have good things and they have bad things. Just to illustrate  I went into my annals of myself. That's a picture of me. Awww.  Laughter  I was born and raised in Zambia in     . At the time of my birth  blacks were not issued birth certificates  and that law only changed in     . This is an affidavit from the Zambian government. I bring this to you to tell you that in    years  I've gone from not being recognized as a human being to standing in front of the illustrious TED crowd today to talk to you about my views. In this vein  we can increase economic growth. We can meaningfully put a dent in poverty. But also  it's going to require that we look at our assumptions  assumptions and strictures that we've grown up with around democracy  around private capitalism  around what creates economic growth and reduces poverty and creates freedoms. We might have to tear those books up and start to look at other options and be open minded to seek the truth. Ultimately  it's about transforming the world and making it a better place. Thank you very much. So  stepping down out of the bus  I headed back to the corner to head west en route to a braille training session. It was the winter of       and I had been blind for about a year. Things were going pretty well. Safely reaching the other side  I turned to the left  pushed the auto button for the audible pedestrian signal  and waited my turn. As it went off  I took off and safely got to the other side. Stepping onto the sidewalk  I then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me. I know there's a cafe on the corner  and they have chairs out in front  so I just adjusted to the left to get closer to the street. As I did  so slid the chair. I just figured I'd made a mistake  and went back to the right  and so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity. Now I was getting a little anxious. I went back to the left  and so slid the chair  blocking my path of travel. Now  I was officially freaking out. So I yelled   Who the hell's out there  What's going on   Just then  over my shout  I heard something else  a familiar rattle. It sounded familiar  and I quickly considered another possibility  and I reached out with my left hand  as my fingers brushed against something fuzzy  and I came across an ear  the ear of a dog  perhaps a golden retriever. Its leash had been tied to the chair as her master went in for coffee  and she was just persistent in her efforts to greet me  perhaps get a scratch behind the ear. Who knows  maybe she was volunteering for service. But that little story is really about the fears and misconceptions that come along with the idea of moving through the city without sight  seemingly oblivious to the environment and the people around you. So let me step back and set the stage a little bit. On St. Patrick's Day of       I reported to the hospital for surgery to remove a brain tumor. The surgery was successful. Two days later  my sight started to fail. On the third day  it was gone. Immediately  I was struck by an incredible sense of fear  of confusion  of vulnerability  like anybody would. But as I had time to stop and think  I actually started to realize I had a lot to be grateful for. In particular  I thought about my dad  who had passed away from complications from brain surgery. He was   . I was seven at the time. So although I had every reason to be fearful of what was ahead  and had no clue quite what was going to happen  I was alive. My son still had his dad. And besides  it's not like I was the first person ever to lose their sight. I knew there had to be all sorts of systems and techniques and training to have to live a full and meaningful  active life without sight. So by the time I was discharged from the hospital a few days later  I left with a mission  a mission to get out and get the best training as quickly as I could and get on to rebuilding my life. Within six months  I had returned to work. My training had started. I even started riding a tandem bike with my old cycling buddies  and was commuting to work on my own  walking through town and taking the bus. It was a lot of hard work. But what I didn't anticipate through that rapid transition was the incredible experience of the juxtaposition of my sighted experience up against my unsighted experience of the same places and the same people within such a short period of time. From that came a lot of insights  or outsights  as I called them  things that I learned since losing my sight. These outsights ranged from the trival to the profound  from the mundane to the humorous. As an architect  that stark juxtaposition of my sighted and unsighted experience of the same places and the same cities within such a short period of time has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights of the city itself. Paramount amongst those was the realization that  actually  cities are fantastic places for the blind. And then I was also surprised by the city's propensity for kindness and care as opposed to indifference or worse. And then I started to realize that it seemed like the blind seemed to have a positive influence on the city itself. That was a little curious to me. Let me step back and take a look at why the city is so good for the blind. Inherent with the training for recovery from sight loss is learning to rely on all your non visual senses  things that you would otherwise maybe ignore. It's like a whole new world of sensory information opens up to you. I was really struck by the symphony of subtle sounds all around me in the city that you can hear and work with to understand where you are  how you need to move  and where you need to go. Similarly  just through the grip of the cane  you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below  and over time you build a pattern of where you are and where you're headed. Similarly  just the sun warming one side of your face or the wind at your neck gives you clues about your alignment and your progression through a block and your movement through time and space. But also  the sense of smell. Some districts and cities have their own smell  as do places and things around you  and if you're lucky  you can even follow your nose to that new bakery that you've been looking for. All this really surprised me  because I started to realize that my unsighted experienced was so far more multi sensory than my sighted experience ever was. What struck me also was how much the city was changing around me. When you're sighted  everybody kind of sticks to themselves  you mind your own business. Lose your sight  though  and it's a whole other story. And I don't know who's watching who  but I have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me. And I'm not paranoid  but everywhere I go  I'm getting all sorts of advice  Go here  move there  watch out for this. A lot of the information is good. Some of it's helpful. A lot of it's kind of reversed. You've got to figure out what they actually meant. Some of it's kind of wrong and not helpful. But it's all good in the grand scheme of things. But one time I was in Oakland walking along Broadway  and came to a corner. I was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal  and as it went off  I was just about to step out into the street  when all of a sudden  my right hand was just gripped by this guy  and he yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk and was dragging me out across the street  speaking to me in Mandarin. It's like  there was no escape from this man's death grip  but he got me safely there. What could I do  But believe me  there are more polite ways to offer assistance. We don't know you're there  so it's kind of nice to say  Hello  first.  Would you like some help   But while in Oakland  I've really been struck by how much the city of Oakland changed as I lost my sight. I liked it sighted. It was fine. It's a perfectly great city. But once I lost my sight and was walking along Broadway  I was blessed every block of the way.  Bless you  man.   Go for it  brother.   God bless you.  I didn't get that sighted. And even without sight  I don't get that in San Francisco. And I know it bothers some of my blind friends  it's not just me. Often it's thought that that's an emotion that comes up out of pity. I tend to think that it comes out of our shared humanity  out of our togetherness  and I think it's pretty cool. In fact  if I'm feeling down  I just go to Broadway in downtown Oakland  I go for a walk  and I feel better like that  in no time at all. But also that it illustrates how disability and blindness sort of cuts across ethnic  social  racial  economic lines. Disability is an equal opportunity provider. Everybody's welcome. In fact  I've heard it said in the disability community that there are really only two types of people  There are those with disabilities  and there are those that haven't quite found theirs yet. It's a different way of thinking about it  but I think it's kind of beautiful  because it is certainly far more inclusive than the us versus them or the abled versus the disabled  and it's a lot more honest and respectful of the fragility of life. So my final takeaway for you is that not only is the city good for the blind  but the city needs us. And I'm so sure of that that I want to propose to you today that the blind be taken as the prototypical city dwellers when imagining new and wonderful cities  and not the people that are thought about after the mold has already been cast. It's too late then. So if you design a city with the blind in mind  you'll have a rich  walkable network of sidewalks with a dense array of options and choices all available at the street level. If you design a city with the blind in mind  sidewalks will be predictable and will be generous. The space between buildings will be well balanced between people and cars. In fact  cars  who needs them  If you're blind  you don't drive.  Laughter  They don't like it when you drive.  Laughter  If you design a city with the blind in mind  you design a city with a robust  accessible  well connected mass transit system that connects all parts of the city and the region all around. If you design a city with the blind in mind  there'll be jobs  lots of jobs. Blind people want to work too. They want to earn a living. So  in designing a city for the blind  I hope you start to realize that it actually would be a more inclusive  a more equitable  a more just city for all. And based on my prior sighted experience  it sounds like a pretty cool city  whether you're blind  whether you have a disability  or you haven't quite found yours yet. So thank you. I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid. I don't know his name  but I do know his story. He lives in a small village in southern Somalia. His village is near Mogadishu. Drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation. With nothing left for him there  he leaves for the big city  in this case  Mogadishu  the capital of Somalia. When he arrives  there are no opportunities  no jobs  no way forward. He ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu. Maybe a year passes  nothing. One day  he's approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch  then to dinner  to breakfast. He meets this dynamic group of people  and they give him a break. He's given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes  money to send back home to his family. He is introduced to this young woman. He eventually gets married. He starts this new life. He has a purpose in life. One beautiful day in Mogadishu  under an azure blue sky  a car bomb goes off. That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber  and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab  a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda. So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up  He was waiting. He was waiting for an opportunity  waiting to begin his future  waiting for a way forward  and this was the first thing that came along. This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood. And his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world. It is the story of the disenfranchised  unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in Johannesburg  sparks riots in London  who reaches out for something other than waithood. For young people  the promise of the city  the big city dream is that of opportunity  of jobs  of wealth  but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities. Often it's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates. By       three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of   . If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities  if we do not provide them opportunities  the story of waithood  the gateway to terrorism  to violence  to gangs  will be the story of cities  . . And in my city of birth  Mogadishu     percent of young people suffer from unemployment.    percent don't work  don't go to school. They pretty much do nothing. I went back to Mogadishu last month  and I went to visit Madina Hospital  the hospital I was born in. I remember standing in front of that bullet ridden hospital thinking  what if I had never left  What if I had been forced into that same state of waithood  Would I have become a terrorist  I'm not really sure about the answer. My reason for being in Mogadishu that month was actually to host a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit. I brought together about    young Somali leaders. We sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city. One of the young men in the room was Aden. He went to university in Mogadishu  graduated. There were no jobs  no opportunities. I remember him telling me  because he was a college graduate  unemployed  frustrated  that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations  to be recruited. They sought people like him out. But his story takes a different route. In Mogadishu  the biggest barrier to getting from point A to point B are the roads. Twenty three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system  and a motorbike can be the easiest way to get around. Aden saw an opportunity and seized it. He started a motorbike company. He began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn't normally afford them. He bought    bikes  with the help of family and friends  and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years. How is this story different  What makes his story different  I believe it is his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity. It's entrepreneurship  and I believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood. It empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking. And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs. I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings  Mohamed Mohamoud  a florist. He was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship. He's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen in over    years  and until recently  until Mohamed came along  if you wanted flowers at your wedding  you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad. If you asked someone   When was the last time you saw fresh flowers   for many who grew up under civil war  the answer would be   Never.  So Mohamed saw an opportunity. He started a landscaping and design floral company. He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu  and started growing tulips and lilies  which he said could survive the harsh Mogadishu climate. And he began delivering flowers to weddings  creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city  and he's now working on creating Mogadishu's first public park in    years. There's no public park in Mogadishu. He wants to create a space where families  young people  can come together  and  as he says  smell the proverbial roses. And he doesn't grow roses because they use too much water  by the way. So the first step is to inspire young people  and in that room  Mohamed's presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room. They had never really thought about starting up a business. They've thought about working for an NGO  working for the government  but his story  his innovation  really had a strong impact on them. He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity. He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs  that they could be change makers. By the end of the day  they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city. They came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems. So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step  but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality. They need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses. Connect young people with the resources they need  provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation  and you will create catalysts for urban growth. For me  entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business. It's about creating a social impact. Mohamed is not simply selling flowers. I believe he is selling hope. His Peace Park  and that's what he calls it  when it's created  will actually transform the way people see their city. Aden hired street kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him. He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood. These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities. So my suggestion is  turn youth into entrepreneurs  incubate and nurture their inherent innovation  and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and waithood. Thank you. Five years ago  I was on a sabbatical  and I returned to the medical university where I studied. I saw real patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in    years  in fact since I became a management consultant. There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent. The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost cutting  and the second thing  which really bothered me  actually  was that several of the colleagues I met  former friends from medical school  who I knew to be some of the smartest  most motivated  engaged and passionate people I'd ever met  many of them had turned cynical  disengaged  or had distanced themselves from hospital management. So with this focus on cost cutting  I asked myself  are we forgetting the patient  Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare. It's a big part of the national budgets. And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth. In some countries  we have long waiting times for patients for surgery. In other countries  new drugs are not being reimbursed  and therefore don't reach patients. In several countries  doctors and nurses are the targets  to some extent  for the governments. After all  the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses. You choose an expensive lab test  you choose to operate on an old and frail patient. So  by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians  this is a way to hold costs down. And ultimately  some physicians will say today that they don't have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients. So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated. At BCG  we looked at this  and we asked ourselves  this can't be the right way of managing healthcare. And so we took a step back and we said   What is it that we are trying to achieve   Ultimately  in the healthcare system  we're aiming at improving health for the patients  and we need to do so at a limited  or affordable  cost. We call this value based healthcare. On the screen behind me  you see what we mean by value  outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend. This was described beautifully in a book in      by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg. On this picture  you have my father in law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters. When we started doing our research at BCG  we decided not to look so much at the costs  but to look at the quality instead  and in the research  one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw. You compare hospitals in a country  you'll find some that are extremely good  but you'll find a large number that are vastly much worse. The differences were dramatic. Erik  my father in law  he suffers from prostate cancer  and he probably needs surgery. Now living in Europe  he can choose to go to Germany that has a well reputed healthcare system. If he goes there and goes to the average hospital  he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about    percent  so he would have to start wearing diapers again. You flip a coin. Fifty percent risk. That's quite a lot. If he instead would go to Hamburg  and to a clinic called the Martini Klinik  the risk would be only one in   . Either you a flip a coin  or you have a one in    risk. That's a huge difference  a seven fold difference. When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases  we see these huge differences. But you and I don't know. We don't have the data. And often  the data actually doesn't exist. Nobody knows. So going the hospital is a lottery. Now  it doesn't have to be that way. There is hope. In the late '  s  there were a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting  and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery. To the left of this slide  you see a variety of metal pieces  artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip. They all realized they had their individual way of operating. They all argued that   My technique is the best   but none of them actually knew  and they admitted that. So they said   We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what's best.  So they in fact spent two years debating   So what is quality in hip surgery    Oh  we should measure this.   No  we should measure that.  And they finally agreed. And once they had agreed  they started measuring  and started sharing the data. Very quickly  they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in  it actually lasted a lot longer  and most patients would never have to be re operated on in their lifetime. They published the data  and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country. Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense. Since then  they publish every year. Once a year  they publish the league table  who's best  who's at the bottom  And they visit each other to try to learn  so a continuous cycle of improvement. For many years  Swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world  at least for those who actually were measuring  and many were not. Now I found this principle really exciting. So the physicians get together  they agree on what quality is  they start measuring  they share the data  they find who's best  and they learn from it. Continuous improvement. Now  that's not the only exciting part. That's exciting in itself. But if you bring back the cost side of the equation  and look at that  it turns out  those who have focused on quality  they actually also have the lowest costs  although that's not been the purpose in the first place. So if you look at the hip surgery story again  there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden. They looked at how many patients have needed to be re operated on seven years after the first surgery. In the United States  the number was three times higher than in Sweden. So many unnecessary surgeries  and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period. Now  you can imagine how much savings there would be for society. We did a study where we looked at OECD data. OECD does  every so often  look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries. The United States has  for many diseases  actually a quality which is below the average in OECD. Now  if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality  and raise quality just to the level of average OECD  it would save the American people     billion U.S. dollars a year. That's    percent of the budget  of the healthcare budget of the country. Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic  and it's all logical  but is it possible  This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare  and I would argue that not only can it be done  but it has to be done. The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system. In my practice as a consultant  I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year. The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients. Physicians are  like most of you in the audience  very competitive. They were always best in class. We were always best in class. And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do  they will do whatever it takes to improve. But most of them don't know. But physicians have another characteristic. They actually thrive from peer recognition. If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results  they will share. They will share the information on how to improve. So it is  by measuring and creating transparency  you get a cycle of continuous improvement  which is what this slide shows. Now  you may say this is a nice idea  but this isn't only an idea. This is happening in reality. We're creating a global community  and a large global community  where we'll be able to measure and compare what we achieve. Together with two academic institutions  Michael Porter at Harvard Business School  and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden  BCG has formed something we call ICHOM. You may think that's a sneeze  but it's not a sneeze  it's an acronym. It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement. We're bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss  disease by disease  what is really quality  what should we measure  and to make those standards global. They've worked    four working groups have worked during the past year  cataracts  back pain  coronary artery disease  which is  for instance  heart attack  and prostate cancer. The four groups will publish their data in November of this year. That's the first time we'll be comparing apples to apples  not only within a country  but between countries. Next year  we're planning to do eight diseases  the year after    . In three years' time  we plan to have covered    percent of the disease burden. Compare apples to apples. Who's better  Why is that  Five months ago  I led a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe. They have a new CEO  and she has a vision  I want to manage my big institution much more on quality  outcomes that matter to patients. This particular day  we sat in a workshop together with physicians  nurses and other staff  discussing leukemia in children. The group discussed  how do we measure quality today  Can we measure it better than we do  We discussed  how do we treat these kids  what are important improvements  And we discussed what are the costs for these patients  can we do treatment more efficiently  There was an enormous energy in the room. There were so many ideas  so much enthusiasm. At the end of the meeting  the chairman of the department  he stood up. He looked over the group and he said    first he raised his hand  I forgot that    he raised his hand  clenched his fist  and then he said to the group   Thank you. Thank you. Today  we're finally discussing what this hospital does the right way.  By measuring value in healthcare  that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients  we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution. I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution  and I'm convinced that the founder of modern medicine  the Greek Hippocrates  who always put the patient at the center  he would smile in his grave. Thank you. Today I am going to teach you how to play my favorite game  massively multiplayer thumb wrestling. It's the only game in the world that I know of that allows you  the player  the opportunity to experience    positive emotions in    seconds or less. This is true  so if you play this game with me today for just one single minute  you will get to feel joy  relief  love  surprise  pride  curiosity  excitement  awe and wonder  contentment  and creativity  all in the span of one minute. So this sounds pretty good  right  Now you're willing to play. In order to teach you this game  I'm going to need some volunteers to come up onstage really quickly  and we're going to do a little hands on demo. While they're coming up  I should let you know  this game was invented    years ago by an artists' collective in Austria named Monochrom. So thank you  Monochrom. Okay  so most people are familiar with traditional  two person thumb wrestling. Sunni  let's just remind them. One  two  three  four   I declare a thumb war  and we wrestle  and of course Sunni beats me because she's the best. Now the first thing about massively multiplayer thumb wrestling  we're the gamer generation. There are a billion gamers on the planet now  so we need more of a challenge. So the first thing we need is more thumbs. So Eric  come on over. So we could get three thumbs together  and Peter could join us. We could even have four thumbs together  and the way you win is you're the first person to pin someone else's thumb. This is really important. You can't  like  wait while they fight it out and then swoop in at the last minute. That is not how you win. Ah  who did that  Eric you did that. So Eric would have won. He was the first person to pin my thumb. Okay  so that's the first rule  and we can see that three or four is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node  but if you feel ambitious  you don't have to hold back. We can really go for it. So you can see up here. Now the only other rule you need to remember is  gamer generation  we like a challenge. I happen to notice you all have some thumbs you're not using. So I think we should kind of get some more involved. And if we had just four people  we would do it just like this  and we would try and wrestle both thumbs at the same time. Perfect. Now  if we had more people in the room  instead of just wrestling in a closed node  we might reach out and try and grab some other people. And in fact  that's what we're going to do right now. We're going to try and get all  something like  I don't know        thumbs in this room connected in a single node. And we have to connect both levels  so if you're up there  you're going to be reaching down and reaching up. Now    Laughter    before we get started    This is great. You're excited to play.   before we get started  can I have the slides back up here really quick  because if you get good at this game  I want you to know there are some advanced levels. So this is the kind of simple level  right  But there are advanced configurations. This is called the Death Star Configuration. Any Star Wars fans  And this one's called the M bius Strip. Any science geeks  you get that one. This is the hardest level. This is the extreme. So we'll stick with the normal one for now  and I'm going to give you    seconds  every thumb into the node  connect the upper and the lower levels  you guys go on down there. Thirty seconds. Into the network. Make the node. Stand up  It's easier if you stand up. Everybody  up up up up up  Stand up  my friends. All right. Don't start wrestling yet. If you have a free thumb  wave it around  make sure it gets connected. Okay. We need to do a last minute thumb check. If you have a free thumb  wave it around to make sure. Grab that thumb  Reach behind you. There you go. Any other thumbs  Okay  on the count of three  you're going to go. Try to keep track. Grab  grab  grab it. Okay  One  two  three  go  Did you win  You got it  You got it  Excellent  Well done. Thank you. Thank you very much. All right. While you are basking in the glow of having won your first massively multiplayer thumb wrestling game  let's do a quick recap on the positive emotions. So curiosity. I said  massively multiplayer thumb wrestling.  You were like   What the hell is she talking about   So I provoked a little curiosity. Creativity  it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all the thumbs into the node. I'm reaching around and I'm reaching up. So you used creativity. That was great. How about surprise  The actual feeling of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once is pretty surprising. You heard that sound go up in the room. We had excitement. As you started to wrestle  maybe you're starting to win or this person's  like  really into it  so you kind of get the excitement going. We have relief. You got to stand up. You've been sitting for awhile  so the physical relief  getting to shake it out. We had joy. You were laughing  smiling. Look at your faces. This room is full of joy. We had some contentment. I didn't see anybody sending text messages or checking their email while we were playing  so you were totally content to be playing. The most important three emotions  awe and wonder  we had everybody connected physically for a minute. When was the last time you were at TED and you got to connect physically with every single person in the room  And it's truly awesome and wondrous. And speaking of physical connection  you guys know I love the hormone oxytocin  you release oxytocin  you feel bonded to everyone in the room. You guys know that the best way to release oxytocin quickly is to hold someone else's hand for at least six seconds. You guys were all holding hands for way more than six seconds  so we are all now biochemically primed to love each other. That is great. And the last emotion of pride. How many people are like me. Just admit it. You lost both your thumbs. It just didn't work out for you. That's okay  because you learned a new skill today. You learned  from scratch  a game you never knew before. Now you know how to play it. You can teach other people. So congratulations. How many of you won just won thumb  All right. I have very good news for you. According to the official rules of massively multiplayer thumb wrestling  this makes you a grandmaster of the game. Because there aren't that many people who know how to play  we have to kind of accelerate the program more than a game like chess. So congratulations  grandmasters. Win one thumb once  you will become a grandmaster. Did anybody win both their thumbs  Yes. Awesome. Okay. Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status. You guys  according to the rules  are legendary grandmasters  so congratulations. I will just leave you with this tip  if you want to play again. The best way to become a legendary grandmaster  you've got your two nodes going on. Pick off the one that looks easiest. They're not paying attention. They look kind of weak. Focus on that one and do something crazy with this arm. As soon as you win  suddenly stop. Everybody is thrown off. You go in for the kill. That's how you become a legendary grandmaster of massively multiplayer thumb wrestling. Thank you for letting me teach you my favorite game. Wooo   Applause  Thank you.  Applause  When we think of Nepal  we tend to think of the snow capped mountains of the Himalayas  the crystal clear still waters of its alpine lakes  or the huge expanse of its grasslands. What some of us may not realize is that in the Himalayan foothills  where the climate is much warmer and the landscape much greener  there lives a great diversity of wildlife  including the one horned rhinoceros  the Asian elephant and the Bengal tiger. But unfortunately  these animals are under constant threat from poachers who hunt and kill them for their body parts. To stop the killing of these animals  battalions of soldiers and rangers are sent to protect Nepal's national parks  but that is not an easy task  because these soldiers have to patrol thousands of hectares of forests on foot or elephant backs. It is also risky for these soldiers when they get into gunfights with poachers  and therefore Nepal is always looking for new ways to help with protecting the forests and wildlife. Well recently  Nepal acquired a new tool in the fight against wildlife crime  and these are drones  or more specifically  conservation drones. For about a year now  my colleagues and I have been building drones for Nepal and training the park protection personnel on the use of these drones. Not only does a drone give you a bird's eye view of the landscape  but it also allows you to capture detailed  high resolution images of objects on the ground. This  for example  is a pair of rhinoceros taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day in the lowlands of Nepal. Now we believe that drones have tremendous potential  not only for combating wildlife crime  but also for monitoring the health of these wildlife populations. So what is a drone  Well  the kind of drone I'm talking about is simply a model aircraft fitted with an autopilot system  and this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer  a GPS  a compass  a barometric altimeter and a few other sensors. Now a drone like this is meant to carry a useful payload  such as a video camera or a photographic camera. It also requires a software that allows the user to program a mission  to tell the drone where to go. Now people I talk to are often surprised when they hear that these are the only four components that make a conservation drone  but they are even more surprised when I tell them how affordable these components are. The facts is  a conservation drone doesn't cost very much more than a good laptop computer or a decent pair of binoculars. So now that you've built your own conservation drone  you probably want to go fly it  but how does one fly a drone  Well  actually  you don't  because the drone flies itself. All you have to do is to program a mission to tell the drone where to fly. But you simply do that by clicking on a few way points on the Google Maps interface using the open source software. Those missions could be as simple as just a few way points  or they could be slightly longer and more complicated  to fly along a river system. Sometimes  we fly the drone in a lawnmower type pattern and take pictures of that area  and those pictures can be processed to produce a map of that forest. Other researchers might want to fly the drone along the boundaries of a forest to watch out for poachers or people who might be trying to enter the forest illegally. Now whatever your mission is  once you've programmed it  you simply upload it to the autopilot system  bring your drone to the field  and launch it simply by tossing it in the air. And often we'll go about this mission taking pictures or videos along the way  and usually at that point  we will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee  sit back  and relax for the next few minutes  although some of us sit back and panic for the next few minutes worrying that the drone will not return. Usually it does  and when it does  it even lands automatically. So what can we do with a conservation drone  Well  when we built our first prototype drone  our main objective was to fly it over a remote rainforest in North Sumatra  Indonesia  to look for the nest of a species of great ape known as the orangutan. The reason we wanted to do that was because we needed to know how many individuals of this species are still left in that forest. Now the traditional method of surveying for orangutans is to walk the forest on foot carrying heavy equipment and to use a pair of binoculars to look up in the treetops where you might find an orangutan or its nest. Now as you can imagine  that is a very time consuming  labor intensive  and costly process  so we were hoping that drones could significantly reduce the cost of surveying for orangutan populations in Indonesia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. So we were very excited when we captured our first pair of orangutan nests on camera. And this is it  this is the first ever picture of orangutan nests taken with a drone. Since then we have taken pictures of dozens of these nests from around various parts of Southeast Asia  and we're now working with computer scientists to develop algorithms that can automatically count the number of nests from the thousands of photos we've collected so far. But nests are not the only objects these drones can detect. This is a wild orangutan happily feeding on top of a palm tree  seemingly oblivious to our drone that was flying overhead  not once but several times. We've also taken pictures of other animals including forest buffalos in Gabon  elephants  and even turtle nests. But besides taking pictures of just the animals themselves  we also take pictures of the habitats these animals live in  because we want to keep track of the health of these habitats. Sometimes  we zoom out a little and look at other things that might be happening in the landscape. This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra. Now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation in that part of the world  so we wanted to use this new drone technology to keep track of the spread of these plantations in Southeast Asia. But drones could also be used to keep track of illegal logging activities. This is a recently logged forest  again in Sumatra. You could even still see the processed wooden planks left on the ground. But perhaps the most exciting part about taking pictures from the air is we could later stitch these pictures together using special software to create a map of the entire landscape  and this map gives us crucial information for monitoring land use change  to let us know where and when plantations might be expanding  where forests might be contracting  or where fires might be breaking out. Aerial images could also be processed to produce three dimensional computer models of forests. Now these models are not just visually appealing  but they are also geometrically accurate  which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees  calculate surface area  the volume of vegetation  and so on  all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests. Recently  we've also begun experimenting with thermal imaging cameras. Now these cameras can detect heat emitting objects from the ground  and therefore they are very useful for detecting poachers or their campfires at night. So I've told you quite a lot about what conservation drones are  how you might operate one of these drones  and what a drone could do for you. I will now tell you where conservation drones are being used around the world. We built our first prototype drones in Switzerland. We brought a few of these to Indonesia for the first few test flights. Since then  we've been building drones for our collaborators from around the world  and these include fellow biologists and partners from major conservation organizations. Perhaps the best and most rewarding part about working with these collaborators is the feedback they give us on how to improve our drones. Building drones for us is a constant work in progress. We are constantly trying to improve them in terms of their range  their ruggedness  and the amount of payload they can carry. We also work with collaborators to discover new ways of using these drones. For example  camera traps are a common tool used by biologists to take pictures of shy animals hiding in the forests  but these are motion activated cameras  so they snap a picture every time an animal crosses their path. But the problem with camera traps is that the researcher has to go back to the forest every so often to retrieve those images  and that takes a lot of time  especially if there are dozens or hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest. Now a drone could be designed to perform the task much more efficiently. This drone  carrying a special sensor  could be flown over the forest and remotely download these images from wi fi enabled cameras. Radio collars are another tool that's commonly used by biologists. Now these collars are put onto animals. They transmit a radio signal which allows the researcher to track the movements of these animals across the landscape. But the traditional way of tracking animals is pretty ridiculous  because it requires the researcher to be walking on the ground carrying a huge and cumbersome radio antenna  not unlike those old TV antennae we used to have on our rooftops. Some of us still do. A drone could be used to do the same job much more efficiently. Why not equip a drone with a scanning radio receiver  fly that over the forest canopy in a certain pattern which would allow the user or the operator to triangulate the location of these radio collared animals remotely without having to step foot in the forest. A third and perhaps most exciting way of using these drones is to fly them to a really remote  never explored before rainforest somewhere hidden in the tropics  and parachute down a tiny spy microphone that would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls of mammals  birds  amphibians  the Yeti  the Sasquatch  Bigfoot  whatever. That would give us biologists a pretty good idea of what animals might be living in those forests. And finally  I would like to show you the latest version of our conservation drone. The MAJA drone has a wingspan of about two meters. It weighs only about two kilograms  but it can carry half its weight. It is a fully autonomous system. During its mission  it can even transmit a live video feed back to a ground station laptop  which allows the user to see what the drone is seeing in real time. It carries a variety of sensors  and the photo quality of some of these sensors can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel. This drone can stay in the air for    to    minutes  which gives it a range of up to    kilometers. That is quite sufficient for most of our conservation applications. Now  conservation drones began as a crazy idea from two biologists who are just deeply passionate about this technology. And we believe  strongly believe  that drones can and will be a game changer for conservation research and applications. We've had our fair share of skeptics and critics who thought that we were just fooling around with toy planes. And in a way  they are right. I mean  let's be honest  drones are the ultimate toys for boys. But at the same time  we've also gotten to know many wonderful colleagues and collaborators who share our vision and see the potential of conservation drones. To us  it is obvious that conservation biologists and practitioners should make full use of every available tool  including drones  in our fight to save the last remaining forests and wildlife of this planet. Thank you. Technology can change our understanding of nature. Take for example the case of lions. For centuries  it's been said that female lions do all of the hunting out in the open savanna  and male lions do nothing until it's time for dinner. You've heard this too  I can tell. Well recently  I led an airborne mapping campaign in the Kruger National Park in South Africa. Our colleagues put GPS tracking collars on male and female lions  and we mapped their hunting behavior from the air. The lower left shows a lion sizing up a herd of impala for a kill  and the right shows what I call the lion viewshed. That's how far the lion can see in all directions until his or her view is obstructed by vegetation. And what we found is that male lions are not the lazy hunters we thought them to be. They just use a different strategy. Whereas the female lions hunt out in the open savanna over long distances  usually during the day  male lions use an ambush strategy in dense vegetation  and often at night. This video shows the actual hunting viewsheds of male lions on the left and females on the right. Red and darker colors show more dense vegetation  and the white are wide open spaces. And this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level of hunting male and female lions. All of a sudden  you get a very clear understanding of the very spooky conditions under which male lions do their hunting. I bring up this example to begin  because it emphasizes how little we know about nature. There's been a huge amount of work done so far to try to slow down our losses of tropical forests  and we are losing our forests at a rapid rate  as shown in red on the slide. I find it ironic that we're doing so much  yet these areas are fairly unknown to science. So how can we save what we don't understand  Now I'm a global ecologist and an Earth explorer with a background in physics and chemistry and biology and a lot of other boring subjects  but above all  I'm obsessed with what we don't know about our planet. So I created this  the Carnegie Airborne Observatory  or CAO. It may look like a plane with a fancy paint job  but I packed it with over       kilos of high tech sensors  computers  and a very motivated staff of Earth scientists and pilots. Two of our instruments are very unique  one is called an imaging spectrometer that can actually measure the chemical composition of plants as we fly over them. Another one is a set of lasers  very high powered lasers  that fire out of the bottom of the plane  sweeping across the ecosystem and measuring it at nearly         times per second in high resolution  D. Here's an image of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco  not far from where I live. Although we flew straight over this bridge  we imaged it in  D  captured its color in just a few seconds. But the real power of the CAO is its ability to capture the actual building blocks of ecosystems. This is a small town in the Amazon  imaged with the CAO. We can slice through our data and see  for example  the  D structure of the vegetation and the buildings  or we can use the chemical information to actually figure out how fast the plants are growing as we fly over them. The hottest pinks are the fastest growing plants. And we can see biodiversity in ways that you never could have imagined. This is what a rainforest might look like as you fly over it in a hot air balloon. This is how we see a rainforest  in kaleidoscopic color that tells us that there are many species living with one another. But you have to remember that these trees are literally bigger than whales  and what that means is that they're impossible to understand just by walking on the ground below them. So our imagery is  D  it's chemical  it's biological  and this tells us not only the species that are living in the canopy  but it tells us a lot of information about the rest of the species that occupy the rainforest. Now I created the CAO in order to answer questions that have proven extremely challenging to answer from any other vantage point  such as from the ground  or from satellite sensors. I want to share three of those questions with you today. The first questions is  how do we manage our carbon reserves in tropical forests  Tropical forests contain a huge amount of carbon in the trees  and we need to keep that carbon in those forests if we're going to avoid any further global warming. Unfortunately  global carbon emissions from deforestation now equals the global transportation sector. That's all ships  airplanes  trains  and automobiles combined. So it's understandable that policy negotiators have been working hard to reduce deforestation  but they're doing it on landscapes that are hardly known to science. If you don't know where the carbon is exactly  in detail  how can you know what you're losing  Basically  we need a high tech accounting system. With our system  we're able to see the carbon stocks of tropical forests in utter detail. The red shows  obviously  closed canopy tropical forest  and then you see the cookie cutting  or the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens. It's like cutting a cake except this cake is about whale deep. And yet  we can zoom in and see the forest and the trees at the same time. And what's amazing is  even though we flew very high above this forest  later on in analysis  we can go in and actually experience the treetrops  leaf by leaf  branch by branch  just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves. We've been using the technology to explore and to actually put out the first carbon geographies in high resolution in faraway places like the Amazon Basin and not so faraway places like the United States and Central America. What I'm going to do is I'm going to take you on a high resolution  first time tour of the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Panama. The colors are going to be going from red to blue. Red is extremely high carbon stocks  your largest cathedral forests you can imagine  and blue are very low carbon stocks. And let me tell you  Peru alone is an amazing place  totally unknown in terms of its carbon geography until today. We can fly to this area in northern Peru and see super high carbon stocks in red  and the Amazon River and floodplain cutting right through it. We can go to an area of utter devastation caused by deforestation in blue  and the virus of deforestation spreading out in orange. We can also fly to the southern Andes to see the tree line and see exactly how the carbon geography ends as we go up into the mountain system. And we can go to the biggest swamp in the western Amazon. It's a watery dreamworld akin to Jim Cameron's  Avatar.  We can go to one of the smallest tropical countries  Panama  and see also a huge range of carbon variation  from high in red to low in blue. Unfortunately  most of the carbon is lost in the lowlands  but what you see that's left  in terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds  is the stuff that's up in the mountains. One interesting exception to this is right in the middle of your screen. You're seeing the buffer zone around the Panama Canal. That's in the reds and yellows. The canal authorities are using force to protect their watershed and global commerce. This kind of carbon mapping has transformed conservation and resource policy development. It's really advancing our ability to save forests and to curb climate change. My second question  How do we prepare for climate change in a place like the Amazon rainforest  Let me tell you  I spend a lot of time in these places  and we're seeing the climate changing already. Temperatures are increasing  and what's really happening is we're getting a lot of droughts  recurring droughts. The      mega drought is shown here with red showing an area about the size of Western Europe. The Amazon was so dry in      that even the main stem of the Amazon river itself dried up partially  as you see in the photo in the lower portion of the slide. What we found is that in very remote areas  these droughts are having a big negative impact on tropical forests. For example  these are all of the dead trees in red that suffered mortality following the      drought. This area happens to be on the border of Peru and Brazil  totally unexplored  almost totally unknown scientifically. So what we think  as Earth scientists  is species are going to have to migrate with climate change from the east in Brazil all the way west into the Andes and up into the mountains in order to minimize their exposure to climate change. One of the problems with this is that humans are taking apart the western Amazon as we speak. Look at this     square kilometer gash in the forest created by gold miners. You see the forest in green in  D  and you see the effects of gold mining down below the soil surface. Species have nowhere to migrate in a system like this  obviously. If you haven't been to the Amazon  you should go. It's an amazing experience every time  no matter where you go. You're going to probably see it this way  on a river. But what happens is a lot of times the rivers hide what's really going on back in the forest itself. We flew over this same river  imaged the system in  D. The forest is on the left. And then we can digitally remove the forest and see what's going on below the canopy. And in this case  we found gold mining activity  all of it illegal  set back away from the river's edge  as you'll see in those strange pockmarks coming up on your screen on the right. Don't worry  we're working with the authorities to deal with this and many  many other problems in the region. So in order to put together a conservation plan for these unique  important corridors like the western Amazon and the Andes Amazon corridor  we have to start making geographically explicit plans now. How do we do that if we don't know the geography of biodiversity in the region  if it's so unknown to science  So what we've been doing is using the laser guided spectroscopy from the CAO to map for the first time the biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest. Here you see actual data showing different species in different colors. Reds are one type of species  blues are another  and greens are yet another. And when we take this together and scale up to the regional level  we get a completely new geography of biodiversity unknown prior to this work. This tells us where the big biodiversity changes occur from habitat to habitat  and that's really important because it tells us a lot about where species may migrate to and migrate from as the climate shifts. And this is the pivotal information that's needed by decision makers to develop protected areas in the context of their regional development plans. And third and final question is  how do we manage biodiversity on a planet of protected ecosystems  The example I started out with about lions hunting  that was a study we did behind the fence line of a protected area in South Africa. And the truth is  much of Africa's nature is going to persist into the future in protected areas like I show in blue on the screen. This puts incredible pressure and responsibility on park management. They need to do and make decisions that will benefit all of the species that they're protecting. Some of their decisions have really big impacts. For example  how much and where to use fire as a management tool  Or  how to deal with a large species like elephants  which may  if their populations get too large  have a negative impact on the ecosystem and on other species. And let me tell you  these types of dynamics really play out on the landscape. In the foreground is an area with lots of fire and lots of elephants  wide open savanna in blue  and just a few trees. As we cross this fence line  now we're getting into an area that has had protection from fire and zero elephants  dense vegetation  a radically different ecosystem. And in a place like Kruger  the soaring elephant densities are a real problem. I know it's a sensitive issue for many of you  and there are no easy answers with this. But what's good is that the technology we've developed and we're working with in South Africa  for example  is allowing us to map every single tree in the savanna  and then through repeat flights we're able to see which trees are being pushed over by elephants  in the red as you see on the screen  and how much that's happening in different types of landscapes in the savanna. That's giving park managers a very first opportunity to use tactical management strategies that are more nuanced and don't lead to those extremes that I just showed you. So really  the way we're looking at protected areas nowadays is to think of it as tending to a circle of life  where we have fire management  elephant management  those impacts on the structure of the ecosystem  and then those impacts affecting everything from insects up to apex predators like lions. Going forward  I plan to greatly expand the airborne observatory. I'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit so we can manage the entire planet with technologies like this. Until then  you're going to find me flying in some remote place that you've never heard of. I just want to end by saying that technology is absolutely critical to managing our planet  but even more important is the understanding and wisdom to apply it. Thank you. Sarge Salman  All the way from Los Altos Hills  California  Mr. Henry Evans. Henry Evans  Hello. My name is Henry Evans  and until August           I was living my version of the American dream. I grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis. My dad was a lawyer. My mom was a homemaker. My six siblings and I were good kids  but caused our fair share of trouble. After high school  I left home to study and learn more about the world. I went to Notre Dame University and graduated with degrees in accounting and German  including spending a year of study in Austria. Later on  I earned an MBA at Stanford. I married my high school sweetheart  Jane. I am lucky to have her. Together  we raised four wonderful children. I worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder  eventually becoming a chief financial officer in Silicon Valley  a job I really enjoyed. My family and I bought our first and only home on December           a fixer upper in a beautiful spot of Los Altos Hills  California  from where I am speaking to you now. We were looking forward to rebuilding it  but eight months after we moved in  I suffered a stroke like attack caused by a birth defect. Overnight  I became a mute quadriplegic at the ripe old age of   . It took me several years  but with the help of an incredibly supportive family  I finally decided life was still worth living. I became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled. Head tracking devices sold commercially by the company Madentec convert my tiny head movements into cursor movements  and enable my use of a regular computer. I can surf the web  exchange email with people  and routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins in online word games. This technology allows me to remain engaged  mentally active  and feel like I am a part of the world. One day  I was lying in bed watching CNN  when I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp of the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech demonstrating a PR  robot. I emailed Charlie and Steve Cousins of Willow Garage  and we formed the Robots for Humanity project. For about two years  Robots for Humanity developed ways for me to use the PR  as my body surrogate. I shaved myself for the first time in    years. From my home in California  I shaved Charlie in Atlanta.  Laughter  I handed out Halloween candy. I opened my refrigerator on my own. I began doing tasks around the house. I saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities to live and contribute  both for myself and others in my circumstance. All of us have disabilities in one form or another. For example  if either of us wants to go    miles an hour  both of us will need an assistive device called a car. Your disability doesn't make you any less of a person  and neither does mine. By the way  check out my sweet ride.  Laughter  Since birth  we have both suffered from the inability to fly on our own. Last year  Kaijen Hsiao of Willow Garage connected with me Chad Jenkins. Chad showed me how easy it is to purchase and fly aerial drones. It was then I realized that I could also use an aerial drone to expand the worlds of bedridden people through flight  giving a sense of movement and control that is incredible. Using a mouse cursor I control with my head  these web interfaces allow me to see video from the robot and send control commands by pressing buttons in a web browser. With a little practice  I became good enough with this interface to drive around my home on my own. I could look around our garden and see the grapes we are growing. I inspected the solar panels on our roof.  Laughter  One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone on our basketball hoop. I went even further by seeing if I could use a head mounted display  the Oculus Rift  as modified by Fighting Walrus  to have an immersive experience controlling the drone. With Chad's group at Brown  I regularly fly drones around his lab several times a week  from my home       miles away. All work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic  so we also find time to play friendly games of robot soccer.  Laughter  I never thought I would be able to casually move around a campus like Brown on my own. I just wish I could afford the tuition.  Laughter  Chad Jenkins  Henry  all joking aside  I bet all of these people here would love to see you fly this drone from your bed in California       miles away. Okay  Henry  have you been to D.C. lately  Are you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic  Can you show us how excited you are  All right  big finish. Can you show us how good of a pilot you are  All right  we still have a little ways to go with that  but I think it shows the promise. What makes Henry's story amazing is it's about understanding Henry's needs  understanding what people in Henry's situation need from technology  and then also understanding what advanced technology can provide  and then bringing those two things together for use in a wise and responsible way. What we're trying to do is democratize robotics  so that anybody can be a part of this. We're providing affordable  off the shelf robot platforms such as the A.R. drone      dollars  the Suitable Technologies beam  only        dollars  along with open source robotics software so that you can be a part of what we're trying to do. And our hope is that  by providing these tools  that you'll be able to think of better ways to provide movement for the disabled  to provide care for our aging population  to help better educate our children  to think about what the new types of middle class jobs could be for the future  to both monitor and protect our environment  and to explore the universe. Back to you  Henry. HE  Thank you  Chad. With this drone setup  we show the potential for bedridden people to once again be able to explore the outside world  and robotics will eventually provide a level playing field where one is only limited by their mental acuity and imagination  where the disabled are able to perform the same activities as everyone else  and perhaps better  and technology will even allow us to provide an outlet for many people who are presently considered vegetables. One hundred years ago  I would have been treated like a vegetable. Actually  that's not true. I would have died. It is up to us  all of us  to decide how robotics will be used  for good or for evil  for simply replacing people or for making people better  for allowing us to do and enjoy more. Our goal for robotics is to unlock everyone's mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe. With the help of people like you  we can make this dream a reality. Thank you. One billion people in the world today do not have access to all season roads. One billion people. One seventh of the Earth's population are totally cut off for some part of the year. We cannot get medicine to them reliably  they cannot get critical supplies  and they cannot get their goods to market in order to create a sustainable income. In sub Saharan Africa  for instance     percent of roads are unusable in the wet season. Investments are being made  but at the current level  it's estimated it's going to take them    years to catch up. In the U.S. alone  there's more than four million miles of roads  very expensive to build  very expensive to maintain infrastructure  with a huge ecological footprint  and yet  very often  congested. So we saw this and we thought  can there be a better way  Can we create a system using today's most advanced technologies that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog in the same way they've done with mobile telephones in the last    years  Many of those nations have excellent telecommunications today without ever putting copper lines in the ground. Could we do the same for transportation  Imagine this scenario. Imagine you are in a maternity ward in Mali  and have a newborn in need of urgent medication. What would you do today  Well  you would place a request via mobile phone  and someone would get the request immediately. That's the part that works. The medication may take days to arrive  though  because of bad roads. That's the part that's broken. We believe we can deliver it within hours with an electric autonomous flying vehicle such as this. This can transport a small payload today  about two kilograms  over a short distance  about    kilometers  but it's part of a wider network that may cover the entire country  maybe even the entire continent. It's an ultra flexible  automated logistics network. It's a network for a transportation of matter. We call it Matternet. We use three key technologies. The first is electric autonomous flying vehicles. The second is automated ground stations that the vehicles fly in and out of to swap batteries and fly farther  or pick up or deliver loads. And the third is the operating system that manages the whole network. Let's look at each one of those technologies in a bit more detail. First of all  the UAVs. Eventually  we're going to be using all sorts of vehicles for different payload capacities and different ranges. Today  we're using small quads. These are able to transport two kilograms over    kilometers in just about    minutes. Compare this with trying to trespass a bad road in the developing world  or even being stuck in traffic in a developed world country. These fly autonomously. This is the key to the technology. So they use GPS and other sensors on board to navigate between ground stations. Every vehicle is equipped with an automatic payload and battery exchange mechanism  so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations  they dock  swap a battery automatically  and go out again. The ground stations are located on safe locations on the ground. They secure the most vulnerable part of the mission  which is the landing. They are at known locations on the ground  so the paths between them are also known  which is very important from a reliability perspective from the whole network. Apart from fulfilling the energy requirements of the vehicles  eventually they're going to be becoming commercial hubs where people can take out loads or put loads into the network. The last component is the operating system that manages the whole network. It monitors weather data from all the ground stations and optimizes the routes of the vehicles through the system to avoid adverse weather conditions  avoid other risk factors  and optimize the use of the resources throughout the network. I want to show you what one of those flights looks like. Here we are flying in Haiti last summer  where we've done our first field trials. We're modeling here a medical delivery in a camp we set up after the      earthquake. People there love this. And I want to show you what one of those vehicles looks like up close. So this is a        vehicle. Costs are coming down very rapidly. We use this in all sorts of weather conditions  very hot and very cold climates  very strong winds. They're very sturdy vehicles. Imagine if your life depended on this package  somewhere in Africa or in New York City  after Sandy. The next big question is  what's the cost  Well  it turns out that the cost to transport two kilograms over    kilometers with this vehicle is just    cents. And it's counterintuitive  but the cost of energy expended for the flight is only two cents of a dollar today  and we're just at the beginning of this. When we saw this  we felt that this is something that can have significant impact in the world. So we said  okay  how much does it cost to set up a network somewhere in the world  And we looked at setting up a network in Lesotho for transportation of HIV AIDS samples. The problem there is how do you take them from clinics where they're being collected to hospitals where they're being analyzed  And we said  what if we wanted to cover an area spanning around     square kilometers  That's roughly one and a half times the size of Manhattan. Well it turns out that the cost to do that there would be less than a million dollars. Compare this to normal infrastructure investments. We think this can be    this is the power of a new paradigm. So here we are  a new idea about a network for transportation that is based on the ideas of the Internet. It's decentralized  it's peer to peer  it's bidirectional  highly adaptable  with very low infrastructure investment  very low ecological footprint. If it is a new paradigm  though  there must be other uses for it. It can be used perhaps in other places in the world. So let's look at the other end of the spectrum  our cities and megacities. Half of the Earth's population lives in cities today. Half a billion of us live in megacities. We are living through an amazing urbanization trend. China alone is adding a megacity the size of New York City every two years. These are places that do have road infrastructure  but it's very inefficient. Congestion is a huge problem. So we think it makes sense in those places to set up a network of transportation that is a new layer that sits between the road and the Internet  initially for lightweight  urgent stuff  and over time  we would hope to develop this into a new mode of transportation that is truly a modern solution to a very old problem. It's ultimately scalable with a very small ecological footprint  operating in the background       just like the Internet. So when we started this a couple of years ago now  we've had a lot of people come up to us who said   This is a very interesting but crazy idea  and certainly not something that you should engage with anytime soon.  And of course  we're talking about drones  right  a technology that's not only unpopular in the West but one that has become a very  very unpleasant fact of life for many living in poor countries  especially those engaged in conflict. So why are we doing this  Well  we chose to do this one not because it's easy  but because it can have amazing impact. Imagine one billion people being connected to physical goods in the same way that mobile telecommunications connected them to information. Imagine if the next big network we built in the world was a network for the transportation of matter. In the developing world  we would hope to reach millions of people with better vaccines  reach them with better medication. It would give us an unfair advantage against battling HIV AIDS  tuberculosis and other epidemics. Over time  we would hope it would become a new platform for economic transactions  lifting millions of people out of poverty. In the developed world and the emerging world  we would hope it would become a new mode of transportation that could help make our cities more livable. So for those that still believe that this is science fiction  I firmly say to you that it is not. We do need to engage  though  in social fiction to make it happen. Thank you. So yesterday  I was out in the street in front of this building  and I was walking down the sidewalk  and I had company  several of us  and we were all abiding by the rules of walking down sidewalks. We're not talking each other. We're facing forward. We're moving. When the person in front of me slows down. And so I'm watching him  and he slows down  and finally he stops. Well  that wasn't fast enough for me  so I put on my turn signal  and I walked around him  and as I walked  I looked to see what he was doing  and he was doing this. He was texting  and he couldn't text and walk at the same time. Now we could approach this from a working memory perspective or from a multitasking perspective. We're going to do working memory today. Now  working memory is that part of our consciousness that we are aware of at any given time of day. You're going it right now. It's not something we can turn off. If you turn it off  that's called a coma  okay  So right now  you're doing just fine. Now working memory has four basic components. It allows us to store some immediate experiences and a little bit of knowledge. It allows us to reach back into our long term memory and pull some of that in as we need it  mixes it  processes it in light of whatever our current goal is. Now the current goal isn't something like  I want to be president or the best surfer in the world. It's more mundane. I'd like that cookie  or I need to figure out how to get into my hotel room. Now working memory capacity is our ability to leverage that  our ability to take what we know and what we can hang onto and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy our current goal. Now working memory capacity has a fairly long history  and it's associated with a lot of positive effects. People with high working memory capacity tend to be good storytellers. They tend to solve and do well on standardized tests  however important that is. They're able to have high levels of writing ability. They're also able to reason at high levels. So what we're going to do here is play a little bit with some of that. So I'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks  and we're going to take your  working memory out for a ride. You up for that  Okay. I'm going to give you five words  and I just want you to hang on to them. Don't write them down. Just hang on to them. Five words. While you're hanging on to them  I'm going to ask you to answer three questions. I want to see what happens with those words. So here's the words  tree  highway  mirror  Saturn and electrode. So far so good  Okay. What I want you to do is I want you to tell me what the answer is to    times eight. Just shout it out. In fact it's     Mumbling     exactly.  Laughter  All right. I want you to take out your left hand and I want you to go   One  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine    .  It's a neurological test  just in case you were wondering. All right  now what I want you to do is to recite the last five letters of the English alphabet backwards. You should have started with Z. All right. How many people here are still pretty sure you've got all five words  Okay. Typically we end up with about less than half  right  which is normal. There will be a range. Some people can hang on to five. Some people can hang on to   . Some will be down to two or three. What we know is this is really important to the way we function  right  And it's going to be really important here at TED because you're going to be exposed to so many different ideas. Now the problem that we have is that life comes at us  and it comes at us very quickly  and what we need to do is to take that amorphous flow of experience and somehow extract meaning from it with a working memory that's about the size of a pea. Now don't get me wrong  working memory is awesome. Working memory allows us to investigate our current experience as we move forward. It allows us to make sense of the world around us. But it does have certain limits. Now working memory is great for allowing us to communicate. We can have a conversation  and I can build a narrative around that so I know where we've been and where we're going and how to contribute to this conversation. It allows us to problem solve  critical think. We can be in the middle of a meeting  listen to somebody's presentation  evaluate it  decide whether or not we like it  ask follow up questions. All of that occurs within working memory. It also allows us to go to the store and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese when what we're really looking for is Red Bull and bacon.  Laughter  Gotta make sure we're getting what we're looking for. Now  a central issue with working memory is that it's limited. It's limited in capacity  limited in duration  limited in focus. We tend to remember about four things. Okay  It used to be seven  but with functional MRIs  apparently it's four  and we were overachieving. Now we can remember those four things for about    to    seconds unless we do something with it  unless we process it  unless we apply it to something  unless we talk to somebody about it. When we think about working memory  we have to realize that this limited capacity has lots of different impacts on us. Have you ever walked from one room to another and then forgotten why you're there  You do know the solution to that  right  You go back to that original room.  Laughter  Have you ever forgotten your keys  You ever forgotten your car  You ever forgotten your kids  Have you ever been involved in a conversation  and you realize that the conversation to your left is actually more interesting   Laughter  So you're nodding and you're smiling  but you're really paying attention to this one over here  until you hear that last word go up  and you realize  you've been asked a question.  Laughter  And you're really hoping the answer is no  because that's what you're about to say. All of that talks about working memory  what we can do and what we can't do. We need to realize that working memory has a limited capacity  and that working memory capacity itself is how we negotiate that. We negotiate that through strategies. So what I want to do is talk a little bit about a couple of strategies here  and these will be really important because you are now in an information target rich environment for the next several days. Now the first part of this that we need to think about and we need to process our existence  our life  immediately and repeatedly. We need to process what's going on the moment it happens  not    minutes later  not a week later  at the moment. So we need to think about  well  do I agree with him  What's missing  What would I like to know  Do I agree with the assumptions  How can I apply this in my life  It's a way of processing what's going on so that we can use it later. Now we also need to repeat it. We need to practice. So we need to think about it here. In between  we want to talk to people about it. We're going to write it down  and when you get home  pull out those notes and think about them and end up practicing over time. Practice for some reason became a very negative thing. It's very positive. The next thing is  we need to think elaboratively and we need to think illustratively. Oftentimes  we think that we have to relate new knowledge to prior knowledge. What we want to do is spin that around. We want to take all of our existence and wrap it around that new knowledge and make all of these connections and it becomes more meaningful. We also want to use imagery. We are built for images. We need to take advantage of that. Think about things in images  write things down that way. If you read a book  pull things up. I just got through reading  The Great Gatsby   and I have a perfect idea of what he looks like in my head  so my own version. The last one is organization and support. We are meaning making machines. It's what we do. We try to make meaning out of everything that happens to us. Organization helps  so we need to structure what we're doing in ways that make sense. If we are providing knowledge and experience  we need to structure that. And the last one is support. We all started as novices. Everything we do is an approximation of sophistication. We should expect it to change over time. We have to support that. The support may come in asking people questions  giving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on it or has some guiding images  but we need to support it. Now  the final piece of this  the take home message from a working memory capacity standpoint is this  what we process  we learn. If we're not processing life  we're not living it. Live life. Thank you. To give me an idea of how many of you here may find what I'm about to tell you of practical value  let me ask you please to raise your hands  Who here is either over    years old or hopes to live past age    or has parents or grandparents who did live or have lived past     raise your hands please.  Laughter  Okay. You are the people to whom my talk will be of practical value.  Laughter  The rest of you won't find my talk personally relevant  but I think that you will still find the subject fascinating. I'm going to talk about growing older in traditional societies. This subject constitutes just one chapter of my latest book  which compares traditional  small  tribal societies with our large  modern societies  with respect to many topics such as bringing up children  growing older  health  dealing with danger  settling disputes  religion and speaking more than one language. Those tribal societies  which constituted all human societies for most of human history  are far more diverse than are our modern  recent  big societies. All big societies that have governments  and where most people are strangers to each other  are inevitably similar to each other and different from tribal societies. Tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments in how to run a human society. They constitute experiments from which we ourselves may be able to learn. Tribal societies shouldn't be scorned as primitive and miserable  but also they shouldn't be romanticized as happy and peaceful. When we learn of tribal practices  some of them will horrify us  but there are other tribal practices which  when we hear about them  we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves. Most old people in the U.S. end up living separately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years  and often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly  whereas in traditional societies  older people instead live out their lives among their children  their other relatives  and their lifelong friends. Nevertheless  the treatment of the elderly varies enormously among traditional societies  from much worse to much better than in our modern societies. At the worst extreme  many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four increasingly direct ways  by neglecting their elderly and not feeding or cleaning them until they die  or by abandoning them when the group moves  or by encouraging older people to commit suicide  or by killing older people. In which tribal societies do children abandon or kill their parents  It happens mainly under two conditions. One is in nomadic  hunter gather societies that often shift camp and that are physically incapable of transporting old people who can't walk when the able bodied younger people already have to carry their young children and all their physical possessions. The other condition is in societies living in marginal or fluctuating environments  such as the Arctic or deserts  where there are periodic food shortages  and occasionally there just isn't enough food to keep everyone alive. Whatever food is available has to be reserved for able bodied adults and for children. To us Americans  it sounds horrible to think of abandoning or killing your own sick wife or husband or elderly mother or father  but what could those traditional societies do differently  They face a cruel situation of no choice. Their old people had to do it to their own parents  and the old people know what now is going to happen to them. At the opposite extreme in treatment of the elderly  the happy extreme  are the New Guinea farming societies where I've been doing my fieldwork  for the past    years  and most other sedentary traditional societies around the world. In those societies  older people are cared for. They are fed. They remain valuable. And they continue to live in the same hut or else in a nearby hut near their children  relatives and lifelong friends. There are two main sets of reasons for this variation among societies in their treatment of old people. The variation depends especially on the usefulness of old people and on the society's values. First  as regards usefulness  older people continue to perform useful services. One use of older people in traditional societies is that they often are still effective at producing food. Another traditional usefulness of older people is that they are capable of babysitting their grandchildren  thereby freeing up their own adult children  the parents of those grandchildren  to go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren. Still another traditional value of older people is in making tools  weapons  baskets  pots and textiles. In fact  they're usually the people who are best at it. Older people usually are the leaders of traditional societies  and the people most knowledgeable about politics  medicine  religion  songs and dances. Finally  older people in traditional societies have a huge significance that would never occur to us in our modern  literate societies  where our sources of information are books and the Internet. In contrast  in traditional societies without writing  older people are the repositories of information. It's their knowledge that spells the difference between survival and death for their whole society in a time of crisis caused by rare events for which only the oldest people alive have had experience. Those  then  are the ways in which older people are useful in traditional societies. Their usefulness varies and contributes to variation in the society's treatment of the elderly. The other set of reasons for variation in the treatment of the elderly is the society's cultural values. For example  there's particular emphasis on respect for the elderly in East Asia  associated with Confucius' doctrine of filial piety  which means obedience  respect and support for elderly parents. Cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the U.S. Older Americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications. They're at a big disadvantage in hospitals. Our hospitals have an explicit policy called age based allocation of healthcare resources. That sinister expression means that if hospital resources are limited  for example if only one donor heart becomes available for transplant  or if a surgeon has time to operate on only a certain number of patients  American hospitals have an explicit policy of giving preference to younger patients over older patients on the grounds that younger patients are considered more valuable to society because they have more years of life ahead of them  even though the younger patients have fewer years of valuable life experience behind them. There are several reasons for this low status of the elderly in the U.S. One is our Protestant work ethic which places high value on work  so older people who are no longer working aren't respected. Another reason is our American emphasis on the virtues of self reliance and independence  so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self reliant and independent. Still a third reason is our American cult of youth  which shows up even in our advertisements. Ads for Coca Cola and beer always depict smiling young people  even though old as well as young people buy and drink Coca Cola and beer. Just think  what's the last time you saw a Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people    years old  Never. Instead  the only American ads featuring white haired old people are ads for retirement homes and pension planning. Well  what has changed in the status of the elderly today compared to their status in traditional societies  There have been a few changes for the better and more changes for the worse. Big changes for the better include the fact that today we enjoy much longer lives  much better health in our old age  and much better recreational opportunities. Another change for the better is that we now have specialized retirement facilities and programs to take care of old people. Changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past. That means that all those old people are more of a burden on the few young people  and that each old person has less individual value. Another big change for the worse in the status of the elderly is the breaking of social ties with age  because older people  their children  and their friends  all move and scatter independently of each other many times during their lives. We Americans move on the average every five years. Hence our older people are likely to end up living distant from their children and the friends of their youth. Yet another change for the worse in the status of the elderly is formal retirement from the workforce  carrying with it a loss of work friendships and a loss of the self esteem associated with work. Perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our elderly are objectively less useful than in traditional societies. Widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as repositories of knowledge. When we want some information  we look it up in a book or we Google it instead of finding some old person to ask. The slow pace of technological change in traditional societies means that what someone learns there as a child is still useful when that person is old  but the rapid pace of technological change today means that what we learn as children is no longer useful    years later. And conversely  we older people are not fluent in the technologies essential for surviving in modern society. For example  as a    year old  I was considered outstandingly good at multiplying numbers because I had memorized the multiplication tables and I know how to use logarithms and I'm quick at manipulating a slide rule. Today  though  those skills are utterly useless because any idiot can now multiply eight digit numbers accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator. Conversely  I at age    am incompetent at skills essential for everyday life. My family's first TV set in      had only three knobs that I quickly mastered  an on off switch  a volume knob  and a channel selector knob. Today  just to watch a program on the TV set in my own house  I have to operate a    button TV remote that utterly defeats me. I have to telephone my    year old sons and ask them to talk me through it while I try to push those wretched    buttons. What can we do to improve the lives of the elderly in the U.S.  and to make better use of their value  That's a huge problem. In my remaining four minutes today  I can offer just a few suggestions. One value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high quality childcare to their grandchildren  if they choose to do it  as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full time caretakers of their children. Compared to the usual alternatives of paid babysitters and day care centers  grandparents offer superior  motivated  experienced child care. They've already gained experience from raising their own children. They usually love their grandchildren  and are eager to spend time with them. Unlike other caregivers  grandparents don't quit their job because they found another job with higher pay looking after another baby. A second value of older people is paradoxically related to their loss of value as a result of changing world conditions and technology. At the same time  older people have gained in value today precisely because of their unique experience of living conditions that have now become rare because of rapid change  but that could come back. For example  only Americans now in their   s or older today can remember the experience of living through a great depression  the experience of living through a world war  and agonizing whether or not dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible than the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs. Most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things  but millions of older Americans do. Unfortunately  all of those terrible situations could come back. Even if they don't come back  we have to be able to plan for them on the basis of the experience of what they were like. Older people have that experience. Younger people don't. The remaining value of older people that I'll mention involves recognizing that while there are many things that older people can no longer do  there are other things that they can do better than younger people. A challenge for society is  to make use of those things that older people are better at doing. Some abilities  of course  decrease with age. Those include abilities at tasks requiring physical strength and stamina  ambition  and the power of novel reasoning in a circumscribed situation  such as figuring out the structure of DNA  best left to scientists under the age of   . Conversely  valuable attributes that increase with age include experience  understanding of people and human relationships  ability to help other people without your own ego getting in the way  and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases  such as economics and comparative history  best left to scholars over the age of   . Hence older people are much better than younger people at supervising  administering  advising  strategizing  teaching  synthesizing  and devising long term plans. I've seen this value of older people with so many of my friends in their   s    s    s and   s  who are still active as investment managers  farmers  lawyers and doctors. In short  many traditional societies make better use of their elderly and give their elderly more satisfying lives than we do in modern  big societies. Paradoxically nowadays  when we have more elderly people than ever before  living healthier lives and with better medical care than ever before  old age is in some respects more miserable than ever before. The lives of the elderly are widely recognized as constituting a disaster area of modern American society. We can surely do better by learning from the lives of the elderly in traditional societies. But what's true of the lives of the elderly in traditional societies is true of many other features of traditional societies as well. Of course  I'm not advocating that we all give up agriculture and metal tools and return to a hunter gatherer lifestyle. There are many obvious respects in which our lives today are far happier than those in small  traditional societies. To mention just a few examples  our lives are longer  materially much richer  and less plagued by violence than are the lives of people in traditional societies. But there are also things to be admired about people in traditional societies  and perhaps to be learned from them. Their lives are usually socially much richer than our lives  although materially poorer. Their children are more self confident  more independent  and more socially skilled than are our children. They think more realistically about dangers than we do. They almost never die of diabetes  heart disease  stroke  and the other noncommunicable diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today. Features of the modern lifestyle predispose us to those diseases  and features of the traditional lifestyle protect us against them. Those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies. I hope that you will find it as fascinating to read about traditional societies as I found it to live in those societies. Thank you. What is so special about the human brain  Why is it that we study other animals instead of them studying us  What does a human brain have or do that no other brain does  When I became interested in these questions about    years ago  scientists thought they knew what different brains were made of. Though it was based on very little evidence  many scientists thought that all mammalian brains  including the human brain  were made in the same way  with a number of neurons that was always proportional to the size of the brain. This means that two brains of the same size  like these two  with a respectable     grams  should have similar numbers of neurons. Now  if neurons are the functional information processing units of the brain  then the owners of these two brains should have similar cognitive abilities. And yet  one is a chimp  and the other is a cow. Now maybe cows have a really rich internal mental life and are so smart that they choose not to let us realize it  but we eat them. I think most people will agree that chimps are capable of much more complex  elaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are. So this is a first indication that the  all brains are made the same way  scenario is not quite right. But let's play along. If all brains were made the same way and you were to compare animals with brains of different sizes  larger brains should always have more neurons than smaller brains  and the larger the brain  the more cognitively able its owner should be. So the largest brain around should also be the most cognitively able. And here comes the bad news  Our brain  not the largest one around. It seems quite vexing. Our brain weighs between  .  and  .  kilos  but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos  and whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos  which is why scientists used to resort to saying that our brain must be special to explain our cognitive abilities. It must be really extraordinary  an exception to the rule. Theirs may be bigger  but ours is better  and it could be better  for example  in that it seems larger than it should be  with a much larger cerebral cortex than we should have for the size of our bodies. So that would give us extra cortex to do more interesting things than just operating the body. That's because the size of the brain usually follows the size of the body. So the main reason for saying that our brain is larger than it should be actually comes from comparing ourselves to great apes. Gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are  so their brains should also be larger than ours  but instead it's the other way around. Our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain. The human brain also seems special in the amount of energy that it uses. Although it weighs only two percent of the body  it alone uses    percent of all the energy that your body requires to run per day. That's     calories out of a total of       calories  just to keep your brain working. So the human brain is larger than it should be  it uses much more energy than it should  so it's special. And this is where the story started to bother me. In biology  we look for rules that apply to all animals and to life in general  so why should the rules of evolution apply to everybody else but not to us  Maybe the problem was with the basic assumption that all brains are made in the same way. Maybe two brains of a similar size can actually be made of very different numbers of neurons. Maybe a very large brain does not necessarily have more neurons than a more modest sized brain. Maybe the human brain  actually has the most neurons of any brain  regardless of its size  especially in the cerebral cortex. So this to me became the important question to answer  how many neurons does the human brain have  and how does that compare to other animals  Now  you may have heard or read somewhere that we have     billion neurons  so    years ago  I asked my colleagues if they knew where this number came from. But nobody did. I've been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number  and I could never find it. It seems that nobody had actually ever counted the number of neurons in the human brain  or in any other brain for that matter. So I came up with my own way to count cells in the brain  and it essentially consists of dissolving that brain into soup. It works like this  You take a brain  or parts of that brain  and you dissolve it in detergent  which destroys the cell membranes but keeps the cell nuclei intact  so you end up with a suspension of free nuclei that looks like this  like a clear soup. This soup contains all the nuclei that once were a mouse brain. Now  the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup  you can agitate it and make those nuclei be distributed homogeneously in the liquid  so that now by looking under the microscope at just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution  you can count nuclei  and therefore tell how many cells that brain had. It's simple  it's straightforward  and it's really fast. So we've used that method to count neurons in dozens of different species so far  and it turns out that all brains are not made the same way. Take rodents and primates  for instance  In larger rodent brains  the average size of the neuron increases  so the brain inflates very rapidly and gains size much faster than it gains neurons. But primate brains gain neurons without the average neuron becoming any larger  which is a very economical way to add neurons to your brain. The result is that a primate brain will always have more neurons than a rodent brain of the same size  and the larger the brain  the larger this difference will be. Well  what about our brain then  We found that we have  on average     billion neurons     billion of which are in the cerebral cortex  and if you consider that the cerebral cortex is the seat of functions like awareness and logical and abstract reasoning  and that    billion is the most neurons that any cortex has  I think this is the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities. But just as important is what the    billion neurons mean. Because we found that the relationship between the size of the brain and its number of neurons could be described mathematically  we could calculate what a human brain would look like if it was made like a rodent brain. So  a rodent brain with    billion neurons would weigh    kilos. That's not possible. A brain that huge would be crushed by its own weight  and this impossible brain would go in the body of    tons. I don't think it looks like us. So this brings us to a very important conclusion already  which is that we are not rodents. The human brain is not a large rat brain. Compared to a rat  we might seem special  yes  but that's not a fair comparison to make  given that we know that we are not rodents. We are primates  so the correct comparison is to other primates. And there  if you do the math  you find that a generic primate with    billion neurons would have a brain of about  .  kilos  which seems just right  in a body of some    kilos  which in my case is exactly right  which brings us to a very unsurprising but still incredibly important conclusion  I am a primate. And all of you are primates. And so was Darwin. I love to think that Darwin would have really appreciated this. His brain  like ours  was made in the image of other primate brains. So the human brain may be remarkable  yes  but it is not special in its number of neurons. It is just a large primate brain. I think that's a very humbling and sobering thought that should remind us of our place in nature. Why does it cost so much energy  then  Well  other people have figured out how much energy the human brain and that of other species costs  and now that we knew how many neurons each brain was made of  we could do the math. And it turns out that both human and other brains cost about the same  an average of six calories  per billion neurons per day. So the total energetic cost of a brain is a simple  linear function of its number of neurons  and it turns out that the human brain costs just as much energy as you would expect. So the reason why the human brain costs so much energy is simply because it has a huge number of neurons  and because we are primates with many more neurons for a given body size than any other animal  the relative cost of our brain is large  but just because we're primates  not because we're special. Last question  then  how did we come by this remarkable number of neurons  and in particular  if great apes are larger than we are  why don't they have a larger brain  than we do  with more neurons  When we realized how much expensive it is to have a lot of neurons in the brain  I figured  maybe there's a simple reason. They just can't afford the energy for both a large body  and a large number of neurons. So we did the math. We calculated on the one hand how much energy a primate gets per day from eating raw foods  and on the other hand  how much energy a body of a certain size costs and how much energy a brain of a certain number of neurons costs  and we looked for the combinations of body size and number of brain neurons that a primate could afford if it ate a certain number of hours per day. And what we found is that because neurons are so expensive  there is a tradeoff between body size and number of neurons. So a primate that eats eight hours per day can afford at most    billion neurons  but then its body cannot be any bigger than    kilos. To weigh any more than that  it has to give up neurons. So it's either a large body or a large number of neurons. When you eat like a primate  you can't afford both. One way out of this metabolic limitation would be to spend even more hours per day eating  but that gets dangerous  and past a certain point  it's just not possible. Gorillas and orangutans  for instance  afford about    billion neurons by spending eight and a half hours per day eating  and that seems to be about as much as they can do. Nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate. What about us  With our    billion neurons and    to    kilos of body mass  we should have to spend over nine hours per day every single day feeding  which is just not feasible. If we ate like a primate  we should not be here. How did we get here  then  Well  if our brain costs just as much energy as it should  and if we can't spend every waking hour of the day feeding  then the only alternative  really  is to somehow get more energy out of the same foods. And remarkably  that matches exactly what our ancestors are believed to have invented one and a half million years ago  when they invented cooking. To cook is to use fire to pre digest foods outside of your body. Cooked foods are softer  so they're easier to chew and to turn completely into mush in your mouth  so that allows them to be completely digested and absorbed in your gut  which makes them yield much more energy in much less time. So cooking frees time for us to do much more interesting things with our day and with our neurons than just thinking about food  looking for food  and gobbling down food all day long. So because of cooking  what once was a major liability  this large  dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons  could now become a major asset  now that we could both afford  the energy for a lot of neurons and the time to do interesting things with them. So I think this explains why the human brain grew to become so large so fast in evolution  all of the while remaining just a primate brain. With this large brain now affordable by cooking  we went rapidly from raw foods to culture  agriculture  civilization  grocery stores  electricity  refrigerators  all of those things that nowadays allow us to get all the energy we need for the whole day in a single sitting at your favorite fast food joint. So what once was a solution now became the problem  and ironically  we look for the solution in raw food. So what is the human advantage  What is it that we have that no other animal has  My answer is that we have the largest number of neurons in the cerebral cortex  and I think that's the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities. And what is it that we do that no other animal does  and which I believe was fundamental to allow us to reach that large  largest number of neurons in the cortex  In two words  we cook. No other animal cooks its food. Only humans do. And I think that's how we got to become human. Studying the human brain changed  the way I think about food. I now look at my kitchen  and I bow to it  and I thank my ancestors for coming up with the invention that probably made us humans. Thank you very much. There is something you know about me  something very personal  and there is something I know about every one of you and that's very central to your concerns. There is something that we know about everyone we meet anywhere in the world  on the street  that is the very mainspring of whatever they do and whatever they put up with. And that is that all of us want to be happy. In this  we are all together. How we imagine our happiness  that differs from one another  but it's already a lot that we have all in common  that we want to be happy. Now my topic is gratefulness. What is the connection between happiness and gratefulness  Many people would say  well  that's very easy. When you are happy  you are grateful. But think again. Is it really the happy people that are grateful  We all know quite a number of people who have everything that it would take to be happy  and they are not happy  because they want something else or they want more of the same. And we all know people who have lots of misfortune  misfortune that we ourselves would not want to have  and they are deeply happy. They radiate happiness. You are surprised. Why  Because they are grateful. So it is not happiness that makes us grateful. It's gratefulness that makes us happy. If you think it's happiness that makes you grateful  think again. It's gratefulness that makes you happy. Now  we can ask  what do we really mean by gratefulness  And how does it work  I appeal to your own experience. We all know from experience how it goes. We experience something that's valuable to us. Something is given to us that's valuable to us. And it's really given. These two things have to come together. It has to be something valuable  and it's a real gift. You haven't bought it. You haven't earned it. You haven't traded it in. You haven't worked for it. It's just given to you. And when these two things come together  something that's really valuable to me and I realize it's freely given  then gratefulness spontaneously rises in my heart  happiness spontaneously rises in my heart. That's how gratefulness happens. Now the key to all this is that we cannot only experience this once in a while. We cannot only have grateful experiences. We can be people who live gratefully. Grateful living  that is the thing. And how can we live gratefully  By experiencing  by becoming aware that every moment is a given moment  as we say. It's a gift. You haven't earned it. You haven't brought it about in any way. You have no way of assuring that there will be another moment given to you  and yet  that's the most valuable thing that can ever be given to us  this moment  with all the opportunity that it contains. If we didn't have this present moment  we wouldn't have any opportunity to do anything or experience anything  and this moment is a gift. It's a given moment  as we say. Now  we say the gift within this gift is really the opportunity. What you are really grateful for is the opportunity  not the thing that is given to you  because if that thing were somewhere else and you didn't have the opportunity to enjoy it  to do something with it  you wouldn't be grateful for it. Opportunity is the gift within every gift  and we have this saying  opportunity knocks only once. Well  think again. Every moment is a new gift  over and over again  and if you miss the opportunity of this moment  another moment is given to us  and another moment. We can avail ourselves of this opportunity  or we can miss it  and if we avail ourselves of the opportunity  it is the key to happiness. Behold the master key to our happiness in our own hands. Moment by moment  we can be grateful for this gift. Does that mean that we can be grateful for everything  Certainly not. We cannot be grateful for violence  for war  for oppression  for exploitation. On the personal level  we cannot be grateful for the loss of a friend  for unfaithfulness  for bereavement. But I didn't say we can be grateful for everything. I said we can be grateful in every given moment for the opportunity  and even when we are confronted with something that is terribly difficult  we can rise to this occasion and respond to the opportunity that is given to us. It isn't as bad as it might seem. Actually  when you look at it and experience it  you find that most of the time  what is given to us is the opportunity to enjoy  and we only miss it because we are rushing through life and we are not stopping to see the opportunity. But once in a while  something very difficult is given to us  and when this difficult thing occurs to us  it's a challenge to rise to that opportunity  and we can rise to it by learning something which is sometimes painful. Learning patience  for instance. We have been told that the road to peace is not a sprint  but is more like a marathon. That takes patience. That's difficult. It may be to stand up for your opinion  to stand up for your conviction. That's an opportunity that is given to us. To learn  to suffer  to stand up  all these opportunities are given to us  but they are opportunities  and those who avail themselves of those opportunities are the ones that we admire. They make something out of life. And those who fail get another opportunity. We always get another opportunity. That's the wonderful richness of life. So how can we find a method that will harness this  How can each one of us find a method for living gratefully  not just once in a while being grateful  but moment by moment to be grateful. How can we do it  It's a very simple method. It's so simple that it's actually what we were told as children when we learned to cross the street. Stop. Look. Go. That's all. But how often do we stop  We rush through life. We don't stop. We miss the opportunity because we don't stop. We have to stop. We have to get quiet. And we have to build stop signs into our lives. When I was in Africa some years ago and then came back  I noticed water. In Africa where I was  I didn't have drinkable water. Every time I turned on the faucet  I was overwhelmed. Every time I clicked on the light  I was so grateful. It made me so happy. But after a while  this wears off. So I put little stickers on the light switch and on the water faucet  and every time I turned it on  water. So leave it up to your own imagination. You can find whatever works best for you  but you need stop signs in your life. And when you stop  then the next thing is to look. You look. You open your eyes. You open your ears. You open your nose. You open all your senses for this wonderful richness that is given to us. There is no end to it  and that is what life is all about  to enjoy  to enjoy what is given to us. And then we can also open our hearts  our hearts for the opportunities  for the opportunities also to help others  to make others happy  because nothing makes us more happy than when all of us are happy. And when we open our hearts to the opportunities  the opportunities invite us to do something  and that is the third. Stop  look  and then go  and really do something. And what we can do is whatever life offers to you in that present moment. Mostly it's the opportunity to enjoy  but sometimes it's something more difficult. But whatever it is  if we take this opportunity  we go with it  we are creative  those are the creative people. And that little stop  look  go  is such a potent seed that it can revolutionize our world. Because we are at the present moment in the middle of a change of consciousness  and you will be surprised if you    I am always surprised when I hear how many times this word  gratefulness  and  gratitude  comes up. Everywhere you find it  a grateful airline  a restaurant gratefulness  a caf  gratefulness  a wine that is gratefulness. Yes  I have even come across a toilet paper whose brand is called  Thank You.  There is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware how important this is and how this can change our world. It can change our world in immensely important ways  because if you're grateful  you're not fearful  and if you're not fearful  you're not violent. If you're grateful  you act out of a sense of enough and not of a sense of scarcity  and you are willing to share. If you are grateful  you are enjoying the differences between people  and you are respectful to everybody  and that changes this power pyramid under which we live. And it doesn't make for equality  but it makes for equal respect  and that is the important thing. The future of the world will be a network  not a pyramid turned upside down. The revolution of which I am speaking is a nonviolent revolution  and it's so revolutionary that it even revolutionizes the very concept of a revolution  because the normal revolution is one where the power pyramid is turned upside down and those who were on the bottom are now on the top and are doing exactly the same thing that the ones before. What we need is a networking of smaller groups  smaller and smaller groups who know one another  who interact with one another  and that is a grateful world. A grateful world is a world of joyful people. Grateful people are joyful people  and joyful people    the more and more joyful people there are  the more and more we'll have a joyful world. We have a network for grateful living  and it has mushroomed. We couldn't understand why it mushroomed. We have an opportunity for people to light a candle when they are grateful for something. And there have been    million candles lit in one decade. People are becoming aware that a grateful world is a happy world  and we all have the opportunity by the simple stop  look  go  to transform the world  to make it a happy place. And that is what I hope for us  and if this has contributed a little to making you want to do the same  stop  look  go. Thank you.
