When I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old  we were playing on top of a bunk bed. I was two years older than my sister at the time    I mean  I'm two years older than her now    but at the time it meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do  and I wanted to play war. So we were up on top of our bunk beds. And on one side of the bunk bed  I had put out all of my G.I. Joe soldiers and weaponry. And on the other side were all my sister's My Little Ponies ready for a cavalry charge. There are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon  but since my sister is not here with us today  let me tell you the true story    which is my sister's a little on the clumsy side. Somehow  without any help or push from her older brother at all  Amy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor. I nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground. I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible. And seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy's arm just one week before    heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet  for which I have yet to be thanked  I was trying as hard as I could    she didn't even see it coming    I was trying hard to be on my best behavior. And I saw my sister's face  this wail of pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and wake my parents from the long winter's nap for which they had settled. So I did the only thing my frantic seven year old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy. And if you have children  you've seen this hundreds of times. I said   Amy  wait. Don't cry. Did you see how you landed  No human lands on all fours like that. Amy  I think this means you're a unicorn.  Now  that was cheating  because there was nothing she would want more than not to be Amy the hurt five year old little sister  but Amy the special unicorn. Of course  this option was open to her brain at no point in the past. And you could see how my poor  manipulated sister faced conflict  as her little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced  or contemplating her new found identity as a unicorn. And the latter won. Instead of crying or ceasing our play  instead of waking my parents  with all the negative consequences for me  a smile spread across her face and she scrambled back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn    with one broken leg. What we stumbled across at this tender age of just five and seven    we had no idea at the time    was was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain. We had stumbled across something called positive psychology  which is the reason I'm here today and the reason that I wake up every morning. When I started talking about this research outside of academia  with companies and schools  the first thing they said to never do is to start with a graph. The first thing I want to do is start with a graph. This graph looks boring  but it is the reason I get excited and wake up every morning. And this graph doesn't even mean anything  it's fake data. What we found is    If I got this data studying you  I would be thrilled  because there's a trend there  and that means that I can get published  which is all that really matters. There is one weird red dot above the curve  there's one weirdo in the room    I know who you are  I saw you earlier    that's no problem. That's no problem  as most of you know  because I can just delete that dot. I can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error. And we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data. So one of the first things we teach people in economics  statistics  business and psychology courses is how  in a statistically valid way  do we eliminate the weirdos. How do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit  Which is fantastic if I'm trying to find out how many Advil the average person should be taking    two. But if I'm interested in your potential  or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity  we're creating the cult of the average with science. If I asked a question like   How fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom   scientists change the answer to  How fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom   and we tailor the class towards the average. If you fall below the average  then psychologists get thrilled  because that means you're depressed or have a disorder  or hopefully both. We're hoping for both because our business model is  if you come into a therapy session with one problem  we want to make sure you leave knowing you have ten  so you keep coming back. We'll go back into your childhood if necessary  but eventually we want to make you normal again. But normal is merely average. And positive psychology posits that if we study what is merely average  we will remain merely average. Then instead of deleting those positive outliers  what I intentionally do is come into a population like this one and say  why  Why are some of you high above the curve in terms of intellectual  athletic  musical ability  creativity  energy levels  resiliency in the face of challenge  sense of humor  Whatever it is  instead of deleting you  what I want to do is study you. Because maybe we can glean information  not just how to move people up to the average  but move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide. The reason this graph is important to me is  on the news  the majority of the information is not positive. in fact it's negative. Most of it's about murder  corruption  diseases  natural disasters. And very quickly  my brain starts to think that's the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world. This creates  the medical school syndrome.  During the first year of medical training  as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases  suddenly you realize you have all of them. I have a brother in law named Bobo  which is a whole other story. Bobo married Amy the unicorn. Bobo called me on the phone    from Yale Medical School  and Bobo said   Shawn  I have leprosy.  Which  even at Yale  is extraordinarily rare. But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause. We're finding it's not necessarily the reality that shapes us  but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality. And if we can change the lens  not only can we change your happiness  we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time. I applied to Harvard on a dare. I didn't expect to get in  and my family had no money for college. When I got a military scholarship two weeks later  they let me go. Something that wasn't even a possibility became a reality. I assumed everyone there would see it as a privilege as well  that they'd be excited to be there. Even in a classroom full of people smarter than you  I felt you'd be happy just to be in that classroom. But what I found is  while some people experience that  when I graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students    Harvard asked me to  I wasn't that guy. I was an officer to counsel students through the difficult four years. And in my research and my teaching  I found that these students  no matter how happy they were with their original success of getting into the school  two weeks later their brains were focused  not on the privilege of being there  nor on their philosophy or physics  but on the competition  the workload  the hassles  stresses  complaints. When I first went in there  I walked into the freshmen dining hall  which is where my friends from Waco  Texas  which is where I grew up    I know some of you know this. When they'd visit  they'd look around  and say   This dining hall looks like something out of Hogwart's.  It does  because that was Hogwart's and that's Harvard. And when they see this  they say   Why do you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard  What does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about   Embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness. Because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels  when in reality  if I know everything about your external world  I can only predict     of your long term happiness.    percent of your long term happiness is predicted not by the external world  but by the way your brain processes the world. And if we change it  if we change our formula for happiness and success  we can change the way that we can then affect reality. What we found is that only     of job successes are predicted by IQ     percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels  your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat. I talked to a New England boarding school  probably the most prestigious one  and they said   We already know that. So every year  instead of just teaching our students  we have a wellness week. And we're so excited. Monday night we have the world's leading expert will speak about adolescent depression. Tuesday night it's school violence and bullying. Wednesday night is eating disorders. Thursday night is illicit drug use. And Friday night we're trying to decide between risky sex or happiness.  I said   That's most people's Friday nights.  Which I'm glad you liked  but they did not like that at all. Silence on the phone. And into the silence  I said   I'd be happy to speak at your school  but that's not a wellness week  that's a sickness week. You've outlined all the negative things that can happen  but not talked about the positive.  The absence of disease is not health. Here's how we get to health  We need to reverse the formula for happiness and success. In the last three years  I've traveled to    countries  working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn. And I found that most companies and schools follow a formula for success  which is this  If I work harder  I'll be more successful. And if I'm more successful  then I'll be happier. That undergirds most of our parenting and managing styles  the way that we motivate our behavior. And the problem is it's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons. Every time your brain has a success  you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like. You got good grades  now you have to get better grades  you got into a good school and after you get into a better one  you got a good job  now you have to get a better job  you hit your sales target  we're going to change it. And if happiness is on the opposite side of success  your brain never gets there. We've pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon  as a society. And that's because we think we have to be successful  then we'll be happier. But our brains work in the opposite order. If you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present  then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage  which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than at negative  neutral or stressed. Your intelligence rises  your creativity rises  your energy levels rise. In fact  we've found that every single business outcome improves. Your brain at positive is     more productive than your brain at negative  neutral or stressed. You're     better at sales. Doctors are    percent faster  more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative  neutral or stressed. Which means we can reverse the formula. If we can find a way of becoming positive in the present  then our brains work even more successfully as we're able to work harder  faster and more intelligently. We need to be able to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of. Because dopamine  which floods into your system when you're positive  has two functions. Not only does it make you happier  it turns on all of the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way. We've found there are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive. In just a two minute span of time done for    days in a row  we can actually rewire your brain  allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully. We've done these things in research now in every company that I've worked with  getting them to write down three new things that they're grateful for for    days in a row  three new things each day. And at the end of that  their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world not for the negative  but for the positive first. Journaling about one positive experience you've had over the past    hours allows your brain to relive it. Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters. We find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand. And finally  random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness. We get people  when they open up their inbox  to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their support network. And by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we train our bodies  what we've found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success  and in doing so  not only create ripples of positivity  but a real revolution. Thank you very much. I'm going to talk to you today about the design of medical technology for low resource settings. I study health systems in these countries. And one of the major gaps in care  almost across the board  is access to safe surgery. Now one of the major bottlenecks that we've found that's sort of preventing both the access in the first place and the safety of those surgeries that do happen is anesthesia. And actually  it's the model that we expect to work for delivering anesthesia in these environments. Here we have a scene that you would find in any operating room across the U.S. or any other developed country. In the background there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine. And this machine is able to enable surgery and save lives because it was designed with this environment in mind. In order to operate  this machine needs a number of things that this hospital has to offer. It needs an extremely well trained anesthesiologist with years of training with complex machines to help her monitor the flows of the gas and keep her patients safe and anesthetized throughout the surgery. It's a delicate machine running on computer algorithms  and it needs special care  TLC  to keep it up and running  and it's going to break pretty easily. And when it does  it needs a team of biomedical engineers who understand its complexities  can fix it  can source the parts and keep it saving lives. It's a pretty expensive machine. It needs a hospital whose budget can allow it to support one machine costing upwards of    or         . And perhaps most obviously  and perhaps most importantly    and the path to concepts that we've heard about kind of illustrate this    it needs infrastructure that can supply an uninterrupted source of electricity  of compressed oxygen and other medical supplies that are so critical to the functioning of this machine. In other words  this machine requires a lot of stuff that this hospital cannot offer. This is the electrical supply for a hospital in rural Malawi. In this hospital  there is one person qualified to deliver anesthesia  and she's qualified because she has     maybe    months of training in anesthesia. In the hospital and in the entire region there's not a single biomedical engineer. So when this machine breaks  the machines they have to work with break  they've got to try and figure it out  but most of the time  that's the end of the road. Those machines go the proverbial junkyard. And the price tag of the machine that I mentioned could represent maybe a quarter or a third of the annual operating budget for this hospital. And finally  I think you can see that infrastructure is not very strong. This hospital is connected to a very weak power grid  one that goes down frequently. So it runs frequently  the entire hospital  just on a generator. And you can imagine  the generator breaks down or runs out of fuel. And the World Bank sees this and estimates that a hospital in this setting in a low income country can expect up to    power outages per month. Similarly compressed oxygen and other medical supplies are really a luxury and can often be out of stock for months or even a year. So it seems crazy  but the model that we have right now is taking those machines that were designed for that first environment that I showed you and donating or selling them to hospitals in this environment. It's not just inappropriate  it becomes really unsafe. One of our partners at Johns Hopkins was observing surgeries in Sierra Leone about a year ago. And the first surgery of the day happened to be an obstetrical case. A woman came in  she needed an emergency C section to save her life and the life of her baby. And everything began pretty auspiciously. The surgeon was on call and scrubbed in. The nurse was there. She was able to anesthetize her quickly  and it was important because of the emergency nature of the situation. And everything began well until the power went out. And now in the middle of this surgery  the surgeon is racing against the clock to finish his case  which he can do    he's got a headlamp. But the nurse is literally running around a darkened operating theater trying to find anything she can use to anesthetize her patient  to keep her patient asleep. Because her machine doesn't work when there's no power. And now this routine surgery that many of you have probably experienced  and others are probably the product of  has now become a tragedy. And what's so frustrating is this is not a singular event  this happens across the developing world.    million surgeries are attempted every year without safe anesthesia. My colleague  Dr. Paul Fenton  was living this reality. He was the chief of anesthesiology in a hospital in Malawi  a teaching hospital. He went to work every day in an operating theater like this one  trying to deliver anesthesia and teach others how to do so using that same equipment that became so unreliable  and frankly unsafe  in his hospital. And after umpteen surgeries and  you can imagine  really unspeakable tragedy  he just said   That's it. I'm done. That's enough. There has to be something better.  So he took a walk down the hall to where they threw all those machines that had just crapped out on them    I think that's the scientific term    and he just started tinkering. He took one part from here and another from there  and he tried to come up with a machine that would work in the reality that he was facing. And what he came up with was this guy  the prototype for the Universal Anesthesia Machine    a machine that would work and anesthetize his patients no matter the circumstances that his hospital had to offer. Here it is back at home at that same hospital  developed a little further     years later  working on patients from pediatrics to geriatrics. Now let me show you a little bit about how this machine works. Voila  Here she is. When you have electricity  everything in this machine begins in the base. There's a built in oxygen concentrator down there. Now you've heard me mention oxygen a few times at this point. Essentially  to deliver anesthesia  you want as pure oxygen as possible  because eventually you're going to dilute it essentially with the gas. And the mixture that the patient inhales needs to be at least a certain percentage oxygen or else it can become dangerous. But so in here when there's electricity  the oxygen concentrator takes in room air. Now we know room air is gloriously free  it is abundant  and it's already    percent oxygen. So all this concentrator does is take that room air in  filter it and send    percent pure oxygen up and across here where it mixes with the anesthetic agent. Now before that mixture hits the patient's lungs  it's going to pass by here    you can't see it  but there's an oxygen sensor here    that's going to read out on this screen the percentage of oxygen being delivered. Now if you don't have power  or  God forbid  the power cuts out in the middle of surgery  this machine transitions automatically  without even having to touch it  to drawing in room air from this inlet. Everything else is the same. The only difference is that now you're only working with    percent oxygen. Now that used to be a dangerous guessing game  because you only knew if you had given too little oxygen once something bad happened. But we've put a long life battery backup on here. This is the only part that's battery backed up. But this gives control to the provider  whether there's power or not  because they can adjust the flow based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they're giving their patient. In both cases  whether you have power or not  sometimes the patient needs help breathing. It's just a reality of anesthesia. The lungs can be paralyzed. And so we've just added this manual bellows. We've seen surgeries for three or four hours to ventilate the patient on this. So it's a straightforward machine. I shudder to say simple  it's straightforward. And it's by design. And you do not need to be a highly trained  specialized anesthesiologist to use this machine  which is good because  in these rural district hospitals  you're not going to get that level of training. It's also designed for the environment that it will be used in. This is an incredibly rugged machine. It has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear that happens in hospitals in these rural districts. And so it's not going to break very easily  but if it does  virtually every piece in this machine can be swapped out and replaced with a hex wrench and a screwdriver. And finally  it's affordable. This machine comes in at an eighth of the cost of the conventional machine that I showed you earlier. So in other words  what we have here is a machine that can enable surgery and save lives because it was designed for its environment  just like the first machine I showed you. But we're not content to stop there. Is it working  Is this the design that's going to work in place  Well we've seen good results so far. This is in    hospitals in four countries  and since       we've done well over       surgeries with no clinically adverse events. So we're thrilled. This really seems like a cost effective  scalable solution to a problem that's really pervasive. But we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals. So to do that we've launched a number of partnerships with NGOs and universities to gather data on the user interface  on the types of surgeries it's appropriate for and ways we can enhance the device itself. One of those partnerships is with Johns Hopkins just here in Baltimore. They have a really cool anesthesia simulation lab out in Baltimore. So we're taking this machine and recreating some of the operating theater crises that this machine might face in one of the hospitals that it's intended for  and in a contained  safe environment  evaluating its effectiveness. We're then able to compare the results from that study with real world experience  because we're putting two of these in hospitals that Johns Hopkins works with in Sierra Leone  including the hospital where that emergency C section happened. So I've talked a lot about anesthesia  and I tend to do that. I think it is incredibly fascinating and an important component of health. And it really seems peripheral  we never think about it  until we don't have access to it  and then it becomes a gatekeeper. Who gets surgery and who doesn't  Who gets safe surgery and who doesn't  But you know  it's just one of so many ways that design  appropriate design  can have an impact on health outcomes. If more people in the health delivery space really working on some of these challenges in low income countries could start their design process  their solution search  from outside of that proverbial box and inside of the hospital    in other words  if we could design for the environment that exists in so many parts of the world  rather than the one that we wished existed    we might just save a lot of lives. Thank you very much. Because I usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be  and I thought that  since I was among friends here  I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it. So I'm going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide. And then  so if you can just turn on the slide that's on. This is just a random slide that I picked out of my file. What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide  but the general form of it. This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of RISC microprocessors versus the power of local area networks. And the interesting thing about it is that this slide  like so many technology slides that we're used to  is a sort of a straight line on a semi log curve. In other words  every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale. And this is a new thing that we talk about technology on semi log curves. Something really weird is going on here. And that's basically what I'm going to be talking about. So  if you could bring up the lights. If you could bring up the lights higher  because I'm just going to use a piece of paper here. Now why do we draw technology curves in semi log curves  Well the answer is  if I drew it on a normal curve where  let's say  this is years  this is time of some sort  and this is whatever measure of the technology that I'm trying to graph  the graphs look sort of silly. They sort of go like this. And they don't tell us much. Now if I graph  for instance  some other technology  say transportation technology  on a semi log curve  it would look very stupid  it would look like a flat line. But when something like this happens  things are qualitatively changing. So if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology  then the day after tomorrow  I would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in Tokyo in    seconds. It's not moving like that. And there's nothing precedented in the history of technology development of this kind of self feeding growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years. Now the question that I'd like to ask is  if you look at these exponential curves  they don't go on forever. Things just can't possibly keep changing as fast as they are. One of two things is going to happen. Either it's going to turn into a sort of classical S curve like this  until something totally different comes along  or maybe it's going to do this. That's about all it can do. Now I'm an optimist  so I sort of think it's probably going to do something like that. If so  that means that what we're in the middle of right now is a transition. We're sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is. And so what I'm trying to ask  what I've been asking myself  is what's this new way that the world is  What's that new state that the world is heading toward  Because the transition seems very  very confusing when we're right in the middle of it. Now when I was a kid growing up  the future was kind of the year       and people used to talk about what would happen in the year     . Now here's a conference in which people talk about the future  and you notice that the future is still at about the year     . It's about as far as we go out. So in other words  the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime. Now I think that the reason is because we all feel that something's happening there. That transition is happening. We can all sense it. And we know that it just doesn't make too much sense to think out        years because everything's going to be so different that a simple extrapolation of what we're doing just doesn't make any sense at all. So what I would like to talk about is what that could be  what that transition could be that we're going through. Now in order to do that I'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers. Because I think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things. So the time scale that I would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on Earth. So I think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time. So if you go back about two and a half billion years  the Earth was this big  sterile hunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it. And if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized  we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it. And I think that there's theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with RNA  but I'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it  which is that  at that time  there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them. And some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil. And those that were like that started to split and divide. And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense  those little drops of oil. But now those drops of oil weren't really alive  as we say it now  because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals. And every time it divided  they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them. And so every drop was a little bit different. In fact  the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them  grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more. So those tended to live longer  get expressed more. Now that's sort of just a very simple chemical form of life  but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction. Somehow by ways that we don't quite understand  these little drops learned to write down information. They learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called DNA. So in other words  they worked out  in this mindless sort of evolutionary way  a form of writing that let them write down what they were  so that that way of writing it down could get copied. The amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago. In fact the recipe for us  our genes  is exactly that same code and that same way of writing. In fact  every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code. In fact  one of the things that I did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code. And I've got here a little     micrograms of white powder  which I try not to let the security people see at airports. But this has in it    what I did is I took this code    the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it    and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA and amplified it    to the    times. So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card  I have plenty for everyone in the room  and  in fact  everyone in the world  and it's right here. If I had really been a egotist  I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room. So what was the next step  Writing down the DNA was an interesting step. And that caused these cells    that kept them happy for another billion years. But then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different  which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information  so that they began to get communities of cells. I don't know if you know this  but bacteria can actually exchange DNA. Now that's why  for instance  antibiotic resistance has evolved. Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin  and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information with other bacteria  and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin  because bacteria communicate. Now what this communication allowed was communities to form that  in some sense  were in the same boat together  they were synergistic. So they survived or they failed together  which means that if a community was very successful  all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution. Now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that  in fact  they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one string of DNA. And so the next stage that's interesting in life took about another billion years. And at that stage  we have multi cellular communities  communities of lots of different types of cells  working together as a single organism. And in fact  we're such a multi cellular community. We have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore. Your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell  muscle cell  a brain cell and so on. So these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell  but a community which we call an organism. Now the next step that happened is within these communities. These communities of cells  again  began to abstract information. And they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community. And those are the neural structures. So neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up. And in fact  they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording  understanding  learning information. And that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities. And that gave them an evolutionary advantage. Because at that point  an individual    learning could happen within the time span of a single organism  instead of over this evolutionary time span. So an organism could  for instance  learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it. That could happen within the lifetime of a single organism  whereas before they'd built these special information processing structures  that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit. So that nervous system  the fact that they built these special information structures  tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution. Because evolution could now happen within an individual. It could happen in learning time scales. But then what happened was the individuals worked out  of course  tricks of communicating. And for example  the most sophisticated version that we're aware of is human language. It's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it. Here I have a very complicated  messy  confused idea in my head. I'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically  and hopefully constructing a similar messy  confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it. But we're taking something very complicated  turning it into sound  sequences of sounds  and producing something very complicated in your brain. So this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism. And so  in fact  what we've done is we  humanity  have started abstracting out. We're going through the same levels that multi cellular organisms have gone through    abstracting out our methods of recording  presenting  processing information. So for example  the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction. Telephony  computers  videotapes  CD ROMs and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we've now built within our society for handling that information. And it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before. So now  evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds. And you saw Ty's little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the Convolution program right before your eyes. So now we've speeded up the time scales once again. So the first steps of the story that I told you about took a billion years a piece. And the next steps  like nervous systems and brains  took a few hundred million years. Then the next steps  like language and so on  took less than a million years. And these next steps  like electronics  seem to be taking only a few decades. The process is feeding on itself and becoming  I guess  autocatalytic is the word for it    when something reinforces its rate of change. The more it changes  the faster it changes. And I think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion of curve. We're seeing this process feeding back on itself. Now I design computers for a living  and I know that the mechanisms that I use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers. So right now  what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense. I don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does. There are billions of them. Instead  what I do and what the designers at Thinking Machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do  much farther and faster than we could ever do. And in fact  sometimes it takes it by methods that we don't quite even understand. One method that's particularly interesting that I've been using a lot lately is evolution itself. So what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time scale. So for example  in the most extreme cases  we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions. Say   Computer  would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions. Now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions  run all of those programs  and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted.  So in other words  I define what I wanted. Let's say I want to sort numbers  as a simple example I've done it with. So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers. So of course  random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers  so none of them will really do it. But one of them  by luck  may put two numbers in the right order. And I say   Computer  would you please now take the    percent of those random sequences that did the best job. Save those. Kill off the rest. And now let's reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best. And let's reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to sex.  Take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines  and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs. So I've got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job. Say   Please repeat that process.  Score them again. Introduce some mutations perhaps. And try that again and do that for another generation. Well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds. So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes  or in the complicated cases  in a few hours. At the end of that  I end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers. In fact  they are programs that are much more efficient than programs I could have ever written by hand. Now if I look at those programs  I can't tell you how they work. I've tried looking at them and telling you how they work. They're obscure  weird programs. But they do the job. And in fact  I know  I'm very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job. In fact  their life depended on doing the job. I was riding in a     with Marvin Minsky once  and he pulls out this card and says   Oh look. Look at this. It says  'This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight.' Doesn't that make you feel confident   In fact  we know that the engineering process doesn't work very well when it gets complicated. So we're beginning to depend on computers to do a process that's very different than engineering. And it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce. And yet  we don't quite understand the options of it. So in a sense  it's getting ahead of us. We're now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we'll be able to run this process much faster. So it's feeding back on itself. The thing is becoming faster and that's why I think it seems so confusing. Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves. We're taking off. And what we are is we're at a point in time which is analogous to when single celled organisms were turning into multi celled organisms. So we're the amoebas and we can't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we're creating. We're right at that point of transition. But I think that there really is something coming along after us. I think it's very haughty of us to think that we're the end product of evolution. And I think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is. So lunch is coming along  and I think I will stop at that point  before I get selected out. I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age. I grew up in Mobile  Alabama    somebody's got to be from Mobile  right     and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers  forming this beautiful delta. And the delta has alligators crawling in and out of rivers filled with fish and cypress trees dripping with snakes  birds of every flavor. It's an absolute magical wonderland to live in    if you're a kid interested in animals  to grow up in. And this delta water flows to Mobile Bay  and finally into the Gulf of Mexico. And I remember my first real contact with octopus was probably at age five or six. I was in the gulf  and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom. And I reached down and picked him up  and immediately became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility. It was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand. It was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature. Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands and started flashing colors  just pulsing all of these colors. And as I looked at it  it kind of tucked its arms under it  raised into a spherical shape and turned chocolate brown with two white stripes. I'm going   My gosh   I had never seen anything like this in my life  So I marveled for a moment  and then decided it was time to release him  so I put him down. The octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing  It landed on the bottom in the rubble and    fwoosh     vanished right before my eyes. And I knew  right then  at age six  that is an animal that I want to learn more about. So I did. And I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology  and then moved to Hawaii and entered graduate school at the University of Hawaii. And while a student at Hawaii  I worked at the Waikiki Aquarium. And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays  and being the spineless guy  I thought  well I'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals I had been learning about as a student and bring them in  and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display. Now  the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at  but they didn't really interact with people. But the octopus did. If you walked up to an octopus tank  especially early in the morning before anyone arrived  the octopus would rise up and look at you and you're thinking   Is that guy really looking at me  He is looking at me   And you walk up to the front of the tank. Then you realize that these animals all have different personalities  Some of them would hold their ground  others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks  and one in particular  this amazing animal ... I went up to the front of the tank  and he's just staring at me  and he had little horns come up above his eyes. So I went right up to the front of the tank    I was three or four inches from the front glass    and the octopus was sitting on a perch  a little rock  and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass. So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away  and at that time I could actually focus that close  now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone. Anyway  there we were  staring at each other  and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank from the filtration system  and    chk chk chk chk chk     this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down. He reaches up  takes another armful of gravel  releases it    chk chk chk chk chk     same thing. Then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm. Then he lifts another arm and I lift another arm. And then I realize the octopus won the arms race  because I was out and he had six left.  Laughter  But the only way I can describe what I was seeing that day was that this octopus was playing  which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate. So  about three years into my degree  a funny thing happened on the way to the office  which actually changed the course of my life. A man came into the aquarium. It's a long story  but essentially he sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the South Pacific to collect animals for him  and as we left  he gave us two    millimeter movie cameras. He said   Make a movie about this expedition.   OK  a couple of biologists making a movie    this'll be interesting   and off we went. And we did  we made a movie  which had to be the worst movie ever made in the history of movie making  but it was a blast. I had so much fun. And I remember that proverbial light going off in my head  thinking   Wait a minute. Maybe I can do this all the time. Yeah  I'll be a filmmaker.  So I literally came back from that job  quit school  hung my filmmaking shingle and just never told anyone that I didn't know what I was doing. It's been a good ride. And what I learned in school though was really beneficial. If you're a wildlife filmmaker and you're going out into the field to film animals  especially behavior  it helps to have a fundamental background on who these animals are  how they work and  you know  a bit about their behaviors. But where I really learned about octopus was in the field  as a filmmaker making films with them  where you're allowed to spend large periods of time with the animals  seeing octopus being octopus in their ocean homes. I remember I took a trip to Australia  went to an island called One Tree Island. And apparently  evolution had occurred at a pretty rapid rate on One Tree  between the time they named it and the time I arrived  because I'm sure there were at least three trees on that island when we were there. Anyway  one tree is situated right next to a beautiful coral reef. In fact  there's a surge channel where the tide is moving back and forth  twice a day  pretty rapidly. And there's a beautiful reef  very complex reef  with lots of animals  including a lot of octopus. And not uniquely but certainly  the octopus in Australia are masters at camouflage. As a matter of fact  there's one right there. So our first challenge was to find these things  and that was a challenge  indeed. But the idea is  we were there for a month and I wanted to acclimate the animals to us so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them. So the first week was pretty much spent just getting as close as we could  every day a little closer  a little closer  a little closer. And you knew what the limit was  they would start getting twitchy and you'd back up  come back in a few hours. And after the first week  they ignored us. It was like   I don't know what that thing is  but he's no threat to me.  So they went on about their business and from a foot away  we're watching mating and courting and fighting and it is just an unbelievable experience. And one of the most fantastic displays that I remember  or at least visually  was a foraging behavior. And they had a lot of different techniques that they would use for foraging  but this particular one used vision. And they would see a coral head  maybe    feet away  and start moving over toward that coral head. And I don't know whether they actually saw crab in it  or imagined that one might be  but whatever the case  they would leap off the bottom and go through the water and land right on top of this coral head  and then the web between the arms would completely engulf the coral head  and they would fish out  swim for crabs. And as soon as the crabs touched the arm  it was lights out. And I always wondered what happened under that web. So we created a way to find out   Laughter  and I got my first look at that famous beak in action. It was fantastic. If you're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals  you might as well pick one that's fairly common. And octopus are  they live in all the oceans. They also live deep. And I can't say octopus are responsible for my really strong interest in getting in subs and going deep  but whatever the case  I like that. It's like nothing you've ever done. If you ever really want to get away from it all and see something that you have never seen  and have an excellent chance of seeing something no one has ever seen  get in a sub. You climb in  seal the hatch  turn on a little oxygen  turn on the scrubber  which removes the CO  in the air you breathe  and they chuck you overboard. Down you go. There's no connection to the surface apart from a pretty funky radio. And as you go down  the washing machine at the surface calms down. And it gets quiet. And it starts getting really nice. And as you go deeper  that lovely  blue water you were launched in gives way to darker and darker blue. And finally  it's a rich lavender  and after a couple of thousand feet  it's ink black. And now you've entered the realm of the mid water community. You could give an entire talk about the creatures that live in the mid water. Suffice to say though  as far as I'm concerned  without question  the most bizarre designs and outrageous behaviors are in the animals that live in the mid water community. But we're just going to zip right past this area  this area that includes about    percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid ocean ridge  which I think is even more extraordinary. The mid ocean ridge is a huge mountain range         miles long  snaking around the entire globe. And they're big mountains  thousands of feet tall  some of which are tens of thousands of feet and bust through the surface  creating islands like Hawaii. And the top of this mountain range is splitting apart  creating a rift valley. And when you dive into that rift valley  that's where the action is because literally thousands of active volcanoes are going off at any point in time all along this        mile range. And as these tectonic plates are spreading apart  magma  lava is coming up and filling those gaps  and you're looking land    new land    being created right before your eyes. And over the tops of them is       to       meters of water creating enormous pressure  forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth  until it hits a magma chamber where it becomes superheated and supersaturated with minerals  reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone. In fact  this whole area is like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings. And this vent fluid is about     or     degrees F. The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing. So it immediately cools  and it can no longer hold in suspension all of the material that it's dissolved  and it precipitates out  forming black smoke. And it forms these towers  these chimneys that are            feet tall. And all along the sides of these chimneys is shimmering with heat and loaded with life. You've got black smokers going all over the place and chimneys that have tube worms that might be eight to    feet long. And out of the tops of these tube worms are these beautiful red plumes. And living amongst the tangle of tube worms is an entire community of animals  shrimp  fish  lobsters  crab  clams and swarms of arthropods that are playing that dangerous game between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold. And this whole ecosystem wasn't even known about until    years ago. And it completely threw science on its head. It made scientists rethink where life on Earth might have actually begun. And before the discovery of these vents  all life on Earth  the key to life on Earth  was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis. But down there  there is no sun  there is no photosynthesis  it's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it  and it's all so ephemeral. You might film this unbelievable hydrothermal vent  which you think at the time has to be on another planet. It's amazing to think that this is actually on earth  it looks like aliens in an alien environment. But you go back to the same vent eight years later and it can be completely dead. There's no hot water. All of the animals are gone  they're dead  and the chimneys are still there creating a really nice ghost town  an eerie  spooky ghost town  but essentially devoid of animals  of course. But    miles down the ridge... pshhh  There's another volcano going. And there's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed. And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities is going on every    or    years all along the ridge. And that ephemeral nature of the hydrothermal vent community isn't really different from some of the areas that I've seen in    years of traveling around  making films. Where you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay. And you go back  and I'm at home  and I'm thinking   Okay  what can I shoot ... Ah  I know where I can shoot that. There's this beautiful bay  lots of soft corals and stomatopods.  And you show up  and it's dead. There's no coral  algae growing on it  and the water's pea soup. You think   Well  what happened   And you turn around  and there's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in  and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth. And over here there's a golf course going in. And this is the tropics. It's raining like crazy here. So this rainwater is flooding down the hillside  carrying with it sediments from the construction site  smothering the coral and killing it. And fertilizers and pesticides are flowing into the bay from the golf course    the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals  fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom    and there's your pea soup. But  encouragingly  I've seen just the opposite. I've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay. And I looked at it  just said   Yuck   and go and work on the other side of the island. Five years later  come back  and that same bay is now gorgeous. It's beautiful. It's got living coral  fish all over the place  crystal clear water  and you go   How did that happen   Well  how it happened is the local community galvanized. They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it  enacted laws and made permits required to do responsible construction and golf course maintenance and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay  and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay  and the bay recovered. The ocean has an amazing ability to recover  if we'll just leave it alone. I think Margaret Mead said it best. She said that a small group of thoughtful people could change the world. Indeed  it's the only thing that ever has. And a small group of thoughtful people changed that bay. I'm a big fan of grassroots organizations. I've been to a lot of lectures where  at the end of it  inevitably  one of the first questions that comes up is   But  but what can I do  I'm an individual. I'm one person. And these problems are so large and global  and it's just overwhelming.  Fair enough question. My answer to that is don't look at the big  overwhelming issues of the world. Look in your own backyard. Look in your heart  actually. What do you really care about that isn't right where you live  And fix it. Create a healing zone in your neighborhood and encourage others to do the same. And maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map  little dots on a map. And in fact  the way that we can communicate today    where Alaska is instantly knowing what's going on in China  and the Kiwis did this  and then over in England they tried to ... and everybody is talking to everyone else    it's not isolated points on a map anymore  it's a network we've created. And maybe these healing zones can start growing  and possibly even overlap  and good things can happen. So that's how I answer that question. Look in your own backyard  in fact  look in the mirror. What can you do that is more responsible than what you're doing now  And do that  and spread the word. The vent community animals can't really do much about the life and death that's going on where they live  but up here we can. In theory  we're thinking  rational human beings. And we can make changes to our behavior that will influence and affect the environment  like those people changed the health of that bay. Now  Sylvia's TED Prize wish was to beseech us to do anything we could  everything we could  to set aside not pin pricks  but significant expanses of the ocean for preservation   hope spots   she calls them. And I applaud that. I loudly applaud that. And it's my hope that some of these  hope spots  can be in the deep ocean  an area that has historically been seriously neglected  if not abused. The term  deep six  comes to mind   If it's too big or too toxic for a landfill  deep six it   So  I hope that we can also keep some of these  hope spots  in the deep sea. Now  I don't get a wish  but I certainly can say that I will do anything I can to support Sylvia Earle's wish. And that I do. Thank you very much.  Applause  When we park in a big parking lot  how do we remember where we parked our car  Here's the problem facing Homer. And we're going to try to understand what's happening in his brain. So we'll start with the hippocampus  shown in yellow  which is the organ of memory. If you have damage there  like in Alzheimer's  you can't remember things including where you parked your car. It's named after Latin for  seahorse   which it resembles. And like the rest of the brain  it's made of neurons. So the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it. And the neurons communicate with each other by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity via connections to each other. The hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells  which are very densely interconnected. And scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food. So we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of this rat here. And when it fires a little spike of electricity  there's going to be a red dot and a click. So what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment. And it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike. So we could show the firing rate of that neuron as a function of the animal's location. And if we record from lots of different neurons  we'll see that different neurons fire when the animal goes in different parts of its environment  like in this square box shown here. So together they form a map for the rest of the brain  telling the brain continually   Where am I now within my environment   Place cells are also being recorded in humans. So epilepsy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring. And some of these patients played a video game where they drive around a small town. And place cells in their hippocampi would fire  become active  start sending electrical impulses whenever they drove through a particular location in that town. So how does a place cell know where the rat or person is within its environment  Well these two cells here show us that the boundaries of the environment are particularly important. So the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of the box that their rat's in. And when you expand the box  the firing location expands. The one below likes to fire whenever there's a wall close by to the south. And if you put another wall inside the box  then the cell fires in both place wherever there's a wall to the south as the animal explores around in its box. So this predicts that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you    extended buildings and so on    is particularly important for the hippocampus. And indeed  on the inputs to the hippocampus  cells are found which project into the hippocampus  which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it's exploring around. So the cell on the left  you can see  it fires whenever the animal gets near to a wall or a boundary to the east  whether it's the edge or the wall of a square box or the circular wall of the circular box or even the drop at the edge of a table  which the animals are running around. And the cell on the right there fires whenever there's a boundary to the south  whether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart. So that's one way in which we think place cells determine where the animal is as it's exploring around. We can also test where we think objects are  like this goal flag  in simple environments    or indeed  where your car would be. So we can have people explore an environment and see the location they have to remember. And then  if we put them back in the environment  generally they're quite good at putting a marker down where they thought that flag or their car was. But on some trials  we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell. In that case  we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment. And what you see  for example  if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment  and then if you ask people where it was  but you've made the environment bigger  where they think the flag had been stretches out in exactly the same way that the place cell firing stretched out. It's as if you remember where the flag was by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells at that location  and then you can get back to that location by moving around so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells with that stored pattern. That guides you back to the location that you want to remember. But we also know where we are through movement. So if we take some outbound path    perhaps we park and we wander off    we know because our own movements  which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back. And place cells also get this kind of path integration input from a kind of cell called a grid cell. Now grid cells are found  again  on the inputs to the hippocampus  and they're a bit like place cells. But now as the rat explores around  each individual cell fires in a whole array of different locations which are laid out across the environment in an amazingly regular triangular grid. And if you record from several grid cells    shown here in different colors    each one has a grid like firing pattern across the environment  and each cell's grid like firing pattern is shifted slightly relative to the other cells. So the red one fires on this grid and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one. So together  it's as if the rat can put a virtual grid of firing locations across its environment    a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you'd find on a map  but using triangles. And as it moves around  the electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is  so that it can use its own movements to know where it is in its environment. Do people have grid cells  Well because all of the grid like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry  the same orientations of grid  shown in orange here  it means that the net activity of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether we're running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between. So we can put people in an MRI scanner and have them do a little video game like the one I showed you and look for this signal. And indeed  you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex  which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats. So back to Homer. He's probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked. And that would be represented by the firing of boundary detecting cells. He's also remembering the path he took out of the car park  which would be represented in the firing of grid cells. Now both of these kinds of cells can make the place cells fire. And he can return to the location where he parked by moving so as to find where it is that best matches the firing pattern of the place cells in his brain currently with the stored pattern where he parked his car. And that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his car's actually there. Maybe it's been towed. But he knows where it was  so he knows to go and get it. So beyond spatial memory  if we look for this grid like firing pattern throughout the whole brain  we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks  like remembering the last time you went to a wedding  for example. So it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery so that we can recreate the spatial scene  at least  of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them. So if this was happening  your memories could start by place cells activating each other via these dense interconnections and then reactivating boundary cells to create the spatial structure of the scene around your viewpoint. And grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space. Another kind of cell  head direction cells  which I didn't mention yet  they fire like a compass according to which way you're facing. They could define the viewing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery  so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding  for example. So this is just one example of a new era really in cognitive neuroscience where we're beginning to understand psychological processes like how you remember or imagine or even think in terms of the actions of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains. Thank you very much. What I want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the Western world    Australia  United States  U.K. and so on    face in some of the deployments that they're dealing with in the modern world at this time. If you think about the sorts of things that we've sent Australian military personnel to in recent years  we've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan  but you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands and so on. And a lot of these deployments that we're actually sending military personnel to these days aren't traditional wars. In fact  a lot of the jobs that we're asking the military personnel to do in these situations are ones that  in their own countries  in Australia  the United States and so on  would actually be done by police officers. And so there's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations  because they're doing things that they haven't really been trained for  and they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for. Now there's a bunch of reasons why we actually do send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs. If Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example  we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go. So when we have to send someone  we send the military    because they're there  they're available and  heck  they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support. So they are able to do it in that sense. But they aren't trained in the same way that police officers are and they're certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are. And so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues. One particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether  when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs  we ought to be equipping them differently  and in particular  whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non lethal weapons that police have. Since they're doing some of these same jobs  maybe they should have some of those things. And of course  there's a range of places where you'd think those things would be really useful. So for example  when you've got military checkpoints. If people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel there are unsure whether this person's hostile or not. Say this person approaching here  and they say   Well is this a suicide bomber or not  Have they got something hidden under their clothing  What's going to happen   They don't know whether this person's hostile or not. If this person doesn't follow directions  then they may end up shooting them and then find out afterward either  yes  we shot the right person  or  no  this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on. So if they had non lethal weapons then they would say   Well we can use them in that sort of situation. If we shoot someone who wasn't hostile  at least we haven't killed them.  Another situation. This photo is actually from one of the missions in the Balkans in the late     s. Situation's a little bit different where perhaps they know someone who's hostile  where they've got someone shooting at them or doing something else that's clearly hostile  throwing rocks  whatever. But if they respond  there's a range of other people around  who are innocent people who might also get hurt    be collateral damage that the military often doesn't want to talk about. So again  they would say   Well if we have access to non lethal weapons  if we've got someone we know is hostile  we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place  at least  again  we're not going to kill them.  Another suggestion has been  since we're putting so many robots in the field  we can see the time coming where they're actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous. They're going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without a human in the loop. And so the suggestion is  well hey  if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this  maybe it would be a good idea  again  with these things if they were armed with non lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person  again  they haven't actually killed them. Now there's a whole range of different sorts of non lethal weapons  some of which are obviously available now  some of which they're developing. So you've got traditional things like pepper spray  O.C. spray up at the top there  or Tasers over here. The one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them. You've got non lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones. And this one in the middle here  the large truck  is actually called the Active Denial System    something the U.S. military is working on at the moment. It's essentially a big microwave transmitter. It's sort of your classic idea of a heat ray. It goes out to a really long distance  compared to any of these other sorts of things. And anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way. It is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven  but it is basically boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin. So you feel this massive heat  and you go   I want to get out of the way.  And they're thinking  well this will be really useful in places like where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area  if the crowd is being hostile. If we need to keep people away from a particular place  we can do that with these sorts of things. So obviously there's a whole range of different sorts of non lethal weapons we could give military personnel and there's a whole range of situations where they're looking a them and saying   Hey  these things could be really useful.  But as I said  the military and the police are very different. Yes  you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different. In particular  the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different. The police    and knowing because I've actually helped to train police    police  in particular Western jurisdictions at least  are trained to de escalate force  to try and avoid using force wherever possible  and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort. Military personnel are being trained for war  so they're trained that  as soon as things go bad  their first response is lethal force. The moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine  you can start shooting at people. So their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different  and I think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police. And since we've already had so many problems with police use of non lethal weapons in various ways  I thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try to relate it to the military context. And I was really surprised when I started to do this  to see that  in fact  even those people who were advocating the use of non lethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that. They generally seem to think   Well  why would we care what's happened with the police  We're looking at something different   and didn't seem to recognize  in fact  they were looking at pretty much the same stuff. So I actually started to investigate some of those issues and have a look at the way that police use non lethal weapons when they're introduced and some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them. And of course  being Australian  I started looking at stuff in Australia  knowing  again  from my own experience about various times when non lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia. So one of the things I particularly looked at was the use of O.C. spray  oleoresin capsicum spray  pepper spray  by Australian police and seeing when that had been introduced  what had happened and those sorts of issues. And one study that I found  a particularly interesting one  was actually in Queensland  because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly. And I went and had a look at some of the figures here. Now when they introduced O.C. spray in Queensland  they were really explicit. The police minister had a whole heap of public statements made about it. They were saying   This is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting. This is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone.  So I went and looked at all of these police shooting figures. And you can't actually find them very easily for individual Australian states. I could only find these ones. This is from a Australian Institute of Criminology report. As you can see from the fine print  if you can read it at the top   Police shooting deaths  means not just people who have been shot by police  but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police. But this is the figures across the entire country. And the red arrow represents the point where Queensland actually said   Yes  this is where we're going to give all police officers across the entire state access to O.C. spray.  So you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years. There was a spike  of course  a few years before  but that wasn't actually Queensland. Anyone know where that was  Wasn't Port Arthur  no. Victoria  Yes  correct. That spike was all Victoria. So it wasn't that Queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on. So six shootings across the whole country  fairly consistently over the years before. So the next two years were the years they studied              . Anyone want to take a stab at the number of times  given how they've introduced this  the number of times police in Queensland used O.C. spray in that period  Hundreds  One  three. Thousand is getting better. Explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force    an alternative between shouting and shooting. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland police didn't have O.C. spray  they wouldn't have shot       people in those two years. In fact  if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at  the material they were collecting and examining  you can see the suspects were only armed in about    percent of cases where O.C. spray was used. It was routinely being used in this period  and  of course  still is routinely used    because there were no complaints about it  not within the context of this study anyway    it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent  who were potentially violent  and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively non compliant. This person is not doing anything violent  but they just won't do what we want them to. They're not obeying the directions that we're giving them  so we'll give them a shot of the O.C. spray. That'll speed them up. Everything will work out better that way. This was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms  but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems. Now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non lethal weapons    and people when they're actually saying   Well hey  there might be some problems     there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on. One of those problems is that non lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately. One of the fundamental principles of military use of force is that you have to be discriminate. You have to be careful about who you're shooting at. So one of the problems that's been suggested with non lethal weapons is that they might be used indiscriminately    that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore. And in fact  one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Dubrovka Theatre siege in Moscow in       which probably a lot of you  unlike most of my students at ADFA  are actually old enough to remember. So Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater. They were holding something like     people hostage. They'd released a bunch of people  but they still had about     people hostage. And the Russian special military police  special forces  Spetsnaz  came in and actually stormed the theater. And the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anesthetic gas. And it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas. It was used indiscriminately. They pumped the whole theater full of the gas. And it's no surprise that people died  because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale  what position they're going to fall in when they become unconscious and so on. There were  in fact  only a couple of people who got shot in this episode. So when they had a look at it afterward  there were only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation. Virtually everybody that got killed got killed from inhaling the gas. The final toll of hostages is a little unclear  but it's certainly a few more than that  because there were other people who died over the next few days. So this was one particular problem they talked about  that it might be used indiscriminately. Second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non lethal weapons  and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention  it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare  the problem with that is that it's seen that sometimes non lethal weapons might actually be used  not as an alternative to lethal force  but as a lethal force multiplier    that you use non lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective. The people you're going to be shooting at aren't going to be able to get out of the way. They're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better. And in fact  that's exactly what happened here. The hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody  they were simply shot in the head. So this non lethal weapon was being used  in fact  in this case as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation. Another problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use non lethal weapons and get trained about them and then get tested and so on. Because they get tested in nice  safe environments. And people get taught to use them in nice  safe environments like this  where you can see exactly what's going on. The person who's spraying the O.C. spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on. But they don't ever get used like that. They get used out in the real world  like in Texas  like this. I confess  this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this. It happened while I was working as a research fellow at the U.S. Naval Academy. And news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer. She wasn't violent. In fact  he was probably six inches taller than me  and she was about this tall. And eventually she said to him  Well I'm going to get back in my car.  And he says   If you get back into your car  I'm going to tase you.  And she says   Oh  go ahead. Tase me.  And so he does. And it's all captured by the video camera running in the front of the police car. So she's     and it's seen that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with her. And other examples of the same sorts of things with other people where you think where you think   Is this really an appropriate way to use non lethal weapons    Police chief fires Taser into    year old girl's head.   She was running away. What else was I suppose to do   Or Florida   Police Taser six year old boy at elementary school.  And they clearly learned a lot from it because in the same district   Police review policy after children shocked   nd child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks.  Same police district. Another child within weeks of Tasering the six year old boy. Just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States  it happened in Canada as well. And a colleague of mine sent me this one from London. But my personal favorite of these ones  I have to confess  does actually come from the United States   Officers Taser    year old disabled woman in her bed.  I checked the reports on this one. I looked at it. I was really surprised. Apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed. I kid you not. That's exactly what it said.  She took up a more threatening position in her bed.  Okay. But I'd remind you what I'm talking about  I'm talking about military uses of non lethal weapons. So why is this relevant  Because police are actually more restrained in the use of force than the military are. They're trained to be more restrained in the use of force than the military are. They're trained to think more  to try and de escalate. So if you have these problems with police officers with non lethal weapons  what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel  The last thing that I would just like to say  when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non lethal weapon would look like  they almost inevitably say the same thing. They say   Well  it's got to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon. So if you threaten to use it  people are going to comply with it  but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects.  In other words  your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse. What would these guys have done if they'd had access to Tasers or to a manned  portable version of the Active Denial System    a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about it. So I think  yes  there may be ways that non lethal weapons are going to be great in these situations  but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well. Thanks very much. Both myself and my brother belong to the under    demographic  which Pat said makes    percent  but according to our statistics it makes    percent of the region's population. Qatar is no exception to the region. It's a very young nation led by young people. We have been reminiscing about the latest technologies and the iPods  and for me the abaya  my traditional dress that I'm wearing today. Now this is not a religious garment  nor is it a religious statement. Instead  it's a diverse cultural statement that we choose to wear. Now I remember a few years ago  a journalist asked Dr. Sheikha  who's sitting here  president of Qatar University    who  by the way  is a woman    he asked her whether she thought the abaya hindered or infringed her freedom in any way. Her answer was quite the contrary. Instead  she felt more free  more free because she could wear whatever she wanted under the abaya. She could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care. Not that you do  I'm just saying. My point is here  people have a choice    just like the Indian lady could wear her sari or the Japanese woman could wear her kimono. We are changing our culture from within  but at the same time we are reconnecting with our traditions. We know that modernization is happening. And yes  Qatar wants to be a modern nation. But at the same time we are reconnecting and reasserting our Arab heritage. It's important for us to grow organically. And we continuously make the conscious decision to reach that balance. In fact  research has shown that the more the world is flat  if I use Tom Friedman's analogy  or global  the more and more people are wanting to be different. And for us young people  they're looking to become individuals and find their differences amongst themselves. Which is why I prefer the Richard Wilk analogy of globalizing the local and localizing the global. We don't want to be all the same  but we want to respect each other and understand each other. And therefore tradition becomes more important  not less important. Life necessitates a universal world  however  we believe in the security of having a local identity. And this is what the leaders of this region are trying to do. We're trying to be part of this global village  but at the same time we're revising ourselves through our cultural institutions and cultural development. I'm a representation of that phenomenon. And I think a lot of people in this room  I can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself. And I'm sure  although we can't see the people in Washington  they are in the same position. We're continuously trying to straddle different worlds  different cultures and trying to meet the challenges of a different expectation from ourselves and from others. So I want to ask a question  What should culture in the   st century look like  In a time where the world is becoming personalized  when the mobile phone  the burger  the telephone  everything has its own personal identity  how should we perceive ourselves and how should we perceive others  How does that impact our desert culture  I'm not sure of how many of you in Washington are aware of the cultural developments happening in the region and  the more recent  Museum of Islamic Art opened in Qatar in     . I myself am personalizing these cultural developments  but I also understand that this has to be done organically. Yes  we do have all the resources that we need in order to develop new cultural institutions  but what I think is more important is that we are very fortunate to have visionary leaders who understand that this can't happen from outside  it has to come from within. And guess what  You might be surprised to know that most people in the Gulf who are leading these cultural initiatives happen to be women. I want to ask you  why do you think this is  Is it because it's a soft option  we have nothing else to do  No  I don't think so. I think that women in this part of the world realize that culture is an important component to connect people both locally and regionally. It's a natural component for bringing people together  discussing ideas    in the same way we're doing here at TED. We're here  we're part of a community  sharing out ideas and discussing them. Art becomes a very important part of our national identity. The existential and social and political impact an artist has on his nation's development of cultural identity is very important. You know  art and culture is big business. Ask me. Ask the chairpersons and CEOs of Sotheby's and Christie's. Ask Charles Saatchi about great art. They make a lot of money. So I think women in our society are becoming leaders  because they realize that for their future generations  it's very important to maintain our cultural identities. Why else do Greeks demand the return of the Elgin Marbles  And why is there an uproar when a private collector tries to sell his collection to a foreign museum  Why does it take me months on end to get an export license from London or New York in order to get pieces into my country  In few hours  Shirin Neshat  my friend from Iran who's a very important artist for us will be talking to you. She lives in New York City  but she doesn't try to be a Western artist. Instead  she tries to engage in a very important dialogue about her culture  nation and heritage. She does that through important visual forms of photography and film. In the same way  Qatar is trying to grow its national museums through an organic process from within. Our mission is of cultural integration and independence. We don't want to have what there is in the West. We don't want their collections. We want to build our own identities  our own fabric  create an open dialogue so that we share our ideas and share yours with us. In a few days  we will be opening the Arab Museum of Modern Art. We have done extensive research to ensure that Arab and Muslim artists  and Arabs who are not Muslims    not all Arabs are Muslims  by the way    but we make sure that they are represented in this new institution. This institution is government backed and it has been the case for the past three decades. We will open the museum in a few days  and I welcome all of you to get on Qatar Airways and come and join us. Now this museum is just as important to us as the West. Some of you might have heard of the Algerian artist Baya Mahieddine  but I doubt a lot of people know that this artist worked in Picasso's studio in Paris in the     s. For me it was a new discovery. And I think with time  in the years to come we'll be learning a lot about our Picassos  our Legers and our Cezannes. We do have artists  but unfortunately we have not discovered them yet. Now visual expression is just one form of culture integration. We have realized that recently more and more people are using the means of YouTube and social networking to express their stories  share their photos and tell their own stories through their own voices. In a similar way  we have created the Doha Film Institute. Now the Doha Film Institute is an organization to teach people about film and filmmaking. Last year we didn't have one Qatari woman filmmaker. Today I am proud to say we have trained and educated over    Qatari women filmmakers to edit  tell their own stories in their own voices. Now if you'll allow me  I would love to share a one minute film that has proven to show that a    sec film can be as powerful as a haiku in telling a big picture. And this is one of our filmmakers' products. Who are you playing  Girl  Uncle Khaled. Here  put on the headscarf. Khaled  Why would I want to put it on  Girl  Do as you're told  young girl. Boy  No  you play mom and I play dad.  Girl  But it's my game.  Play by yourself then. Girl  Women  One word and they get upset. Useless. Thank you. Thank you  SM  Going back to straddling between East and West  last month we had our second Doha Tribeca Film Festival here in Doha. The Doha Tribeca Film Festival was held at our new cultural hub  Katara. It attracted        people  and we showcased    films. Now the Doha Tribeca Film Festival is not an imported festival  but rather an important festival between the cities of New York and Doha. It's important for two things. First  it allows us to showcase our Arab filmmakers and voices to one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world  New York City. At the same time  we are inviting them to come and explore our part of the world. They're learning our culture  our language  our heritage and realizing we're just as different and just the same as each other. Now over and over again  people have said   Let's build bridges   and frankly  I want to do more than that. I would like break the walls of ignorance between East and West    no  not the soft option that we have discussed before  but rather the soft power that Joseph Nye has spoken about before. Culture's a very important tool to bring people together. We should not underestimate it.  Know thyself   that is the journey of self expression and self realization that we are traveling. Now I don't pretend to have all the answers  but I know that me as an individual and we as a nation welcome this community of ideas worth spreading. This is a very interesting journey. I welcome you on board for us to engage and discuss new ideas of how to bring people together through cultural initiatives and discussions. Familiarity destroys and trumps fear. Try it. Ladies and gentlemen  thank you very much. Shokran. Shall I ask for a show of hands or a clapping of people in different generations  I'm interested in how many are three to    years old. None  huh  All right. I'm going to talk about dinosaurs. Do you remember dinosaurs when you were that age  Dinosaurs are kind of funny  you know. We're going to kind of go in a different direction right now. I hope you all realize that. So I'll just give you my message up front  Try not to go extinct. That's it. People ask me a lot    in fact  one of the most asked questions I get is  why do children like dinosaurs so much  What's the fascination  And I usually just say   Well dinosaurs were big  different and gone.  They're all gone. Well that's not true  but we'll get to the goose in a minute. So that's sort of the theme  big  different and gone. The title of my talk  Shape shifting Dinosaurs  The Cause of a Premature Extinction. Now I assume that we remember dinosaurs. And there's lots of different shapes. Lots of different kinds. A long time ago  back in the early     s  museums were out looking for dinosaurs. They went out and gathered them up. And this is an interesting story. Every museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else had. So if the museum in Toronto went out and collected a Tyrannosaur  a big one  then the museum in Ottawa wanted a bigger one and a better one. And that happened for all museums. So everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs. And this was in the early     s. By about       some scientists were sitting around and they thought   What in the world  Look at these dinosaurs. They're all big. Where are all the little ones   And they thought about it and they even wrote papers about it   Where are the little dinosaurs   Well  go to a museum  you'll see  see how many baby dinosaurs there are. People assumed    and this was actually a problem    people assumed that if they had little dinosaurs  if they had juvenile dinosaurs  they'd be easy to identify. You'd have a big dinosaur and a littler dinosaur. But all they had were big dinosaurs. And it comes down to a couple of things. First off  scientists have egos  and scientists like to name dinosaurs. They like to name anything. Everybody likes to have their own animal that they named. And so every time they found something that looked a little different  they named it something different. And what happened  of course  is we ended up with a whole bunch of different dinosaurs. In       a light went on in somebody's head. Dr. Peter Dodson at the University of Pennsylvania actually realized that dinosaurs grew kind of like birds do  which is different than the way reptiles grow. And in fact  he used the cassowary as an example. And it's kind of cool    if you look at the cassowary  or any of the birds that have crests on their heads  they actually grow to about    percent adult size before the crest starts to grow. Now think about that. They're basically retaining their juvenile characteristics very late in what we call ontogeny. So allometric cranial ontogeny is relative skull growth. So you can see that if you actually found one that was    percent grown and you didn't know that it was going to grow up to a cassowary  you would think they were two different animals. So this was a problem  and Peter Dodson pointed this out using some duck billed dinosaurs then called Hypacrosaurus. And he showed that if you were to take a baby and an adult and make an average of what it should look like  if it grew in sort of a linear fashion  it would have a crest about half the size of the adult. But the actual sub adult at    percent had no crest at all. So this was interesting. So this is where people went astray again. I mean  if they'd have just taken that  taken Peter Dodson's work  and gone on with that  then we would have a lot less dinosaurs than we have. But scientists have egos  they like to name things. And so they went on naming dinosaurs because they were different. Now we have a way of actually testing to see whether a dinosaur  or any animal  is a young one or an older one. And that's by actually cutting into their bones. But cutting into the bones of a dinosaur is hard to do  as you can imagine  because in museums bones are precious. You go into a museum and they take really good care of them. They put them in foam  little containers. They're very well taken care of. They don't like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside. So they don't normally let you do that. But I have a museum and I collect dinosaurs and I can saw mine open. So that's what I do. So if you cut open a little dinosaur  it's very spongy inside like A. And if you cut into an older dinosaur  it's very massive. You can tell it's mature bone. So it's real easy to tell them apart. So what I want to do is show you these. In North America in the Northern Plains of the United States and the Southern Plains of Alberta and Saskatchewan  there's this unit of rock called the Hell Creek Formation that produces the last dinosaurs that lived on Earth. And there are    of them that everyone recognizes    I mean the    primary dinosaurs that went extinct. And so we will evaluate them. And that's sort of what I've been doing. So my students  my staff  we've been cutting them open. Now as you can imagine  cutting open a leg bone is one thing  but when you go to a museum and say   You don't mind if I cut open your dinosaur's skull do you   they say   Go away.  So here are    dinosaurs. And we want to look at these three first. So these are dinosaurs that are called Pachycephalosaurs. And everybody knows that these three animals are related. And the assumption is is that they're related like cousins or whatever. But no one ever considered that they might be more closely related. In other words  people looked at them and they saw the differences. And you all know that if you are going to determine whether you're related to your brother or your sister  you can't do it by looking at differences. You can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities. So people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are. Pachycephalosaurus has a big  thick dome on its head  and it's got some little bumps on the back of its head  and it's got a bunch of gnarly things on the end of its nose. And then Stygimoloch  another dinosaur from the same age  lived at the same time  has spikes sticking out the back of its head. It's got a little  tiny dome  and it's got a bunch of gnarly stuff on its nose. And then there's this thing called Dracorex  Hogwart's Eye. Guess where that came from  Dragon. So here's a dinosaur that has spikes sticking out of its head  no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose. Nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike. But they did look at these three and they said   These are three different dinosaurs  and Dracorex is probably the most primitive of them. And the other one is more primitive than the other. It's unclear to me how they actually sorted these three of them out. But if you line them up  if you just take those three skulls and just line them up  they line up like this. Dracorex is the littlest one  Stygimoloch is the middle size one  Pachycephalosaurus is the largest one. And one would think  that should give me a clue. But it didn't give them a clue. Because  well we know why. Scientists like to name things. So if we cut open Dracorex    I cut open our Dracorex    and look  it was spongy inside  really spongy inside. I mean  it is a juvenile and it's growing really fast. So it is going to get bigger. If you cut open Stygimoloch  it is doing the same thing. The dome  that little dome  is growing really fast. It's inflating very fast. What's interesting is the spike on the back of the Dracorex was growing very fast as well. The spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch are actually resorbing  which means they're getting smaller as that dome is getting bigger. And if we look at Pachycephalosaurus  Pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome and its little bumps on the back of its head were also resorbing. So just with these three dinosaurs  you can easily    as a scientist    we can easily hypothesize that it is just a growth series of the same animal. Which of course means that Stygimoloch and Dracorex are extinct. Okay. Which of course means we have    primary dinosaurs to deal with. So a colleague of mine at Berkley  he and I were looking at Triceratops. And before the year         now remember  Triceratops was first found in the     s    before       no one had ever seen a juvenile Triceratops. There's a Triceratops in every museum in the world  but no one had ever collected a juvenile. And we know why  right  Because everybody wants to have a big one. So everyone had a big one. So we went out and collected a whole bunch of stuff and we found a whole bunch of little ones. They're everywhere. They're all over the place. So we have a whole bunch of them at our museum. And everybody says it's because I have a little museum. When you have a little museum  you have little dinosaurs. If you look at the Triceratops  you can see it's changing  it's shape shifting. As the juveniles are growing up  their horns actually curve backwards. And then as they grow older  the horns grow forward. And that's pretty cool. If you look along the edge of the frill  they have these little triangular bones that actually grow big as triangles and then they flatten against the frill pretty much like the spikes do on the Pachycephalosaurs. And then  because the juveniles are in my collection  I cut them open and look inside. And the little one is really spongy. And the middle size one is really spongy. But what was interesting was the adult Triceratops was also spongy. And this is a skull that is two meters long. It's a big skull. But there's another dinosaur that is found in this formation that looks like a Triceratops  except it's bigger  and it's called Torosaurus. And Torosaurus  when we cut into it  has mature bone. But it's got these big holes in its shield. And everybody says   A Triceratops and a Torosaurus can't possibly be the same animal because one of them's bigger than the other one.   And it has holes in its frill.  And I said   Well do we have any juvenile Torosauruses   And they said   Well no  but it has holes in its frill.  So one of my graduate students  John Scannella  looked through our whole collection and he actually discovered that the hole starting to form in Triceratops and  of course it's open  in Torosaurus    so he found the transitional ones between Triceratops and Torosaurus  which was pretty cool. So now we know that Torosaurus is actually a grownup Triceratops. Now when we name dinosaurs  when we name anything  the original name gets to stick and the second name is thrown out. So Torosaurus is extinct. Triceratops  if you've heard the news  a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong. They thought Torosaurus should be kept and Triceratops thrown out  but that's not going to happen. All right  so we can do this with a bunch of dinosaurs. I mean  here's Edmontosaurus and Anatotitan. Anatotitan  giant duck. It's a giant duck bill dinosaur. Here's another one. So we look at the bone histology. The bone histology tells us that Edmontosaurus is a juvenile  or at least a sub adult  and the other one is an adult and we have an ontogeny. And we get rid of Anatotitan. So we can just keep doing this. And the last one is T. Rex. So there's these two dinosaurs  T. Rex and Nanotyrannus. Again  makes you wonder. But they had a good question. They were looking at them and they said   One's got    teeth  and the biggest one's got    teeth. And that doesn't make any sense at all  because we don't know of any dinosaurs that gain teeth as they get older. So it must be true    they must be different.  So we cut into them. And sure enough  Nanotyrannus has juvenile bone and the bigger one has more mature bone. It looks like it could still get bigger. And at the Museum of the Rockies where we work  I have four T. Rexes  so I can cut a whole bunch of them. But I didn't have to cut any of them really  because I just lined up their jaws and it turned out the biggest one had    teeth and the next smallest one had    and the next smallest had   . And of course  Nano has   . And we just went out and looked at other people's collections and we found one that has sort of    teeth. So again  real easy to say that Tyrannosaurus ontogeny included Nanotyrannus  and therefore we can take out another dinosaur. So when it comes down to our end cretaceous  we have seven left. And that's a good number. That's a good number to go extinct  I think. Now as you can imagine  this is not very popular with fourth graders. Fourth graders love their dinosaurs  they memorize them. And they're not happy with this. Thank you very much. I'm here to share my photography. Or is it photography  Because  of course  this is a photograph that you can't take with your camera. Yet  my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of   . It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing  but it was a bit different  because using the camera  the process was in the planning instead. And when you take a photograph with a camera  the process ends when you press the trigger. So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time. I felt like anyone could do that. So I wanted to create something different  something where the process starts when you press the trigger. Photos like this  construction going on along a busy road. But it has an unexpected twist. And despite that  it retains a level of realism. Or photos like these    both dark and colorful  but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism. When I say realism  I mean photo realism. Because  of course  it's not something you can capture really  but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph. Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick. So it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really. But what's the trick that makes it look realistic  Is it something about the details or the colors  Is it something about the light  What creates the illusion  Sometimes the perspective is the illusion. But in the end  it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two dimensional surface. It's not really what is realistic  it's what we think looks realistic really. So I think the basics are quite simple. I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality. And let me show you a simple example. Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects  something we all can relate to living in a three dimensional world. But combined in a certain way  they can create something that still looks three dimensional  like it could exist. But at the same time  we know it can't. So we trick our brains  because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make sense. And I see the same process with combining photographs. It's just really about combining different realities. So the things that make a photograph look realistic  I think it's the things that we don't even think about  the things all around us in our daily lives. But when combining photographs  this is really important to consider  because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow. So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result. As you can see  these images aren't really special. But combined  they can create something like this. So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective. Secondly  photos combined should have the same type of light. And these two images both fulfill these two requirements    shot at the same height and in the same type of light. The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless. Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed. So by matching color  contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images  adding photographic defects like depth of field  desaturated colors and noise  we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image  despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically. So here's another example. One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what's manipulated. But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations. I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place than to find a place  because then you don't need to compromise with the ideas in your head. But it does require a lot of planning. And getting this idea during winter  I knew that I had several months to plan it  to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically. So for example  the fish was captured on a fishing trip. The shores are from a different location. The underwater part was captured in a stone pit. And yeah  I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish. So to achieve a realistic result  I think it comes down to planning. It always starts with a sketch  an idea. Then it's about combining the different photographs. And here every piece is very well planned. And if you do a good job capturing the photos  the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic. So all the tools are out there  and the only thing that limits us is our imagination. Thank you. How many of you are completely comfortable with calling yourselves a leader  See  I've asked that question all the way across the country  and everywhere I ask it  no matter where  there's always a huge portion of the audience that won't put up their hand. And I've come to realize that we have made leadership into something bigger than us. We've made into something beyond us. We've made it about changing the world. And we've taken this title of leader  and we treat it as if it's something that one day we're going to deserve  but to give it to ourselves right now means a level of arrogance or cockiness that we're not comfortable with. And I worry sometimes that we spend so much time celebrating amazing things that hardly anybody can do that we've convinced ourselves that those are the only things worth celebrating  and we start to devalue the things that we can do every day  and we start to take moments where we truly are a leader and we don't let ourselves take credit for it  and we don't let ourselves feel good about it. And I've been lucky enough over the last    years to work with some amazing people who have helped me redefine leadership in a way that I think has made me happier. And with my short time today  I just want to share with you the one story that is probably most responsible for that redefinition. I went to school in a little school called Mount Allison University in Sackville  New Brunswick  and on my last day there  a girl came up to me and she said   I remember the first time that I met you.  And then she told me a story that had happened four years earlier. She said   On the day before I started university  I was in the hotel room with my mom and my dad  and I was so scared and so convinced that I couldn't do this  that I wasn't ready for university  that I just burst into tears. And my mom and my dad were amazing. They were like  'Look  we know you're scared  but let's just go tomorrow. Let's go to the first day  and if at any point you feel as if you can't do this  that's fine  just tell us  we will take you home. We love you no matter what.'  And she says   So I went the next day and I was standing in line getting ready for registration  and I looked around and I just knew I couldn't do it. I knew I wasn't ready. I knew I had to quit.  And she says   I made that decision  and as soon as I made it  there was this incredible feeling of peace that came over me. And I turned to my mom and my dad to tell them that we needed to go home  and just at that moment  you came out of the Student Union building wearing the stupidest hat I have ever seen in my life.   Laughter   It was awesome. And you had a big sign promoting Shinerama  which is Students Fighting Cystic Fibrosis     a charity I've worked with for years    and you had a bucketful of lollipops. And you were walking along and you were handing the lollipops out to people in line and talking about Shinerama. And all of a sudden  you got to me  and you just stopped  and you stared. It was creepy.   Laughter  This girl right here knows exactly what I'm talking about.  Laughter   And then you looked at the guy next to me  and you smiled  and you reached in your bucket  and you pulled out a lollipop  and you held it out to him  and you said  'You need to give a lollipop to the beautiful woman standing next to you.'  And she said   I have never seen anyone get more embarrassed faster in my life. He turned beet red  and he wouldn't even look at me. He just kind of held the lollipop out like this.   Laughter   And I felt so bad for this dude that I took the lollipop  and as soon as I did  you got this incredibly severe look on your face and you looked at my mom and my dad  and you said  'Look at that. Look at that. First day away from home  and already she's taking candy from a stranger  '   Laughter  And she said   Everybody lost it. Twenty feet in every direction  everyone started to howl. And I know this is cheesy  and I don't know why I'm telling you this  but in that moment when everyone was laughing  I knew that I shouldn't quit. I knew that I was where I was supposed to be  and I knew that I was home  and I haven't spoken to you once in the four years since that day  but I heard that you were leaving  and I had to come up and tell you that you've been an incredibly important person in my life  and I'm going to miss you. Good luck.  And she walks away  and I'm flattened. And she gets about six feet away  she turns around and smiles  and goes   You should probably know this  too. I'm still dating that guy four years later.   Laughter  A year and a half after I moved to Toronto  I got an invitation to their wedding. Here's the kicker. I don't remember that. I have no recollection of that moment  and I've searched my memory banks  because that is funny and I should remember doing it  and I don't remember it. And that was such an eye opening  transformative moment for me to think that maybe the biggest impact I'd ever had on anyone's life  a moment that had a woman walk up to a stranger four years later and say   You've been an incredibly important person in my life   was a moment that I didn't even remember. How many of you guys have a lollipop moment  a moment where someone said something or did something that you feel fundamentally made your life better  All right. How many of you have told that person they did it  See  why not  We celebrate birthdays  where all you have to do is not die for     days    Laughter    and yet we let people who have made our lives better walk around without knowing it. And every single one of you  every single one of you has been the catalyst for a lollipop moment. You have made someone's life better by something that you said or that you did  and if you think you haven't  think about all the hands that didn't go back up when I asked that question. You're just one of the people who hasn't been told. But it is so scary to think of ourselves as that powerful. It can be frightening to think that we can matter that much to other people  because as long as we make leadership something bigger than us  as long as we keep leadership something beyond us  as long as we make it about changing the world  we give ourselves an excuse not to expect it every day from ourselves and from each other. Marianne Williamson said   Our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our greatest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light  and not our darkness  that frightens us.  And my call to action today is that we need to get over that. We need to get over our fear of how extraordinarily powerful we can be in each other's lives. We need to get over it so we can move beyond it  and our little brothers and our little sisters  and one day our kids    or our kids right now    can watch and start to value the impact we can have on each other's lives more than money and power and titles and influence. We need to redefine leadership as being about lollipop moments  how many of them we create  how many of them we acknowledge  how many of them we pay forward  and how many of them we say thank you for. Because we've made leadership about changing the world  and there is no world. There's only six billion understandings of it  and if you change one person's understanding of it  one person's understanding of what they're capable of  one person's understanding of how much people care about them  one person's understanding of how powerful an agent for change they can be in this world  you've changed the whole thing. And if we can understand leadership like that  I think if we can redefine leadership like that  I think we can change everything. And it's a simple idea  but I don't think it's a small one  and I want to thank you all so much for letting me share it with you today. Penelope Jagessar Chaffer  I was going to ask if there's a doctor in the house. No  I'm just joking. It's interesting  because it was six years ago when I was pregnant with my first child that I discovered that the most commonly used preservative in baby care products mimics estrogen when it gets into the human body. Now it's very easy actually to get a chemical compound from products into the human body through the skin. And these preservatives had been found in breast cancer tumors. That was the start of my journey to make this film   Toxic Baby.  And it doesn't take much time to discover some really astonishing statistics with this issue. One is that you and I all have between    to        chemicals in our bodies that our grandparents didn't have. And many of these chemicals are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents of chronic childhood disease that we're seeing across industrialized nations. I'll show you some statistics. So for example  in the United Kingdom  the incidence of childhood leukemia has risen by    percent just in a generation. Very similar statistic for childhood cancer in the U.S. In Canada  we're now looking at one in    Canadian children with asthma. That's a four fold increase. Again  similar story around the world. In the United States  probably the most astonishing statistic is a     percent increase in autism and autistic spectrum disorders and other learning disabilities. Again  we're seeing that trend across Europe  across North America. And in Europe  there's certain parts of Europe  where we're seeing a four fold increase in certain genital birth defects. Interestingly  one of those birth defects has seen a     percent increase in the U.S. So a real skyrocketing of chronic childhood disease that includes other things like obesity and juvenile diabetes  premature puberty. So it's interesting for me  when I'm looking for someone who can really talk to me and talk to an audience about these things  that probably one of the most important people in the world who can discuss toxicity in babies is expert in frogs. Tyrone Hayes  It was a surprise to me as well that I would be talking about pesticides  that I'd be talking about public health  because  in fact  I never thought I would do anything useful. Frogs. In fact  my involvement in the whole pesticide issue was sort of a surprise as well when I was approached by the largest chemical company in the world and they asked me if I would evaluate how atrazine affected amphibians  or my frogs. It turns out  atrazine is the largest selling product for the largest chemical company in the world. It's the number one contaminant of groundwater  drinking water  rain water. In       after my studies  it was banned in the European Union  but in that same year  the United States EPA re registered the compound. We were a bit surprised when we found out that when we exposed frogs to very low levels of atrazine     .  parts per billion    that it produced animals that look like this. These are the dissected gonads of an animal that has two testes  two ovaries  another large testis  more ovaries  which is not normal ... even for amphibians. In some cases  another species like the North American Leopard Frog showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes. And you can see these large  yolked up eggs bursting through the surface of this male's testes. Now my wife tells me  and I'm sure Penelope can as well  that there's nothing more painful than childbirth    which that I'll never experience  I can't really argue that    but I would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle would probably be somewhere in the top five. In recent studies that we've published  we've shown that some of these animals when they're exposed to atrazine  some of the males grow up and completely become females. So these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship. And not only do these genetic males mate with other males  they actually have the capacity to lay eggs even though they're genetic males. What we proposed  and what we've now generated support for  is that what atrazine is doing is wreaking havoc causing a hormone imbalance. Normally the testes should make testosterone  the male hormone. But what atrazine does is it turns on an enzyme  the machinery if you will  aromatase  that converts testosterone into estrogen. And as a result  these exposed males lose their testosterone  they're chemically castrated  and they're subsequently feminized because now they're making the female hormone. Now this is what brought me to the human related issues. Because it turns out that the number one cancer in women  breast cancer  is regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase. So when you develop a cancerous cell in your breast  aromatase converts androgens into estrogens  and that estrogen turns on or promotes the growth of that cancer so that it turns into a tumor and spreads. In fact  this aromatase is so important in breast cancer that the latest treatment for breast cancer is a chemical called letrozole  which blocks aromatase  blocks estrogen  so that if you developed a mutated cell  it doesn't grow into a tumor. Now what's interesting is  of course  that we're still using    million pounds of atrazine  the number one contaminant in drinking water  that does the opposite    turns on aromatase  increases estrogen and promotes tumors in rats and is associated with tumors  breast cancer  in humans. What's interesting is  in fact  the same company that sold us    million pounds of atrazine  the breast cancer promoter  now sells us the blocker    the exact same company. And so I find it interesting that instead of treating this disease by preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it  we simply respond by putting more chemicals into the environment. PJC  So speaking of estrogen  one of the other compounds that Tyrone talks about in the film is something called bisphenol A  BPA  which has been in the news recently. It's a plasticizer. It's a compound that's found in polycarbonate plastic  which is what baby bottles are made out of. And what's interesting about BPA is that it's such a potent estrogen that it was actually once considered for use as a synthetic estrogen in hormone placement therapy. And there have been many  many  many studies that have shown that BPA leaches from babies' bottles into the formula  into the milk  and therefore into the babies. So we're dosing our babies  our newborns  our infants  with a synthetic estrogen. Now two weeks ago or so  the European Union passed a law banning the use of BPA in babies' bottles and sippy cups. And for those of you who are not parents  sippy cups are those little plastic things that your child graduates to after using bottles. But just two weeks before that  the U.S. Senate refused to even debate the banning of BPA in babies' bottles and sippy cups. So it really makes you realize the onus on parents to have to look at this and regulate this and police this in their own lives and how astonishing that is. now proven to leak the chemical bisphenol A  it really shows how sometimes it is only a parent's awareness that stands between chemicals and our children. The baby bottle scenario proves that we can prevent unnecessary exposure. However  if we parents are unaware  we are leaving our children to fend for themselves. TH  And what Penelope says here is even more true. For those of you who don't know  we're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction. Scientists agree now. We are losing species from the Earth faster than the dinosaurs disappeared  and leading that loss are amphibians.    percent of all amphibians are threatened and in come decline. And I believe  many scientists believe that pesticides are an important part of that decline. In part  amphibians are good indicators and more sensitive because they don't have protection from contaminants in the water    no eggshells  no membranes and no placenta. In fact  our invention    by  our  I mean we mammals    one of our big inventions was the placenta. But we also start out as aquatic organisms. But it turns out that this ancient structure that separates us from other animals  the placenta  cannot evolve or adapt fast enough because of the rate that we're generating new chemicals that it's never seen before. The evidence of that is that studies in rats  again with atrazine  show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion. Because maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones. Of those rats that don't abort  atrazine causes prostate disease in the pups so the sons are born with an old man's disease. Of those that don't abort  atrazine causes impaired mammary  or breast  development in the exposed daughters in utero  so that their breast don't develop properly. And as a result  when those rats grow up  their pups experience retarded growth and development because they can't make enough milk to nourish their pups. So the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine that its grandmother was exposed to. And given the life of many of these chemicals  generations  years  dozens of years  that means that we right now are affecting the health of our grandchildren's grandchildren by things that we're putting into the environment today. And this is not just philosophical  it's already known  that chemicals like diethylstilbestrol and estrogen  PCBs  DDT cross the placenta and effectively determine the likelihood of developing breast cancer and obesity and diabetes already when the baby's in the womb. In addition to that  after the baby's born  our other unique invention as mammals is that we nourish our offspring after they're born. We already know that chemicals like DDT and DES and atrazine can also pass over into milk  again  affecting our babies even after their born. PJC  So when Tyrone tells me that the placenta is an ancient organ  I'm thinking  how do I demonstrate that  How do you show that  And it's interesting when you make a film like this  because you're stuck trying to visualize science that there's no visualization for. And I have to take a little bit of artistic license. Old man  Placenta control. What is it  Oh what  Puffuffuff  what  Perflourooctanoic acid. Blimey. Never heard of it. PJC  And neither had I actually before I started making this film. And so when you realize that chemicals can pass the placenta and go into your unborn child  it made me start to think  what would my fetus say to me  What would our unborn children say to us when they have an exposure that's happening everyday  day after day  I had some octyphenols  some artificial musks and some bisphenol A. Help me. PJC  It's a very profound notion to know that we as women are at the vanguard of this. This is our issue  because we collect these compounds our entire life and then we end up dumping it and dumping them into our unborn children. We are in effect polluting our children. And this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago when I found out I was pregnant and the first scan revealed that my baby had a birth defect associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb and the second scan revealed no heartbeat. So my child's death  my baby's death  really brought home the resonance of what I was trying to make in this film. And it's sometimes a weird place when the communicator becomes part of the story  which is not what you originally intend. And so when Tyrone talks about the fetus being trapped in a contaminated environment  this is my contaminated environment. This is my toxic baby. And that's something that's just profound and sad  but astonishing because so many of us don't actually know this. TH  One of this things that's exciting and appropriate for me to be here at TEDWomen is that  well  I think it was summed up best last night at dinner when someone said   Turn to the man at your table and tell them  'When the revolution starts  we've got your back.'  The truth is  women  you've had our back on this issue for a very long time  starting with Rachel Carson's  Silent Spring  to Theo Colborn's  Our Stolen Future  to Sandra Steingraber's books  Living Downstream  and  Having Faith.  And perhaps it's the connection to our next generation    like my wife and my beautiful daughter here about    years ago    perhaps it's that connection that makes women activists in this particular area. But for the men here  I want to say it's not just women and children that are at risk. And the frogs that are exposed to atrazine  the testes are full of holes and spaces  because the hormone imbalance  instead of allowing sperm to be generated  such as in the testis here  the testicular tubules end up empty and fertility goes down by as much as    percent. It's not just my work in amphibians  but similar work has been shown in fish in Europe  holes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from South America and in rats  an absence of sperm in the testicular tubules as well. And of course  we don't do these experiments in humans  but just by coincidence  my colleague has shown that men who have low sperm count  low semen quality have significantly more atrazine in their urine. These are just men who live in an agricultural community. Men who actually work in agriculture have much higher levels of atrazine. And the men who actually apply atrazine have even more atrazine in their urine  up to levels that are        times what we know to be active are present in the urine of these men. Of course  most of them     percent are Mexican  Mexican American. And it's not just atrazine they're exposed to. They're exposed to chemicals like chloropicrin  which was originally used as a nerve gas. And many of these workers have life expectancies of only   . It shouldn't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife are also a warning to us  just like Rachel Carson and others have warned. As evident in this slide from Lake Nabugabo in Uganda  the agricultural runoff from this crop  which goes into these buckets  is the sole source of drinking  cooking and bathing water for this village. Now if I told the men in this village that the frogs have pour immune function and eggs developing in their testes  the connection between environmental health and public health would be clear. You would not drink water that you knew was having this kind of impact on the wildlife that lived in it. The problem is  in my village  Oakland  in most of our villages  we don't see that connection. We turn on the faucet  the water comes out  we assume it's safe  and we assume that we are masters of our environment  rather than being part of it. PJC  So it doesn't take much to realize that actually this is an environmental issue. And I kept thinking over and over again this question. We know so much about global warming and climate change  and yet  we have no concept of what I've been calling internal environmentalism. We know what we're putting out there  we have a sense of those repercussions  but we are so ignorant of this sense of what happens when we put things  or things are put into our bodies. And it's my feeling and it's my urging being here to know that  as we women move forward as the communicators of this  but also as the ones who carry that burden of carrying the children  bearing the children  we hold most of the buying power in the household  is that it's going to be us moving forward to carry the work of Tyrone and other scientists around the world. And my urging is that when we think about environmental issues that we remember that it's not just about melting glaciers and ice caps  but it's also about our children as well. Thank you. Every year in the United States alone            couples make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together ... and not to have sex with anyone else  ever. He buys a ring  she buys a dress. They go shopping for all sorts of things. She takes him to Arthur Murray for ballroom dancing lessons. And the big day comes. And they'll stand before God and family and some guy her dad once did business with  and they'll vow that nothing  not abject poverty  not life threatening illness  not complete and utter misery will ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion. These optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and mid life crises and a cumulative    lb. weight gain  until that far off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace. You know  because they can't hear the snoring anymore. And then they'll get stupid drunk and smash cake in each others' faces and do the  Macarena   and we'll be there showering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze and throwing birdseed at them every single time    even though we know  statistically  half of them will be divorced within a decade. Of course  the other half won't  right  They'll keep forgetting anniversaries and arguing about where to spend holidays and debating which way the toilet paper should come off of the roll. And some of them will even still be enjoying each others' company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore. And researchers want to know why. I mean  look  it doesn't take a double blind  placebo controlled study to figure out what makes a marriage not work. Disrespect  boredom  too much time on Facebook  having sex with other people. But you can have the exact opposite of all of those things    respect  excitement  a broken Internet connection  mind numbing monogamy    and the thing still can go to hell in a hand basket. So what's going on when it doesn't  What do the folks who make it all the way to side by side burial plots have in common  What are they doing right  What can we learn from them  And if you're still happily sleeping solo  why should you stop what you're doing and make it your life's work to find that one special person that you can annoy for the rest of your life  Well researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out. They stalk blissful couples and they study their every move and mannerism. And they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends. And it turns out  the success stories share a few similarities  actually  beyond they don't have sex with other people. For instance  in the happiest marriages  the wife is thinner and better looking than the husband. Obvious  right. It's obvious that this leads to marital bliss because  women  we care a great deal about being thin and good looking  whereas men mostly care about sex ... ideally with women who are thinner and better looking than they are. The beauty of this research though is that no one is suggesting that women have to be thin to be happy  we just have to be thinner than our partners. So instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising  we just need to wait for them to get fat  maybe bake a few pies. This is good information to have  and it's not that complicated. Research also suggests that the happiest couples are the ones that focus on the positives. For example  the happy wife. Instead of pointing out her husband's growing gut or suggesting he go for a run  she might say   Wow  honey  thank you for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner.  These are couples who can find good in any situation.  Yeah  it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire  but it's kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars  and it's a good thing you've got all that body fat to keep us warm.  One of my favorite studies found that the more willing a husband is to do house work  the more attractive his wife will find him. Because we needed a study to tell us this. But here's what's going on here. The more attractive she finds him  the more sex they have  the more sex they have  the nicer he is to her  the nicer he is to her  the less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed    and ultimately  they live happily ever after. In other words  men  you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department. Here's an interesting one. One study found that people who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a divorce. This is an actual study  and let me clarify. The researchers were not looking at documented self reports of childhood happiness or even studying old journals. The data were based entirely on whether people looked happy in these early pictures. Now I don't know how old all of you are  but when I was a kid  your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called film  and  by God  film was expensive. They didn't take     shots of you in that rapid fire digital video mode and then pick out the nicest  smileyest one for the Christmas card. Oh no. They dressed you up  they lined you up  and you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to or you could kiss your birthday party goodbye. But still  I have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures and I'm glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce. So what else can you do to safeguard your marriage  Do not win an Oscar for best actress. I'm serious. Bettie Davis  Joan Crawford  Hallie Berry  Hillary Swank  Sandra Bullock  Reese Witherspoon  all of them single soon after taking home that statue. They actually call it the Oscar curse. It is the marriage kiss of death and something that should be avoided. And it's not just successfully starring in films that's dangerous. It turns out  merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plummet. Apparently  the bitter realization that maybe it could happen to us  but it obviously hasn't and it probably never will  makes our lives seem unbearably grim in comparison. And theoretically  I suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered or dies in a fiery car crash  we are more likely to walk out of that theater feeling like we've got it pretty good. Drinking alcohol  it seems  is bad for your marriage. Yeah. I can't tell you anymore about that one because I stopped reading it at the headline. But here's a scary one  Divorce is contagious. That's right    when you have a close couple friend split up  it increases your chances of getting a divorce by    percent. Now I have to say  I don't get this one at all. My husband and I have watched quite a few friends divide their assets and then struggle with being our age and single in an age of sexting and Viagra and eHarmony. And I'm thinking they've done more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever could. So now you may be wondering  why does anyone get married ever  Well the U.S. federal government counts more than a thousand legal benefits to being someone's spouse    a list that includes visitation rights in jail  but hopefully you'll never need that one. But beyond the profound federal perks  married people make more money. We're healthier  physically and emotionally. We produce happier  more stable and more successful kids. We have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends    believe it or not. We even live longer  which is a pretty compelling argument for marrying someone you like a lot in the first place. Now if you're not currently experiencing the joy of the joint tax return  I can't tell you how to find a chore loving person of the approximately ideal size and attractiveness who prefers horror movies and doesn't have a lot of friends hovering on the brink of divorce  but I can only encourage you to try  because the benefits  as I've pointed out  are significant. The bottom line is  whether you're in it or you're searching for it  I believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing and protecting. So I hope you'll use the information I've given you today to weigh your personal strengths against your own risk factors. For instance  in my marriage  I'd say I'm doing okay. One the one hand  I have a husband who's annoyingly lean and incredibly handsome. So I'm obviously going to need fatten him up. And like I said  we have those divorced friends who may secretly or subconsciously be trying to break us up. So we have to keep an eye on that. And we do like a cocktail or two. On the other hand  I have the fake happy picture thing. And also  my husband does a lot around the house  and would happily never see another romantic comedy as long as he lives. So I've got all those things going for me. But just in case  I plan to work extra hard to not win an Oscar anytime soon. And for the good of your relationships  I would encourage you to do the same. I'll see you at the bar. I would like to talk to you about why many e health projects fail. And I really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients. And one of the things we did at Radboud University is we appointed a chief listening officer. Not in a very scientific way    she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients  family  relatives   What's up  How could we help you   And we think  we like to think  that this is one of the major problems why all    maybe not all    but most of the e health projects fail  since we stopped listening. This is my WiFi scale. It's a very simple thing. It's got one knob  on off. And every morning I hop on it. And yes  I've got a challenge  as you might see. And I put my challenge on    kg. But the thing is that it's made this simple that whenever I hop on  it sends my data through Google Health as well. And it's collected by my general practitioner as well  so he can see what's my problem in weight  not on the very moment that I need cardiologic support or something like it  but also looking backward. But there's another thing. As some of you might know  I've got more than       followers on Twitter. So every morning I hop on my WiFi scale and before I'm in my car  people start talking to me   I think you need a light lunch today  Lucien.  But that's the nicest thing that could happen  since this is peer pressure  peer pressure used to help patients    since this could be used for obesity  it could be used to stop smoking in patients. But on the other hand  it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health. As of next week  it will soon be available. There will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iPhone or something or other. And people will be able  from their homes  to take their blood pressure  send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others  for instance  for over a hundred dollars. And this is the point where patients get into position and can collect  not only their own control again  be captain of their own ship  but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face  like health care cost explosion  doubled demand and things like that. Make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team. And you can do this with techniques like this  but also by crowd sourcing. And one of the things we did I would like to share with you introduced by a little video. We've all got navigation controls in our car. We maybe even  have  it in our cellphone. We know perfectly where all the ATMs are about the city of Maastricht. The other thing is we know where all the gas stations are. And sure  we could find fast food chains. But where would be the nearest AED to help this patient  We asked around and nobody knew. Nobody knew where the nearest life saving AED was to be obtained right now. So what we did  we crowdsourced The Netherlands. We set up a website and asked the crowd   If you see an AED  please submit it  tell us where it is  tell us when it's open   since sometimes in office hours sometimes it's closed  of course. And over        AEDs already in The Netherlands already have been submitted. The next step we took was to find the applications for it. And we built an iPad application. We made an application for Layar  augmented reality  to find these AEDs. And whenever you are in a city like Maastricht and somebody collapses  you can use your iPhone  and within the next weeks also run your Microsoft cellphone  to find the nearest AED which can save lives. And as of today  we would like to introduce this  not only as AED EU  which is what the product is called  but also AED US. And we would like to start this on a worldwide level. And  we're  asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world  colleague universities  to help us to find and work and act like a hub to crowd source all these AEDs all around the world. That whenever you're on holiday and somebody collapses  might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you  you can find this. The other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us validate these AEDs. These might be courier services or cable guys for instance  just to see whether the AED that's submitted still is in place. So please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better  but take control of it. Thank you. Basking sharks are awesome creatures. They are just magnificent. They grow    meters long. Some say bigger. They might weigh up to two tons. Some say up to five tons. They're the second largest fish in the world. They're also harmless plankton feeding animals. And they are thought to be able to filter a cubic kilometer of water every hour and can feed on    kilos of zoo plankton a day to survive. They're fantastic creatures. And we're very lucky in Ireland  we have plenty of basking sharks and plenty of opportunities to study them. They were also very important to coast communities going back hundreds of years  especially the around the Claddagh  Duff  Connemara region where subsistence farmers used to sail out on their hookers and open boats sometimes way off shore  sometimes to a place called the Sunfish Bank  which is about    miles west of Achill Island  to kill the basking sharks. This is an old woodcut from the         s. So they were very important  and they were important for the oil out of their liver. A third of the size of the basking shark is their liver  and it's full of oil. You get gallons of oil from their liver. And that oil was used especially for lighting  but also for dressing wounds and other things. In fact  the streetlights in      of Galway  Dublin and Waterford were linked with sunfish oil. And  sunfish  is one of the words for basking sharks. So they were incredibly important animals. They've been around a long time  have been very important to coast communities. Probably the best documented basking shark fishery in the world is that from Achill Island. This is Keem Bay up in Achill Island. And sharks used to come into the bay. And the fishermen would tie a net off the headland  string it out along the other net. And as the shark came round  it would hit the net  the net would collapse on it. It would often drown and suffocate. Or at times  they would row out in their small currachs and kill it with a lance through the back of the neck. And then they'd tow the sharks back to Purteen Harbor  boil them up  use the oil. They used to use the flesh as well for fertilizer and also would fin the sharks. This is probably the biggest threat to sharks worldwide    it is the finning of sharks. We're often all frightened of sharks thanks to  Jaws.  Maybe five or six people get killed by sharks every year. There was someone recently  wasn't there  Just a couple weeks ago. We kill about     million sharks a year. So I don't know what the balance is  but I think sharks have got more right to be fearful of us than we have of them. It was a well documented fishery  and as you can see here  it peaked in the   s where they were killing       sharks a year. And it declined very fast    a classic boom and bust fishery  which suggests that a stock has been depleted or there's low reproductive rates. And they killed about        sharks in this period  literally just by stringing a manila rope off the tip of Keem Bay at Achill Island. Sharks were still killed up into the mid   s  especially after places like Dunmore East in County Waterford. And about two and a half        sharks were killed up till '    many by Norwegian vessels. The black  you can't really see this  but these are Norwegian basking shark hunting vessels  and the black line in the crow's nest signifies this is a shark vessel rather than a whaling vessel. The importance of basking sharks to the coast communities is recognized through the language. Now I don't pretend to have any Irish  but in Kerry they were often known as  Ainmhide na seolta   the monster with the sails. And another title would be  Liop an da lapa   the unwieldy beast with two fins.  Liabhan mor   suggesting a big animal. Or my favorite   Liabhan chor greine   the great fish of the sun. And that's a lovely  evocative name. On Tory Island  which is a strange place anyway  they were known as muldoons  and no one seems to know why. Hope there's no one from Tory here  lovely place. But more commonly all around the island  they were known as the sunfish. And this represents their habit of basking on the surface when the sun is out. There's great concern that basking sharks are depleted all throughout the world. Some people say it's not population decline. It might be a change in the distribution of plankton. And it's been suggested that basking sharks would make fantastic indicators of climate change  because they're basically continuous plankton recorders swimming around with their mouth open. They're now listed as vulnerable under the IUCN. There's also moves in Europe to try and stop catching them. There's now a ban on catching them and even landing them and even landing ones that are caught accidentally. They're not protected in Ireland. In fact  they have no legislative status in Ireland whatsoever  despite our importance for the species and also the historical context within which basking sharks reside. We know very little about them. And most of what we do know is based on their habit of coming to the surface. And we try to guess what they're doing from their behavior on the surface. I only found out last year  at a conference on the Isle of Man  just how unusual it is to live somewhere where basking sharks regularly  frequently and predictably come to the surface to  bask.  And it's a fantastic opportunity in science to see and experience basking sharks  and they are awesome creatures. And it gives us a fantastic opportunity to actually study them  to get access to them. So what we've been doing a couple of years    but last year was a big year    is we started tagging sharks so we could try to get some idea of sight fidelity and movements and things like that. So we concentrated mainly in North Donegal and West Kerry as the two areas where I was mainly active. And we tagged them very simply  not very hi tech  with a big  long pole. This is a beachcaster rod with a tag on the end. Go up in your boat and tag the shark. And we were very effective. We tagged     sharks last summer. We got    in three days off Inishowen Peninsula. Half the challenge is to get access  is to be in the right place at the right time. But it's a very simple and easy technique. I'll show you what they look like. We use a pole camera on the boat to actually film shark. One is to try and work out the gender of the shark. We also deployed a couple of satellite tags  so we did use hi tech stuff as well. These are archival tags. So what they do is they store the data. A satellite tag only works when the air is clear of the water and can send a signal to the satellite. And of course  sharks  fish  are underwater most of the time. So this tag actually works out the locations of shark depending on the timing and the setting of the sun  plus water temperature and depth. And you have to kind of reconstruct the path. What happens is that you set the tag to detach from the shark after a fixed period  in this case it was eight months  and literally to the day the tag popped off  drifted up  said hello to the satellite and sent  not all the data  but enough data for us to use. And this is the only way to really work out the behavior and the movements when they're under water. And here's a couple of maps that we've done. That one  you can see that we tagged both off Kerry. And basically it spent all its time  the last eight months  in Irish waters. Christmas day it was out on the shelf edge. And here's one that we haven't ground truthed it yet with sea surface temperature and water depth  but again  the second shark kind of spent most of its time in and around the Irish Sea. Colleagues from the Isle of Man last year actually tagged one shark that went from the Isle of Man all the way out to Nova Scotia in about    days. That's nine and a half thousand kilometers. We never thought that happened. Another colleague in the States tagged about    sharks off Massachusetts  and his tags didn't really work. All he knows is where he tagged them and he knows where they popped off. And his tags popped off in the Caribbean and even in Brazil. And we thought that basking sharks were temperate animals and only lived in our latitude. But in actual fact  they're obviously crossing the Equator as well. So very simple things like that  we're trying to learn about basking sharks. One thing that I think is a very surprising and strange thing is just how low the genetic diversity of sharks are. Now I'm not a geneticist  so I'm not going to pretend to understand the genetics. And that's why it's great to have collaboration. Whereas I'm a field person  I get panic attacks if I have to spend too many hours in a lab with a white coat on    take me away. So we can work with geneticists who understand that. So when they looked at the genetics of basking sharks  they found that the diversity was incredibly low. If you look at the first line really  you can see that all these different shark species are all quite similar. I think this means basically that they're all sharks and they've come from a common ancestry. If you look at nucleotide diversity  which is more genetics that are passed on through parents  you can see that basking sharks  if you look at the first study  was an order of magnitude less diversity than other shark species. And you see that this work was done in     . Before       we had no idea of the genetic variability of basking sharks. We had no idea  did they distinguish into different populations  Were there subpopulations  And of course  that's very important if you want to know what the population size is and the status of the animals. So Les Noble in Aberdeen kind of found this a bit unbelievable really. So he did another study using microsatellites  which are much more expensive  much more time consuming  and  to his surprise  came up with almost identical results. So it does seem to be that basking sharks  for some reason  have incredibly low diversity. And it's thought maybe it was a bottleneck  a genetic bottleneck thought to be        years ago  and this has caused a very low diversity. And yet  if you look at whale sharks  which is the other plankton eating large shark  its diversity is much greater. So it doesn't really make sense at all. They found that there was no genetic differentiation between any of the world's oceans of basking sharks. So even though basking sharks are found throughout the world  you couldn't tell the difference genetically from one from the Pacific  the Atlantic  New Zealand  or from Ireland  South Africa. They all basically seem the same. But again  it's kind of surprising. You wouldn't really expect that. I don't understand this. I don't pretend to understand this. And I suspect most geneticists don't understand it either  but they produce the numbers. So you can actually estimate the population size based on the diversity of the genetics. And Rus Hoelzel came up with an effective population size        animals. That's it.       animals in the world. You're thinking   That's just ridiculous. No way.  So Les did a finer study and he found out it came out about      . And using different microsatellites gave the different results. But the average of all these studies came out    the mean is about        which I personally don't believe  but then I am a skeptic. But even if you toss a few numbers around  you're probably talking of an effective population of about        animals. Do you remember how many they killed off Achill there in the   s and the   s  So what it tells us actually is that there's actually a risk of extinction of this species because its population is so small. In fact  of those               were thought to be females. There's only       basking shark females in the world  I don't know. I don't believe it. The problem with this is they were constrained with samples. They didn't get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail. So where do you get samples from for your genetic analysis  Well one obvious source is dead sharks  Dead sharks washed up. We might get two or three dead sharks washed up in Ireland a year  if we're kind of lucky. Another source would be fisheries bycatch. We were getting quite a few caught in surface drift nets. That's banned now  and that'll be good news for the sharks. And some are caught in nets  in trawls. This is a shark that was actually landed in Howth just before Christmas  illegally  because you're not allowed to do that under E.U. law  and was actually sold for eight euros a kilo as shark steak. They even put a recipe up on the wall  until they were told this was illegal. And they actually did get a fine for that. So if you look at all those studies I showed you  the total number of samples worldwide is    at present. So it's very important work  and they can ask some really good questions  and they can tell us about population size and subpopulations and structure  but they're constrained by lack of samples. Now when we were out tagging our sharks  this is how we tagged them on the front of a RIB    get in there fast    occasionally the sharks do react. And on one occasion when we were up in Malin Head up in Donegal  a shark smacked the side of the boat with his tail  more  I think  in startle to the fact that a boat came near it  rather than the tag going in. And that was fine. We got wet. No problem. And then when myself and Emmett got back to Malin Head  to the pier  I noticed some black slime on the front of the boat. And I remembered    I used to spend a lot of time out on commercial fishing boats    I remember fishermen telling me they can always tell when a basking shark's been caught in the net because it leaves this black slime behind. So I was thinking that must have come from the shark. Now we had an interest in getting tissue samples for genetics because we knew they were very valuable. And we would use conventional methods    I have a crossbow  you see the crossbow in my hand there  which we use to sample whales and dolphins for genetic studies as well. So I tried that  I tried many techniques. All it was doing was breaking my arrows because the shark skin is just so strong. There was no way we were going to get a sample from that. So that wasn't going to work. So when I saw the black slime on the bow of the boat  I thought   If you take what you're given in this world ...  So I scraped it off. And I had a little tube with alcohol in it to send to the geneticists. So I scraped the slime off and I sent it off to Aberdeen. And I said   You might try that.  And they sat on it for months actually. It was only because we had a conference on the Isle of Man. But I kept emailing  saying   Have you had a chance to look at my slime yet   And he was like   Yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah. Later  later  later.  Anyway he thought he'd better do it  because I never met him before and he might lose face if he hadn't done the thing I sent him. And he was amazed that they actually got DNA from the slime. And they amplified it and they tested it and they found  yes  this was actually basking shark DNA  which was got from the slime. And so he was all very excited. It became known as Simon's shark slime. And I thought   Hey  you know  I can build on this.  So we thought  okay  we're going to try to get out and get some slime. So having spent three and a half thousand on satellite tags  I then thought I'd invest  .      the price is still on it    in my local hardware store in Kilrush for a mop handle and even less money on some oven cleaners. And I wrapped the oven cleaner around the end of the mop handle and was desperate  desperate to have an opportunity to get some sharks. Now this was into August now  and normally sharks peak at June  July. And you rarely see them. You can only rarely be in the right place to find sharks into August. So we were desperate. So we rushed out to Blasket as soon as we heard there were sharks there and managed to find some sharks. So by just rubbing the mop handle down the shark as it swam under the boat    you see  here's a shark that's running under the boat here    we managed to collect slime. And here it is. Look at that lovely  black shark slime. And in about half an hour  we got five samples  five individual sharks  were sampled using Simon's shark slime sampling system. I've been working on whales and dolphins in Ireland for    years now  and they're kind of a bit more dramatic. You probably saw the humpback whale footage that we got there a month or two ago off County Wexford. And you always think you might have some legacy you can leave the world behind. And I was thinking of humpback whales breaching and dolphins. But hey  sometimes these things are sent to you and you just have to take them when they come. So this is possibly going to be my legacy    Simon's shark slime. So we got more money this year to carry on collecting more and more samples. And one thing that is kind of very useful is that we use a pole cameras    this is my colleague Joanne with a pole camera    where you can actually look underneath the shark. And what you're trying to look at is the males have claspers  which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark. So you can quite easily tell the gender of the shark. So if we can tell the gender of the shark before we sample it  we can tell the geneticist this was taken from a male or a female. Because at the moment  they actually have no way genetically of telling the difference between a male and a female  which I found absolutely staggering  because they don't know what primers to look for. And being able to tell the gender of a shark has got very important for things like policing the trade in basking shark and other species through societies  because it is illegal to trade any sharks. And they are caught and they are on the market. So as a field biologist  you just want to get encounters with these animals. You want to learn as much as you can. They're often quite brief. They're often very seasonally constrained. And you just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can. But isn't it fantastic that you can then offer these samples and opportunities to other disciplines  such as geneticists  who can gain so much more from that. So as I said  these things are sent to you in strange ways. Grab them while you can. I'll take that as my scientific legacy. Hopefully I might get something a bit more dramatic and romantic before I die. But for the time being  thank you for that. And keep an eye out for sharks. If you're more interested  we have a basking shark website now just set up. So thank you and thank you for listening. The humanitarian model has barely changed since the early   th century. Its origins are firmly rooted in the analog age. And there is a major shift coming on the horizon. The catalyst for this change was the major earthquake that struck Haiti on the   th of January in     . Haiti was a game changer. The earthquake destroyed the capital of Port au Prince  claiming the lives of some         people  rendering homeless about  .  million people. Government institutions were completely decapitated  including the presidential palace. I remember standing on the roof of the Ministry of Justice in downtown Port au Prince. It was about two meters high  completely squashed by the violence of the earthquake. For those of us on the ground in those early days  it was clear for even the most disaster hardened veterans that Haiti was something different. Haiti was something we hadn't seen before. But Haiti provided us with something else unprecedented. Haiti allowed us to glimpse into a future of what disaster response might look like in a hyper connected world where people have access to mobile smart devices. Because out of the urban devastation in Port au Prince came a torrent of SMS texts    people crying for help  beseeching us for assistance  sharing data  offering support  looking for their loved ones. This was a situation that traditional aid agencies had never before encountered. We were in one of the poorest countries on the planet  but    percent of the people had mobile devices in their hands. And we were unprepared for this  and they were shaping the aid effort. Outside Haiti also  things were looking different. Tens of thousands of so called digital volunteers were scouring the Internet  converting tweets that had already been converted from texts and putting these into open source maps  layering them with all sorts of important information    people like Crisis Mappers and Open Street Map    and putting these on the Web for everybody    the media  the aid organizations and the communities themselves    to participate in and to use. Back in Haiti  people were increasingly turning to the medium of SMS. People that were hungry and hurting were signaling their distress  were signaling their need for help. On street sides all over Port au Prince  entrepreneurs sprung up offering mobile phone charging stations. They understood more than we did people's innate need to be connected. Never having been confronted with this type of situation before  we wanted to try and understand how we could tap into this incredible resource  how we could really leverage this incredible use of mobile technology and SMS technology. We started talking with a local telecom provider called Voil   which is a subsidiary of Trilogy International. We had basically three requirements. We wanted to communicate in a two way form of communication. We didn't want to shout  we needed to listen as well. We wanted to be able to target specific geographic communities. We didn't need to talk to the whole country at the same time. And we wanted it to be easy to use. Out of this rubble of Haiti and from this devastation came something that we call TERA    the Trilogy Emergency Response Application    which has been used to support the aid effort ever since. It has been used to help communities prepare for disasters. It has been used to signal early warning in advance of weather related disasters. It's used for public health awareness campaigns such as the prevention of cholera. And it is even used for sensitive issues such as building awareness around gender based violence. But does it work  We have just published an evaluation of this program  and the evidence that is there for all to see is quite remarkable. Some    percent of people received the data. Those who were intended to receive the data     percent of them received it.    percent of them found it useful.    percent of them took action    evidence that it is indeed empowering. And    percent of them shared it. The TERA system was developed from Haiti with support of engineers in the region. It is a user appropriate technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect. Technology is transformational. Right across the developing world  citizens and communities are using technology to enable them to bring about change  positive change  in their own communities. The grassroots has been strengthened through the social power of sharing and they are challenging the old models  the old analog models of control and command. One illustration of the transformational power of technology is in Kibera. Kibera is one of Africa's largest slums. It's on the outskirts of Nairobi  the capital city of Kenya. It's home to an unknown number of people    some say between         and  .  million. If you were to arrive in Nairobi today and pick up a tourist map  Kibera is represented as a lush  green national park devoid of human settlement. Young people living in Kibera in their community  with simple handheld devices  GPS handheld devices and SMS enabled mobile phones  have literally put themselves on the map. They have collated crowd sourced data and rendered the invisible visible. People like Josh and Steve are continuing to layer information upon information  real time information  Tweet it and text it onto these maps for all to use. You can find out about the latest impromptu music session. You can find out about the latest security incident. You can find out about places of worship. You can find out about the health centers. You can feel the dynamism of this living  breathing community. They also have their own news network on YouTube with        viewers at the moment. They're showing us what can be done with mobile  digital technologies. They're showing that the magic of technology can bring the invisible visible. And they are giving a voice to themselves. They are telling their own story  bypassing the official narrative. And we're seeing from all points on the globe similar stories. In Mongolia for instance  where    percent of the people are nomadic  SMS information systems are being used to track migration and weather patterns. SMS is even used to hold herder summits from remote participation. And if people are migrating into urban  unfamiliar  concrete environments  they can also be helped in anticipation with social supporters ready and waiting for them based on SMS knowledge. In Nigeria  open source SMS tools are being used by the Red Cross community workers to gather information from the local community in an attempt to better understand and mitigate the prevalence of malaria. My colleague  Jason Peat  who runs this program  tells me it's    times faster and    times cheaper than the traditional way of doing things. And not only is it empowering to the communities  but really importantly  this information stays in the community where it is needed to formulate long term health polices. We are on a planet of seven billion people  five billion mobile subscriptions. By       there will be three billion smartphones in the world. The U.N. broadband commission has recently set targets to help broadband access in    percent of the Developing World  compared to    percent today. We are hurtling towards a hyper connected world where citizens from all cultures and all social strata will have access to smart  fast mobile devices. People are understanding  from Cairo to Oakland  that there are new ways to come together  there are new ways to mobilize  there are new ways to influence. A transformation is coming which needs to be understood by the humanitarian structures and humanitarian models. The collective voices of people needs to be more integrated through new technologies into the organizational strategies and plans of actions and not just recycled for fundraising or marketing. We need to  for example  embrace the big data  the knowledge that is there from market leaders who understand what it means to use and leverage big data. One idea that I'd like you to consider  for instance  is to take a look at our IT departments. They're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers  but they need to be elevated to software strategists. We need people in our organizations who know what it's like to work with big data. We need technology as a core organizational principle. We need technological strategists in the boardroom who can ask and answer the question   What would Amazon or Google do with all of this data   and convert it to humanitarian good. The possibilities that new digital technologies are bringing can help humanitarian organizations  not only ensure that people's right to information is met  or that they have their right to communicate  but I think in the future  humanitarian organizations will also have to anticipate the right for people to access critical communication technologies in order to ensure that their voices are heard  that they're truly participating  that they're truly empowered in the humanitarian world. It has always been the elusive ideal to ensure full participation of people affected by disasters in the humanitarian effort. We now have the tools. We now have the possibilities. There are no more reasons not to do it. I believe we need to bring the humanitarian world from analog to digital. Thank you very much. The world's largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project is situated in the heart of the largest and most intact forest in the world  Canada's boreal forest. It stretches right across northern Canada  in Labrador  it's home to the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world  the George River caribou herd  numbering approximately         animals. Unfortunately  when I was there I couldn't find one of them  but you have the antlers as proof. All across the boreal  we're blessed with this incredible abundance of wetlands. Wetlands globally are one of the most endangered ecosystems. They're absolutely critical ecosystems  they clean air  they clean water  they sequester large amounts of greenhouse gases  and they're home to a huge diversity of species. In the boreal  they are also the home where almost    percent of the     bird species found in North America migrate north to breed and raise their young. In Ontario  the boreal marches down south to the north shore of Lake Superior. And these incredibly beautiful boreal forests were the inspiration for some of the most famous art in Canadian history  the Group of Seven were very inspired by this landscape  and so the boreal is not just a really key part of our natural heritage  but also an important part of our cultural heritage. In Manitoba  this is an image from the east side of Lake Winnipeg  and this is the home of the newly designated UNESCO Cultural Heritage site. In Saskatchewan  as across all of the boreal  home to some of our most famous rivers  an incredible network of rivers and lakes that every school age child learns about  the Peace  the Athabasca  the Churchill here  the Mackenzie  and these networks were the historical routes for the voyageur and the coureur des bois  the first non Aboriginal explorers of northern Canada that  taking from the First Nations people  used canoes and paddled to explore for a trade route  a Northwest Passage for the fur trade. In the North  the boreal is bordered by the tundra  and just below that  in Yukon  we have this incredible valley  the Tombstone Valley. And the Tombstone Valley is home to the Porcupine caribou herd. Now you've probably heard about the Porcupine caribou herd in the context of its breeding ground in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Well  the wintering ground is also critical and it also is not protected  and is potentially  could be potentially  exploited for gas and mineral rights. The western border of the boreal in British Columbia is marked by the Coast Mountains  and on the other side of those mountains is the greatest remaining temperate rainforest in the world  the Great Bear Rainforest  and we'll discuss that in a few minutes in a bit more detail. All across the boreal  it's home for a huge incredible range of indigenous peoples  and a rich and varied culture. And I think that one of the reasons why so many of these groups have retained a link to the past  know their native languages  the songs  the dances  the traditions  I think part of that reason is because of the remoteness  the span and the wilderness of this almost    percent intact ecosystem. And I think particularly now  as we see ourselves in a time of environmental crisis  we can learn so much from these people who have lived so sustainably in this ecosystem for over        years. In the heart of this ecosystem is the very antithesis of all of these values that we've been talking about  and I think these are some of the core values that make us proud to be Canadians. This is the Alberta tar sands  the largest oil reserves on the planet outside of Saudi Arabia. Trapped underneath the boreal forest and wetlands of northern Alberta are these vast reserves of this sticky  tar like bitumen. And the mining and the exploitation of that is creating devastation on a scale that the planet has never seen before. I want to try to convey some sort of a sense of the size of this. If you look at that truck there  it is the largest truck of its kind of the planet. It is a     ton capacity dump truck and its dimensions are    feet long by    feet wide and    feet high. If I stand beside that truck  my head comes to around the bottom of the yellow part of that hubcap. Within the dimensions of that truck  you could build a       square foot two story home quite easily. I did the math. So instead of thinking of that as a truck  think of that as a       square foot home. That's not a bad size home. And line those trucks homes back and forth across there from the bottom all the way to the top. And then think of how large that very small section of one mine is. Now  you can apply that same kind of thinking here as well. Now  here you see    of course  as you go further on  these trucks become like a pixel. Again  imagine those all back and forth there. How large is that one portion of a mine  That would be a huge  vast metropolitan area  probably much larger than the city of Victoria. And this is just one of a number of mines     mines so far right now. This is one section of one mining complex  and there are about another    or    in the approval process. No tar sands mine has actually ever been denied approval  so it is essentially a rubber stamp. The other method of extraction is what's called the in situ. And here  massive amounts of water are super heated and pumped through the ground  through these vasts networks of pipelines  seismic lines  drill paths  compressor stations. And even though this looks maybe not quite as repugnant as the mines  it's even more damaging in some ways. It impacts and fragments a larger part of the wilderness  where there is    percent reduction of key species  like woodland caribou and grizzly bears  and it consumes even more energy  more water  and produces at least as much greenhouse gas. So these in situ developments are at least as ecologically damaging as the mines. The oil produced from either method produces more greenhouse gas emissions than any other oil. This is one of the reasons why it's called the world's dirtiest oil. It's also one of the reasons why it is the largest and fastest growing single source of carbon in Canada  and it is also a reason why Canada is now number three in terms of producing carbon per person. The tailings ponds are the largest toxic impoundments on the planet. Oil sands    or rather I should say tar sands     oil sands  is a P.R. created term so that the oil companies wouldn't be trying to promote something that sounds like a sticky tar like substance that's the world's dirtiest oil. So they decided to call it oil sands. The tar sands consume more water than any other oil process  three to five barrels of water are taken  polluted and then returned into tailings ponds  the largest toxic impoundments on the planet. SemCrude  just one of the licensees  in just one of their tailings ponds  dumps         tons of this toxic gunk every single day. That's creating the largest toxic impoundments in the history of the planet. So far  this is enough toxin to cover the face of Lake Eerie a foot deep. And the tailings ponds range in size up to       acres. That's two thirds the size of the entire island of Manhattan. That's like from Wall Street at the southern edge of Manhattan up to maybe    th Street. So this is an absolutely    this is one of the larger tailings ponds. This might be  what  I don't know  half the size of Manhattan. And you can see in the context  it's just a relatively small section of one of    mining complexes and another    to    on stream to be approved soon. And of course  these tailings ponds    well  you can't see many ponds from outer space and you can see these  so maybe we should stop calling them ponds    these massive toxic wastelands are built unlined and on the banks of the Athabasca River. And the Athabasca River drains downstream to a range of Aboriginal communities. In Fort Chippewa  the     people there  are finding toxins in the food chain  this has been scientifically proven. The tar sands toxins are in the food chain  and this is causing cancer rates up to    times what they are in the rest of Canada. In spite of that  people have to live  have to eat this food in order to survive. The incredibly high price of flying food into these remote Northern Aboriginal communities and the high rate of unemployment makes this an absolute necessity for survival. And not that many years ago  I was lent a boat by a First Nations man. And he said   When you go out on the river  do not under any circumstances eat the fish. It's carcinogenic.  And yet  on the front porch of that man's cabin  I saw four fish. He had to feed his family to survive. And as a parent  I just can't imagine what that does to your soul. And that's what we're doing. The boreal forest is also perhaps our best defense against global warming and climate change. The boreal forest sequesters more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem. And this is absolutely key. So what we're doing is  we're taking the most concentrated greenhouse gas sink  twice as much greenhouse gases are sequestered in the boreal per acre than the tropical rainforests. And what we're doing is we're destroying this carbon sink  turning it into a carbon bomb. And we're replacing that with the largest industrial project in the history of the world  which is producing the most high carbon greenhouse gas emitting oil in the world. And we're doing this on the second largest oil reserves on the planet. This is one of the reasons why Canada  originally a climate change hero    we were one of the first signatories of the Kyoto Accord. Now we're the country that has full time lobbyists in the European Union and Washington  D.C. threatening trade wars when these countries talk about wanting to bring in positive legislation to limit the import of high carbon fuels  of greenhouse gas emissions  anything like this  at international conferences  whether they're in Copenhagen or Cancun  international conferences on climate change  we're the country that gets the dinosaur award every single day as being the biggest obstacle to progress on this issue. Just    miles downstream is the world's largest freshwater delta  the Peace Athabasca Delta  the only one at the juncture of all four migratory flyways. This is a globally significant wetland  perhaps the greatest on the planet. Incredible habitat for half the bird species you find in North America  migrating here. And also the last refuge for the largest herd of wild bison  and also  of course  critical habitat for another whole range of other species. But it too is being threatened by the massive amount of water being drawn from the Athabasca  which feeds these wetlands  and also the incredible toxic burden of the largest toxic unlined impoundments on the planet  which are leaching in to the food chain for all the species downstream. So as bad as all that is  things are going to get much worse  much  much worse. This is the infrastructure as we see it about now. This is what's planned for     . And you can see here the Keystone Pipeline  which would take tar sands raw down to the Gulf Coast  punching a pipeline through the heart  the agricultural heart of North America  of the United States  and securing the contract with the dirtiest fuel in the world by consumption of the United States  and promoting a huge disincentive to a sustainable clean energy future for America. Here you see the route down the Mackenzie Valley. This would put a pipeline to take natural gas from the Beaufort Sea through the heart of the third largest watershed basin in the world  and the only one which is    percent intact. And building a pipeline with an industrial highway would change forever this incredible wilderness  which is a true rarity on the planet today. So the Great Bear Rainforest is just over the hill there  within a few miles we go from these dry boreal forests of     year old trees  maybe    inches across  and soon we're in the coastal temperate rainforest  rain drenched        year old trees     feet across  a completely different ecosystem. And the Great Bear Rainforest is generally considered to be the largest coastal temperate rainforest ecosystem in the world. Some of the greatest densities of  some of the most iconic and threatened species on the planet  and yet there's a proposal  of course  to build a pipeline to take huge tankers     times the size of the Exxon Valdez  through some of the most difficult to navigate waters in the world  where only just a few years ago  a B.C. ferry ran aground. When one of these tar sands tankers  carrying the dirtiest oil     times as much as the Exxon Valdez  eventually hits a rock and goes down  we're going to have one of the worst ecological disasters this planet has ever seen. And here we have the plan out to     . What they're proposing is an almost four times increase in production  and that would industrialize an area the size of Florida. In doing so  we'll be removing a large part of our greatest carbon sink and replacing it with the most high greenhouse gas emission oil in the future. The world does not need any more tar mines. The world does not need any more pipelines to wed our addiction to fossil fuels. And the world certainly does not need the largest toxic impoundments to grow and multiply and further threaten the downstream communities. And let's face it  we all live downstream in an era of global warming and climate change. What we need  is we all need to act to ensure that Canada respects the massive amounts of freshwater that we hold in this country. We need to ensure that these wetlands and forests that are our best and greatest and most critical defense against global warming are protected  and we are not releasing that carbon bomb into the atmosphere. And we need to all gather together and say no to the tar sands. And we can do that. There is a huge network all over the world fighting to stop this project. And I quite simply think that this is not something that should be decided just in Canada. Everyone in this room  everyone across Canada  everyone listening to this presentation has a role to play and  I think  a responsibility. Because what we do here is going to change our history  it's going to color our possibility to survive  and for our children to survive and have a rich future. We have an incredible gift in the boreal  an incredible opportunity to preserve our best defense against global warming  but we could let that slip away. The tar sands could threaten not just a large section of the boreal. It compromises the life and the health of some of our most underprivileged and vulnerable people  the Aboriginal communities that have so much to teach us. It could destroy the Athabasca Delta  the largest and possibly greatest freshwater delta in the planet. It could destroy the Great Bear Rainforest  the largest temperate rainforest in the world. And it could have huge impacts on the future of the agricultural heartland of North America. I hope that you will all  if you've been moved by this presentation  join with the growing international community to get Canada to step up to its responsibilities  to convince Canada to go back to being a climate change champion instead of a climate change villain  and to say no to the tar sands  and yes to a clean energy future for all. Thank you so much. The things we make have one supreme quality    they live longer than us. We perish  they survive  we have one life  they have many lives  and in each life they can mean different things. Which means that  while we all have one biography  they have many. I want this morning to talk about the story  the biography    or rather the biographies    of one particular object  one remarkable thing. It doesn't  I agree  look very much. It's about the size of a rugby ball. It's made of clay  and it's been fashioned into a cylinder shape  covered with close writing and then baked dry in the sun. And as you can see  it's been knocked about a bit  which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago and was dug up in     . But today  this thing is  I believe  a major player in the politics of the Middle East. And it's an object with fascinating stories and stories that are by no means over yet. The story begins in the Iran Iraq war and that series of events that culminated in the invasion of Iraq by foreign forces  the removal of a despotic ruler and instant regime change. And I want to begin with one episode from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with  Belshazzar's feast    because we're talking about the Iran Iraq war of     BC. And the parallels between the events of     BC and      and in between are startling. What you're looking at is Rembrandt's painting  now in the National Gallery in London  illustrating the text from the prophet Daniel in the Hebrew scriptures. And you all know roughly the story. Belshazzar  the son of Nebuchadnezzar  Nebuchadnezzar who'd conquered Israel  sacked Jerusalem and captured the people and taken the Jews back to Babylon. Not only the Jews  he'd taken the temple vessels. He'd ransacked  desecrated the temple. And the great gold vessels of the temple in Jerusalem had been taken to Babylon. Belshazzar  his son  decides to have a feast. And in order to make it even more exciting  he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun  and he brings out the temple vessels. He's already at war with the Iranians  with the king of Persia. And that night  Daniel tells us  at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall   You are weighed in the balance and found wanting  and your kingdom is handed over to the Medes and the Persians.  And that very night Cyrus  king of the Persians  entered Babylon and the whole regime of Belshazzar fell. It is  of course  a great moment in the history of the Jewish people. It's a great story. It's story we all know.  The writing on the wall  is part of our everyday language. What happened next was remarkable  and it's where our cylinder enters the story. Cyrus  king of the Persians  has entered Babylon without a fight    the great empire of Babylon  which ran from central southern Iraq to the Mediterranean  falls to Cyrus. And Cyrus makes a declaration. And that is what this cylinder is  the declaration made by the ruler guided by God who had toppled the Iraqi despot and was going to bring freedom to the people. In ringing Babylonian    it was written in Babylonian    he says   I am Cyrus  king of all the universe  the great king  the powerful king  king of Babylon  king of the four quarters of the world.  They're not shy of hyperbole as you can see. This is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that we've got. And it's written  as we'll see in due course  by very skilled P.R. consultants. So the hyperbole is not actually surprising. And what is the great king  the powerful king  the king of the four quarters of the world going to do  He goes on to say that  having conquered Babylon  he will at once let all the peoples that the Babylonians    Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar    have captured and enslaved go free. He'll let them return to their countries. And more important  he will let them all recover the gods  the statues  the temple vessels that had been confiscated. All the peoples that the Babylonians had repressed and removed will go home  and they'll take with them their gods. And they'll be able to restore their altars and to worship their gods in their own way  in their own place. This is the decree  this object is the evidence for the fact that the Jews  after the exile in Babylon  the years they'd spent sitting by the waters of Babylon  weeping when they remembered Jerusalem  those Jews were allowed to go home. They were allowed to return to Jerusalem and to rebuild the temple. It's a central document in Jewish history. And the Book of Chronicles  the Book of Ezra in the Hebrew scriptures reported in ringing terms. This is the Jewish version of the same story.  Thus said Cyrus  king of Persia  'All the kingdoms of the earth have the Lord God of heaven given thee  and he has charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem. Who is there among you of his people  The Lord God be with him  and let him go up.'   Go up     aaleh. The central element  still  of the notion of return  a central part of the life of Judaism. As you all know  that return from exile  the second temple  reshaped Judaism. And that change  that great historic moment  was made possible by Cyrus  the king of Persia  reported for us in Hebrew in scripture and in Babylonian in clay. Two great texts  what about the politics  What was going on was the fundamental shift in Middle Eastern history. The empire of Iran  the Medes and the Persians  united under Cyrus  became the first great world empire. Cyrus begins in the    s BC. And by the time of his son Darius  the whole of the eastern Mediterranean is under Persian control. This empire is  in fact  the Middle East as we now know it  and it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it. It was the largest empire the world had known until then. Much more important  it was the first multicultural  multifaith state on a huge scale. And it had to be run in a quite new way. It had to be run in different languages. The fact that this decree is in Babylonian says one thing. And it had to recognize their different habits  different peoples  different religions  different faiths. All of those are respected by Cyrus. Cyrus sets up a model of how you run a great multinational  multifaith  multicultural society. And the result of that was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen  and which survived for     years of stability until it was shattered by Alexander. It left a dream of the Middle East as a unit  and a unit where people of different faiths could live together. The Greek invasions ended that. And of course  Alexander couldn't sustain a government and it fragmented. But what Cyrus represented remained absolutely central. The Greek historian Xenophon wrote his book  Cyropaedia  promoting Cyrus as the great ruler. And throughout European culture afterward  Cyrus remained the model. This is a   th century image to show you how widespread his veneration actually was. And Xenophon's book on Cyrus on how you ran a diverse society was one of the great textbooks that inspired the Founding Fathers of the American Revolution. Jefferson was a great admirer    the ideals of Cyrus obviously speaking to those   th century ideals of how you create religious tolerance in a new state. Meanwhile  back in Babylon  things had not been going well. After Alexander  the other empires  Babylon declines  falls into ruins  and all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost    until      when the cylinder is discovered by a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon. And it enters now another story. It enters that great debate in the middle of the   th century  Are the scriptures reliable  Can we trust them  We only knew about the return of the Jews and the decree of Cyrus from the Hebrew scriptures. No other evidence. Suddenly  this appeared. And great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation shaken by evolution  by geology  here was evidence that the scriptures were historically true. It's a great   th century moment. But    and this  of course  is where it becomes complicated    the facts were true  hurrah for archeology  but the interpretation was rather more complicated. Because the cylinder account and the Hebrew Bible account differ in one key respect. The Babylonian cylinder is written by the priests of the great god of Bablyon  Marduk. And  not surprisingly  they tell you that all this was done by Marduk.  Marduk  we hold  called Cyrus by his name.  Marduk takes Cyrus by the hand  calls him to shepherd his people and gives him the rule of Babylon. Marduk tells Cyrus that he will do these great  generous things of setting the people free. And this is why we should all be grateful to and worship Marduk. The Hebrew writers in the Old Testament  you will not be surprised to learn  take a rather different view of this. For them  of course  it can't possibly by Marduk that made all this happen. It can only be Jehovah. And so in Isaiah  we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this  not to Marduk but to the Lord God of Israel    the Lord God of Israel who also called Cyrus by name  also takes Cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his people. It's a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event  two different religious takeovers of a political fact. God  we know  is usually on the side of the big battalions. The question is  which god was it  And the debate unsettles everybody in the   th century to realize that the Hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion. And it's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah  and yet  Jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by Marduk. And there's a slight sense that Isaiah knows this  because he says  this is God speaking  of course   I have called thee by thy name though thou hast not known me.  I think it's recognized that Cyrus doesn't realize that he's acting under orders from Jehovah. And equally  he'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from Marduk. Because interestingly  of course  Cyrus is a good Iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts. That's     .    years on and we're in       and the cylinder enters a different world. This time  the real politics of the contemporary world    the year of the Balfour Declaration  the year when the new imperial power in the Middle East  Britain  decides that it will declare a Jewish national home  it will allow the Jews to return. And the response to this by the Jewish population in Eastern Europe is rhapsodic. And across Eastern Europe  Jews display pictures of Cyrus and of George V side by side    the two great rulers who have allowed the return to Jerusalem. And the Cyrus cylinder comes back into public view and the text of this as a demonstration of why what is going to happen after the war is over in      is part of a divine plan. You all know what happened. The state of Israel is setup  and    years later  in the late   s  it's clear that Britain's role as the imperial power is over. And another story of the cylinder begins. The region  the U.K. and the U.S. decide  has to be kept safe from communism  and the superpower that will be created to do this would be Iran  the Shah. And so the Shah invents an Iranian history  or a return to Iranian history  that puts him in the center of a great tradition and produces coins showing himself with the Cyrus cylinder. When he has his great celebrations in Persepolis  he summons the cylinder and the cylinder is lent by the British Museum  goes to Tehran  and is part of those great celebrations of the Pahlavi dynasty. Cyrus cylinder  guarantor of the Shah.    years later  another story  Iranian Revolution      . Islamic revolution  no more Cyrus  we're not interested in that history  we're interested in Islamic Iran    until Iraq  the new superpower that we've all decided should be in the region  attacks. Then another Iran Iraq war. And it becomes critical for the Iranians to remember their great past  their great past when they fought Iraq and won. It becomes critical to find a symbol that will pull together all Iranians    Muslims and non Muslims  Christians  Zoroastrians  Jews living in Iran  people who are devout  not devout. And the obvious emblem is Cyrus. So when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem cooperate and work together  as we've been doing  the Iranians ask for one thing only as a loan. It's the only object they want. They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder. And last year  the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran for the second time. It's shown being presented here  put into its case by the director of the National Museum of Tehran  one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions  Mrs. Ardakani. It was a huge event. This is the other side of that same picture. It's seen in Tehran by between one and two million people in the space of a few months. This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the West. And it's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means  what Cyrus means  but above all  Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder    Cyrus as the defender of the homeland  the champion  of course  of Iranian identity and of the Iranian peoples  tolerant of all faiths. And in the current Iran  Zoroastrians and Christians have guaranteed places in the Iranian parliament  something to be very  very proud of. To see this object in Tehran  thousands of Jews living in Iran came to Tehran to see it. It became a great emblem  a great subject of debate about what Iran is at home and abroad. Is Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed  Will Iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated  This is heady national rhetoric  and it was all put together in a great pageant launching the return. Here you see this out sized Cyrus cylinder on the stage with great figures from Iranian history gathering to take their place in the heritage of Iran. It was a narrative presented by the president himself. And for me  to take this object to Iran  to be allowed to take this object to Iran was to be allowed to be part of an extraordinary debate led at the highest levels about what Iran is  what different Irans there are and how the different histories of Iran might shape the world today. It's a debate that's still continuing  and it will continue to rumble  because this object is one of the great declarations of a human aspiration. It stands with the American constitution. It certainly says far more about real freedoms than Magna Carta. It is a document that can mean so many things  for Iran and for the region. A replica of this is at the United Nations. In New York this autumn  it will be present when the great debates about the future of the Middle East take place. And I want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures. It will appear  certainly  in many more Middle Eastern stories. And what story of the Middle East  what story of the world  do you want to see reflecting what is said  what is expressed in this cylinder  The right of peoples to live together in the same state  worshiping differently  freely    a Middle East  a world  in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate. In the world of the Middle East at the moment  the debates are  as you know  shrill. But I think it's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing  the Cyrus cylinder. Thank you. Gabriel Garc a M rquez is one of my favorite writers  for his storytelling  but even more  I think  for the beauty and precision of his prose. And whether it's the opening line from  One Hundred Years of Solitude  or the fantastical stream of consciousness in  Autumn of the Patriarch   where the words rush by  page after page of unpunctuated imagery sweeping the reader along like some wild river twisting through a primal South American jungle  reading M rquez is a visceral experience. Which struck me as particularly remarkable during one session with the novel when I realized that I was being swept along on this remarkable  vivid journey in translation. Now I was a comparative literature major in college  which is like an English major  only instead of being stuck studying Chaucer for three months  we got to read great literature in translation from around the world. And as great as these books were  you could always tell that you were getting close to the full effect. But not so with M rquez who once praised his translator's versions as being better than his own  which is an astonishing compliment. So when I heard that the translator  Gregory Rabassa  had written his own book on the subject  I couldn't wait to read it. It's called apropos of the Italian adage that I lifted from his forward   If This Be Treason.  And it's a charming read. It's highly recommended for anyone who's interested in the translator's art. But the reason that I mention it is that early on  Rabassa offers this elegantly simple insight   Every act of communication is an act of translation.  Now maybe that's been obvious to all of you for a long time  but for me  as often as I'd encountered that exact difficulty on a daily basis  I had never seen the inherent challenge of communication in so crystalline a light. Ever since I can remember thinking consciously about such things  communication has been my central passion. Even as a child  I remember thinking that what I really wanted most in life was to be able to understand everything and then to communicate it to everyone else. So no ego problems. It's funny  my wife  Daisy  whose family is littered with schizophrenics    and I mean littered with them    once said to me   Chris  I already have a brother who thinks he's God. I don't need a husband who wants to be.  Anyway  as I plunged through my   s ever more aware of how unobtainable the first part of my childhood ambition was  it was that second part  being able to successfully communicate to others whatever knowledge I was gaining  where the futility of my quest really set in. Time after time  whenever I set out to share some great truth with a soon to be grateful recipient  it had the opposite effect. Interestingly  when your opening line of communication is   Hey  listen up  because I'm about to drop some serious knowledge on you   it's amazing how quickly you'll discover both ice and the firing squad. Finally  after about    years of alienating friends and strangers alike  I finally got it  a new personal truth all my own  that if I was going to ever communicate well with other people the ideas that I was gaining  I'd better find a different way of going about it. And that's when I discovered comedy. Now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language. If I had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum  I'd say it falls somewhere between poetry and lies. And I'm not talking about all comedy here  because  clearly  there's plenty of humor that colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel. What I want to talk about is the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has at circumventing our ingrained perspectives    comedy as the philosopher's stone. It takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom and transforms it through ridicule into a different way of seeing and ultimately being in the world. Because that's what I take from the theme of this conference  Gained in Translation. That it's about communication that doesn't just produce greater understanding within the individual  but leads to real change. Which in my experience means communication that manages to speak to and expand our concept of self interest. Now I'm big on speaking to people's self interest because we're all wired for that. It's part of our survival package  and that's why it's become so important for us  and that's why we're always listening at that level. And also because that's where  in terms of our own self interest  we finally begin to grasp our ability to respond  our responsibility to the rest of the world. Now as to what I mean by the best comedy and satire  I mean work that comes first and foremost from a place of honesty and integrity. Now if you think back on Tina Fey's impersonations on Saturday Night Live of the newly nominated vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin  they were devastating. Fey demonstrated far more effectively than any political pundit the candidate's fundamental lack of seriousness  cementing an impression that the majority of the American public still holds today. And the key detail of this is that Fey's scripts weren't written by her and they weren't written by the SNL writers. They were lifted verbatim from Palin's own remarks. Here was a Palin impersonator quoting Palin word for word. Now that's honesty and integrity  and it's also why Fey's performances left such a lasting impression. On the other side of the political spectrum  the first time that I heard Rush Limbaugh refer to presidential hopeful John Edwards as the Breck girl I knew that he'd made a direct hit. Now it's not often that I'm going to associate the words honesty and integrity with Limbaugh  but it's really hard to argue with that punchline. The description perfectly captured Edwards' personal vanity. And guess what  That ended up being the exact personality trait that was at the core of the scandal that ended his political career. Now The Daily Show with John Stewart is by far the most    it's by far the most well documented example of the effectiveness of this kind of comedy. Survey after survey  from Pew Research to the Annenberg Center for Public Policy  has found that Daily Show viewers are better informed about current events than the viewers of all major network and cable news shows. Now whether this says more about the conflict between integrity and profitability of corporate journalism than it does about the attentiveness of Stewart's viewers  the larger point remains that Stewart's material is always grounded in a commitment to the facts    not because his intent is to inform. It's not. His intent is to be funny. It just so happens that Stewart's brand of funny doesn't work unless the facts are true. And the result is great comedy that's also an information delivery system that scores markedly higher in both credibility and retention than the professional news media. Now this is doubly ironic when you consider that what gives comedy its edge at reaching around people's walls is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection. A great piece of comedy is a verbal magic trick  where you think it's going over here and then all of a sudden you're transported over here. And there's this mental delight that's followed by the physical response of laughter  which  not coincidentally  releases endorphins in the brain. And just like that  you've been seduced into a different way of looking at something because the endorphins have brought down your defenses. This is the exact opposite of the way that anger and fear and panic  all of the flight or fight responses  operate. Flight or fight releases adrenalin  which throws our walls up sky high. And the comedy comes along  dealing with a lot of the same areas where our defenses are the strongest    race  religion  politics  sexuality    only by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin  we get endorphins and the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows  revealing a fresh and unexpected point of view. Now let me give you an example from my act. I have some material about the so called radical gay agenda  which starts off by asking  how radical is the gay agenda  Because from what I can tell  the three things gay Americans seem to want most are to join the military  get married and start a family. Three things I've tried to avoid my entire life. Have at it you radical bastards. The field is yours. And that's followed by these lines about gay adoption  What is the problem with gay adoption  Why is this remotely controversial  If you have a baby and you think that baby's gay  you should be allowed to put it up for adoption. You have given birth to an abomination. Remove it from your household. Now by taking the biblical epithet  abomination  and attaching it to the ultimate image of innocence  a baby  this joke short circuits the emotional wiring behind the debate and it leaves the audience with the opportunity  through their laughter  to question its validity. Misdirection isn't the only trick that comedy has up its sleeve. Economy of language is another real strong suit of great comedy. There are few phrases that pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbol than the perfect punchline. Bill Hicks    and if you don't know his work  you should really Google him    Hicks had a routine about getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground  where finally the other kid says to him   Huh  Well my dad can beat up your dad   to which Hicks replies   Really  How soon   That's an entire childhood in three words. Not to mention what it reveals about the adult who's speaking them. And one last powerful attribute that comedy has as communication is that it's inherently viral. People can't wait to pass along that new great joke. And this isn't some new phenomenon of our wired world. Comedy has been crossing country with remarkable speed way before the Internet  social media  even cable TV. Back in      when comedian Richard Pryor accidentally set himself on fire during a freebasing accident  I was in Los Angeles the day after it happened and then I was in Washington D.C. two days after that. And I heard the exact same punchline on both coasts    something about the Ignited Negro College Fund. Clearly  it didn't come out of a Tonight Show monologue. And my guess here    and I have no research on this    is that if you really were to look back at it and if you could research it  you'd find out that comedy is the second oldest viral profession. First there were drums and then knock knock jokes. But it's when you put all of these elements together    when you get the viral appeal of a great joke with a powerful punchline that's crafted from honesty and integrity  it can have a real world impact at changing a conversation. Now I have a close friend  Joel Pett  who's the editorial cartoonist for the Lexington Herald Leader. And he used to be the USA Today Monday morning guy. I was visiting with Joel the weekend before the Copenhagen conference on climate change opened in December of     . And Joel was explaining to me that  because USA Today was one of America's four papers of record  it would be scanned by virtually everyone in attendance at the conference  which meant that  if he hit it out of the park with his cartoon on Monday  the opening day of the conference  it could get passed around at the highest level among actual decision makers. So we started talking about climate change. And it turned out that Joel and I were both bothered by the same thing  which was how so much of the debate was still focused on the science and how complete it was or wasn't  which  to both of us  seems somewhat intentionally off point. Because first of all  there's this false premise that such a thing as complete science exists. Now Governor Perry of my newly adopted state of Texas was pushing this same line this past summer at the beginning of his oops fated campaign for the Republican presidential nomination  proclaiming over and over that the science wasn't complete at the same time that     out of     counties in the state of Texas were on fire. And Perry's policy solution was to ask the people of Texas to pray for rain. Personally  I was praying for four more fires so we could finally complete the damn science. But back in       the question Joel and I kept turning over and over was why this late in the game so much energy was being spent talking about the science when the policies necessary to address climate change were unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long run regardless of the science. So we tossed it back and forth until Joel came up with this. Cartoon   What if it's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing   You've got to love that idea. How about that  How about we create a better world for nothing  Not for God  not for country  not for profit    just as a basic metric for global decision making. And this cartoon hit the bull's eye. Shortly after the conference was over  Joel got a request for a signed copy from the head of the EPA in Washington whose wall it now hangs on. And not long after that  he got another request for a copy from the head of the EPA in California who used it as part of her presentation at an international conference on climate change in Sacramento last year. And it didn't stop there. To date  Joel's gotten requests from over    environmental groups  in the United States  Canada and Europe. And earlier this year  he got a request from the Green Party in Australia who used it in their campaign where it became part of the debate that resulted in the Australian parliament adopting the most rigorous carbon tax regime of any country in the world. That is a lot of punch for    words. So my suggestion to those of you out here who are seriously focused on creating a better world is to take a little bit of time each day and practice thinking funny  because you might just find the question that you've been looking for. Thank you. My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan about two years ago. I was in the desert  under the starry skies with the Sufi singer Mukhtiar Ali. And we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient Indian epic  The Mahabharata.  So back in the day  when us Indians wanted to travel we'd jump into a chariot and we'd zoom across the sky. Now we do the same with airplanes. Back then  when Arjuna  the great Indian warrior prince  when he was thirsty  he'd take out a bow  he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out. Now we do the same with drills and machines. The conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machinery. And this made me really sad. I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe. I was terrified by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me  without tweeting it to my friends. And it felt like technology should enable magic  not kill it. When I was a little girl  my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch. And this piece of    year old technology became the most magical thing to me. It became a gilded gateway into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks and images in my imagination. So I felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming. They stopped us from being inspired. And so I jumped in  I jumped into this world of technology  to see how I could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it. I've been illustrating books since I was   . And so when I saw the iPad  I saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world. It can know how we're holding it. It can know where we are. It brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch. Storytelling is becoming more and more multi sensorial. But what are we doing with it  So I'm actually just going to go in and launch Khoya  an interactive app for the iPad. So it says   Place your fingers upon each light.  And so    It says   This box belongs to ...   And so I type in my name. And actually I become a character in the book. At various points  a little letter drops down to me    and the iPad knows where you live because of GPS    which is actually addressed to me. The child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities. Now I've been talking a lot about magic. And I don't mean wizards and dragons  I mean the kind of childhood magic  those ideas that we all harbored as children. This idea of fireflies in a jar  for some reason  was always really exciting to me. And so over here you need to tilt your iPad  take the fireflies out. And they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book. Another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single marble. And so over here  each book and each world becomes a little marble that I drag in to this magical device within the device. And it opens up a map. All along  all fantasy books have always had maps  but these maps have been static. This is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book. It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well. So I'm just going to enter in. Another thing that's actually really important to me is creating content that is Indian and yet very contemporary. Over here  these are the Apsaras. So we've all heard about fairies and we've all heard about nymphs  but how many people outside of India know about their Indian counterparts  the Apsaras  These poor Apsaras have been trapped inside Indra's chambers for thousands of years in an old and musty book. And so we're bringing them back in a contemporary story for children. And a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis. Speaking of the environmental crisis  I think a big problem has been in the last    years is that children have been locked inside their rooms  glued to their PCs  they haven't been able to get out. But now with mobile technology  we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology. One of the interactions in the book is that you're sent off on this quest where you need to go outside  take out your camera on the iPad and collect pictures of different natural objects. When I was a child  I had multiple collections of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells. And somehow kids don't do that anymore. So in bringing back this childhood ritual  you need to go out and  in one chapter  take a picture of a flower and then tag it. In another chapter  you need to take a picture of a piece of bark and then tag that. And what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online. A child in London puts up a picture of a fox and says   Oh  I saw a fox today.  A child in India says   I saw a monkey today.  And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you've actually taken. In the possibilities of linking together magic  the earth and technology  there are multiple possibilities. In the next book  we plan on having an interaction where you take your iPad out with the video on and through augmented reality  you see this layer of animated pixies appear on a houseplant that's outside your house. At one point  your screen is filled up with leaves. And so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away and read the rest of the book. We're moving  we're all moving here  to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology  and magic and technology can come closer together. We're harnessing energy from the sun. We're bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story. Thank you. I'm going to talk today about saving more  but not today  tomorrow. I'm going to talk about Save More Tomorrow. It's a program that Richard Thaler from the University of Chicago and I devised maybe    years ago. The program  in a sense  is an example of behavioral finance on steroids    how we could really use behavioral finance. Now you might ask  what is behavioral finance  So let's think about how we manage our money. Let's start with mortgages. It's kind of a recent topic  at least in the U.S. A lot of people buy the biggest house they can afford  and actually slightly bigger than that. And then they foreclose. And then they blame the banks for being the bad guys who gave them the mortgages. Let's also think about how we manage risks    for example  investing in the stock market. Two years ago  three years ago  about four years ago  markets did well. We were risk takers  of course. Then market stocks seize and we're like   Wow. These losses  they feel  emotionally  they feel very different from what we actually thought about it when markets were going up.  So we're probably not doing a great job when it comes to risk taking. How many of you have iPhones  Anyone  Wonderful. I would bet many more of you insure your iPhone    you're implicitly buying insurance by having an extended warranty. What if you lose your iPhone  What if you do this  How many of you have kids  Anyone  Keep your hands up if you have sufficient life insurance. I see a lot of hands coming down. I would predict  if you're a representative sample  that many more of you insure your iPhones than your lives  even when you have kids. We're not doing that well when it comes to insurance. The average American household spends       dollars a year on lotteries. And I know it sounds crazy. How many of you spend a thousand dollars a year on lotteries  No one. So that tells us that the people not in this room are spending more than a thousand to get the average to a thousand. Low income people spend a lot more than a thousand on lotteries. So where does it take us  We're not doing a great job managing money. Behavioral finance is really a combination of psychology and economics  trying to understand the money mistakes people make. And I can keep standing here for the    minutes and    seconds that I have left and make fun of all sorts of ways we manage money  and at the end you're going to ask   How can we help people   And that's what I really want to focus on today. How do we take an understanding of the money mistakes people make  and then turning the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions  And what I'm going to talk about today is Save More Tomorrow. I want to address the issue of savings. We have on the screen a representative sample of     Americans. And we're going to look at their saving behavior. First thing to notice is  half of them do not even have access to a     k  plan. They cannot make savings easy. They cannot have money go away from their paycheck into a     k  plan before they see it  before they can touch it. What about the remaining half of the people  Some of them elect not to save. They're just too lazy. They never get around to logging into a complicated website and doing    clicks to join the     k  plan. And then they have to decide how they're going to invest in their    choices  and they never heard about what is a money market fund. And they get overwhelmed and the just don't join. How many people end up saving to a     k  plan  One third of Americans. Two thirds are not saving now. Are they saving enough  Take out those who say they save too little. One out of    are saving enough. Nine out of    either cannot save through their     k  plan  decide not to save    or don't decide    or save too little. We think we have a problem of people saving too much. Let's look at that. We have one person    well  actually we're going to slice him in half because it's less than one percent. Roughly half a percent of Americans feel that they save too much. What are we going to do about it  That's what I really want to focus on. We have to understand why people are not saving  and then we can hopefully flip the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions  and then see how powerful it might be. So let me divert for a second as we're going to identify the problems  the challenges  the behavioral challenges  that prevent people from saving. I'm going to divert and talk about bananas and chocolate. Suppose we had another wonderful TED event next week. And during the break there would be a snack and you could choose bananas or chocolate. How many of you think you would like to have bananas during this hypothetical TED event next week  Who would go for bananas  Wonderful. I predict scientifically    percent of you will go for bananas. Well that's at least what one wonderful study predicted. And then count down the days and see what people ended up eating. The same people that imagined themselves eating the bananas ended up eating chocolates a week later. Self control is not a problem in the future. It's only a problem now when the chocolate is next to us. What does it have to do with time and savings  this issue of immediate gratification  Or as some economists call it  present bias. We think about saving. We know we should be saving. We know we'll do it next year  but today let us go and spend. Christmas is coming  we might as well buy a lot of gifts for everyone we know. So this issue of present bias causes us to think about saving  but end up spending. Let me now talk about another behavioral obstacle to saving having to do with inertia. But again  a little diversion to the topic of organ donation. Wonderful study comparing different countries. We're going to look at two similar countries  Germany and Austria. And in Germany  if you would like to donate your organs    God forbid something really bad happens to you    when you get your driving license or an I.D.  you check the box saying   I would like to donate my organs.  Not many people like checking boxes. It takes effort. You need to think. Twelve percent do. Austria  a neighboring country  slightly similar  slightly different. What's the difference  Well  you still have choice. You will decide whether you want to donate your organs or not. But when you get your driving license  you check the box if you do not want to donate your organ. Nobody checks boxes. That's kind of too much effort. One percent check the box. The rest do nothing. Doing nothing is very common. Not many people check boxes. What are the implications to saving lives and having organs available  In Germany     percent check the box. Twelve percent are organ donors. Huge shortage of organs  God forbid  if you need one. In Austria  again  nobody checks the box. Therefore     percent of people are organ donors. Inertia  lack of action. What is the default setting if people do nothing  if they keep procrastinating  if they don't check the boxes  Very powerful. We're going to talk about what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared to make their     k  choices. Are we going to make them automatically join the plan  or are they going to be left out  In too many     k  plans  if people do nothing  it means they're not saving for retirement  if they don't check the box. And checking the box takes effort. So we've chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges. One more before we flip the challenges into solutions  having to do with monkeys and apples. No  no  no  this is a real study and it's got a lot to do with behavioral economics. One group of monkeys gets an apple  they're pretty happy. The other group gets two apples  one is taken away. They still have an apple left. They're really mad. Why have you taken our apple  This is the notion of loss aversion. We hate losing stuff  even if it doesn't mean a lot of risk. You would hate to go to the ATM  take out     dollars and notice that you lost one of those     bills. It's very painful  even though it doesn't mean anything. Those    dollars might have been a quick lunch. So this notion of loss aversion kicks in when it comes to savings too  because people  mentally and emotionally and intuitively frame savings as a loss because I have to cut my spending. So we talked about all sorts of behavioral challenges having to do with savings eventually. Whether you think about immediate gratification  and the chocolates versus bananas  it's just painful to save now. It's a lot more fun to spend now. We talked about inertia and organ donations and checking the box. If people have to check a lot of boxes to join a     k  plan  they're going to keep procrastinating and not join. And last  we talked about loss aversion  and the monkeys and the apples. If people frame mentally saving for retirement as a loss  they're not going to be saving for retirement. So we've got these challenges  and what Richard Thaler and I were always fascinated by    take behavioral finance  make it behavioral finance on steroids or behavioral finance  .  or behavioral finance in action    flip the challenges into solutions. And we came up with an embarrassingly simple solution called Save More  not today  Tomorrow. How is it going to solve the challenges we chatted about  If you think about the problem of bananas versus chocolates  we think we're going to eat bananas next week. We think we're going to save more next year. Save More Tomorrow invites employees to save more maybe next year    sometime in the future when we can imagine ourselves eating bananas  volunteering more in the community  exercising more and doing all the right things on the planet. Now we also talked about checking the box and the difficulty of taking action. Save More Tomorrow makes it easy. It's an autopilot. Once you tell me you would like to save more in the future  let's say every January you're going to be saving more automatically and it's going to go away from your paycheck to the     k  plan before you see it  before you touch it  before you get the issue of immediate gratification. But what are we going to do about the monkeys and loss aversion  Next January comes and people might feel that if they save more  they have to spend less  and that's painful. Well  maybe it shouldn't be just January. Maybe we should make people save more when they make more money. That way  when they make more money  when they get a pay raise  they don't have to cut their spending. They take a little bit of the increase in the paycheck home and spend more    take a little bit of the increase and put it in a     k  plan. So that is the program  embarrassingly simple  but as we're going to see  extremely powerful. We first implemented it  Richard Thaler and I  back in     . Mid sized company in the Midwest  blue collar employees struggling to pay their bills repeatedly told us they cannot save more right away. Saving more today is not an option. We invited them to save three percentage points more every time they get a pay raise. And here are the results. We're seeing here a three and a half year period  four pay raises  people who were struggling to save  were saving three percent of their paycheck  three and a half years later saving almost four times as much  almost    percent. And there's shoes and bicycles and things on this chart because I don't want to just throw numbers in a vacuum. I want  really  to think about the fact that saving four times more is a huge difference in terms of the lifestyle that people will be able to afford. It's real. It's not just numbers on a piece of paper. Whereas with saving three percent  people might have to add nice sneakers so they can walk  because they won't be able to afford anything else  when they save    percent they might be able to maybe have nice dress shoes to walk to the car to drive. This is a real difference. By now  about    percent of the large companies actually have programs like this in place. It's been part of the Pension Protection Act. And needless to say that Thaler and I have been blessed to be part of this program and make a difference. Let me wrap with two key messages. One is behavioral finance is extremely powerful. This is just one example. Message two is there's still a lot to do. This is really the tip of the iceberg. If you think about people and mortgages and buying houses and then not being able to pay for it  we need to think about that. If you're thinking about people taking too much risk and not understanding how much risk they're taking or taking too little risk  we need to think about that. If you think about people spending a thousand dollars a year on lottery tickets  we need to think about that. The average actually  the record is in Singapore. The average household spends        a year on lottery tickets. We've got a lot to do  a lot to solve  also in the retirement area when it comes to what people do with their money after retirement. One last question  How many of you feel comfortable that as you're planning for retirement you have a really solid plan when you're going to retire  when you're going to claim Social Security benefits  what lifestyle to expect  how much to spend every month so you're not going to run out of money  How many of you feel you have a solid plan for the future when it comes to post retirement decisions. One  two  three  four. Less than three percent of a very sophisticated audience. Behavioral finance has a long way. There's a lot of opportunities to make it powerful again and again and again. Thank you. How can I speak in    minutes about the bonds of women over three generations  about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four year old girl huddled with her young sister  her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than    years ago  bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go    that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today  This is not a finished story. It is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together. Let me tell you about some of the pieces. Imagine the first piece  a man burning his life's work. He is a poet  a playwright  a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country's unity and freedom. Imagine him as the communists enter Saigon  confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste. Words  for so long his friends  now mocked him. He retreated into silence. He died broken by history. He is my grandfather. I never knew him in real life. But our lives are much more than our memories. My grandmother never let me forget his life. My duty was not to allow it to have been in vain  and my lesson was to learn that  yes  history tried to crush us  but we endured. The next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea. My mother  Mai  was    when her father died    already in an arranged marriage  already with two small girls. For her  life had distilled itself into one task  the escape of her family and a new life in Australia. It was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed. So after a four year saga that defies fiction  a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel. All the adults knew the risks. The greatest fear was of pirates  rape and death. Like most adults on the boat  my mother carried a small bottle of poison. If we were captured  first my sister and I  then she and my grandmother would drink. My first memories are from the boat    the steady beat of the engine  the bow dipping into each wave  the vast and empty horizon. I don't remember the pirates who came many times  but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat  or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours. But I do remember the lights on the oil rig off the Malaysian coast and the young man who collapsed and died  the journey's end too much for him  and the first apple I tasted  given to me by the men on the rig. No apple has ever tasted the same. After three months in a refugee camp  we landed in Melbourne. And the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together. We settled in Footscray  a working class suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants. Unlike the settled middle class suburbs  whose existence I was oblivious of  there was no sense of entitlement in Footscray. The smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world. And the snippets of halting English were exchanged between people who had one thing in common  they were starting again. My mother worked on farms  then on a car assembly line  working six days  double shifts. Somehow she found time to study English and gain IT qualifications. We were poor. All the dollars were allocated and extra tuition in English and mathematics was budgeted for regardless of what missed out  which was usually new clothes  they were always secondhand. Two pairs of stockings for school  each to hide the holes in the other. A school uniform down to the ankles  because it had to last for six years. And there were rare but searing chants of  slit eye  and the occasional graffiti   Asian  go home.  Go home to where  Something stiffened inside me. There was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying   I will bypass you.  My mother  my sister and I slept in the same bed. My mother was exhausted each night  but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house. My mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat. And my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so I could wake her. She opened a computer store then studied to be a beautician and opened another business. And the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition  angry and inflexible  and troubled children caught between two worlds. Grants and sponsors were sought. Centers were established. I lived in parallel worlds. In one  I was the classic Asian student  relentless in the demands that I made on myself. In the other  I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious  tragically scarred by violence  drug abuse and isolation. But so many over the years were helped. And for that work  when I was a final year law student  I was chosen as the young Australian of the year. And I was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another  and their edges didn't fit. Tan Le  anonymous Footscray resident  was now Tan Le  refugee and social activist  invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined. I didn't know the protocols. I didn't know how to use the cutlery. I didn't know how to talk about wine. I didn't know how to talk about anything. I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb    a grandmother  a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost    years  telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep  the three of us still in the same bed. I told my mother I couldn't do it. She reminded me that I was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat. No had never been an option.  Just do it   she said   and don't be what you're not.  So I spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and the disenfranchised. And the more candidly I spoke  the more I was asked to speak. I met people from all walks of life  so many of them doing the thing they loved  living on the frontiers of possibility. And even though I finished my degree  I realized I could not settle into a career in law. There had to be another piece of the jigsaw. And I realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider  a recent arrival  new on the scene    and not just okay  but something to be thankful for  perhaps a gift from the boat. Because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons  can so easily mean accepting the presumptions of your province. I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that  yes  the world does fall apart  but not in the way that you fear. Possibilities that would not have been allowed were outrageously encouraged. There was an energy there  an implacable optimism  a strange mixture of humility and daring. So I followed my hunches. I gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label  It can't be done  was an irresistible challenge. For a year we were penniless. At the end of each day  I made a huge pot of soup which we all shared. We worked well into each night. Most of our ideas were crazy  but a few were brilliant  and we broke through. I made the decision to move to the U.S. after only one trip. My hunches again. Three months later I had relocated  and the adventure has continued. Before I close though  let me tell you about my grandmother. She grew up at a time when Confucianism was the social norm and the local Mandarin was the person who mattered. Life hadn't changed for centuries. Her father died soon after she was born. Her mother raised her alone. At    she became the second wife of a Mandarin whose mother beat her. With no support from her husband  she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case  and a far greater sensation when she won.  It can't be done  was shown to be wrong. I was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney the moment she died     miles away in Melbourne. I looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side. I knew she had come to say goodbye. My mother phoned minutes later. A few days later  we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray and sat around her casket. We told her stories and assured her that we were still with her. At midnight the monk came and told us he had to close the casket. My mother asked us to feel her hand. She asked the monk   Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold    Because you have been holding it since this morning   he said.  You have not let it go.  If there is a sinew in our family  it runs through the women. Given who we were and how life had shaped us  we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have thwarted us. Defeat would have come too easily. Now I would like to have my own children  and I wonder about the boat. Who could ever wish it on their own  Yet I am afraid of privilege  of ease  of entitlement. Can I give them a bow in their lives  dipping bravely into each wave  the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine  the vast horizon that guarantees nothing  I don't know. But if I could give it and still see them safely through  I would. Trevor Neilson  And also  Tan's mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row. I'm a computer science professor  and my area of expertise is computer and information security. When I was in graduate school  I had the opportunity to overhear my grandmother describing to one of her fellow senior citizens what I did for a living. Apparently  I was in charge of making sure that no one stole the computers from the university.  Laughter  And  you know  that's a perfectly reasonable thing for her to think  because I told her I was working in computer security  and it was interesting to get her perspective. But that's not the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard anyone say about my work. The most ridiculous thing I ever heard is  I was at a dinner party  and a woman heard that I work in computer security  and she asked me if    she said her computer had been infected by a virus  and she was very concerned that she might get sick from it  that she could get this virus.  Laughter  And I'm not a doctor  but I reassured her that it was very  very unlikely that this would happen  but if she felt more comfortable  she could be free to use latex gloves when she was on the computer  and there would be no harm whatsoever in that. I'm going to get back to this notion of being able to get a virus from your computer  in a serious way. What I'm going to talk to you about today are some hacks  some real world cyberattacks that people in my community  the academic research community  have performed  which I don't think most people know about  and I think they're very interesting and scary  and this talk is kind of a greatest hits of the academic security community's hacks. None of the work is my work. It's all work that my colleagues have done  and I actually asked them for their slides and incorporated them into this talk. So the first one I'm going to talk about are implanted medical devices. Now medical devices have come a long way technologically. You can see in      the first pacemaker was invented.       the first internal pacemaker was implanted  hopefully a little smaller than that one that you see there  and the technology has continued to move forward. In       we hit an important milestone from the perspective of computer security. And why do I say that  Because that's when implanted devices inside of people started to have networking capabilities. One thing that brings us close to home is we look at Dick Cheney's device  he had a device that pumped blood from an aorta to another part of the heart  and as you can see at the bottom there  it was controlled by a computer controller  and if you ever thought that software liability was very important  get one of these inside of you. Now what a research team did was they got their hands on what's called an ICD. This is a defibrillator  and this is a device that goes into a person to control their heart rhythm  and these have saved many lives. Well  in order to not have to open up the person every time you want to reprogram their device or do some diagnostics on it  they made the thing be able to communicate wirelessly  and what this research team did is they reverse engineered the wireless protocol  and they built the device you see pictured here  with a little antenna  that could talk the protocol to the device  and thus control it. In order to make their experience real    they were unable to find any volunteers  and so they went and they got some ground beef and some bacon and they wrapped it all up to about the size of a human being's area where the device would go  and they stuck the device inside it to perform their experiment somewhat realistically. They launched many  many successful attacks. One that I'll highlight here is changing the patient's name. I don't know why you would want to do that  but I sure wouldn't want that done to me. And they were able to change therapies  including disabling the device    and this is with a real  commercial  off the shelf device    simply by performing reverse engineering and sending wireless signals to it. There was a piece on NPR that some of these ICDs could actually have their performance disrupted simply by holding a pair of headphones onto them. Now  wireless and the Internet can improve health care greatly. There's several examples up on the screen of situations where doctors are looking to implant devices inside of people  and all of these devices now  it's standard that they communicate wirelessly  and I think this is great  but without a full understanding of trustworthy computing  and without understanding what attackers can do and the security risks from the beginning  there's a lot of danger in this. Okay  let me shift gears and show you another target. I'm going to show you a few different targets like this  and that's my talk. So we'll look at automobiles. This is a car  and it has a lot of components  a lot of electronics in it today. In fact  it's got many  many different computers inside of it  more Pentiums than my lab did when I was in college  and they're connected by a wired network. There's also a wireless network in the car  which can be reached from many different ways. So there's Bluetooth  there's the FM and XM radio  there's actually wi fi  there's sensors in the wheels that wirelessly communicate the tire pressure to a controller on board. The modern car is a sophisticated multi computer device. And what happens if somebody wanted to attack this  Well  that's what the researchers that I'm going to talk about today did. They basically stuck an attacker on the wired network and on the wireless network. Now  they have two areas they can attack. One is short range wireless  where you can actually communicate with the device from nearby  either through Bluetooth or wi fi  and the other is long range  where you can communicate with the car through the cellular network  or through one of the radio stations. Think about it. When a car receives a radio signal  it's processed by software. That software has to receive and decode the radio signal  and then figure out what to do with it  even if it's just music that it needs to play on the radio  and that software that does that decoding  if it has any bugs in it  could create a vulnerability for somebody to hack the car. The way that the researchers did this work is  they read the software in the computer chips that were in the car  and then they used sophisticated reverse engineering tools to figure out what that software did  and then they found vulnerabilities in that software  and then they built exploits to exploit those. They actually carried out their attack in real life. They bought two cars  and I guess they have better budgets than I do. The first threat model was to see what someone could do if an attacker actually got access to the internal network on the car. Okay  so think of that as  someone gets to go to your car  they get to mess around with it  and then they leave  and now  what kind of trouble are you in  The other threat model is that they contact you in real time over one of the wireless networks like the cellular  or something like that  never having actually gotten physical access to your car. This is what their setup looks like for the first model  where you get to have access to the car. They put a laptop  and they connected to the diagnostic unit on the in car network  and they did all kinds of silly things  like here's a picture of the speedometer showing     miles an hour when the car's in park. Once you have control of the car's computers  you can do anything. Now you might say   Okay  that's silly.  Well  what if you make the car always say it's going    miles an hour slower than it's actually going  You might produce a lot of speeding tickets. Then they went out to an abandoned airstrip with two cars  the target victim car and the chase car  and they launched a bunch of other attacks. One of the things they were able to do from the chase car is apply the brakes on the other car  simply by hacking the computer. They were able to disable the brakes. They also were able to install malware that wouldn't kick in and wouldn't trigger until the car was doing something like going over    miles an hour  or something like that. The results are astonishing  and when they gave this talk  even though they gave this talk at a conference to a bunch of computer security researchers  everybody was gasping. They were able to take over a bunch of critical computers inside the car  the brakes computer  the lighting computer  the engine  the dash  the radio  etc.  and they were able to perform these on real commercial cars that they purchased using the radio network. They were able to compromise every single one of the pieces of software that controlled every single one of the wireless capabilities of the car. All of these were implemented successfully. How would you steal a car in this model  Well  you compromise the car by a buffer overflow of vulnerability in the software  something like that. You use the GPS in the car to locate it. You remotely unlock the doors through the computer that controls that  start the engine  bypass anti theft  and you've got yourself a car. Surveillance was really interesting. The authors of the study have a video where they show themselves taking over a car and then turning on the microphone in the car  and listening in on the car while tracking it via GPS on a map  and so that's something that the drivers of the car would never know was happening. Am I scaring you yet  I've got a few more of these interesting ones. These are ones where I went to a conference  and my mind was just blown  and I said   I have to share this with other people.  This was Fabian Monrose's lab at the University of North Carolina  and what they did was something intuitive once you see it  but kind of surprising. They videotaped people on a bus  and then they post processed the video. What you see here in number one is a reflection in somebody's glasses of the smartphone that they're typing in. They wrote software to stabilize    even though they were on a bus and maybe someone's holding their phone at an angle    to stabilize the phone  process it  and you may know on your smartphone  when you type a password  the keys pop out a little bit  and they were able to use that to reconstruct what the person was typing  and had a language model for detecting typing. What was interesting is  by videotaping on a bus  they were able to produce exactly what people on their smartphones were typing  and then they had a surprising result  which is that their software had not only done it for their target  but other people who accidentally happened to be in the picture  they were able to produce what those people had been typing  and that was kind of an accidental artifact of what their software was doing. I'll show you two more. One is P   radios. P   radios are used by law enforcement and all kinds of government agencies and people in combat to communicate  and there's an encryption option on these phones. This is what the phone looks like. It's not really a phone. It's more of a two way radio. Motorola makes the most widely used one  and you can see that they're used by Secret Service  they're used in combat  it's a very  very common standard in the U.S. and elsewhere. So one question the researchers asked themselves is  could you block this thing  right  Could you run a denial of service  because these are first responders  So  would a terrorist organization want to black out the ability of police and fire to communicate at an emergency  They found that there's this GirlTech device used for texting that happens to operate at the same exact frequency as the P    and they built what they called My First Jammer.  Laughter  If you look closely at this device  it's got a switch for encryption or cleartext. Let me advance the slide  and now I'll go back. You see the difference  This is plain text. This is encrypted. There's one little dot that shows up on the screen  and one little tiny turn of the switch. And so the researchers asked themselves   I wonder how many times very secure  important  sensitive conversations are happening on these two way radios where they forget to encrypt and they don't notice that they didn't encrypt   So they bought a scanner. These are perfectly legal and they run at the frequency of the P    and what they did is they hopped around frequencies and they wrote software to listen in. If they found encrypted communication  they stayed on that channel and they wrote down  that's a channel that these people communicate in  these law enforcement agencies  and they went to    metropolitan areas and listened in on conversations that were happening at those frequencies. They found that in every metropolitan area  they would capture over    minutes a day of cleartext communication. And what kind of things were people talking about  Well  they found the names and information about confidential informants. They found information that was being recorded in wiretaps  a bunch of crimes that were being discussed  sensitive information. It was mostly law enforcement and criminal. They went and reported this to the law enforcement agencies  after anonymizing it  and the vulnerability here is simply the user interface wasn't good enough. If you're talking about something really secure and sensitive  it should be really clear to you that this conversation is encrypted. That one's pretty easy to fix. The last one I thought was really  really cool  and I just had to show it to you  it's probably not something that you're going to lose sleep over like the cars or the defibrillators  but it's stealing keystrokes. Now  we've all looked at smartphones upside down. Every security expert wants to hack a smartphone  and we tend to look at the USB port  the GPS for tracking  the camera  the microphone  but no one up till this point had looked at the accelerometer. The accelerometer is the thing that determines the vertical orientation of the smartphone. And so they had a simple setup. They put a smartphone next to a keyboard  and they had people type  and then their goal was to use the vibrations that were created by typing to measure the change in the accelerometer reading to determine what the person had been typing. Now  when they tried this on an iPhone  GS  this is a graph of the perturbations that were created by the typing  and you can see that it's very difficult to tell when somebody was typing or what they were typing  but the iPhone   greatly improved the accelerometer  and so the same measurement produced this graph. Now that gave you a lot of information while someone was typing  and what they did then is used advanced artificial intelligence techniques called machine learning to have a training phase  and so they got most likely grad students to type in a whole lot of things  and to learn  to have the system use the machine learning tools that were available to learn what it is that the people were typing and to match that up with the measurements in the accelerometer. And then there's the attack phase  where you get somebody to type something in  you don't know what it was  but you use your model that you created in the training phase to figure out what they were typing. They had pretty good success. This is an article from the USA Today. They typed in   The Illinois Supreme Court has ruled that Rahm Emanuel is eligible to run for Mayor of Chicago    see  I tied it in to the last talk    and ordered him to stay on the ballot.  Now  the system is interesting  because it produced  Illinois Supreme  and then it wasn't sure. The model produced a bunch of options  and this is the beauty of some of the A.I. techniques  is that computers are good at some things  humans are good at other things  take the best of both and let the humans solve this one. Don't waste computer cycles. A human's not going to think it's the Supreme might. It's the Supreme Court  right  And so  together we're able to reproduce typing simply by measuring the accelerometer. Why does this matter  Well  in the Android platform  for example  the developers have a manifest where every device on there  the microphone  etc.  has to register if you're going to use it so that hackers can't take over it  but nobody controls the accelerometer. So what's the point  You can leave your iPhone next to someone's keyboard  and just leave the room  and then later recover what they did  even without using the microphone. If someone is able to put malware on your iPhone  they could then maybe get the typing that you do whenever you put your iPhone next to your keyboard. There's several other notable attacks that unfortunately I don't have time to go into  but the one that I wanted to point out was a group from the University of Michigan which was able to take voting machines  the Sequoia AVC Edge DREs that were going to be used in New Jersey in the election that were left in a hallway  and put Pac Man on it. So they ran the Pac Man game. What does this all mean  Well  I think that society tends to adopt technology really quickly. I love the next coolest gadget. But it's very important  and these researchers are showing  that the developers of these things need to take security into account from the very beginning  and need to realize that they may have a threat model  but the attackers may not be nice enough to limit themselves to that threat model  and so you need to think outside of the box. What we can do is be aware that devices can be compromised  and anything that has software in it is going to be vulnerable. It's going to have bugs. Thank you very much.  Applause  Hi. I'm Kevin Allocca  I'm the trends manager at YouTube  and I professionally watch YouTube videos. It's true. So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters. We all want to be stars    celebrities  singers  comedians    and when I was younger  that seemed so very  very hard to do. But now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world's culture. Any one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Saturday. But there are over    hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute. And of that  only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment. So how does it happen  Three things  tastemakers  communities of participation and unexpectedness. All right  let's go. Oh  my God  Wooo  Ohhhhh  wowwww  KA  Last year  Bear Vasquez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park. In       it was viewed    million times. This is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer. But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video  Bear. He just wanted to share a rainbow. Because that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear. And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact. And this video had actually been posted all the way back in January. So what happened here  Jimmy Kimmel actually. Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become. Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience.   Everybody's looking forward to the weekend  weekend.     Friday  Friday. Gettin' down on Friday.   KA  So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope. Rebecca Black's  Friday  is one of the most popular videos of the year. It's been seen nearly     million times this year. This is a chart of what it looked like. And similar to  Double Rainbow   it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere. So what happened on this day  Well it was a Friday  this is true. And if you're wondering about those other spikes  those are also Fridays. But what about this day  this one particular Friday  Well Tosh.  picked it up  a lot of blogs starting writing about. Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter. But what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience  accelerating the process. And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it. And now there are        parodies of  Friday  on YouTube. Even in the first seven days  there was one parody for every other day of the week. Unlike the one way entertainment of the   th century  this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon    either by spreading it or by doing something new with it. So  Nyan Cat  is a looped animation with looped music. It's this  just like this. It's been viewed nearly    million times this year. And if you think that that is weird  you should know that there is a three hour version of this that's been viewed four million times. Even cats were watching this video. Cats were watching other cats watch this video. But what's important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie  geeky Internet culture. There were remixes. Someone made an old timey version. And then it went international. An entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of. Because we don't just enjoy now  we participate. And who could have predicted any of this  Who could have predicted  Double Rainbow  or Rebecca Black or  Nyan Cat   What scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it  In a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute  only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have. When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City  I admit I wasn't very interested. but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane. KA  By being totally surprising and humorous  Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point seen five million times. And so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively. And so it all brings us to one big question ... Ohhhh. KA  What does it mean  Tastemakers  creative participating communities  complete unexpectedness  these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity. I mean  as mentioned earlier  one of the biggest stars in the world right now  Justin Bieber  got his start on YouTube. No one has to green light your idea. And we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture. And these are not characteristics of old media  and they're barely true of the media of today  but they will define the entertainment of the future. Thank you. The oceans cover some    percent of our planet. And I think Arthur C. Clarke probably had it right when he said that perhaps we ought to call our planet Planet Ocean. And the oceans are hugely productive  as you can see by the satellite image of photosynthesis  the production of new life. In fact  the oceans produce half of the new life every day on Earth as well as about half the oxygen that we breathe. In addition to that  it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on Earth  and much of it we don't know about. But I'll tell you some of that today. That also doesn't even get into the whole protein extraction that we do from the ocean. That's about    percent of our global needs and     percent of some island nations. If you were to descend into the    percent of the biosphere that's livable  it would quickly become pitch black  interrupted only by pinpoints of light from bioluminescent organisms. And if you turn the lights on  you might periodically see spectacular organisms swim by  because those are the denizens of the deep  the things that live in the deep ocean. And eventually  the deep sea floor would come into view. This type of habitat covers more of the Earth's surface than all other habitats combined. And yet  we know more about the surface of the Moon and about Mars than we do about this habitat  despite the fact that we have yet to extract a gram of food  a breath of oxygen or a drop of water from those bodies. And so    years ago  an international program began called the Census of Marine Life  which set out to try and improve our understanding of life in the global oceans. It involved    different projects around the world. As you can see  these are the footprints of the different projects. And I hope you'll appreciate the level of global coverage that it managed to achieve. It all began when two scientists  Fred Grassle and Jesse Ausubel  met in Woods Hole  Massachusetts where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute. And Fred was lamenting the state of marine biodiversity and the fact that it was in trouble and nothing was being done about it. Well  from that discussion grew this program that involved       scientists from more than    countries around the world who engaged in     ocean expeditions at a combined cost of     million dollars to study the distribution  diversity and abundance of life in the global ocean. And so what did we find  We found spectacular new species  the most beautiful and visually stunning things everywhere we looked    from the shoreline to the abyss  form microbes all the way up to fish and everything in between. And the limiting step here wasn't the unknown diversity of life  but rather the taxonomic specialists who can identify and catalog these species that became the limiting step. They  in fact  are an endangered species themselves. There are actually four to five new species described everyday for the oceans. And as I say  it could be a much larger number. Now  I come from Newfoundland in Canada    It's an island off the east coast of that continent    where we experienced one of the worst fishing disasters in human history. And so this photograph shows a small boy next to a codfish. It's around     . Now  when I was a boy of about his age  I would go out fishing with my grandfather and we would catch fish about half that size. And I thought that was the norm  because I had never seen fish like this. If you were to go out there today     years after this fishery collapsed  if you could catch a fish  which would be a bit of a challenge  it would be half that size still. So what we're experiencing is something called shifting baselines. Our expectations of what the oceans can produce is something that we don't really appreciate because we haven't seen it in our lifetimes. Now most of us  and I would say me included  think that human exploitation of the oceans really only became very serious in the last    to  perhaps      years or so. The census actually tried to look back in time  using every source of information they could get their hands on. And so anything from restaurant menus to monastery records to ships' logs to see what the oceans looked like. Because science data really goes back to  at best  World War II  for the most part. And so what they found  in fact  is that exploitation really began heavily with the Romans. And so at that time  of course  there was no refrigeration. So fishermen could only catch what they could either eat or sell that day. But the Romans developed salting. And with salting  it became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances. And so began industrial fishing. And so these are the sorts of extrapolations that we have of what sort of loss we've had relative to pre human impacts on the ocean. They range from    to    percent for these major groups of organisms  as shown in the dark blue bars. Now for those species the we managed to leave alone  that we protect    for example  marine mammals in recent years and sea birds    there is some recovery. So it's not all hopeless. But for the most part  we've gone from salting to exhausting. Now this other line of evidence is a really interesting one. It's from trophy fish caught off the coast of Florida. And so this is a photograph from the     s. I want you to notice the scale on the slide  because when you see the same picture from the     s  we see the fish are much smaller and we're also seeing a change in terms of the composition of those fish. By       the catch was actually laughable in terms of the size for a trophy fish. But this is no laughing matter. The oceans have lost a lot of their productivity and we're responsible for it. So what's left  Actually quite a lot. There's a lot of exciting things  and I'm going to tell you a little bit about them. And I want to start with a bit on technology  because  of course  this is a TED Conference and you want to hear something on technology. So one of the tools that we use to sample the deep ocean are remotely operated vehicles. So these are tethered vehicles we lower down to the sea floor where they're our eyes and our hands for working on the sea bottom. So a couple of years ago  I was supposed to go on an oceanographic cruise and I couldn't go because of a scheduling conflict. But through a satellite link I was able to sit at my study at home with my dog curled up at my feet  a cup of tea in my hand  and I could tell the pilot   I want a sample right there.  And that's exactly what the pilot did for me. That's the sort of technology that's available today that really wasn't available even a decade ago. So it allows us to sample these amazing habitats that are very far from the surface and very far from light. And so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans is acoustics  or sound waves. And the advantage of sound waves is that they actually pass well through water  unlike light. And so we can send out sound waves  they bounce off objects like fish and are reflected back. And so in this example  a census scientist took out two ships. One would send out sound waves that would bounce back. They would be received by a second ship  and that would give us very precise estimates  in this case  of     billion herring in a period of about a minute. And that's an area about the size of Manhattan Island. And to be able to do that is a tremendous fisheries tool  because knowing how many fish are there is really critical. We can also use satellite tags to track animals as they move through the oceans. And so for animals that come to the surface to breathe  such as this elephant seal  it's an opportunity to send data back to shore and tell us where exactly it is in the ocean. And so from that we can produce these tracks. For example  the dark blue shows you where the elephant seal moved in the north Pacific. Now I realize for those of you who are colorblind  this slide is not very helpful  but stick with me nonetheless. For animals that don't surface  we have something called pop up tags  which collect data about light and what time the sun rises and sets. And then at some period of time it pops up to the surface and  again  relays that data back to shore. Because GPS doesn't work under water. That's why we need these tools. And so from this we're able to identify these blue highways  these hot spots in the ocean  that should be real priority areas for ocean conservation. Now one of the other things that you may think about is that  when you go to the supermarket and you buy things  they're scanned. And so there's a barcode on that product that tells the computer exactly what the product is. Geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding. And what barcoding does is use a specific gene called CO  that's consistent within a species  but varies among species. And so what that means is we can unambiguously identify which species are which even if they look similar to each other  but may be biologically quite different. Now one of the nicest examples I like to cite on this is the story of two young women  high school students in New York City  who worked with the census. They went out and collected fish from markets and from restaurants in New York City and they barcoded it. Well what they found was mislabeled fish. So for example  they found something which was sold as tuna  which is very valuable  was in fact tilapia  which is a much less valuable fish. They also found an endangered species sold as a common one. So barcoding allows us to know what we're working with and also what we're eating. The Ocean Biogeographic Information System is the database for all the census data. It's open access  you can all go in and download data as you wish. And it contains all the data from the census plus other data sets that people were willing to contribute. And so what you can do with that is to plot the distribution of species and where they occur in the oceans. What I've plotted up here is the data that we have on hand. This is where our sampling effort has concentrated. Now what you can see is we've sampled the area in the North Atlantic  in the North Sea in particular  and also the east coast of North America fairly well. That's the warm colors which show a well sampled region. The cold colors  the blue and the black  show areas where we have almost no data. So even after a    year census  there are large areas that still remain unexplored. Now there are a group of scientists living in Texas  working in the Gulf of Mexico who decided really as a labor of love to pull together all the knowledge they could about biodiversity in the Gulf of Mexico. And so they put this together  a list of all the species  where they're known to occur  and it really seemed like a very esoteric  scientific type of exercise. But then  of course  there was the Deep Horizon oil spill. So all of a sudden  this labor of love for no obvious economic reason has become a critical piece of information in terms of how that system is going to recover  how long it will take and how the lawsuits and the multi billion dollar discussions that are going to happen in the coming years are likely to be resolved. So what did we find  Well  I could stand here for hours  but  of course  I'm not allowed to do that. But I will tell you some of my favorite discoveries from the census. So one of the things we discovered is where are the hot spots of diversity  Where do we find the most species of ocean life  And what we find if we plot up the well known species is this sort of a distribution. And what we see is that for coastal tags  for those organisms that live near the shoreline  they're most diverse in the tropics. This is something we've actually known for a while  so it's not a real breakthrough. What is really exciting though is that the oceanic tags  or the ones that live far from the coast  are actually more diverse at intermediate latitudes. This is the sort of data  again  that managers could use if they want to prioritize areas of the ocean that we need to conserve. You can do this on a global scale  but you can also do it on a regional scale. And that's why biodiversity data can be so valuable. Now while a lot of the species we discovered in the census are things that are small and hard to see  that certainly wasn't always the case. For example  while it's hard to believe that a three kilogram lobster could elude scientists  it did until a few years ago when South African fishermen requested an export permit and scientists realized that this was something new to science. Similarly this Golden V kelp collected in Alaska just below the low water mark is probably a new species. Even though it's three meters long  it actually  again  eluded science. Now this guy  this bigfin squid  is seven meters in length. But to be fair  it lives in the deep waters of the Mid Atlantic Ridge  so it was a lot harder to find. But there's still potential for discovery of big and exciting things. This particular shrimp  we've dubbed it the Jurassic shrimp  it's thought to have gone extinct    years ago    at least it was  until the census discovered it was living and doing just fine off the coast of Australia. And it shows that the ocean  because of its vastness  can hide secrets for a very long time. So  Steven Spielberg  eat your heart out. If we look at distributions  in fact distributions change dramatically. And so one of the records that we had was this sooty shearwater  which undergoes these spectacular migrations all the way from New Zealand all the way up to Alaska and back again in search of endless summer as they complete their life cycles. We also talked about the White Shark Cafe. This is a location in the Pacific where white shark converge. We don't know why they converge there  we simply don't know. That's a question for the future. One of the things that we're taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive. Now this little critter  it's only about half a millimeter in size  not terribly charismatic. But it was only discovered in the early     s. But the really interesting thing about it is that  a few years ago  census scientists discovered that this guy can thrive in oxygen poor sediments in the deep Mediterranean Sea. So now they know that  in fact  animals can live without oxygen  at least some of them  and that they can adapt to even the harshest of conditions. If you were to suck all the water out of the ocean  this is what you'd be left behind with  and that's the biomass of life on the sea floor. Now what we see is huge biomass towards the poles and not much biomass in between. We found life in the extremes. And so there were new species that were found that live inside ice and help to support an ice based food web. And we also found this spectacular yeti crab that lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at Easter Island. And this particular species really captured the public's attention. We also found the deepest vents known yet          meters    the hottest vents at     degrees Celsius    vents in the South Pacific and also in the Arctic where none had been found before. So even new environments are still within the domain of the discoverable. Now in terms of the unknowns  there are many. And I'm just going to summarize just a few of them very quickly for you. First of all  we might ask  how many fishes in the sea  We actually know the fishes better than we do any other group in the ocean other than marine mammals. And so we can actually extrapolate based on rates of discovery how many more species we're likely to discover. And from that  we actually calculate that we know about        marine species and there are probably another       to       left to go. So we've done pretty well. We've got about    percent of the fish  maybe as much as    percent. But the fishes  as I say  are the best known. So our level of knowledge is much less for other groups of organisms. Now this figure is actually based on a brand new paper that's going to come out in the journal PLoS Biology. And what is does is predict how many more species there are on land and in the ocean. And what they found is that they think that we know of about nine percent of the species in the ocean. That means    percent  even after the census  still remain to be discovered. And so that turns out to be about two million species once all is said and done. So we still have quite a lot of work to do in terms of unknowns. Now this bacterium is part of mats that are found off the coast of Chile. And these mats actually cover an area the size of Greece. And so this particular bacterium is actually visible to the naked eye. But you can imagine the biomass that represents. But the really intriguing thing about the microbes is just how diverse they are. A single drop of seawater could contain     different types of microbes. And the oceans themselves are thought potentially to contain as many as a billion different types. So that's really exciting. What are they all doing out there  We actually don't know. The most exciting thing  I would say  about this census is the role of global science. And so as we see in this image of light during the night  there are lots of areas of the Earth where human development is much greater and other areas where it's much less  but between them we see large dark areas of relatively unexplored ocean. The other point I'd like to make about this is that this ocean's interconnected. Marine organisms do not care about international boundaries  they move where they will. And so the importance then of global collaboration becomes all the more important. We've lost a lot of paradise. For example  these tuna that were once so abundant in the North Sea are now effectively gone. There were trawls taken in the deep sea in the Mediterranean  which collected more garbage than they did animals. And that's the deep sea  that's the environment that we consider to be among the most pristine left on Earth. And there are a lot of other pressures. Ocean acidification is a really big issue that people are concerned with  as well as ocean warming  and the effects they're going to have on coral reefs. On the scale of decades  in our lifetimes  we're going to see a lot of damage to coral reefs. And I could spend the rest of my time  which is getting very limited  going through this litany of concerns about the ocean  but I want to end on a more positive note. And so the grand challenge then is to try and make sure that we preserve what's left  because there is still spectacular beauty. And the oceans are so productive  there's so much going on in there that's of relevance to humans that we really need to  even from a selfish perspective  try to do better than we have in the past. So we need to recognize those hot spots and do our best to protect them. When we look at pictures like this  they take our breath away  in addition to helping to give us breath by the oxygen that the oceans provide. Census scientists worked in the rain  they worked in the cold  they worked under water and they worked above water trying to illuminate the wondrous discovery  the still vast unknown  the spectacular adaptations that we see in ocean life. So whether you're a yak herder living in the mountains of Chile  whether you're a stockbroker in New York City or whether you're a TEDster living in Edinburgh  the oceans matter. And as the oceans go so shall we. Thanks for listening. I'm going to speak about a tiny  little idea. And this is about shifting baseline. And because the idea can be explained in one minute  I will tell you three stories before to fill in the time. And the first story is about Charles Darwin  one of my heroes. And he was here  as you well know  in '  . And you'd think he was chasing finches  but he wasn't. He was actually collecting fish. And he described one of them as very  common.  This was the sailfin grouper. A big fishery was run on it until the '  s. Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List. Now this story  we have heard it lots of times on Galapagos and other places  so there is nothing particular about it. But the point is  we still come to Galapagos. We still think it is pristine. The brochures still say it is untouched. So what happens here  The second story  also to illustrate another concept  is called shifting waistline. Because I was there in '    studying a lagoon in West Africa. I was there because I grew up in Europe and I wanted later to work in Africa. And I thought I could blend in. And I got a big sunburn  and I was convinced that I was really not from there. This was my first sunburn. And the lagoon was surrounded by palm trees  as you can see  and a few mangrove. And it had tilapia about    centimeters  a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia. And the fisheries for this tilapia sustained lots of fish and they had a good time and they earned more than average in Ghana. When I went there    years later  the fish had shrunk to half of their size. They were maturing at five centimeters. They had been pushed genetically. There were still fishes. They were still kind of happy. And the fish also were happy to be there. So nothing has changed  but everything has changed. My third little story is that I was an accomplice in the introduction of trawling in Southeast Asia. In the '  s    well  beginning in the '  s    Europe did lots of development projects. Fish development meant imposing on countries that had already         fishers to impose on them industrial fishing. And this boat  quite ugly  is called the Mutiara  . And I went sailing on it  and we did surveys throughout the southern South China sea and especially the Java Sea. And what we caught  we didn't have words for it. What we caught  I know now  is the bottom of the sea. And    percent of our catch were sponges  other animals that are fixed on the bottom. And actually most of the fish  they are a little spot on the debris  the piles of debris  were coral reef fish. Essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down. And these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid. Within a year  you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins. The bottom is transformed from  in this case  a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy mess. This is a dead turtle. They were not eaten  they were thrown away because they were dead. And one time we caught a live one. It was not drowned yet. And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat. This mountain of debris is actually collected by fishers every time they go into an area that's never been fished. But it's not documented. We transform the world  but we don't remember it. We adjust our baseline to the new level  and we don't recall what was there. If you generalize this  something like this happens. You have on the y axis some good thing  biodiversity  numbers of orca  the greenness of your country  the water supply. And over time it changes    it changes because people do things  or naturally. Every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extrapolate forward. And the difference then  they perceive as a loss. But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss. You can have a succession of changes. At the end you want to sustain miserable leftovers. And that  to a large extent  is what we want to do now. We want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were. Now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies  they killed animals and they didn't know they had done so after a few generations. Because  obviously  an animal that is very abundant  before it gets extinct  it becomes rare. So you don't lose abundant animals. You always lose rare animals. And therefore they're not perceived as a big loss. Over time  we concentrate on large animals  and in a sea that means the big fish. They become rarer because we fish them. Over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the baseline. And the question is  why do people accept this  Well because they don't know that it was different. And in fact  lots of people  scientists  will contest that it was really different. And they will contest this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented. For example  the anecdote that some present  as Captain so and so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists  because it's not  scientific.  So you have a situation where people don't know the past  even though we live in literate societies  because they don't trust the sources of the past. And hence  the enormous role that a marine protected area can play. Because with marine protected areas  we actually recreate the past. We recreate the past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low. That is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides  which enables them to reset their baseline. How about the people who can't do that because they have no access    the people in the Midwest for example  There I think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap  and simulation. This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay. There were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago        years ago. And you will have noticed that the hues and tones are like  Avatar.  And if you think about  Avatar   if you think of why people were so touched by it    never mind the Pocahontas story    why so touched by the imagery  Because it evokes something that in a sense has been lost. And so my recommendation  it's the only one I will provide  is for Cameron to do  Avatar II  underwater. Thank you very much. Let me begin with four words that will provide the context for this week  four words that will come to define this century. Here they are  The Earth is full. It's full of us  it's full of our stuff  full of our waste  full of our demands. Yes  we are a brilliant and creative species  but we've created a little too much stuff    so much that our economy is now bigger than its host  our planet. This is not a philosophical statement  this is just science based in physics  chemistry and biology. There are many science based analyses of this  but they all draw the same conclusion    that we're living beyond our means. The eminent scientists of the Global Footprint Network  for example  calculate that we need about  .  Earths to sustain this economy. In other words  to keep operating at our current level  we need    percent more Earth than we've got. In financial terms  this would be like always spending    percent more than you earn  going further into debt every year. But of course  you can't borrow natural resources  so we're burning through our capital  or stealing from the future. So when I say full  I mean really full    well past any margin for error  well past any dispute about methodology. What this means is our economy is unsustainable. I'm not saying it's not nice or pleasant or that it's bad for polar bears or forests  though it certainly is. What I'm saying is our approach is simply unsustainable. In other words  thanks to those pesky laws of physics  when things aren't sustainable  they stop. But that's not possible  you might think. We can't stop economic growth. Because that's what will stop  economic growth. It will stop because of the end of trade resources. It will stop because of the growing demand of us on all the resources  all the capacity  all the systems of the Earth  which is now having economic damage. When we think about economic growth stopping  we go   That's not possible   because economic growth is so essential to our society that is is rarely questioned. Although growth has certainly delivered many benefits  it is an idea so essential that we tend not to understand the possibility of it not being around. Even though it has delivered many benefits  it is based on a crazy idea    the crazy idea being that we can have infinite growth on a finite planet. And I'm here to tell you the emperor has no clothes. That the crazy idea is just that  it is crazy  and with the Earth full  it's game over. Come on  you're thinking. That's not possible. Technology is amazing. People are innovative. There are so many ways we can improve the way we do things. We can surely sort this out. That's all true. Well  it's mostly true. We are certainly amazing  and we regularly solve complex problems with amazing creativity. So if our problem was to get the human economy down from     percent to     percent of the Earth's capacity  we could do that. The problem is we're just warming up this growth engine. We plan to take this highly stressed economy and make it twice as big and then make it four times as big    not in some distant future  but in less than    years  in the life time of most of you. China plans to be there in just    years. The only problem with this plan is that it's not possible. In response  some people argue  but we need growth  we need it to solve poverty. We need it to develop technology. We need it to keep social stability. I find this argument fascinating  as though we can kind of bend the rules of physics to suit our needs. It's like the Earth doesn't care what we need. Mother nature doesn't negotiate  she just sets rules and describes consequences. And these are not esoteric limits. This is about food and water  soil and climate  the basic practical and economic foundations of our lives. So the idea that we can smoothly transition to a highly efficient  solar powered  knowledge based economy transformed by science and technology so that nine billion people can live in      a life of abundance and digital downloads is a delusion. It's not that it's not possible to feed  clothe and house us all and have us live decent lives. It certainly is. But the idea that we can gently grow there with a few minor hiccups is just wrong  and it's dangerously wrong  because it means we're not getting ready for what's really going to happen. See what happens when you operate a system past its limits and then keep on going at an ever accelerating rate is that the system stops working and breaks down. And that's what will happen to us. Many of you will be thinking  but surely we can still stop this. If it's that bad  we'll react. Let's just think through that idea. Now we've had    years of warnings. We've had science proving the urgency of change. We've had economic analysis pointing out that  not only can we afford it  it's cheaper to act early. And yet  the reality is we've done pretty much nothing to change course. We're not even slowing down. Last year on climate  for example  we had the highest global emissions ever. The story on food  on water  on soil  on climate is all much the same. I actually don't say this in despair. I've done my grieving about the loss. I accept where we are. It is sad  but it is what it is. But it is also time that we ended our denial and recognized that we're not acting  we're not close to acting and we're not going to act until this crisis hits the economy. And that's why the end of growth is the central issue and the event that we need to get ready for. So when does this transition begin  When does this breakdown begin  In my view  it is well underway. I know most people don't see it that way. We tend to look at the world  not as the integrated system that it is  but as a series of individual issues. We see the Occupy protests  we see spiraling debt crises  we see growing inequality  we see money's influence on politics  we see resource constraint  food and oil prices. But we see  mistakenly  each of these issues as individual problems to be solved. In fact  it's the system in the painful process of breaking down    our system  of debt fueled economic growth  of ineffective democracy  of overloading planet Earth  is eating itself alive. I could give you countless studies and evidence to prove this  but I won't because  if you want to see it  that evidence is all around you. I want to talk to you about fear. I want to do so because  in my view  the most important issue we face is how we respond to this question. The crisis is now inevitable. This issue is  how will we react  Of course  we can't know what will happen. The future is inherently uncertain. But let's just think through what the science is telling us is likely to happen. Imagine our economy when the carbon bubble bursts  when the financial markets recognize that  to have any hope of preventing the climate spiraling out of control  the oil and coal industries are finished. Imagine China  India and Pakistan going to war as climate impacts generate conflict over food and water. Imagine the Middle East without oil income  but with collapsing governments. Imagine our highly tuned  just in time food industry and our highly stressed agricultural system failing and supermarket shelves emptying. Imagine    percent unemployment in America as the global economy is gripped by fear and uncertainty. Now imagine what that means for you  your family  your friends  your personal financial security. Imagine what it means for your personal security as a heavily armed civilian population gets angrier and angrier about why this was allowed to happen. Imagine what you'll tell your children when they ask you   So  in       Mom and Dad  what was it like when you'd had the hottest decade on record for the third decade in a row  when every scientific body in the world was saying you've got a major problem  when the oceans were acidifying  when oil and food prices were spiking  when they were rioting in the streets of London and occupying Wall Street  When the system was so clearly breaking down  Mom and Dad  what did you do  what were you thinking   So how do you feel when the lights go out on the global economy in your mind  when your assumptions about the future fade away and something very different emerges  Just take a moment and take a breath and think  what do you feel at this point  Perhaps denial. Perhaps anger. Maybe fear. Of course  we can't know what's going to happen and we have to live with uncertainty. But when we think about the kind of possibilities I paint  we should feel a bit of fear. We are in danger  all of us  and we've evolved to respond to danger with fear to motivate a powerful response  to help us bravely face a threat. But this time it's not a tiger at the cave mouth. You can't see the danger at your door. But if you look  you can see it at the door of your civilization. That's why we need to feel our response now while the lights are still on  because if we wait until the crisis takes hold  we may panic and hide. If we feel it now and think it through  we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself. Yes  things will get ugly  and it will happen soon    certainly in our lifetime    but we are more than capable of getting through everything that's coming. You see  those people that have faith that humans can solve any problem  that technology is limitless  that markets can be a force for good  are in fact right. The only thing they're missing is that it takes a good crisis to get us going. When we feel fear and we fear loss we are capable of quite extraordinary things. Think about war. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor  it just took four days for the government to ban the production of civilian cars and to redirect the auto industry  and from there to rationing of food and energy. Think about how a company responds to a bankruptcy threat and how a change that seemed impossible just gets done. Think about how an individual responds to a diagnosis of a life threatening illness and how lifestyle changes that previously were just too difficult suddenly become relatively easy. We are smart  in fact  we really are quite amazing  but we do love a good crisis. And the good news  this one's a monster. Sure  if we get it wrong  we could face the end of this civilization  but if we get it right  it could be the beginning of civilization instead. And how cool would it be to tell your grandchildren that you were part of that  There's certainly no technical or economic barrier in the way. Scientists like James Hansen tell us we may need to eliminate net CO  emissions from the economy in just a few decades. I wanted to know what that would take  so I worked with professor Jorgen Randers from Norway to find the answer. We developed a plan called  The One Degree War Plan     so named because of the level of mobilization and focus required. To my surprise  eliminating net CO  emissions from the economy in just    years is actually pretty easy and pretty cheap  not very cheap  but certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization. We didn't calculate that precisely  but we understand that's very expensive. You can read the details  but in summary  we can transform our economy. We can do it with proven technology. We can do it at an affordable cost. We can do it with existing political structures. The only thing we need to change is how we think and how we feel. And this is where you come in. When we think about the future I paint  of course we should feel a bit of fear. But fear can be paralyzing or motivating. We need to accept the fear and then we need to act. We need to act like the future depends on it. We need to act like we only have one planet. We can do this. I know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth  more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do. They're wrong. We can be more  we can be much more. We have achieved remarkable things since working out how to grow food some        years ago. We've built a powerful foundation of science  knowledge and technology    more than enough to build a society where nine billion people can lead decent  meaningful and satisfying lives. The Earth can support that if we choose the right path. We can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society's evolution    like  what do we want to be when we grow up  when we move past this bumbling adolescence where we think there are no limits and suffer delusions of immortality  Well it's time to grow up  to be wiser  to be calmer  to be more considered. Like generations before us  we'll be growing up in war    not a war between civilizations  but a war for civilization  for the extraordinary opportunity to build a society which is stronger and happier and plans on staying around into middle age. We can choose life over fear. We can do what we need to do  but it will take every entrepreneur  every artist  every scientist  every communicator  every mother  every father  every child  every one of us.

Peter Diamandis  So those are just a few of the clips I collected over the last six months    could have easily been the last six days or the last six years. The point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that's what our minds pay attention to. And there's a very good reason for that. Every second of every day  our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains. And because nothing is more important to us than survival  the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala. Now the amygdala is our early warning detector  our danger detector. It sorts and scours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us. So given a dozen news stories  we will preferentially look at the negative news. And that old newspaper saying   If it bleeds it leads   is very true. So given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week     hours a day  it's no wonder that we're pessimistic. It's no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse. But perhaps that's not the case. Perhaps instead  it's the distortions brought to us of what's really going on. Perhaps the tremendous progress we've made over the last century by a series of forces are  in fact  accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance. Now I'm not saying we don't have our set of problems    climate crisis  species extinction  water and energy shortage    we surely do. And as humans  we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance  but ultimately we knock them down. So let's look at what this last century has been to see where we're going. Over the last hundred years  the average human lifespan has more than doubled  average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled. Childhood mortality has come down a factor of   . Add to that the cost of food  electricity  transportation  communication have dropped    to       fold. Steve Pinker has showed us that  in fact  we're living during the most peaceful time ever in human history. And Charles Kenny that global literacy has gone from    percent to over    percent in the last     years. We truly are living in an extraordinary time. And many people forget this. And we keep setting our expectations higher and higher. In fact  we redefine what poverty means. Think of this  in America today  the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity  water  toilets  refrigerators  television  mobile phones  air conditioning and cars. The wealthiest robber barons of the last century  the emperors on this planet  could have never dreamed of such luxuries. Underpinning much of this is technology  and of late  exponentially growing technologies. My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve  on Moore's Law  and experiences price performance doubling every    to    months. That's why the cellphone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the '  s. Now look at this curve. This is Moore's Law over the last hundred years. I want you to notice two things from this curve. Number one  how smooth it is    through good time and bad time  war time and peace time  recession  depression and boom time. This is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers. It doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges. And also  even though it's plotted on a log curve on the left  it's curving upwards. The rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster. And on this curve  riding on Moore's Law  are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us. Cloud computing  what my friends at Autodesk call infinite computing  sensors and networks  robotics   D printing  which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet  synthetic biology  fuels  vaccines and foods  digital medicine  nanomaterials  and A.I. I mean  how many of you saw the winning of Jeopardy by IBM's Watson  I mean  that was epic. In fact  I scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper I could. And I love this   Watson Vanquishes Human Opponents.  Jeopardy's not an easy game. It's about the nuance of human language. And imagine if you would A.I.'s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cellphone. Four years ago here at TED  Ray Kurzweil and I started a new university called Singularity University. And we teach our students all of these technologies  and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity's grand challenges. And every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade. Think about that  the fact that  literally  a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today.    years ago that would have sounded ludicrous. Today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that. When I think about creating abundance  it's not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet  it's about creating a life of possibility. It is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant. You see  scarcity is contextual  and technology is a resource liberating force. Let me give you an example. So this is a story of Napoleon III in the mid     s. He's the dude on the left. He invited over to dinner the king of Siam. All of Napoleon's troops were fed with silver utensils  Napoleon himself with gold utensils. But the King of Siam  he was fed with aluminum utensils. You see  aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet  worth more than gold and platinum. It's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument is made of aluminum. You see  even though aluminum is  .  percent of the Earth by mass  it doesn't come as a pure metal. It's all bound by oxygen and silicates. But then the technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throw away mentality. So let's project this analogy going forward. We think about energy scarcity. Ladies and gentlemen  we are on a planet that is bathed with       times more energy than we use in a year.    terawatts of energy hits the Earth's surface every    minutes. It's not about being scarce  it's about accessibility. And there's good news here. For the first time  this year the cost of solar generated electricity is    percent that of diesel generated electricity in India     .  rupees versus    rupees. The cost of solar dropped    percent last year. Last month  MIT put out a study showing that by the end of this decade  in the sunny parts of the United States  solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to    cents as a national average. And if we have abundant energy  we also have abundant water. Now we talk about water wars. Do you remember when Carl Sagan turned the Voyager spacecraft back towards the Earth  in      after it just passed Saturn  He took a famous photo. What was it called   A Pale Blue Dot.  Because we live on a water planet. We live on a planet    percent covered by water. Yes    .  percent is saltwater  two percent is ice  and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet  but here too there is hope. And there is technology coming online  not        years from now  right now. There's nanotechnology coming on  nanomaterials. And the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning  one of the great DIY innovators  I'd like to share with you    he gave me permission to do so    his technology called Slingshot that many of you may have heard of  it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator. It's able to generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day out of any source    saltwater  polluted water  latrine    at less than two cents a liter. The chairman of Coca Cola has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world. And if that pans out  which I have every confidence it will  Coca Cola will deploy this globally to     countries around the planet. This is the kind of innovation  empowered by this technology  that exists today. And we've seen this in cellphones. My goodness  we're going to hit    percent penetration of cellphones in the developing world by the end of     . Think about it  that a Masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of Kenya has better mobile comm than President Reagan did    years ago. And if they're on a smartphone on Google  they've got access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton did    years ago. They're living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted. Better than that  the things that you and I spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for    GPS  HD video and still images  libraries of books and music  medical diagnostic technology    are now literally dematerializing and demonetizing into your cellphone. Probably the best part of it is what's coming down the pike in health. Last month  I had the pleasure of announcing with Qualcomm Foundation something called the     million Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize. We're challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to  because it's got A.I.  you can cough on it  you can do a finger blood prick. And to win  it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of board certified doctors. So literally  imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors     percent of the disease burden and  .  percent of the health care workers. When this device sequences an RNA or DNA virus that it doesn't recognize  it calls the CDC and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place. But here  here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance. I call it the rising billion. So the white lines here are population. We just passed the seven billion mark on Earth. And by the way  the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy. In       we had just short of two billion people online  connected. By       that's going from two billion to five billion Internet users. Three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation. What will these people want  What will they consume  What will they desire  And rather than having economic shutdown  we're about to have the biggest economic injection ever. These people represent tens of trillions of dollars injected into the global economy. And they will get healthier by using the Tricorder  and they'll become better educated by using the Khan Academy  and by literally being able to use  D printing and infinite computing  become  more productive than ever before. So what could three billion rising  healthy  educated  productive members of humanity bring to us  How about a set of voices that have never been heard from before. What about giving the oppressed  wherever they might be  the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever  What will these three billion people bring  What about contributions we can't even predict  The one thing I've learned at the X Prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things  things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past. Let me share and close with a story that really got me excited. There is a program that some of you might have heard of. It's a game called Foldit. It came out of the University of Washington in Seattle. And this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold. And how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality. And it's very important for research in medicine. And up until now  it's been a supercomputer problem. And this game has been played by university professors and so forth. And it's literally  hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it. And it showed that  in fact  today  the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers. And when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world  it wasn't an MIT professor  it wasn't a CalTech student  it was a person from England  from Manchester  a woman who  during the day  was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and  at night  was the world's best protein folder. Ladies and gentlemen  what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet. We have the tools with this exponential technology. We have the passion of the DIY innovator. We have the capital of the techno philanthropist. And we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges  to do that which we must do. We are living into extraordinary decades ahead. Thank you.
