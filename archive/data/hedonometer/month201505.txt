On the path that American children  travel to adulthood  two institutions oversee the journey. The first is the one we hear  a lot about  college. Some of you may remember the excitement that you felt when you first set off for college. Some of you may be in college right now and you're feeling this excitement at this very moment. College has some shortcomings. It's expensive  it leaves young people in debt. But all in all  it's a pretty good path. Young people emerge from college with pride and with great friends and with a lot of knowledge  about the world. And perhaps most importantly  a better chance in the labor market than they had before they got there. Today I want to talk about the second institution overseeing the journey from childhood to adulthood in the United States. And that institution is prison. Young people on this journey are meeting with probation officers instead of with teachers. They're going to court dates instead of to class. Their junior year abroad is instead a trip to a state correctional facility. And they're emerging from their   s not with degrees in business and English  but with criminal records. This institution is also costing us a lot  about        dollars a year to send a young person to prison in New Jersey. But here  taxpayers are footing the bill and what kids are getting is a cold prison cell and a permanent mark against them when they come home and apply for work. There are more and more kids on this journey to adulthood than ever before in the United States and that's because in the past    years  our incarceration rate  has grown by     percent. I have one slide for this talk. Here it is. Here's our incarceration rate  about     people per         in the population. Here's the OECD countries. What's more  it's poor kids that we're sending to prison  too many drawn from African American and Latino communities so that prison now stands firmly between the young people trying to make it and the fulfillment of the American Dream. The problem's actually  a bit worse than this 'cause we're not just sending  poor kids to prison  we're saddling poor kids with court fees  with probation and parole restrictions  with low level warrants  we're asking them to live  in halfway houses and on house arrest  and we're asking them  to negotiate a police force that is entering poor communities of color  not for the purposes  of promoting public safety  but to make arrest counts  to line city coffers. This is the hidden underside to our historic experiment in punishment  young people worried that at any moment  they will be stopped  searched and seized. Not just in the streets   but in their homes  at school and at work. I got interested in this  other path to adulthood when I was myself a college student attending the University of Pennsylvania in the early     s. Penn sits within a historic  African American neighborhood. So you've got these two parallel journeys going on simultaneously  the kids attending  this elite  private university  and the kids from  the adjacent neighborhood  some of whom are making it to college  and many of whom  are being shipped to prison. In my sophomore year  I started tutoring a young woman who was in high school who lived about    minutes away from the university. Soon  her cousin came home  from a juvenile detention center. He was     a freshman in high school. I began to get to know him  and his friends and family  and I asked him what he thought  about me writing about his life for my senior thesis in college. This senior thesis became a dissertation at Princeton and now a book. By the end of my sophomore year  I moved into the neighborhood and I spent the next six years trying to understand what young people were facing as they came of age. The first week I spent in this neighborhood  I saw two boys  five and seven years old  play this game of chase  where the older boy ran after the other boy. He played the cop. When the cop caught up to the younger boy  he pushed him down  handcuffed him with imaginary handcuffs  took a quarter out of  the other child's pocket  saying   I'm seizing that.  He asked the child if  he was carrying any drugs or if he had a warrant. Many times  I saw this game repeated  sometimes children would  simply give up running  and stick their bodies flat  against the ground with their hands above their heads  or flat up against a wall. Children would yell at each other   I'm going to lock you up  I'm going to lock you up and you're never coming home   Once I saw a six year old child pull another child's pants down and try to do a cavity search. In the first    months that I lived in this neighborhood  I wrote down every time I saw any contact between police and people that were my neighbors. So in the first    months  I watched the police stop  pedestrians or people in cars  search people  run people's names  chase people through the streets  pull people in for questioning  or make an arrest every single day  with five exceptions. Fifty two times  I watched the police break down doors  chase people through houses or make an arrest of someone in their home. Fourteen times in this first year and a half  I watched the police punch  choke  kick  stomp on or beat young men after they had caught them. Bit by bit  I got to know two brothers  Chuck and Tim. Chuck was    when we met  a senior in high school. He was playing on the basketball team and making C's and B's. His younger brother  Tim  was   . And Tim loved Chuck  he followed him around a lot  looked to Chuck to be a mentor. They lived with their mom and grandfather in a two story row home  with a front lawn and a back porch. Their mom was struggling with addiction all while the boys were growing up. She never really was able  to hold down a job for very long. It was their grandfather's pension that supported the family  not really enough to pay for food and clothes and school supplies for growing boys. The family was really struggling. So when we met  Chuck was a senior in high school. He had just turned   . That winter  a kid in the schoolyard called Chuck's mom a crack whore. Chuck pushed the kid's face into the snow and the school cops charged him  with aggravated assault. The other kid was fine the next day  I think it was his pride that was injured more than anything. But anyway  since Chuck was     this agg. assault case sent him  to adult county jail on State Road in northeast Philadelphia  where he sat  unable to pay the bail    he couldn't afford it    while the trial dates  dragged on and on and on through almost his entire senior year. Finally  near the end of this season  the judge on this assault case threw out most of the charges and Chuck came home with only a few hundred dollars' worth of court fees hanging over his head. Tim was pretty happy that day. The next fall  Chuck tried  to re enroll as a senior  but the school secretary told him that he was then    and too old  to be readmitted. Then the judge on his assault case issued him a warrant for his arrest because he couldn't pay  the     dollars in court fees that came due a few weeks after the case ended. Then he was a high school dropout living on the run. Tim's first arrest came later that year after he turned   . Chuck had managed to get his warrant lifted and he was on a payment plan for the court fees and he was driving Tim to school in his girlfriend's car. So a cop pulls them over  runs the car  and the car comes up  as stolen in California. Chuck had no idea where in the history of this car it had been stolen. His girlfriend's uncle bought it from a used car auction in northeast Philly. Chuck and Tim had never been outside of the tri state  let alone to California. But anyway  the cops down at the precinct charged Chuck with  receiving stolen property. And then a juvenile judge   a few days later  charged Tim  age     with accessory to receiving a stolen property and then he was placed on  three years of probation. With this probation sentence  hanging over his head  Chuck sat his little brother down and began teaching him how to run from the police. They would sit side by side  on their back porch looking out into the shared alleyway and Chuck would coach Tim how to spot undercover cars  how to negotiate a late night police raid  how and where to hide. I want you to imagine for a second what Chuck and Tim's lives would be like if they were living in a neighborhood where kids were going to college  not prison. A neighborhood like the one  I got to grow up in. Okay  you might say. But Chuck and Tim  kids like them  they're committing crimes  Don't they deserve to be in prison  Don't they deserve to be  living in fear of arrest  Well  my answer would be no. They don't. And certainly not for the same things  that other young people with more privilege are doing with impunity. If Chuck had gone to my high school  that schoolyard fight  would have ended there  as a schoolyard fight. It never would have become an aggravated assault case. Not a single kid that I went to college with has a criminal record right now. Not a single one. But can you imagine how many might have if the police had stopped those kids and searched their pockets for drugs as they walked to class  Or had raided their frat parties in the middle of the night  Okay  you might say. But doesn't this high incarceration rate partly account for our  really low crime rate  Crime is down. That's a good thing. Totally  that is a good thing. Crime is down. It dropped precipitously in the '  s and through the     s. But according to a committee of academics convened by the National Academy of Sciences last year  the relationship between our historically high incarceration rates and our low crime rate is pretty shaky. It turns out that the crime rate goes up and down irrespective of how many young people we send to prison. We tend to think about justice in a pretty narrow way  good and bad  innocent and guilty. Injustice is about being  wrongfully convicted. So if you're convicted  of something you did do  you should be punished for it. There are innocent and guilty people  there are victims and  there are perpetrators. Maybe we could think a little bit more broadly than that. Right now  we're asking kids who live in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods  who have the least amount of family resources  who are attending  the country's worst schools  who are facing the toughest time in the labor market  who are living in neighborhoods where violence is an everyday problem  we're asking these kids to walk the thinnest possible line    to basically never do anything wrong. Why are we not providing support to young kids facing these challenges  Why are we offering only handcuffs  jail time and this fugitive existence  Can we imagine something better  Can we imagine a criminal justice system that prioritizes recovery  prevention  civic inclusion  rather than punishment  A criminal justice system  that acknowledges the legacy of exclusion that poor people of color in the U.S. have faced and that does not promote and perpetuate those exclusions. And finally  a criminal justice system that believes in black young people  rather than treating black young people  as the enemy to be rounded up. The good news is that we already are. A few years ago  Michelle Alexander wrote  The New Jim Crow   which got Americans to see  incarceration as a civil rights issue of historic proportions in a way they had not seen it before. President Obama and Attorney General  Eric Holder have come out very strongly on sentencing reform  on the need to address  racial disparity in incarceration. We're seeing states throw out Stop and Frisk as the civil rights violation that it is. We're seeing cities and states decriminalize possession of marijuana. New York  New Jersey and California have been dropping their  prison populations  closing prisons  while also seeing a big drop in crime. Texas has gotten into the game now  also closing prisons   investing in education. This curious coalition is building  from the right and the left  made up of former prisoners and fiscal conservatives  of civil rights activists and libertarians  of young people taking to the streets to protest police violence against unarmed black teenagers  and older  wealthier people    some of you are here in the audience    pumping big money into  decarceration initiatives In a deeply divided Congress  the work of reforming  our criminal justice system is just about the only thing that the right and the left are coming together on. I did not think I would see this political moment in my lifetime. I think many of the people who have been working tirelessly to write about the causes and consequences of our historically  high incarceration rates did not think we would see this moment in our lifetime. The question for us now is  how much can we make of it  How much can we change  I want to end with a call to young people  the young people attending college and the young people struggling to stay out of prison or to make it through prison and return home. It may seem like these paths to adulthood are worlds apart  but the young people participating in these two institutions conveying us to adulthood  they have one thing in common  Both can be leaders in the work of reforming our criminal justice system. Young people have always been leaders in the fight for equal rights  the fight for more people  to be granted dignity and a fighting chance at freedom. The mission for the generation  of young people coming of age in this  a sea change moment  potentially  is to end mass incarceration and  build a new criminal justice system  emphasis on the word justice. Thanks. I am a plant geneticist. I study genes that make plants resistant to disease and tolerant of stress. In recent years  millions of people around the world have come to believe that there's something sinister about genetic modification. Today  I am going to provide a different perspective. First  let me introduce my husband  Raoul. He's an organic farmer. On his farm  he plants a variety of different crops. This is one of the many ecological farming practices he uses to keep his farm healthy. Imagine some of the reactions we get   Really  An organic farmer and a plant geneticist  Can you agree on anything   Well  we can  and it's not difficult  because we have the same goal. We want to help nourish the growing population without further destroying the environment. I believe this is the greatest challenge of our time. Now  genetic modification is not new  virtually everything we eat has been genetically modified in some manner. Let me give you a few examples. On the left is an image of the ancient ancestor of modern corn. You see a single roll of grain that's covered in a hard case. Unless you have a hammer  teosinte isn't good for making tortillas. Now  take a look at the ancient ancestor of banana. You can see the large seeds. And unappetizing brussel sprouts  and eggplant  so beautiful. Now  to create these varieties  breeders have used many different genetic techniques over the years. Some of them are quite creative  like mixing two different species together using a process called grafting to create this variety that's half tomato and half potato. Breeders have also used other types of genetic techniques  such as random mutagenesis  which induces uncharacterized mutations into the plants. The rice in the cereal that many of us fed our babies was developed using this approach. Now  today  breeders have even more options to choose from. Some of them are extraordinarily precise. I want to give you a couple examples from my own work. I work on rice  which is a staple food for more than half the world's people. Each year     percent of the potential harvest is lost to pest and disease. For this reason  farmers plant rice varieties that carry genes for resistance. This approach has been used for nearly     years. Yet  when I started graduate school  no one knew what these genes were. It wasn't until the     s that scientists finally uncovered the genetic basis of resistance. In my laboratory  we isolated a gene for immunity to a very serious bacterial disease in Asia and Africa. We found we could engineer the gene into a conventional rice variety that's normally susceptible  and you can see the two leaves on the bottom here are highly resistant to infection. Now  the same month that my laboratory published our discovery on the rice immunity gene  my friend and colleague Dave Mackill stopped by my office. He said   Seventy million rice farmers are having trouble growing rice.  That's because their fields are flooded  and these rice farmers are living on less than two dollars a day. Although rice grows well in standing water  most rice varieties will die if they're submerged for more than three days. Flooding is expected to be increasingly problematic as the climate changes. He told me that his graduate student Kenong Xu and himself were studying an ancient variety of rice that had an amazing property. It could withstand two weeks of complete submergence. He asked if I would be willing to help them isolate this gene. I said yes    I was very excited  because I knew if we were successful  we could potentially help millions of farmers grow rice even when their fields were flooded. Kenong spent    years looking for this gene. Then one day  he said   Come look at this experiment. You've got to see it.  I went to the greenhouse and I saw that the conventional variety that was flooded for    days had died  but the rice variety that we had genetically engineered with a new gene we had discovered  called Sub   was alive. Kenong and I were amazed and excited that a single gene could have this dramatic effect. But this is just a greenhouse experiment. Would this work in the field  Now  I'm going to show you a four month time lapse video taken at the International Rice Research Institute. Breeders there developed a rice variety carrying the Sub  gene using another genetic technique called precision breeding. On the left  you can see the Sub  variety  and on the right is the conventional variety. Both varieties do very well at first  but then the field is flooded for    days. You can see the Sub  variety does great. In fact  it produces three and a half times more grain than the conventional variety. I love this video because it shows the power of plant genetics to help farmers. Last year  with the help of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  three and a half million farmers grew Sub  rice. Thank you. Now  many people don't mind genetic modification when it comes to moving rice genes around  rice genes in rice plants  or even when it comes to mixing species together through grafting or random mutagenesis. But when it comes to taking genes from viruses and bacteria and putting them into plants  a lot of people say   Yuck.  Why would you do that  The reason is that sometimes it's the cheapest  safest  and most effective technology for enhancing food security and advancing sustainable agriculture. I'm going to give you three examples. First  take a look at papaya. It's delicious  right  But now  look at this papaya. This papaya is infected with papaya ringspot virus. In the     s  this virus nearly wiped out the entire production of papaya on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. Many people thought that the Hawaiian papaya was doomed  but then  a local Hawaiian  a plant pathologist named Dennis Gonsalves  decided to try to fight this disease using genetic engineering. He took a snippet of viral DNA and he inserted it into the papaya genome. This is kind of like a human getting a vaccination. Now  take a look at his field trial. You can see the genetically engineered papaya in the center. It's immune to infection. The conventional papaya around the outside is severely infected with the virus. Dennis' pioneering work is credited with rescuing the papaya industry. Today     years later  there's still no other method to control this disease. There's no organic method. There's no conventional method. Eighty percent of Hawaiian papaya is genetically engineered. Now  some of you may still feel a little queasy about viral genes in your food  but consider this  The genetically engineered papaya carries just a trace amount of the virus. If you bite into an organic or conventional papaya that is infected with the virus  you will be chewing on tenfold more viral protein. Now  take a look at this pest feasting on an eggplant. The brown you see is frass  what comes out the back end of the insect. To control this serious pest  which can devastate the entire eggplant crop in Bangladesh  Bangladeshi farmers spray insecticides two to three times a week  sometimes twice a day  when pest pressure is high. But we know that some insecticides are very harmful to human health  especially when farmers and their families cannot afford proper protection  like these children. In less developed countries  it's estimated that         people die every year because of insecticide misuse and exposure. Cornell and Bangladeshi scientists decided to fight this disease using a genetic technique that builds on an organic farming approach. Organic farmers like my husband Raoul spray an insecticide called B.T.  which is based on a bacteria. This pesticide is very specific to caterpillar pests  and in fact  it's nontoxic to humans  fish and birds. It's less toxic than table salt. But this approach does not work well in Bangladesh. That's because these insecticide sprays are difficult to find  they're expensive  and they don't prevent the insect from getting inside the plants. In the genetic approach  scientists cut the gene out of the bacteria and insert it directly into the eggplant genome. Will this work to reduce insecticide sprays in Bangladesh  Definitely. Last season  farmers reported they were able to reduce their insecticide use by a huge amount  almost down to zero. They're able to harvest and replant for the next season. Now  I've given you a couple examples of how genetic engineering can be used to fight pests and disease and to reduce the amount of insecticides. My final example is an example where genetic engineering can be used to reduce malnutrition. In less developed countries          children go blind every year because of lack of Vitamin A. More than half will die. For this reason  scientists supported by the Rockefeller Foundation genetically engineered a golden rice to produce beta carotene  which is the precursor of Vitamin A. This is the same pigment that we find in carrots. Researchers estimate that just one cup of golden rice per day will save the lives of thousands of children. But golden rice is virulently opposed by activists who are against genetic modification. Just last year  activists invaded and destroyed a field trial in the Philippines. When I heard about the destruction  I wondered if they knew that they were destroying much more than a scientific research project  that they were destroying medicines that children desperately needed to save their sight and their lives. Some of my friends and family still worry  How do you know genes in the food are safe to eat  I explained the genetic engineering  the process of moving genes between species  has been used for more than    years in wines  in medicine  in plants  in cheeses. In all that time  there hasn't been a single case of harm to human health or the environment. But I say  look  I'm not asking you to believe me. Science is not a belief system. My opinion doesn't matter. Let's look at the evidence. After    years of careful study and rigorous peer review by thousands of independent scientists  every major scientific organization in the world has concluded that the crops currently on the market are safe to eat and that the process of genetic engineering is no more risky than older methods of genetic modification. These are precisely the same organizations that most of us trust when it comes to other important scientific issues such as global climate change or the safety of vaccines. Raoul and I believe that  instead of worrying about the genes in our food  we must focus on how we can help children grow up healthy. We must ask if farmers in rural communities can thrive  and if everyone can afford the food. We must try to minimize environmental degradation. What scares me most about the loud arguments and misinformation about plant genetics is that the poorest people who most need the technology may be denied access because of the vague fears and prejudices of those who have enough to eat. We have a huge challenge in front of us. Let's celebrate scientific innovation and use it. It's our responsibility to do everything we can to help alleviate human suffering and safeguard the environment. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Powerfully argued. The people who argue against GMOs  as I understand it  the core piece comes from two things. One  complexity and unintended consequence. Nature is this incredibly complex machine. If we put out these brand new genes that we've created  that haven't been challenged by years of evolution  and they started mixing up with the rest of what's going on  couldn't that trigger some kind of cataclysm or problem  especially when you add in the commercial incentive that some companies have to put them out there  The fear is that those incentives mean that the decision is not made on purely scientific grounds  and even if it was  that there would be unintended consequences. How do we know that there isn't a big risk of some unintended consequence  Often our tinkerings with nature do lead to big  unintended consequences and chain reactions. Pamela Ronald  Okay  so on the commercial aspects  one thing that's really important to understand is that  in the developed world  farmers in the United States  almost all farmers  whether they're organic or conventional  they buy seed produced by seed companies. So there's definitely a commercial interest to sell a lot of seed  but hopefully they're selling seed that the farmers want to buy. It's different in the less developed world. Farmers there cannot afford the seed. These seeds are not being sold. These seeds are being distributed freely through traditional kinds of certification groups  so it is very important in less developed countries that the seed be freely available. CA  Wouldn't some activists say that this is actually part of the conspiracy  This is the heroin strategy. You seed the stuff  and people have no choice but to be hooked on these seeds forever  PR  There are a lot of conspiracy theories for sure  but it doesn't work that way. For example  the seed that's being distributed  the flood tolerant rice  this is distributed freely through Indian and Bangladeshi seed certification agencies  so there's no commercial interest at all. The golden rice was developed through support of the Rockefeller Foundation. Again  it's being freely distributed. There are no commercial profits in this situation. And now to address your other question about  well  mixing genes  aren't there some unintended consequences  Absolutely    every time we do something different  there's an unintended consequence  but one of the points I was trying to make is that we've been doing kind of crazy things to our plants  mutagenesis using radiation or chemical mutagenesis. This induces thousands of uncharacterized mutations  and this is even a higher risk of unintended consequence than many of the modern methods. And so it's really important not to use the term GMO because it's scientifically meaningless. I feel it's very important to talk about a specific crop and a specific product  and think about the needs of the consumer. CA  So part of what's happening here is that there's a mental model in a lot of people that nature is nature  and it's pure and pristine  and to tinker with it is Frankensteinian. It's making something that's pure dangerous in some way  and I think you're saying that that whole model just misunderstands how nature is. Nature is a much more chaotic interplay of genetic changes that have been happening all the time anyway. PR  That's absolutely true  and there's no such thing as pure food. I mean  you could not spray eggplant with insecticides or not genetically engineer it  but then you'd be stuck eating frass. So there's no purity there. CA  Pam Ronald  thank you.  That was powerfully argued. PR  Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Most of us think of motion as a very visual thing. If I walk across this stage or gesture with my hands while I speak  that motion is something that you can see. But there's a world of important motion that's too subtle for the human eye  and over the past few years  we've started to find that cameras can often see this motion even when humans can't. So let me show you what I mean. On the left here  you see video of a person's wrist  and on the right  you see video of a sleeping infant  but if I didn't tell you that these were videos  you might assume that you were looking at two regular images  because in both cases  these videos appear to be almost completely still. But there's actually a lot of subtle motion going on here  and if you were to touch the wrist on the left  you would feel a pulse  and if you were to hold the infant on the right  you would feel the rise and fall of her chest as she took each breath. And these motions carry a lot of significance  but they're usually too subtle for us to see  so instead  we have to observe them through direct contact  through touch. But a few years ago  my colleagues at MIT developed what they call a motion microscope  which is software that finds these subtle motions in video and amplifies them so that they become large enough for us to see. And so  if we use their software on the left video  it lets us see the pulse in this wrist  and if we were to count that pulse  we could even figure out this person's heart rate. And if we used the same software on the right video  it lets us see each breath that this infant takes  and we can use this as a contact free way to monitor her breathing. And so this technology is really powerful because it takes these phenomena that we normally have to experience through touch and it lets us capture them visually and non invasively. So a couple years ago  I started working with the folks that created that software  and we decided to pursue a crazy idea. We thought  it's cool that we can use software to visualize tiny motions like this  and you can almost think of it as a way to extend our sense of touch. But what if we could do the same thing with our ability to hear  What if we could use video to capture the vibrations of sound  which are just another kind of motion  and turn everything that we see into a microphone  Now  this is a bit of a strange idea  so let me try to put it in perspective for you. Traditional microphones work by converting the motion of an internal diaphragm into an electrical signal  and that diaphragm is designed to move readily with sound so that its motion can be recorded and interpreted as audio. But sound causes all objects to vibrate. Those vibrations are just usually too subtle and too fast for us to see. So what if we record them with a high speed camera and then use software to extract tiny motions from our high speed video  and analyze those motions to figure out what sounds created them  This would let us turn visible objects into visual microphones from a distance. And so we tried this out  and here's one of our experiments  where we took this potted plant that you see on the right and we filmed it with a high speed camera while a nearby loudspeaker played this sound. And so here's the video that we recorded  and we recorded it at thousands of frames per second  but even if you look very closely  all you'll see are some leaves that are pretty much just sitting there doing nothing  because our sound only moved those leaves by about a micrometer. That's one ten thousandth of a centimeter  which spans somewhere between a hundredth and a thousandth of a pixel in this image. So you can squint all you want  but motion that small is pretty much perceptually invisible. But it turns out that something can be perceptually invisible and still be numerically significant  because with the right algorithms  we can take this silent  seemingly still video and we can recover this sound. So how is this possible  How can we get so much information out of so little motion  Well  let's say that those leaves move by just a single micrometer  and let's say that that shifts our image by just a thousandth of a pixel. That may not seem like much  but a single frame of video may have hundreds of thousands of pixels in it  and so if we combine all of the tiny motions that we see from across that entire image  then suddenly a thousandth of a pixel can start to add up to something pretty significant. On a personal note  we were pretty psyched when we figured this out. But even with the right algorithm  we were still missing a pretty important piece of the puzzle. You see  there are a lot of factors that affect when and how well this technique will work. There's the object and how far away it is  there's the camera and the lens that you use  how much light is shining on the object and how loud your sound is. And even with the right algorithm  we had to be very careful with our early experiments  because if we got any of these factors wrong  there was no way to tell what the problem was. We would just get noise back. And so a lot of our early experiments looked like this. And so here I am  and on the bottom left  you can kind of see our high speed camera  which is pointed at a bag of chips  and the whole thing is lit by these bright lamps. And like I said  we had to be very careful in these early experiments  so this is how it went down. Mary had a little lamb  Little lamb  Little lamb  AD  So this experiment looks completely ridiculous. I mean  I'm screaming at a bag of chips    and we're blasting it with so much light  we literally melted the first bag we tried this on.  Laughter  But ridiculous as this experiment looks  it was actually really important  because we were able to recover this sound. AD  And this was really significant  because it was the first time we recovered intelligible human speech from silent video of an object. And so it gave us this point of reference  and gradually we could start to modify the experiment  using different objects or moving the object further away  using less light or quieter sounds. And we analyzed all of these experiments until we really understood the limits of our technique  because once we understood those limits  we could figure out how to push them. And that led to experiments like this one  where again  I'm going to speak to a bag of chips  but this time we've moved our camera about    feet away  outside  behind a soundproof window  and the whole thing is lit by only natural sunlight. And so here's the video that we captured. And this is what things sounded like from inside  next to the bag of chips. and everywhere that Mary went  that lamb was sure to go. AD  And here's what we were able to recover from our silent video captured outside behind that window. and everywhere that Mary went  that lamb was sure to go. AD  And there are other ways that we can push these limits as well. So here's a quieter experiment where we filmed some earphones plugged into a laptop computer  and in this case  our goal was to recover the music that was playing on that laptop from just silent video of these two little plastic earphones  and we were able to do this so well that I could even Shazam our results. And we can also push things by changing the hardware that we use. Because the experiments I've shown you so far were done with a camera  a high speed camera  that can record video about a     times faster than most cell phones  but we've also found a way to use this technique with more regular cameras  and we do that by taking advantage of what's called a rolling shutter. You see  most cameras record images one row at a time  and so if an object moves during the recording of a single image  there's a slight time delay between each row  and this causes slight artifacts that get coded into each frame of a video. And so what we found is that by analyzing these artifacts  we can actually recover sound using a modified version of our algorithm. So here's an experiment we did where we filmed a bag of candy while a nearby loudspeaker played the same  Mary Had a Little Lamb  music from before  but this time  we used just a regular store bought camera  and so in a second  I'll play for you the sound that we recovered  and it's going to sound distorted this time  but listen and see if you can still recognize the music. And so  again  that sounds distorted  but what's really amazing here is that we were able to do this with something that you could literally run out and pick up at a Best Buy. So at this point  a lot of people see this work  and they immediately think about surveillance. And to be fair  it's not hard to imagine how you might use this technology to spy on someone. But keep in mind that there's already a lot of very mature technology out there for surveillance. In fact  people have been using lasers to eavesdrop on objects from a distance for decades. But what's really new here  what's really different  is that now we have a way to picture the vibrations of an object  which gives us a new lens through which to look at the world  and we can use that lens to learn not just about forces like sound that cause an object to vibrate  but also about the object itself. And so I want to take a step back and think about how that might change the ways that we use video  because we usually use video to look at things  and I've just shown you how we can use it to listen to things. But there's another important way that we learn about the world  that's by interacting with it. We push and pull and poke and prod things. We shake things and see what happens. And that's something that video still won't let us do  at least not traditionally. So I want to show you some new work  and this is based on an idea I had just a few months ago  so this is actually the first time I've shown it to a public audience. And the basic idea is that we're going to use the vibrations in a video to capture objects in a way that will let us interact with them and see how they react to us. So here's an object  and in this case  it's a wire figure in the shape of a human  and we're going to film that object with just a regular camera. So there's nothing special about this camera. In fact  I've actually done this with my cell phone before. But we do want to see the object vibrate  so to make that happen  we're just going to bang a little bit on the surface where it's resting while we record this video. So that's it  just five seconds of regular video  while we bang on this surface  and we're going to use the vibrations in that video to learn about the structural and material properties of our object  and we're going to use that information to create something new and interactive. And so here's what we've created. And it looks like a regular image  but this isn't an image  and it's not a video  because now I can take my mouse and I can start interacting with the object. And so what you see here is a simulation of how this object would respond to new forces that we've never seen before  and we created it from just five seconds of regular video. And so this is a really powerful way to look at the world  because it lets us predict how objects will respond to new situations  and you could imagine  for instance  looking at an old bridge and wondering what would happen  how would that bridge hold up if I were to drive my car across it. And that's a question that you probably want to answer before you start driving across that bridge. And of course  there are going to be limitations to this technique  just like there were with the visual microphone  but we found that it works in a lot of situations that you might not expect  especially if you give it longer videos. So for example  here's a video that I captured of a bush outside of my apartment  and I didn't do anything to this bush  but by capturing a minute long video  a gentle breeze caused enough vibrations that we could learn enough about this bush to create this simulation. And so you could imagine giving this to a film director  and letting him control  say  the strength and direction of wind in a shot after it's been recorded. Or  in this case  we pointed our camera at a hanging curtain  and you can't even see any motion in this video  but by recording a two minute long video  natural air currents in this room created enough subtle  imperceptible motions and vibrations that we could learn enough to create this simulation. And ironically  we're kind of used to having this kind of interactivity when it comes to virtual objects  when it comes to video games and  D models  but to be able to capture this information from real objects in the real world using just simple  regular video  is something new that has a lot of potential. So here are the amazing people who worked with me on these projects. And what I've shown you today is only the beginning. We've just started to scratch the surface of what you can do with this kind of imaging  because it gives us a new way to capture our surroundings with common  accessible technology. And so looking to the future  it's going to be really exciting to explore what this can tell us about the world. Thank you. You may not realize this  but there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy. This fascinating universe of bacteria inside of us is an integral part of our health  and our technology is evolving so rapidly that today we can program these bacteria like we program computers. Now  the diagram that you see here  I know it looks like some kind of sports play  but it is actually a blueprint of the first bacterial program I developed. And like writing software  we can print and write DNA into different algorithms and programs inside of bacteria. What this program does is produces fluorescent proteins in a rhythmic fashion and generates a small molecule that allows bacteria to communicate and synchronize  as you're seeing in this movie. The growing colony of bacteria that you see here is about the width of a human hair. Now  what you can't see is that our genetic program instructs these bacteria to each produce small molecules  and these molecules travel between the thousands of individual bacteria telling them when to turn on and off. And the bacteria synchronize quite well at this scale  but because the molecule that synchronizes them together can only travel so fast  in larger colonies of bacteria  this results in traveling waves between bacteria that are far away from each other  and you can see these waves going from right to left across the screen. Now  our genetic program relies on a natural phenomenon called quorum sensing  in which bacteria trigger coordinated and sometimes virulent behaviors once they reach a critical density. You can observe quorum sensing in action in this movie  where a growing colony of bacteria only begins to glow once it reaches a high or critical density. Our genetic program continues producing these rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins as the colony grows outwards. This particular movie and experiment we call The Supernova  because it looks like an exploding star. Now  besides programming these beautiful patterns  I wondered  what else can we get these bacteria to do  And I decided to explore how we can program bacteria to detect and treat diseases in our bodies like cancer. One of the surprising facts about bacteria is that they can naturally grow inside of tumors. This happens because typically tumors are areas where the immune system has no access  and so bacteria find these tumors and use them as a safe haven to grow and thrive. We started using probiotic bacteria which are safe bacteria that have a health benefit  and found that when orally delivered to mice  these probiotics would selectively grow inside of liver tumors. We realized that the most convenient way to highlight the presence of the probiotics  and hence  the presence of the tumors  was to get these bacteria to produce a signal that would be detectable in the urine  and so we specifically programmed these probiotics to make a molecule that would change the color of your urine to indicate the presence of cancer. We went on to show that this technology could sensitively and specifically detect liver cancer  one that is challenging to detect otherwise. Now  since these bacteria specifically localize to tumors  we've been programming them to not only detect cancer but also to treat cancer by producing therapeutic molecules from within the tumor environment that shrink the existing tumors  and we've been doing this using quorum sensing programs like you saw in the previous movies. Altogether  imagine in the future taking a programmed probiotic that could detect and treat cancer  or even other diseases. Our ability to program bacteria and program life opens up new horizons in cancer research  and to share this vision  I worked with artist Vik Muniz to create the symbol of the universe  made entirely out of bacteria or cancer cells. Ultimately  my hope is that the beauty and purpose of this microscopic universe can inspire new and creative approaches for the future of cancer research. Thank you. In June of       Tori Murden McClure left Nags Head  North Carolina for France. That's her boat  the American Pearl. It's    feet long and just six feet across at its widest point. The deck was the size of a cargo bed of a Ford F     pickup truck. Tori and her friends built it by hand  and it weighed about       pounds. Her plan was to row it alone across the Atlantic Ocean    no motor  no sail    something no woman and no American had ever done before. This would be her route  over       miles across the open North Atlantic Ocean. Professionally  Tori worked as a project administrator for the city of Louisville  Kentucky  her hometown  but her real passion was exploring. This was not her first big expedition. Several years earlier  she'd become the first woman to ski to the South Pole. She was an accomplished rower in college  even competed for a spot on the      U.S. Olympic team  but this  this was different. Sector time   a.m. So that's Kentucky time now. Dawn Landes  Tori made these videos as she rowed. This is her   st day at sea. At this point  she'd covered over       miles  had had no radio contact in more than two weeks following a storm that disabled all her long range communications systems just five days in. Most days looked like this. At this point  she'd rowed over         strokes  fighting the current and the wind. Some days  she traveled as little as    feet. Yeah. And as frustrating as those days were  other days were like this. DL  She saw fish  dolphins  whales  sharks  and even some sea turtles. After two weeks with no human contact  Tori was able to contact a local cargo ship via VHF radio. Man  Heading up to a low ahead of you but it's heading  and you're obviously going northeast and there's a high behind us. That'd be coming east northeast also. TMM  Good. DL  She's pretty happy to talk to another human at this point. is going to happen soon. DL  What the weather report didn't tell her was that she was rowing right into the path of Hurricane Danielle in the worst hurricane season on record in the North Atlantic. There's a very strong wind from the east now. It's blowing about. It's blowing  After    days of storm I get to row for four hours without a flagging wind. I'm not very happy right now. As happy as I was this morning  I am unhappy now  so ... DL  After nearly three months at sea  she'd covered over       miles. She was two thirds of the way there  but in the storm  the waves were the size of a seven story building. Her boat kept capsizing. Some of them were pitchpole capsizes  flipping her end over end  and rowing became impossible. I'm in something big  bad and ugly. Two capsizes. Last capsize  I took the rib off the top of my ceiling with my back. I've had about six capsizes now. The last one was a pitchpole. I have the Argus beacon with me. I would set off the distress signal  but quite frankly  I don't think they'd ever be able to find this little boat. It's so far underwater right now  the only part that's showing pretty much is the cabin. It's about    a.m. I've lost track of the number of capsizes. I seem to capsize about every    minutes. I think I may have broken my left arm. The waves are tearing the boat to shreds. I keep praying because I'm not sure I'm going to make it through this. DL  Tori set off her distress beacon and was rescued by a passing container ship. They found her abandoned boat two months later adrift near France. I read about it in the newspaper. In       I was a high school student living in Louisville  Kentucky. Now  I live in New York City. I'm a songwriter. And her bravery stuck with me  and I'm adapting her story into a musical called  Row.  When Tori returned home  she was feeling disheartened  she was broke. She was having a hard time making the transition back into civilization. In this scene  she sits at home. The phone is ringing  her friends are calling  but she doesn't know how to talk to them. She sings this song. It's called  Dear Heart.  When I was dreaming  I took my body to beautiful places I'd never been. I saw Gibraltar  and stars of Kentucky burned in the moonlight  making me smile. And when I awoke here  the sky was so cloudy. I walked to a party where people I know try hard to know me and ask where I've been  but I can't explain what I've seen to them. Ah  listen  dear heart. Just pay attention  go right from the start. Ah  listen  dear heart. You can fall off the map  but don't fall apart. Ooh ooh ooh  ah ah ah ah ah. Ah ah  ah ah ah. When I was out there  the ocean would hold me  rock me and throw me  light as a child. But now I'm so heavy  nothing consoles me. My mind floats like driftwood  wayward and wild. Ah  listen  dear heart. Just pay attention  go right from the start. Ah  listen  dear heart. You can fall off the map  but don't fall apart. Ooh. Eventually  Tori starts to get her feet under her. She starts hanging out with her friends again. She meets a guy and falls in love for the first time. She gets a new job working for another Louisville native  Muhammad Ali. One day  at lunch with her new boss  Tori shares the news that two other women are setting out to row across the mid Atlantic  to do something that she almost died trying to do. His response was classic Ali   You don't want to go through life as the woman who almost rowed across the ocean.  He was right. Tori rebuilt the American Pearl  and in December of       she did it. Thank you. These bees are in my backyard in Berkeley  California. Until last year  I'd never kept bees before  but National Geographic asked me to photograph a story about them  and I decided  to be able to take compelling images  I should start keeping bees myself. And as you may know  bees pollinate one third of our food crops  and lately they've been having a really hard time. So as a photographer  I wanted to explore what this problem really looks like. So I'm going to show you what I found over the last year. This furry little creature is a fresh young bee halfway emerged from its brood cell  and bees right now are dealing with several different problems  including pesticides  diseases  and habitat loss  but the single greatest threat is a parasitic mite from Asia  Varroa destructor. And this pinhead sized mite crawls onto young bees and sucks their blood. This eventually destroys a hive because it weakens the immune system of the bees  and it makes them more vulnerable to stress and disease. Now  bees are the most sensitive when they're developing inside their brood cells  and I wanted to know what that process really looks like  so I teamed up with a bee lab at U.C. Davis and figured out how to raise bees in front of a camera. I'm going to show you the first    days of a bee's life condensed into    seconds. This is a bee egg as it hatches into a larva  and those newly hatched larvae swim around their cells feeding on this white goo that nurse bees secrete for them. Then  their head and their legs slowly differentiate as they transform into pupae. Here's that same pupation process  and you can actually see the mites running around in the cells. Then the tissue in their body reorganizes and the pigment slowly develops in their eyes. The last step of the process is their skin shrivels up and they sprout hair. So     Applause  As you can see halfway through that video  the mites were running around on the baby bees  and the way that beekeepers typically manage these mites is they treat their hives with chemicals. In the long run  that's bad news  so researchers are working on finding alternatives to control these mites. This is one of those alternatives. It's an experimental breeding program at the USDA Bee Lab in Baton Rouge  and this queen and her attendant bees are part of that program. Now  the researchers figured out that some of the bees have a natural ability to fight mites  so they set out to breed a line of mite resistant bees. This is what it takes to breed bees in a lab. The virgin queen is sedated and then artificially inseminated using this precision instrument. Now  this procedure allows the researchers to control exactly which bees are being crossed  but there's a tradeoff in having this much control. They succeeded in breeding mite resistant bees  but in that process  those bees started to lose traits like their gentleness and their ability to store honey  so to overcome that problem  these researchers are now collaborating with commercial beekeepers. This is Bret Adee opening one of his        beehives. He and his brother run the largest beekeeping operation in the world  and the USDA is integrating their mite resistant bees into his operation with the hope that over time  they'll be able to select the bees that are not only mite resistant but also retain all of these qualities that make them useful to us. And to say it like that makes it sound like we're manipulating and exploiting bees  and the truth is  we've been doing that for thousands of years. We took this wild creature and put it inside of a box  practically domesticating it  and originally that was so that we could harvest their honey  but over time we started losing our native pollinators  our wild pollinators  and there are many places now where those wild pollinators can no longer meet the pollination demands of our agriculture  so these managed bees have become an integral part of our food system. So when people talk about saving bees  my interpretation of that is we need to save our relationship to bees  and in order to design new solutions  we have to understand the basic biology of bees and understand the effects of stressors that we sometimes cannot see. In other words  we have to understand bees up close. Thank you. When I was nine years old  my mom asked me what I would want my house to look like  and I drew this fairy mushroom. And then she actually built it. I don't think I realized this was so unusual at the time  and maybe I still haven't  because I'm still designing houses. This is a six story bespoke home on the island of Bali. It's built almost entirely from bamboo. The living room overlooks the valley from the fourth floor. You enter the house by a bridge. It can get hot in the tropics  so we make big curving roofs to catch the breezes. But some rooms have tall windows to keep the air conditioning in and the bugs out. This room we left open. We made an air conditioned  tented bed. And one client wanted a TV room in the corner of her living room. Boxing off an area with tall walls just didn't feel right  so instead  we made this giant woven pod. Now  we do have all the necessary luxuries  like bathrooms. This one is a basket in the corner of the living room  and I've got tell you  some people actually hesitate to use it. We have not quite figured out our acoustic insulation. So there are lots of things that we're still working on  but one thing I have learned is that bamboo will treat you well if you use it right. It's actually a wild grass. It grows on otherwise unproductive land    deep ravines  mountainsides. It lives off of rainwater  spring water  sunlight  and of the       species of bamboo that grow across the world  we use just seven of them. That's my dad. He's the one who got me building with bamboo  and he is standing in a clump of Dendrocalamus asper niger that he planted just seven years ago. Each year  it sends up a new generation of shoots. That shoot  we watched it grow a meter in three days just last week  so we're talking about sustainable timber in three years. Now  we harvest from hundreds of family owned clumps. Betung  as we call it  it's really long  up to    meters of usable length. Try getting that truck down the mountain. And it's strong  it has the tensile strength of steel  the compressive strength of concrete. Slam four tons straight down on a pole  and it can take it. Because it's hollow  it's lightweight  light enough to be lifted by just a few men  or  apparently  one woman. And when my father built Green School in Bali  he chose bamboo for all of the buildings on campus  because he saw it as a promise. It's a promise to the kids. It's one sustainable material that they will not run out of. And when I first saw these structures under construction about six years ago  I just thought  this makes perfect sense. It is growing all around us. It's strong. It's elegant. It's earthquake resistant. Why hasn't this happened sooner  and what can we do with it next  So along with some of the original builders of Green School  I founded Ibuku. Ibu means  mother   and ku means  mine   so it represents my Mother Earth  and at Ibuku  we are a team of artisans  architects and designers  and what we're doing together is creating a new way of building. Over the past five years together  we have built over    unique structures  most of them in Bali. Nine of them are at Green Village    you've just seen inside some of these homes    and we fill them with bespoke furniture  we surround them with veggie gardens  we would love to invite you all to come visit someday. And while you're there  you can also see Green School    we keep building classrooms there each year    as well as an updated fairy mushroom house. We're also working on a little house for export. This is a traditional Sumbanese home that we replicated  right down to the details and textiles. A restaurant with an open air kitchen. It looks a lot like a kitchen  right  And a bridge that spans    meters across a river. Now  what we're doing  it's not entirely new. From little huts to elaborate bridges like this one in Java  bamboo has been in use across the tropical regions of the world for literally tens of thousands of years. There are islands and even continents that were first reached by bamboo rafts. But until recently  it was almost impossible to reliably protect bamboo from insects  and so  just about everything that was ever built out of bamboo is gone. Unprotected bamboo weathers. Untreated bamboo gets eaten to dust. And so that's why most people  especially in Asia  think that you couldn't be poor enough or rural enough to actually want to live in a bamboo house. And so we thought  what will it take to change their minds  to convince people that bamboo is worth building with  much less worth aspiring to  First  we needed safe treatment solutions. Borax is a natural salt. It turns bamboo into a viable building material. Treat it properly  design it carefully  and a bamboo structure can last a lifetime. Second  build something extraordinary out of it. Inspire people. Fortunately  Balinese culture fosters craftsmanship. It values the artisan. So combine those with the adventurous outliers from new generations of locally trained architects and designers and engineers  and always remember that you are designing for curving  tapering  hollow poles. No two poles alike  no straight lines  no two by fours here. The tried and true  well crafted formulas and vocabulary of architecture do not apply here. We have had to invent our own rules. We ask the bamboo what it's good at  what it wants to become  and what it says is  respect it  design for its strengths  protect it from water  and to make the most of its curves. So we design in real  D  making scale structural models out of the same material that we'll later use to build the house. And bamboo model making  it's an art  as well as some hardcore engineering. So that's the blueprint of the house. And we bring it to site  and with tiny rulers  we measure each pole  and consider each curve  and we choose a piece of bamboo from the pile to replicate that house on site. When it comes down to the details  we consider everything. Why are doors so often rectangular  Why not round  How could you make a door better  Well  its hinges battle with gravity  and gravity will always win in the end  so why not have it pivot on the center where it can stay balanced  And while you're at it  why not doors shaped like teardrops  To reap the selective benefits and work within the constraints of this material  we have really had to push ourselves  and within that constraint  we have found space for something new. It's a challenge  how do you make a ceiling if you don't have any flat boards to work with  Let me tell you  sometimes I dream of sheet rock and plywood. But if what you've got is skilled craftsmen and itsy bitsy little splits  weave that ceiling together  stretch a canvas over it  lacquer it. How do you design durable kitchen countertops that do justice to this curving structure you've just built  Slice up a boulder like a loaf of bread  hand carve each to fit the other  leave the crusts on  and what we're doing  it is almost entirely handmade. The structural connections of our buildings are reinforced by steel joints  but we use a lot of hand whittled bamboo pins. There are thousands of pins in each floor. This floor is made of glossy and durable bamboo skin. You can feel the texture under bare feet. And the floor that you walk on  can it affect the way that you walk  Can it change the footprint that you'll ultimately leave on the world  I remember being nine years old and feeling wonder  and possibility  and a little bit of idealism. And we've got a really long way to go  there's a lot left to learn  but one thing I know is that with creativity and commitment  you can create beauty and comfort and safety and even luxury out of a material that will grow back. Thank you. I know what you're thinking   Why does that guy get to sit down   That's because this is radio. I tell radio stories about design  and I report on all kinds of stories  buildings and toothbrushes and mascots and wayfinding and fonts. My mission is to get people to engage with the design that they care about so they begin to pay attention to all forms of design. When you decode the world with design intent in mind  the world becomes kind of magical. Instead of seeing the broken things  you see all the little bits of genius that anonymous designers have sweated over to make our lives better. And that's essentially the definition of design  making life better and providing joy. And few things give me greater joy than a well designed flag. Yeah  Happy   th anniversary on your flag  Canada. It is beautiful  gold standard. Love it. I'm kind of obsessed with flags. Sometimes I bring up the topic of flags  and people are like   I don't care about flags   and then we start talking about flags  and trust me      percent of people care about flags. There's just something about them that works on our emotions. My family wrapped my Christmas presents as flags this year  including the blue gift bag that's dressed up as the flag of Scotland. I put this picture online  and sure enough  within the first few minutes  someone left a comment that said   You can take that Scottish Saltire and shove it up your ass.   Laughter  Which    see  people are passionate about flags  you know  That's the way it is. What I love about flags is that once you understand the design of flags  what makes a good flag  what makes a bad flag  you can understand the design of almost anything. So what I'm going to do here is  I cracked open an episode of my radio show       Invisible   and I'm going to reconstruct it here on stage  so when I press a button over here    Voice  S for Sound    Roman Mars  It's going to make a sound  and so whenever you hear a sound or a voice or a piece of music  it's because I pressed a button. Voice  Sssssound. RM  All right  got it  Here we go. Three  two. This is     Invisible. I'm Roman Mars. Narrator  The five basic principles of flag design. Roman Mars  According to the North American Vexillological Association. Vexillological. Ted Kaye  Vexillology is the study of flags. RM  It's that extra  lol  that makes it sound weird. Narrator  Number one  keep it simple. The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory. RM  Before I moved to Chicago in       I didn't even know cities had their own flags. TK  Most larger cities do have flags. RM  Well  I didn't know that. That's Ted Kaye  by the way. TK  Hello. RM  He's a flag expert. He's a totally awesome guy. TK  I'm Ted Kaye. I have edited a scholarly journal on flag studies  and I am currently involved with the Portland Flag Association and the North American Vexillological Association. RM  Ted literally wrote the book on flag design. Narrator   Good Flag  Bad Flag.  RM  It's more of a pamphlet  really. It's about    pages. TK  Yes  it's called  Good Flag  Bad Flag  How to Design a Great Flag.  RM  And that first city flag I discovered in Chicago is a beaut  white field  two horizontal blue stripes  and four six pointed red stars down the middle. Narrator  Number two  use meaningful symbolism. TK  The blue stripes represent the water  the river and the lake. Narrator  The flag's images  colors or pattern should relate to what it symbolizes. TK  The red stars represent significant events in Chicago's history. RM  Namely  the founding of Fort Dearborn on the future site of Chicago  the Great Chicago Fire  the World Columbian Exposition  which everyone remembers because of the White City  and the Century of Progress Exposition  which no one remembers at all. Narrator  Number three  use two to three basic colors. TK  The basic rule for colors is to use two to three colors from the standard color set  red  white  blue  green  yellow and black. RM  The design of the Chicago flag has complete buy in with an entire cross section of the city. It is everywhere  every municipal building flies the flag. Whet Moser  Like  there's probably at least one store on every block near where I work that sells some sort of Chicago flag paraphernalia. RM  That's Whet Moser from Chicago magazine. WM  Today  just for example  I went to get a haircut  and when I sat down in the barber's chair  there was a Chicago flag on the box that the barber kept all his tools in  and then in the mirror there was a Chicago flag on the wall behind me. When I left  a guy passed me who had a Chicago flag badge on his backpack. RM  It's adaptable and remixable. The six pointed stars in particular show up in all kinds of places. WM  The coffee I bought the other day had a Chicago star on it. RM  It's a distinct symbol of Chicago pride. TK  When a police officer or a firefighter dies in Chicago  often it's not the flag of the  United States on his casket. It can be the flag of the city of Chicago. That's how deeply the flag has gotten into the civic imagery of Chicago. RM  And it isn't just that people love Chicago and therefore love the flag. I also think that people love Chicago more because the flag is so cool. TK  A positive feedback loop there between great symbolism and civic pride. RM  Okay. So when I moved back to San Francisco in       I researched its flag  because I had never seen it in the previous eight years I lived there. And I found it  I am sorry to say  sadly lacking. I know. It hurts me  too. TK  Well  let me start from the top. Narrator  Number one  keep it simple. TK  Keeping it simple. Narrator  The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory. TK  It's a relatively complex flag. RM  Okay  here we go. Okay. The main component of the San Francisco flag is a phoenix representing the city rising from the ashes after the devastating fires of the     s. TK  A powerful symbol for San Francisco. RM  I still don't really dig the phoenix. Design wise  it manages to both be too crude and have too many details at the same time  which if you were trying for that  you wouldn't be able to do it  and it just looks bad at a distance  but having deep meaning puts that element in the plus column. Behind the phoenix  the background is mostly white  and then it has a substantial gold border around it. TK  Which is a very attractive design element. RM  I think it's okay. But     Laughter     here come the big no nos of flag design. Narrator  Number four  no lettering or seals. Never use writing of any kind. RM  Underneath the phoenix  there's a motto on a ribbon that translates to  Gold in peace  iron in war   plus    and this is the big problem    it says San Francisco across the bottom. TK  If you need to write the name of what you're representing on your flag  your symbolism has failed. RM  The United States flag doesn't say  USA  across the front. In fact  country flags  they tend to behave. Like  hats off to South Africa and Turkey and Israel and Somalia and Japan and Gambia. There's a bunch of really great country flags  but they obey good design principles because the stakes are high. They're on the international stage. But city  state and regional flags are another story. There is a scourge of bad flags  and they must be stopped. That is the truth and that is the dare. The first step is to recognize that we have a problem. A lot of people tend to think that good design is just a matter of taste  and quite honestly  sometimes it is  actually  but sometimes it isn't  all right  Here's the full list of NAVA flag design principles. Narrator  The five basic principles of flag design. Number one. TK  Keep it simple. Narrator  Number two. TK  Use meaningful symbolism. Narrator  Number three. TK  Use two to three basic colors. Narrator  Number four. TK  No lettering or seals. Narrator  Never use writing of any kind. TK  Because you can't read that at a distance. Narrator  Number five. TK  And be distinctive. RM  All the best flags tend to stick to these principles. And like I said before  most country flags are okay. But here's the thing  if you showed this list of principles to any designer of almost anything  they would say these principles    simplicity  deep meaning  having few colors or being thoughtful about colors  uniqueness  don't have  writing you can't read    all those principles apply to them  too. But sadly  good design principles are rarely invoked in U.S. city flags. Our biggest problem seems to be that fourth one. We just can't stop ourselves from putting our names on our flags  or little municipal seals with tiny writing on them. Here's the thing about municipal seals  They were designed to be on pieces of paper where you can read them  not on flags     feet away flapping in the breeze. So here's a bunch of flags again. Vexillologists call these SOBs  seals on a bedsheet     Laughter     and if you can't tell what city they go to  yeah  that's exactly the problem  except for Anaheim  apparently. They fixed it.  Laughter  These flags are everywhere in the U.S. The European equivalent of the municipal seal is the city coat of arms  and this is where we can learn a lesson for how to do things right. So this is the city coat of arms of Amsterdam. Now  if this were a United States city  the flag would probably look like this. You know  yeah.  Laughter  But instead  the flag of Amsterdam looks like this. Rather than plopping the whole coat of arms on a solid background and writing  Amsterdam  below it  they just take the key elements of the escutcheon  the shield  and they turn it into the most badass city flag in the world. And because it's so badass  those flags and crosses are found throughout Amsterdam  just like Chicago  they're used. Even though seal on a bedsheet flags are particularly painful and offensive to me  nothing can quite prepare you for one of the biggest train wrecks in vexillological history. Are you ready  It's the flag of Milwaukee  Wisconsin. I mean  it's distinctive  I'll give them that. Steve Kodis  It was adopted in     . RM  The city ran a contest and gathered a bunch of submissions with all kinds of designs. SK  And an alderman by the name of Fred Steffan cobbled together parts of the submissions to make what is now the Milwaukee flag. RM  It's a kitchen sink flag. There's a gigantic gear representing industry  there's a ship recognizing the port  a giant stalk of wheat paying homage to the brewing industry. It's a hot mess  and Steve Kodis  a graphic designer from Milwaukee  wants to change it. SK  It's really awful. It's a misstep on the city's behalf  to say the least. RM  But what puts the Milwaukee flag over the top  almost to the point of self parody  is on it is a picture of the Civil War battle flag of the Milwaukee regiment. SK  So that's the final element in it that just makes it that much more ridiculous  that there is a flag design within the Milwaukee flag. RM  On the flag. Yeah. Yeah.  Laughter  Yeah. Now  Milwaukee is a fantastic city. I've been there. I love it. The most depressing part of this flag  though  is that there have been two major redesign contests. The last one was held in     . One hundred and five entries were received. TK  But in the end  the members of the Milwaukee Arts Board decided that none of the new entries were worthy of flying over the city. RM  They couldn't agree to change that thing   Laughter  That's discouraging enough  to make you think that good design and democracy just simply do not go together. But Steve Kotas is going to try one more time to redesign the Milwaukee flag. SK  I believe Milwaukee is a great city. Every great city deserves a great flag. RM  Steve isn't ready to reveal his design yet. One of the things about proposing one of these things is you have to get people on board  and then you reveal your design. But here's the trick  If you want to design a great flag  a kickass flag like Chicago's or D.C.'s  which also has a great flag  start by drawing a one by one and a half  inch rectangle on a piece of paper. Your design has to fit within that tiny rectangle. Here's why. TK  A three by five foot flag on a pole     feet away looks about the same size as a one by one and a half inch rectangle seen about    inches from your eye. You'd be surprised by how compelling and simple the design can be when you hold yourself to that limitation. RM  Meanwhile  back in San Francisco. Is there anything we can do  TK  I like to say that in every bad flag there's a good flag trying to get out.  Laughter  The way to make  San Francisco's flag a good flag is to take the motto off because you can't read that at a distance. Take the name off  and the border might even be made thicker  so it's more a part of the flag. And I would simply take the phoenix and make it a great big element in the middle of the flag. RM  But the current phoenix  that's got to go. TK  I would simplify or stylize the phoenix. Depict a big  wide winged bird coming out of flames. Emphasize those flames. RM  So this San Francisco flag was designed by Frank Chimero based on Ted Kaye's suggestions. I don't know what he would do if we was completely unfettered and didn't follow those guidelines. Fans of my radio show and podcast  they've heard me complain about bad flags. They've sent me other suggested designs. This one's by Neil Mussett. Both are so much better. And I think if they were adopted  I would see them around the city. In my crusade to make flags of the world more beautiful  many listeners have taken it upon themselves to redesign their flags and look into the feasibility of getting them officially adopted. If you see your city flag and like it  fly it  even if it violates  a design rule or two. I don't care. But if you don't see your city flag  maybe it doesn't exist  but maybe it does  and it just sucks  and I dare you to join the effort to try to change that. As we move more and more into cities  the city flag will become not just a symbol of that city as a place  but also it could become a symbol of how that city considers design itself  especially today  as the populace is becoming more design aware. And I think design awareness is at an all time high. A well designed flag could be seen as an indicator of how a city considers all of its design systems  its public transit  its parks  its signage. It might seem frivolous  but it's not. TK  Often when city leaders say   We have more important things to do than worry about a city flag   my response is   If you had a great city flag  you would have a banner for people to rally under to face those more important things.  RM  I've seen firsthand what a good city flag can do in the case of Chicago. The marriage of good design and civic pride is something that we need in all places. The best part about municipal flags is that we own them. They are an open source  publicly owned design language of the community. When they are done well  they are remixable  adaptable  and they are powerful. We could control the branding and graphical imagery of our cities with a good flag  but instead  by having bad flags we don't use  we cede that territory to sports teams and chambers of commerce and tourism boards. Sports teams can leave and break our hearts. And besides  some of us don't really care about sports. And tourism campaigns can just be cheesy. But a great city flag is something that represents a city to its people and its people to the world at large. And when that flag is a beautiful thing  that connection is a beautiful thing. So maybe all the city flags can be as inspiring as Hong Kong or Portland or Trondheim  and we can do away with all the bad flags like San Francisco  Milwaukee  Cedar Rapids  and finally  when we're all done  we can do something about Pocatello  Idaho  considered by the North American Vexillological Association as the worst city flag in North America. Yeah. That thing has a trademark symbol on it  people.  Laughter  That hurts me just to look at. Thank you so much for listening.   Music by  Melodium   melodiumbox  and Keegan DeWitt   keegandewitt    Dannielle Hadley  Life in Pennsylvania means just that  life without the possibility of parole. For us lifers  as we call ourselves  our only chance for release is through commutation  which has only been granted to two women since       close to    years ago. Our song   This Is Not Our Home   it tells of our experiences while doing life without the possibility of parole. Brenda Watkins  I'm a woman. I'm a grandmother. I'm a daughter. I have a son.

Will I see my family or die alone  Or die alone  Chris Anderson  So I guess what we're going to do is we're going to talk about your life  and using some pictures that you shared with me. And I think we should start right here with this one. Okay  now who is this  Martine Rothblatt  This is me with our oldest son Eli. He was about age five. This is taken in Nigeria right after having taken the Washington  D.C. bar exam. CA  Okay. But this doesn't really look like a Martine. MR  Right. That was myself as a male  the way I was brought up. Before I transitioned from male to female and Martin to Martine. CA  You were brought up Martin Rothblatt. MR  Correct. CA  And about a year after this picture  you married a beautiful woman. Was this love at first sight  What happened there  MR  It was love at the first sight. I saw Bina at a discotheque in Los Angeles  and we later began living together  but the moment I saw her  I saw just an aura of energy around her. I asked her to dance. She said she saw an aura of energy around me. I was a single male parent. She was a single female parent. We showed each other our kids' pictures  and we've been happily married for a third of a century now. CA  And at the time  you were kind of this hotshot entrepreneur  working with satellites. I think you had two successful companies  and then you started addressing this problem of how could you use satellites to revolutionize radio. Tell us about that. MR  Right. I always loved space technology  and satellites  to me  are sort of like the canoes that our ancestors first pushed out into the water. So it was exciting for me to be part of the navigation of the oceans of the sky  and as I developed different types of satellite communication systems  the main thing I did was to launch bigger and more powerful satellites  the consequence of which was that the receiving antennas could be smaller and smaller  and after going through direct television broadcasting  I had the idea that if we could make a more powerful satellite  the receiving dish could be so small that it would just be a section of a parabolic dish  a flat little plate embedded into the roof of an automobile  and it would be possible to have nationwide satellite radio  and that's Sirius XM today. CA  Wow. So who here has used Sirius  MR  Thank you for your monthly subscriptions. CA  So that succeeded despite all predictions at the time. It was a huge commercial success  but soon after this  in the early     s  there was this big transition in your life and you became Martine. MR  Correct. CA  So tell me  how did that happen  MR  It happened in consultation with Bina and our four beautiful children  and I discussed with each of them that I felt my soul was always female  and as a woman  but I was afraid people would laugh at me if I expressed it  so I always kept it bottled up and just showed my male side. And each of them had a different take on this. Bina said   I love your soul  and whether the outside is Martin and Martine  it doesn't it matter to me  I love your soul.  My son said   If you become a woman  will you still be my father   And I said   Yes  I'll always be your father   and I'm still his father today. My youngest daughter did an absolutely brilliant five year old thing. She told people   I love my dad and she loves me.  So she had no problem with a gender blending whatsoever. CA  And a couple years after this  you published this book   The Apartheid of Sex.  What was your thesis in this book  MR  My thesis in this book is that there are seven billion people in the world  and actually  seven billion unique ways to express one's gender. And while people may have the genitals of a male or a female  the genitals don't determine your gender or even really your sexual identity. That's just a matter of anatomy and reproductive tracts  and people could choose whatever gender they want if they weren't forced by society into categories of either male or female the way South Africa used to force people into categories of black or white. We know from anthropological science that race is fiction  even though racism is very  very real  and we now know from cultural studies that separate male or female genders is a constructed fiction. The reality is a gender fluidity that crosses the entire continuum from male to female. CA  You yourself don't always feel     percent female. MR  Correct. I would say in some ways I change my gender about as often as I change my hairstyle. CA   Laughs  Okay  now  this is your gorgeous daughter  Jenesis. And I guess she was about this age when something pretty terrible happened. MR  Yes  she was finding herself unable to walk up the stairs in our house to her bedroom  and after several months of doctors  she was diagnosed to have a rare  almost invariably fatal disease called pulmonary arterial hypertension. CA  So how did you respond to that  MR  Well  we first tried to get her to the best doctors we could. We ended up at Children's National Medical Center in Washington  D.C. The head of pediatric cardiology told us that he was going to refer her to get a lung transplant  but not to hold out any hope  because there are very few lungs available  especially for children. He said that all people with this illness died  and if any of you have seen the film  Lorenzo's Oil   there's a scene when the protagonist kind of rolls down the stairway crying and bemoaning the fate of his son  and that's exactly how we felt about Jenesis. CA  But you didn't accept that as the limit of what you could do. You started trying to research and see if you could find a cure somehow. MR  Correct. She was in the intensive care ward for weeks at a time  and Bina and I would tag team to stay at the hospital while the other watched the rest of the kids  and when I was in the hospital and she was sleeping  I went to the hospital library. I read every article that I could find on pulmonary hypertension. I had not taken any biology  even in college  so I had to go from a biology textbook to a college level textbook and then medical textbook and the journal articles  back and forth  and eventually I knew enough to think that it might be possible that somebody could find a cure. So we started a nonprofit foundation. I wrote a description asking people to submit grants and we would pay for medical research. I became an expert on the condition    doctors said to me  Martine  we really appreciate all the funding you've provided us  but we are not going to be able to find a cure in time to save your daughter. However  there is a medicine that was developed at the Burroughs Wellcome Company that could halt the progression of the disease  but Burroughs Wellcome has just been acquired by Glaxo Wellcome. They made a decision not to develop any medicines for rare and orphan diseases  and maybe you could use your expertise in satellite communications to develop this cure for pulmonary hypertension. CA  So how on earth did you get access to this drug  MR  I went to Glaxo Wellcome and after three times being rejected and having the door slammed in my face because they weren't going to out license the drug to a satellite communications expert  they weren't going to send the drug out to anybody at all  and they thought I didn't have the expertise  finally I was able to persuade a small team of people to work with me and develop enough credibility. I wore down their resistance  and they had no hope this drug would even work  by the way  and they tried to tell me   You're just wasting your time. We're sorry about your daughter.  But finally  for        dollars and agreement to pay    percent of any revenues we might ever get  they agreed to give me worldwide rights to this drug. CA  And so you put this drug on the market in a really brilliant way  by basically charging what it would take to make the economics work. MR  Oh yes  Chris  but this really wasn't a drug that I ended up    after I wrote the check for         and I said   Okay  where's the medicine for Jenesis   they said   Oh  Martine  there's no medicine for Jenesis. This is just something we tried in rats.  And they gave me  like  a little plastic Ziploc bag of a small amount of powder. They said   Don't give it to any human   and they gave me a piece of paper which said it was a patent  and from that  we had to figure out a way to make this medicine. A hundred chemists in the U.S. at the top universities all swore that little patent could never be turned into a medicine. If it was turned into a medicine  it could never be delivered because it had a half life of only    minutes. CA  And yet  a year or two later  you were there with a medicine that worked for Jenesis. MR  Chris  the astonishing thing is that this absolutely worthless piece of powder that had the sparkle of a promise of hope for Jenesis is not only keeping Jenesis and other people alive today  but produces almost a billion and a half dollars a year in revenue. CA  So here you go. So you took this company public  right  And made an absolute fortune. And how much have you paid Glaxo  by the way  after that         MR  Yeah  well  every year we pay them    percent of  .  billion      million dollars  last year     million dollars. It's the best return on investment they ever received.  Laughter  CA  And the best news of all  I guess  is this. MR  Yes. Jenesis is an absolutely brilliant young lady. She's alive  healthy today at   . You see me  Bina and Jenesis there. The most amazing thing about Jenesis is that while she could do anything with her life  and believe me  if you grew up your whole life with people in your face saying that you've got a fatal disease  I would probably run to Tahiti and just not want to run into anybody again. But instead she chooses to work in United Therapeutics. She says she wants to do all she can to help other people with orphan diseases get medicines  and today  she's our project leader for all telepresence activities  where she helps digitally unite the entire company to work together to find cures for pulmonary hypertension. CA  But not everyone who has this disease has been so fortunate. There are still many people dying  and you are tackling that too. How  MR  Exactly  Chris. There's some       people a year in the United States alone  perhaps    times that number worldwide  who continue to die of this illness because the medicines slow down the progression but they don't halt it. The only cure for pulmonary hypertension  pulmonary fibrosis  cystic fibrosis  emphysema  COPD  what Leonard Nimoy just died of  is a lung transplant  but sadly  there are only enough available lungs for       people in the U.S. a year to get a lung transplant  whereas nearly a half million people a year die of end stage lung failure. CA  So how can you address that  MR  So I conceptualize the possibility that just like we keep cars and planes and buildings going forever with an unlimited supply of building parts and machine parts  why can't we create an unlimited supply of transplantable organs to keep people living indefinitely  and especially people with lung disease. So we've teamed up with the decoder of the human genome  Craig Venter  and the company he founded with Peter Diamandis  the founder of the X Prize  to genetically modify the pig genome so that the pig's organs will not be rejected by the human body and thereby to create an unlimited supply of transplantable organs. We do this through our company  United Therapeutics. CA  So you really believe that within  what  a decade  that this shortage of transplantable lungs maybe be cured  through these guys  MR  Absolutely  Chris. I'm as certain of that as I was of the success that we've had with direct television broadcasting  Sirius XM. It's actually not rocket science. It's straightforward engineering away one gene after another. We're so lucky to be born in the time that sequencing genomes is a routine activity  and the brilliant folks at Synthetic Genomics are able to zero in on the pig genome  find exactly the genes that are problematic  and fix them. CA  But it's not just bodies that    though that is amazing. It's not just long lasting bodies that are of interest to you now. It's long lasting minds. And I think this graph for you says something quite profound. What does this mean  MR  What this graph means  and it comes from Ray Kurzweil  is that the rate of development in computer processing hardware  firmware and software  has been advancing along a curve such that by the     s  as we saw in earlier presentations today  there will be information technology that processes information and the world around us at the same rate as a human mind. CA  And so that being so  you're actually getting ready for this world by believing that we will soon be able to  what  actually take the contents of our brains and somehow preserve them forever  How do you describe that  MR  Well  Chris  what we're working on is creating a situation where people can create a mind file  and a mind file is the collection of their mannerisms  personality  recollection  feelings  beliefs  attitudes and values  everything that we've poured today into Google  into Amazon  into Facebook  and all of this information stored there will be able  in the next couple decades  once software is able to recapitulate consciousness  be able to revive the consciousness which is imminent in our mind file. CA  Now you're not just messing around with this. You're serious. I mean  who is this  MR  This is a robot version of my beloved spouse  Bina. And we call her Bina   . She was programmed by Hanson Robotics out of Texas. There's the centerfold from National Geographic magazine with one of her caregivers  and she roams the web and has hundreds of hours of Bina's mannerisms  personalities. She's kind of like a two year old kid  but she says things that blow people away  best expressed by perhaps a New York Times Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Amy Harmon who says her answers are often frustrating  but other times as compelling as those of any flesh person she's interviewed. CA  And is your thinking here  part of your hope here  is that this version of Bina can in a sense live on forever  or some future upgrade to this version can live on forever  MR  Yes. Not just Bina  but everybody. You know  it costs us virtually nothing to store our mind files on Facebook  Instagram  what have you. Social media is I think one of the most extraordinary inventions of our time  and as apps become available that will allow us to out Siri Siri  better and better  and develop consciousness operating systems  everybody in the world  billions of people  will be able to develop mind clones of themselves that will have their own life on the web. CA  So the thing is  Martine  that in any normal conversation  this would sound stark staring mad  but in the context of your life  what you've done  some of the things we've heard this week  the constructed realities that our minds give  I mean  you wouldn't bet against it. MR  Well  I think it's really nothing coming from me. If anything  I'm perhaps a bit of a communicator of activities that are being undertaken by the greatest companies in China  Japan  India  the U.S.  Europe. There are tens of millions of people working on writing code that expresses more and more aspects of our human consciousness  and you don't have to be a genius to see that all these threads are going to come together and ultimately create human consciousness  and it's something we'll value. There are so many things to do in this life  and if we could have a simulacrum  a digital doppelg nger of ourselves that helps us process books  do shopping  be our best friends  I believe our mind clones  these digital versions of ourselves  will ultimately be our best friends  and for me personally and Bina personally  we love each other like crazy. Each day  we are always saying  like   Wow  I love you even more than    years ago. And so for us  the prospect of mind clones and regenerated bodies is that our love affair  Chris  can go on forever. And we never get bored of each other. I'm sure we never will. CA  I think Bina's here  right  MR  She is  yeah. CA  Would it be too much  I don't know  do we have a handheld mic  Bina  could we invite you to the stage  I just have to ask you one question. Besides  we need to see you. Thank you  thank you. Come and join Martine here. I mean  look  when you got married  if someone had told you that  in a few years time  the man you were marrying would become a woman  and a few years after that  you would become a robot    how has this gone  How has it been  Bina Rothblatt  It's been really an exciting journey  and I would have never thought that at the time  but we started making goals and setting those goals and accomplishing things  and before you knew it  we just keep going up and up and we're still not stopping  so it's great. CA  Martine told me something really beautiful  just actually on Skype before this  which was that he wanted to live for hundreds of years as a mind file  but not if it wasn't with you. BR  That's right  we want to do it together. We're cryonicists as well  and we want to wake up together. CA  So just so as you know  from my point of view  this isn't only one of the most astonishing lives I have heard  it's one of the most astonishing love stories I've ever heard. It's just a delight to have you both here at TED. Thank you so much. MR  Thank you. When I was growing up  I really  liked playing hide and seek a lot. One time  though  I thought climbing a tree would lead to a great hiding spot  but I fell and broke my arm. I actually started first grade with a big cast all over my torso. It was taken off six weeks later  but even then  I couldn't extend my elbow  and I had to do physical therapy to flex and extend it      times per day  seven days per week. I barely did it  because I found it boring and painful  and as a result  it took me another six weeks to get better. Many years later  my mom developed frozen shoulder  which leads to pain and stiffness in the shoulder. The person I believed for half of my life to have superpowers suddenly needed help to get dressed or to cut food. She went each week to physical therapy  but just like me  she barely followed the home treatment  and it took her over five months to feel better. Both my mom and I required physical therapy  a process of doing a suite of repetitive exercises in order to regain the range of movement lost due to an accident or injury. At first  a physical therapist works with patients  but then it's up to the patients to do their exercises at home. But patients find physical therapy boring  frustrating  confusing and lengthy before seeing results. Sadly  patient noncompliance can be as high as    percent. This means the majority of patients don't do their exercises and therefore take a lot longer to get better. All physical therapists agree that special exercises reduce the time needed for recovery  but patients lack the motivation to do them. So together with three friends  all of us software geeks  we asked ourselves  wouldn't it be interesting if patients could play their way to recovery  We started building MIRA  A P.C. software platform that uses this Kinect device  a motion capture camera  to transform traditional exercises into video games. My physical therapist has already set up a schedule for my particular therapy. Let's see how this looks. The first game asks me to fly a bee up and down to gather pollen to deposit in beehives  all while avoiding the other bugs. I control the bee by doing elbow extension and flexion  just like when I was seven years old after the cast was taken off. When designing a game  we speak to physical therapists at first to understand what movement patients need to do. We then make that a video game to give patients simple  motivating objectives to follow. But the software is very customizable  and physical therapists can also create their own exercises. Using the software  my physical therapist recorded herself performing a shoulder abduction  which is one of the movements my mom had to do when she had frozen shoulder. I can follow my therapist's example on the left side of the screen  while on the right  I see myself doing the recommended movement. I feel more engaged and confident  as I'm exercising alongside my therapist with the exercises my therapist thinks are best for me. This basically extends the application for physical therapists to create whatever exercises they think are best. This is an auction house game for preventing falls  designed to strengthen muscles and improve balance. As a patient  I need to do sit and stand movements  and when I stand up  I bid for the items I want to buy. In two days  my grandmother will be    years old  and there's a    percent chance for people over    to fall at least once per year  which could lead to a broken hip or even worse. Poor muscle tone and impaired balance are the number one cause of falls  so reversing these problems through targeted exercise will help keep older people like my grandmother safer and independent for longer. When my schedule ends  MIRA briefly shows me how I progressed throughout my session. I have just shown you three different games for kids  adults and seniors. These can be used with orthopedic or neurologic patients  but we'll soon have options for children with autism  mental health or speech therapy. My physical therapist can go back to my profile and see the data gathered during my sessions. She can see how much I moved  how many points I scored  with what speed I moved my joints  and so on. My physical therapist can use all of this to adapt my treatment. I'm so pleased this version is now in use in over    clinics across Europe and the U.S.  and we're working on the home version. We want to enable physical therapists to prescribe this digital treatment and help patients play their way to recovery at home. If my mom or I had a tool like this when we needed physical therapy  then we would have been more successful following the treatment  and perhaps gotten better a lot sooner. Thank you. Tom Rielly  So Cosmin  tell me what hardware is this that they're rapidly putting away  What is that made of  and how much does it cost  Cosmin Milhau  So it's a Microsoft Surface Pro   for the demo  but you just need a computer and a Kinect  which is     dollars. TR  Right  and the Kinect is the thing that people use for their Xboxes to do  D games  right  CM  Exactly  but you don't need the Xbox  you only need a camera. TR  Right  so this is less than a        solution. CM  Definitely      dollars  you can definitely use it. TR  So right now  you're doing clinical trials in clinics. CM  Yes. TR  And then the hope is to get it so it's a home version and I can do my exercise remotely  and the therapist at the clinic can see how I'm doing and stuff like that. CM  Exactly. TR  Cool. Thanks so much. CM  Thank you. I'd like to have you look at this pencil. It's a thing. It's a legal thing. And so are books you might have or the cars you own. They're all legal things. The great apes that you'll see behind me  they too are legal things. Now  I can do that to a legal thing. I can do whatever I want to my book or my car. These great apes  you'll see. The photographs are taken by a man named James Mollison who wrote a book called  James   Other Apes.  And he tells in his book how every single one them  almost every one of them  is an orphan who saw his mother and father die before his eyes. They're legal things. So for centuries  there's been a great legal wall that separates legal things from legal persons. On one hand  legal things are invisible to judges. They don't count in law. They don't have any legal rights. They don't have the capacity for legal rights. They are the slaves. On the other side of that legal wall are the legal persons. Legal persons are very visible to judges. They count in law. They may have many rights. They have the capacity for an infinite number of rights. And they're the masters. Right now  all nonhuman animals are legal things. All human beings are legal persons. But being human and being a legal person has never been  and is not today  synonymous with a legal person. Humans and legal persons are not synonymous. On the one side  there have been many human beings over the centuries who have been legal things. Slaves were legal things. Women  children  were sometimes legal things. Indeed  a great deal of civil rights struggle over the last centuries has been to punch a hole through that wall and begin to feed these human things through the wall and have them become legal persons. But alas  that hole has closed up. Now  on the other side are legal persons  but they've never only been limited to human beings. There are  for example  there are many legal persons who are not even alive. In the United States  we're aware of the fact that corporations are legal persons. In pre independence India  a court held that a Hindu idol was a legal person  that a mosque was a legal person. In       the Indian Supreme Court held that the holy books of the Sikh religion was a legal person  and in       just recently  there was a treaty between the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and the crown  in which it was agreed that a river was a legal person who owned its own riverbed. Now  I read Peter Singer's book in       when I had a full head of lush  brown hair  and indeed I was moved by it  because I had become a lawyer because I wanted to speak for the voiceless  defend the defenseless  and I'd never realized how voiceless and defenseless the trillions  billions of nonhuman animals are. And I began to work as an animal protection lawyer. And by       I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible  the reason being that all of my clients  all the animals whose interests I was trying to defend  were legal things  they were invisible. It was not going to work  so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had  at least some of them  had to also be moved through a hole that we could open up again in that wall and begin feeding the appropriate nonhuman animals through that hole onto the other side of being legal persons. Now  at that time  there was very little known about or spoken about truly animal rights  about the idea of having legal personhood or legal rights for a nonhuman animal  and I knew it was going to take a long time. And so  in       I figured that it would take about    years before we'd be able to even begin a strategic litigation  long term campaign  in order to be able to punch another hole through that wall. It turned out that I was pessimistic  that it only took   . So what we had to do in order to begin was not only to write law review articles and teach classes  write books  but we had to then begin to get down to the nuts and bolts of how you litigate that kind of case. So one of the first things we needed to do was figure out what a cause of action was  a legal cause of action. And a legal cause of action is a vehicle that lawyers use to put their arguments in front of courts. It turns out there's a very interesting case that had occurred almost     years ago in London called Somerset vs. Stewart  whereby a black slave had used the legal system and had moved from a legal thing to a legal person. I was so interested in it that I eventually wrote an entire book about it. James Somerset was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa. He survived the Middle Passage  and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stewart in Virginia. Now     years later  Stewart brought James Somerset to London  and after he got there  James decided he was going to escape. And so one of the first things he did was to get himself baptized  because he wanted to get a set of godparents  because to an   th century slave  they knew that one of the major responsibilities of godfathers was to help you escape. And so in the fall of       James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stewart. We don't know exactly what happened  but then James dropped out of sight. An enraged Charles Stewart then hired slave catchers to canvass the city of London  find him  bring him not back to Charles Stewart  but to a ship  the Ann and Mary  that was floating in London Harbour  and he was chained to the deck  and the ship was to set sail for Jamaica where James was to be sold in the slave markets and be doomed to the three to five years of life that a slave had harvesting sugar cane in Jamaica. Well now James' godparents swung into action. They approached the most powerful judge  Lord Mansfield  who was chief judge of the court of King's Bench  and they demanded that he issue a common law writ of habeus corpus on behalf of James Somerset. Now  the common law is the kind of law that English speaking judges can make when they're not cabined in by statutes or constitutions  and a writ of habeus corpus is called the Great Writ  capital G  capital W  and it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against our will. A writ of habeus corpus is issued. The detainer is required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty. Well  Lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat  because if James Somerset was a legal thing  he was not eligible for a writ of habeus corpus  only if he could be a legal person. So Lord Mansfield decided that he would assume  without deciding  that James Somerset was indeed a legal person  and he issued the writ of habeus corpus  and James's body was brought in by the captain of the ship. There were a series of hearings over the next six months. On June           Lord Mansfield said that slavery was so odious  and he used the word  odious   that the common law would not support it  and he ordered James free. At that moment  James Somerset underwent a legal transubstantiation. The free man who walked out of the courtroom looked exactly like the slave who had walked in  but as far as the law was concerned  they had nothing whatsoever in common. The next thing we did is that the Nonhuman Rights Project  which I founded  then began to look at what kind of values and principles do we want to put before the judges  What values and principles did they imbibe with their mother's milk  were they taught in law school  do they use every day  do they believe with all their hearts    and we chose liberty and equality. Now  liberty right is the kind of right to which you're entitled because of how you're put together  and a fundamental liberty right protects a fundamental interest. And the supreme interest in the common law are the rights to autonomy and self determination. So they are so powerful that in a common law country  if you go to a hospital and you refuse life saving medical treatment  a judge will not order it forced upon you  because they will respect your self determination and your autonomy. Now  an equality right is the kind of right to which you're entitled because you resemble someone else in a relevant way  and there's the rub  relevant way. So if you are that  then because they have the right  you're like them  you're entitled to the right. Now  courts and legislatures draw lines all the time. Some are included  some are excluded. But you have to  at the bare minimum you must    that line has to be a reasonable means to a legitimate end. The Nonhuman Rights Project argues that drawing a line in order to enslave an autonomous and self determining being like you're seeing behind me  that that's a violation of equality. We then searched through    jurisdictions  it took us seven years  to find the jurisdiction where we wanted to begin filing our first suit. We chose the state of New York. Then we decided upon who our plaintiffs are going to be. We decided upon chimpanzees  not just because Jane Goodall was on our board of directors  but because they  Jane and others  have studied chimpanzees intensively for decades. We know the extraordinary cognitive capabilities that they have  and they also resemble the kind that human beings have. And so we chose chimpanzees  and we began to then canvass the world to find the experts in chimpanzee cognition. We found them in Japan  Sweden  Germany  Scotland  England and the United States  and amongst them  they wrote     pages of affidavits in which they set out more than    ways in which their complex cognitive capability  either individually or together  all added up to autonomy and self determination. Now  these included  for example  that they were conscious. But they're also conscious that they're conscious. They know they have a mind. They know that others have minds. They know they're individuals  and that they can live. They understand that they lived yesterday and they will live tomorrow. They engage in mental time travel. They remember what happened yesterday. They can anticipate tomorrow  which is why it's so terrible to imprison a chimpanzee  especially alone. It's the thing that we do to our worst criminals  and we do that to chimpanzees without even thinking about it. They have some kind of moral capacity. When they play economic games with human beings  they'll spontaneously make fair offers  even when they're not required to do so. They are numerate. They understand numbers. They can do some simple math. They can engage in language    or to stay out of the language wars  they're involved in intentional and referential communication in which they pay attention to the attitudes of those with whom they are speaking. They have culture. They have a material culture  a social culture. They have a symbolic culture. Scientists in the Ta  Forests in the Ivory Coast found chimpanzees who were using these rocks to smash open the incredibly hard hulls of nuts. It takes a long time to learn how to do that  and they excavated the area and they found that this material culture  this way of doing it  these rocks  had passed down for at least       years through     chimpanzee generations. So now we needed to find our chimpanzee. Our chimpanzee  first we found two of them in the state of New York. Both of them would die before we could even get our suits filed. Then we found Tommy. Tommy is a chimpanzee. You see him behind me. Tommy was a chimpanzee. We found him in that cage. We found him in a small room that was filled with cages in a larger warehouse structure on a used trailer lot in central New York. We found Kiko  who is partially deaf. Kiko was in the back of a cement storefront in western Massachusetts. And we found Hercules and Leo. They're two young male chimpanzees who are being used for biomedical  anatomical research at Stony Brook. We found them. And so on the last week of December       the Nonhuman Rights Project filed three suits all across the state of New York using the same common law writ of habeus corpus argument that had been used with James Somerset  and we demanded that the judges issue these common law writs of habeus corpus. We wanted the chimpanzees out  and we wanted them brought to Save the Chimps  a tremendous chimpanzee sanctuary in South Florida which involves an artificial lake with    or    islands    there are two or three acres where two dozen chimpanzees live on each of them. And these chimpanzees would then live the life of a chimpanzee  with other chimpanzees in an environment that was as close to Africa as possible. Now  all these cases are still going on. We have not yet run into our Lord Mansfield. We shall. We shall. This is a long term strategic litigation campaign. We shall. And to quote Winston Churchill  the way we view our cases is that they're not the end  they're not even the beginning of the end  but they are perhaps the end of the beginning. Thank you. Why do we cheat  And why do happy people cheat  And when we say  infidelity   what exactly do we mean  Is it a hookup  a love story  paid sex  a chat room  a massage with a happy ending  Why do we think that men cheat out of boredom and fear of intimacy  but women cheat out of loneliness and hunger for intimacy  And is an affair always the end of a relationship  For the past    years  I have traveled the globe and worked extensively with hundreds of couples who have been shattered by infidelity. There is one simple act of transgression that can rob a couple of their relationship  their happiness and their very identity  an affair. And yet  this extremely common act is so poorly understood. So this talk is for anyone who has ever loved. Adultery has existed since marriage was invented  and so  too  the taboo against it. In fact  infidelity has a tenacity that marriage can only envy  so much so  that this is the only commandment that is repeated twice in the Bible  once for doing it  and once just for thinking about it. So how do we reconcile what is universally forbidden  yet universally practiced  Now  throughout history  men practically had a license to cheat with little consequence  and supported by a host of biological and evolutionary theories that justified their need to roam  so the double standard is as old as adultery itself. But who knows what's really going on under the sheets there  right  Because when it comes to sex  the pressure for men is to boast and to exaggerate  but the pressure for women is to hide  minimize and deny  which isn't surprising when you consider that there are still nine countries where women can be killed for straying. Now  monogamy used to be one person for life. Today  monogamy is one person at a time. I mean  many of you probably have said   I am monogamous in all my relationships.  We used to marry  and had sex for the first time. But now we marry  and we stop having sex with others. The fact is that monogamy had nothing to do with love. Men relied on women's fidelity in order to know whose children these are  and who gets the cows when I die. Now  everyone wants to know what percentage of people cheat. I've been asked that question since I arrived at this conference. It applies to you. But the definition of infidelity keeps on expanding  sexting  watching porn  staying secretly active on dating apps. So because there is no universally agreed upon definition of what even constitutes an infidelity  estimates vary widely  from    percent to    percent. But on top of it  we are walking contradictions. So    percent of us will say that it is terribly wrong for our partner to lie about having an affair  but just about the same amount of us will say that that's exactly what we would do if we were having one. Now  I like this definition of an affair    it brings together the three key elements  a secretive relationship  which is the core structure of an affair  an emotional connection to one degree or another  and a sexual alchemy. And alchemy is the key word here  because the erotic frisson is such that the kiss that you only imagine giving  can be as powerful and as enchanting as hours of actual lovemaking. As Marcel Proust said  it's our imagination that is responsible for love  not the other person. So it's never been easier to cheat  and it's never been more difficult to keep a secret. And never has infidelity exacted such a psychological toll. When marriage was an economic enterprise  infidelity threatened our economic security. But now that marriage is a romantic arrangement  infidelity threatens our emotional security. Ironically  we used to turn to adultery    that was the space where we sought pure love. But now that we seek love in marriage  adultery destroys it. Now  there are three ways that I think infidelity hurts differently today. We have a romantic ideal in which we turn to one person to fulfill an endless list of needs  to be my greatest lover  my best friend  the best parent  my trusted confidant  my emotional companion  my intellectual equal. And I am it  I'm chosen  I'm unique  I'm indispensable  I'm irreplaceable  I'm the one. And infidelity tells me I'm not. It is the ultimate betrayal. Infidelity shatters the grand ambition of love. But if throughout history  infidelity has always been painful  today it is often traumatic  because it threatens our sense of self. So my patient Fernando  he's plagued. He goes on   I thought I knew my life. I thought I knew who you were  who we were as a couple  who I was. Now  I question everything.  Infidelity    a violation of trust  a crisis of identity.  Can I ever trust you again   he asks.  Can I ever trust anyone again   And this is also what my patient Heather is telling me  when she's talking to me about her story with Nick. Married  two kids. Nick just left on a business trip  and Heather is playing on his iPad with the boys  when she sees a message appear on the screen   Can't wait to see you.  Strange  she thinks  we just saw each other. And then another message   Can't wait to hold you in my arms.  And Heather realizes these are not for her. She also tells me that her father had affairs  but her mother  she found one little receipt in the pocket  and a little bit of lipstick on the collar. Heather  she goes digging  and she finds hundreds of messages  and photos exchanged and desires expressed. The vivid details of Nick's two year affair unfold in front of her in real time  And it made me think  Affairs in the digital age are death by a thousand cuts. But then we have another paradox that we're dealing with these days. Because of this romantic ideal  we are relying on our partner's fidelity with a unique fervor. But we also have never been more inclined to stray  and not because we have new desires today  but because we live in an era where we feel that we are entitled to pursue our desires  because this is the culture where I deserve to be happy. And if we used to divorce because we were unhappy  today we divorce because we could be happier. And if divorce carried all the shame  today  choosing to stay when you can leave is the new shame. So Heather  she can't talk to her friends because she's afraid that they will judge her for still loving Nick  and everywhere she turns  she gets the same advice  Leave him. Throw the dog on the curb. And if the situation were reversed  Nick would be in the same situation. Staying is the new shame. So if we can divorce  why do we still have affairs  Now  the typical assumption is that if someone cheats  either there's something wrong in your relationship or wrong with you. But millions of people can't all be pathological. The logic goes like this  If you have everything you need at home  then there is no need to go looking elsewhere  assuming that there is such a thing as a perfect marriage that will inoculate us against wanderlust. But what if passion has a finite shelf life  What if there are things that even a good relationship can never provide  If even happy people cheat  what is it about  The vast majority of people that I actually work with are not at all chronic philanderers. They are often people who are deeply monogamous in their beliefs  and at least for their partner. But they find themselves in a conflict between their values and their behavior. They often are people who have actually been faithful for decades  but one day they cross a line that they never thought they would cross  and at the risk of losing everything. But for a glimmer of what  Affairs are an act of betrayal  and they are also an expression of longing and loss. At the heart of an affair  you will often find a longing and a yearning for an emotional connection  for novelty  for freedom  for autonomy  for sexual intensity  a wish to recapture lost parts of ourselves or an attempt to bring back vitality in the face of loss and tragedy. I'm thinking about another patient of mine  Priya  who is blissfully married  loves her husband  and would never want to hurt the man. But she also tells me that she's always done what was expected of her  good girl  good wife  good mother  taking care of her immigrant parents. Priya  she fell for the arborist who removed the tree from her yard after Hurricane Sandy. And with his truck and his tattoos  he's quite the opposite of her. But at     Priya's affair is about the adolescence that she never had. And her story highlights for me that when we seek the gaze of another  it isn't always our partner that we are turning away from  but the person that we have ourselves become. And it isn't so much that we're looking for another person  as much as we are looking for another self. Now  all over the world  there is one word that people who have affairs always tell me. They feel alive. And they often will tell me stories of recent losses    of a parent who died  and a friend that went too soon  and bad news at the doctor. Death and mortality often live in the shadow of an affair  because they raise these questions. Is this it  Is there more  Am I going on for another    years like this  Will I ever feel that thing again  And it has led me to think that perhaps these questions are the ones that propel people to cross the line  and that some affairs are an attempt to beat back deadness  in an antidote to death. And contrary to what you may think  affairs are way less about sex  and a lot more about desire  desire for attention  desire to feel special  desire to feel important. And the very structure of an affair  the fact that you can never have your lover  keeps you wanting. That in itself is a desire machine  because the incompleteness  the ambiguity  keeps you wanting that which you can't have. Now some of you probably think that affairs don't happen in open relationships  but they do. First of all  the conversation about monogamy is not the same as the conversation about infidelity. But the fact is that it seems that even when we have the freedom to have other sexual partners  we still seem to be lured by the power of the forbidden  that if we do that which we are not supposed to do  then we feel like we are really doing what we want to. And I've also told quite a few of my patients that if they could bring into their relationships one tenth of the boldness  the imagination and the verve that they put into their affairs  they probably would never need to see me. So how do we heal from an affair  Desire runs deep. Betrayal runs deep. But it can be healed. And some affairs are death knells for relationships that were already dying on the vine. But others will jolt us into new possibilities. The fact is  the majority of couples who have experienced affairs stay together. But some of them will merely survive  and others will actually be able to turn a crisis into an opportunity. They'll be able to turn this into a generative experience. And I'm actually thinking even more so for the deceived partner  who will often say   You think I didn't want more  But I'm not the one who did it.  But now that the affair is exposed  they  too  get to claim more  and they no longer have to uphold the status quo that may not have been working for them that well  either. I've noticed that a lot of couples  in the immediate aftermath of an affair  because of this new disorder that may actually lead to a new order  will have depths of conversations with honesty and openness that they haven't had in decades. And  partners who were sexually indifferent find themselves suddenly so lustfully voracious  they don't know where it's coming from. Something about the fear of loss will rekindle desire  and make way for an entirely new kind of truth. So when an affair is exposed  what are some of the specific things that couples can do  We know from trauma that healing begins when the perpetrator acknowledges their wrongdoing. So for the partner who had the affair  for Nick  one thing is to end the affair  but the other is the essential  important act of expressing guilt and remorse for hurting his wife. But the truth is that I have noticed that quite a lot of people who have affairs may feel terribly guilty for hurting their partner  but they don't feel guilty for the experience of the affair itself. And that distinction is important. And Nick  he needs to hold vigil for the relationship. He needs to become  for a while  the protector of the boundaries. It's his responsibility to bring it up  because if he thinks about it  he can relieve Heather from the obsession  and from having to make sure that the affair isn't forgotten  and that in itself begins to restore trust. But for Heather  or deceived partners  it is essential to do things that bring back a sense of self worth  to surround oneself with love and with friends and activities that give back joy and meaning and identity. But even more important  is to curb the curiosity to mine for the sordid details    Where were you  Where did you do it  How often  Is she better than me in bed     questions that only inflict more pain  and keep you awake at night. And instead  switch to what I call the investigative questions  the ones that mine the meaning and the motives    What did this affair mean for you  What were you able to express or experience there that you could no longer do with me  What was it like for you when you came home  What is it about us that you value  Are you pleased this is over  Every affair will redefine a relationship  and every couple will determine what the legacy of the affair will be. But affairs are here to stay  and they're not going away. And the dilemmas of love and desire  they don't yield just simple answers of black and white and good and bad  and victim and perpetrator. Betrayal in a relationship comes in many forms. There are many ways that we betray our partner  with contempt  with neglect  with indifference  with violence. Sexual betrayal is only one way to hurt a partner. In other words  the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the marriage. Now  you've listened to me  and I know what you're thinking  She has a French accent  she must be pro affair. So  you're wrong. I am not French. And I'm not pro affair. But because I think that good can come out of an affair  I have often been asked this very strange question  Would I ever recommend it  Now  I would no more recommend you have an affair than I would recommend you have cancer  and yet we know that people who have been ill often talk about how their illness has yielded them a new perspective. The main question that I've been asked since I arrived at this conference when I said I would talk about infidelity is  for or against  I said   Yes.  I look at affairs from a dual perspective  hurt and betrayal on one side  growth and self discovery on the other    what it did to you  and what it meant for me. And so when a couple comes to me in the aftermath of an affair that has been revealed  I will often tell them this  Today in the West  most of us are going to have two or three relationships or marriages  and some of us are going to do it with the same person. Your first marriage is over. Would you like to create a second one together  Thank you. So if I told you that this was the face of pure joy  would you call me crazy  I wouldn't blame you  because every time I look at this Arctic selfie  I shiver just a little bit. I want to tell you a little bit about this photograph. I was swimming around in the Lofoten Islands in Norway  just inside the Arctic Circle  and the water was hovering right at freezing. The air  A brisk     with windchill  and I could literally feel the blood trying to leave my hands  feet and face  and rush to protect my vital organs. It was the coldest I've ever been. But even with swollen lips  sunken eyes  and cheeks flushed red  I have found that this place right here is somewhere I can find great joy. Now  when it comes to pain  psychologist Brock Bastian probably said it best when he wrote   Pain is a kind of shortcut to mindfulness. It makes us suddenly aware of everything in the environment. It brutally draws us in to a virtual sensory awareness of the world much like meditation.  If shivering is a form of meditation  then I would consider myself a monk. Now  before we get into the why would anyone ever want to surf in freezing cold water  I would love to give you a little perspective on what a day in my life can look like. but I don't think anybody thought that was going to happen. I can't stop shaking. I am so cold. Chris Burkard  So  surf photographer  right  I don't even know if it's a real job title  to be honest. My parents definitely didn't think so when I told them at    I was quitting my job to pursue this dream career  blue skies  warm tropical beaches  and a tan that lasts all year long. I mean  to me  this was it. Life could not get any better. Sweating it out  shooting surfers in these exotic tourist destinations. But there was just this one problem. You see  the more time I spent traveling to these exotic locations  the less gratifying it seemed to be. I set out seeking adventure  and what I was finding was only routine. It was things like wi fi  TV  fine dining  and a constant cellular connection that to me were all the trappings of places heavily touristed in and out of the water  and it didn't take long for me to start feeling suffocated. I began craving wild  open spaces  and so I set out to find the places others had written off as too cold  too remote  and too dangerous to surf  and that challenge intrigued me. I began this sort of personal crusade against the mundane  because if there's one thing I've realized  it's that any career  even one as seemingly glamorous as surf photography  has the danger of becoming monotonous. So in my search to break up this monotony  I realized something  There's only about a third of the Earth's oceans that are warm  and it's really just that thin band around the equator. So if I was going to find perfect waves  it was probably going to happen somewhere cold  where the seas are notoriously rough  and that's exactly where I began to look. And it was my first trip to Iceland that I felt like I found exactly what I was looking for. I was blown away by the natural beauty of the landscape  but most importantly  I couldn't believe we were finding perfect waves in such a remote and rugged part of the world. At one point  we got to the beach only to find massive chunks of ice had piled on the shoreline. They created this barrier between us and the surf  and we had to weave  through this thing like a maze just to get out into the lineup. and once we got there  we were pushing aside these ice chunks trying to get into waves. It was an incredible experience  one I'll never forget  because amidst those harsh conditions  I felt like I stumbled onto one of the last quiet places  somewhere that I found a clarity and a connection with the world I knew I would never find on a crowded beach. I was hooked. I was hooked.  Laughter  Cold water was constantly on my mind  and from that point on  my career focused on these types of harsh and unforgiving environments  and it took me to places like Russia  Norway  Alaska  Iceland  Chile  the Faroe Islands  and a lot of places in between. And one of my favorite things about these places was simply the challenge and the creativity it took just to get there  hours  days  weeks spent on Google Earth trying to pinpoint any remote stretch of beach or reef we could actually get to. And once we got there  the vehicles were just as creative  snowmobiles  six wheel Soviet troop carriers  and a couple of super sketchy helicopter flights. Helicopters really scare me  by the way. There was this one particularly bumpy boat ride up the coast of Vancouver Island to this kind of remote surf spot  where we ended up watching helplessly from the water as bears ravaged our camp site. They walked off with our food and bits of our tent  clearly letting us know that we were at the bottom of the food chain and that this was their spot  not ours. But to me  that trip was a testament to the wildness I traded for those touristy beaches. Now  it wasn't until I traveled to Norway     Laughter     that I really learned to appreciate the cold. So this is the place where some of the largest  the most violent storms in the world send huge waves smashing into the coastline. We were in this tiny  remote fjord  just inside the Arctic Circle. It had a greater population of sheep than people  so help if we needed it was nowhere to be found. I was in the water  taking pictures of surfers  and it started to snow. And then the temperature began to drop. And I told myself  there's not a chance you're getting out of the water. You traveled all this way  and this is exactly what you've been waiting for  freezing cold conditions with perfect waves. And although I couldn't even feel my finger to push the trigger  I knew I wasn't getting out. So I just did whatever I could. I shook it off  whatever. But that was the point that I felt this wind gush through the valley and hit me  and what started as this light snowfall quickly became a full on blizzard  and I started to lose perception of where I was. I didn't know if I was drifting out to sea or towards shore  and all I could really make out was the faint sound of seagulls and crashing waves. Now  I knew this place had a reputation for sinking ships and grounding planes  and while I was out there floating  I started to get a little bit nervous. Actually  I was totally freaking out    and my friends eventually had to help me out of the water. And I don't know if it was delirium setting in or what  but they told me later I had a smile on my face the entire time. Now  it was this trip and probably that exact experience where I really began to feel like every photograph was precious  because all of a sudden in that moment  it was something I was forced to earn. And I realized  all this shivering had actually taught me something  In life  there are no shortcuts to joy. Anything that is worth pursuing is going to require us to suffer just a little bit  and that tiny bit of suffering that I did for my photography  it added a value to my work that was so much more meaningful to me than just trying to fill the pages of magazines. See  I gave a piece of myself in these places  and what I walked away with was a sense of fulfillment I had always been searching for. So I look back at this photograph. It's easy to see frozen fingers and cold wetsuits and even the struggle that it took just to get there  but most of all  what I see is just joy. Thank you so much. I've learned some of my most important life lessons from drug dealers and gang members and prostitutes  and I've had some of my most profound theological conversations not in the hallowed halls of a seminary but on a street corner on a Friday night  at   a.m. That's a little unusual  since I am a Baptist minister  seminary trained  and pastored a church for over    years  but it's true. It came as a part of my participation in a public safety crime reduction strategy that saw a    percent reduction in violent crime over an eight year period in a major city. But I didn't start out wanting to be a part of somebody's crime reduction strategy. I was     had my first church. If you would have asked me what my ambition was  I would have told you I wanted to be a megachurch pastor. I wanted a             member church. I wanted my own television ministry. I wanted my own clothing line. I wanted to be your long distance carrier. You know  the whole nine yards. After about a year of pastoring  my membership went up about    members. So megachurchdom was way down the road. But seriously  if you'd have said   What is your ambition   I would have said just to be a good pastor  to be able to be with people through all the passages of life  to preach messages that would have an everyday meaning for folks  and in the African American tradition  to be able to represent the community that I serve. But there was something else that was happening in my city and in the entire metro area  and in most metro areas in the United States  and that was the homicide rate started to rise precipitously. And there were young people who were killing each other for reasons that I thought were very trivial  like bumping into someone in a high school hallway  and then after school  shooting the person. Someone with the wrong color shirt on  on the wrong street corner at the wrong time. And something needed to be done about that. It got to the point where it started to change the character of the city. You could go to any housing project  for example  like the one that was down the street from my church  and you would walk in  and it would be like a ghost town  because the parents wouldn't allow their kids to come out and play  even in the summertime  because of the violence. You would listen in the neighborhoods on any given night  and to the untrained ear  it sounded like fireworks  but it was gunfire. You'd hear it almost every night  when you were cooking dinner  telling your child a bedtime story  or just watching TV. And you can go to any emergency room at any hospital  and you would see lying on gurneys young black and Latino men shot and dying. And I was doing funerals  but not of the venerated matriarchs and patriarchs who'd lived a long life and there's a lot to say. I was doing funerals of    year olds     year olds  and    year olds  and I was standing in a church or at a funeral home struggling to say something that would make some meaningful impact. And so while my colleagues were building these cathedrals great and tall and buying property outside of the city and moving their congregations out so that they could create or recreate their cities of God  the social structures in the inner cities were sagging under the weight of all of this violence. And so I stayed  because somebody needed to do something  and so I had looked at what I had and moved on that. I started to preach decrying the violence in the community. And I started to look at the programming in my church  and I started to build programs that would catch the at risk youth  those who were on the fence to the violence. I even tried to be innovative in my preaching. You all have heard of rap music  right  Rap music  I even tried to rap sermon one time. It didn't work  but at least I tried it. I'll never forget the young person who came to me after that sermon. He waited until everybody was gone  and he said   Rev  rap sermon  huh   And I was like   Yeah  what do you think   And he said   Don't do that again  Rev.  But I preached and I built these programs  and I thought maybe if my colleagues did the same that it would make a difference. But the violence just careened out of control  and people who were not involved in the violence were getting shot and killed  somebody going to buy a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store  or someone who was sitting at a bus stop just waiting for a bus  or kids who were playing in the park  oblivious to the violence on the other side of the park  but it coming and visiting them. Things were out of control  and I didn't know what to do  and then something happened that changed everything for me. It was a kid by the name of Jesse McKie  walking home with his friend Rigoberto Carrion to the housing project down the street from my church. They met up with a group of youth who were from a gang in Dorchester  and they were killed. But as Jesse was running from the scene mortally wounded  he was running in the direction of my church  and he died some          yards away. If he would have gotten to the church  it wouldn't have made a difference  because the lights were out  nobody was home. And I took that as a sign. When they caught some of the youth that had done this deed  to my surprise  they were around my age  but the gulf that was between us was vast. It was like we were in two completely different worlds. And so as I contemplated all of this and looked at what was happening  I suddenly realized that there was a paradox that was emerging inside of me  and the paradox was this  in all of those sermons that I preached decrying the violence  I was also talking about building community  but I suddenly realized that there was a certain segment of the population that I was not including in my definition of community. And so the paradox was this  If I really wanted the community that I was preaching for  I needed to reach out and embrace this group that I had cut out of my definition. Which meant not about building programs to catch those who were on the fences of violence  but to reach out and to embrace those who were committing the acts of violence  the gang bangers  the drug dealers. As soon as I came to that realization  a quick question came to my mind. Why me  I mean  isn't this a law enforcement issue  This is why we have the police  right  As soon as the question   Why me   came  the answer came just as quickly  Why me  Because I'm the one who can't sleep at night thinking about it. Because I'm the one looking around saying somebody needs to do something about this  and I'm starting to realize that that someone is me. I mean  isn't that how movements start anyway  They don't start with a grand convention and people coming together and then walking in lockstep with a statement. But it starts with just a few  or maybe just one. It started with me that way  and so I decided to figure out the culture of violence in which these young people who were committing them existed  and I started to volunteer at the high school. After about two weeks of volunteering at the high school  I realized that the youth that I was trying to reach  they weren't going to high school. I started to walk in the community  and it didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren't out during the day. So I started to walk the streets at night  late at night  going into the parks where they were  building the relationship that was necessary. A tragedy happened in Boston that brought a number of clergy together  and there was a small cadre of us who came to the realization that we had to come out of the four walls of our sanctuary and meet the youth where they were  and not try to figure out how to bring them in. And so we decided to walk together  and we would get together in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the city on a Friday night and on a Saturday night at    p.m.  and we would walk until   or   in the morning. I imagine we were quite the anomaly when we first started walking. I mean  we weren't drug dealers. We weren't drug customers. We weren't the police. Some of us would have collars on. It was probably a really odd thing. But they started speaking to us after a while  and what we found out is that while we were walking  they were watching us  and they wanted to make sure of a couple of things  that number one  we were going to be consistent in our behavior  that we would keep coming out there  and then secondly  they had wanted to make sure that we weren't out there to exploit them. Because there was always somebody who would say   We're going to take back the streets   but they would always seem to have a television camera with them  or a reporter  and they would enhance their own reputation to the detriment of those on the streets. So when they saw that we had none of that  they decided to talk to us. And then we did an amazing thing for preachers. We decided to listen and not preach. Come on  give it up for me. All right  come on  you're cutting into my time now  okay   Laughter  But it was amazing. We said to them   We don't know our own communities after   p.m. at night  between   p.m. and   a.m.  but you do. You are the subject matter experts  if you will  of that period of time. So talk to us. Teach us. Help us to see what we're not seeing. Help us to understand what we're not understanding.  And they were all too happy to do that  and we got an idea of what life on the streets was all about  very different than what you see on the    o'clock news  very different than what is portrayed in popular media and even social media. And as we were talking with them  a number of myths were dispelled about them with us. And one of the biggest myths was that these kids were cold and heartless and uncharacteristically bold in their violence. What we found out was the exact opposite. Most of the young people who were out there on the streets are just trying to make it on the streets. And we also found out that some of the most intelligent and creative and magnificent and wise people that we've ever met were on the street  engaged in a struggle. And I know some of them call it survival  but I call them overcomers  because when you're in the conditions that they're in  to be able to live every day is an accomplishment of overcoming. And as a result of that  we said to them   How do you see this church  how do you see this institution helping this situation   And we developed a plan in conversation with these youths. We stopped looking at them as the problem to be solved  and we started looking at them as partners  as assets  as co laborers in the struggle to reduce violence in the community. Imagine developing a plan  you have one minister at one table and a heroin dealer at the other table  coming up with a way in which the church can help the entire community. The Boston Miracle was about bringing people together. We had other partners. We had law enforcement partners. We had police officers. It wasn't the entire force  because there were still some who still had that lock 'em up mentality  but there were other cops who saw the honor in partnering with the community  who saw the responsibility from themselves to be able to work as partners with community leaders and faith leaders in order to reduce violence in the community. Same with probation officers  same with judges  same with folks who were up that law enforcement chain  because they realized  like we did  that we'll never arrest ourselves out of this situation  that there will not be enough prosecutions made  and you cannot fill these jails up enough in order to alleviate the problem. I helped to start an organization    years ago  a faith based organization  to deal with this issue. I left it about four years ago and started working in cities across the United States     in total  and what I found out was that in those cities  there was always this component of community leaders who put their heads down and their nose to the grindstone  who checked their egos at the door and saw the whole as greater than the sum of its parts  and came together and found ways to work with youth out on the streets  that the solution is not more cops  but the solution is mining the assets that are there in the community  to have a strong community component in the collaboration around violence reduction. Now  there is a movement in the United States of young people who I am very proud of who are dealing with the structural issues that need to change if we're going to be a better society. But there is this political ploy to try to pit police brutality and police misconduct against black on black violence. But it's a fiction. It's all connected. When you think about decades of failed housing policies and poor educational structures  when you think about persistent unemployment and underemployment in a community  when you think about poor healthcare  and then you throw drugs into the mix and duffel bags full of guns  little wonder that you would see this culture of violence emerge. And then the response that comes from the state is more cops and more suppression of hot spots. It's all connected  and one of the wonderful things that we've been able to do is to be able to show the value of partnering together    community  law enforcement  private sector  the city    in order to reduce violence. You have to value that community component. I believe that we can end the era of violence in our cities. I believe that it is possible and that people are doing it even now. But I need your help. It can't just come from folks who are burning themselves out in the community. They need support. They need help. Go back to your city. Find those people.  You need some help  I'll help you out.  Find those people. They're there. Bring them together with law enforcement  the private sector  and the city  with the one aim of reducing violence  but make sure that that community component is strong. Because the old adage that comes from Burundi is right  that you do for me  without me  you do to me. God bless you. Thank you. Someone who looks like me walks past you in the street. Do you think they're a mother  a refugee or a victim of oppression  Or do you think they're a cardiologist  a barrister or maybe your local politician  Do you look me up and down  wondering how hot I must get or if my husband has forced me to wear this outfit  What if I wore my scarf like this  I can walk down the street in the exact same outfit and what the world expects of me and the way I'm treated depends on the arrangement of this piece of cloth. But this isn't going to be another monologue about the hijab because Lord knows  Muslim women are so much more than the piece of cloth they choose  or not  to wrap their head in. This is about looking beyond your bias. What if I walked past you and later on you'd found out that actually I was a race car engineer  and that I designed my own race car and I ran my university's race team  because it's true. What if I told you that I was actually trained as a boxer for five years  because that's true  too. Would it surprise you  Why  Ladies and gentlemen  ultimately  that surprise and the behaviors associated with it are the product of something  called unconscious bias  or implicit prejudice. And that results in the ridiculously detrimental lack of diversity in our workforce  particularly in areas of influence. Hello  Australian Federal Cabinet. Let me just set something out from the outset  Unconscious bias is not the same as conscious discrimination. I'm not saying that in all of you   there's a secret sexist or racist or ageist lurking within   waiting to get out. That's not what I'm saying. We all have our biases. They're the filters through which we see the world around us. I'm not accusing anyone  bias is not an accusation. Rather  it's something that  has to be identified  acknowledged and mitigated against. Bias can be about race  it can be about gender. It can also be about class  education  disability. The fact is  we all have biases against what's different  what's different to our social norms. The thing is  if we want  to live in a world where the circumstances of your birth do not dictate your future and where equal opportunity is ubiquitous  then each and every one of us has a role to play in making sure unconscious bias does not determine our lives. There's this really famous experiment in the space of unconscious bias and that's in the space of gender in the     s and     s. So orchestras  back in the day  were made up mostly of dudes  up to only five percent were female. And apparently  that was because men played it differently  presumably better  presumably. But in       The Boston Symphony Orchestra started an experiment. They started blind auditions. So rather than face to face auditions  you would have to play behind a screen. Now funnily enough  no immediate change was registered until they asked the audition ers to take their shoes off before they entered the room. because the clickity clack  of the heels against the hardwood floors was enough to give the ladies away. Now get this  there results of the audition showed that there was a    percent increased chance a woman would progress past the preliminary stage. And it almost tripled  their chances of getting in. What does that tell us  Well  unfortunately for the guys  men actually didn't play differently  but there was the perception that they did. And it was that bias that was determining their outcome. So what we're doing here  is identifying and acknowledging that a bias exists. And look  we all do it. Let me give you an example. A son and his father are in  a horrible car accident. The father dies on impact and the son  who's severely injured  is rushed to hospital. The surgeon looks at the son when they arrive and is like   I can't operate.  Why   The boy is my son.  How can that be  Ladies and gentlemen  the surgeon is his mother. Now hands up    and it's okay    but hands up if you initially assumed the surgeon was a guy  There's evidence that that unconscious bias exists  but we all just have to acknowledge that it's there and then look at ways  that we can move past it so that we can look at solutions. Now one of the interesting things around the space of unconscious bias is the topic of quotas. And this something  that's often brought up. And of of the criticisms  is this idea of merit. Look  I don't want to be picked  because I'm a chick  I want to be picked because  I have merit  because I'm the best person for the job. It's a sentiment that's pretty common among female engineers that I work with and that I know. And yeah  I get it  I've been there. But  if the merit idea was true  why would identical resumes   in an experiment done in      by Yale  identical resumes sent out for a lab technician  why would Jennifers be deemed less competent  be less likely to be offered the job  and be paid less than Johns. The unconscious bias is there  but we just have to look at how we can move past it. And  you know  it's interesting  there's some research that talks about why this is the case and it's called the merit paradox. And in organizations    and this is kind of ironic    in organizations that talk about merit being their primary value driver in terms of who they hire  they were more likely to hire dudes and more likely to pay the guys more because apparently merit  is a masculine quality. But  hey. So you guys think you've got  a good read on me  you kinda think you know what's up. Can you imagine me running one of these  Can you imagine me walking in and being like   Hey boys  this is what's up. This is how it's done.  Well  I'm glad you can. Because ladies and gentlemen  that's my day job. And the cool thing about it is that it's pretty entertaining. Actually  in places like Malaysia  Muslim women on rigs  isn't even comment worthy. There are that many of them. But  it is entertaining. I remember  I was telling one of the guys   Hey  mate  look  I really want  to learn how to surf.  And he's like   Yassmin  I don't know how you can surf with all that gear you've got on  and I don't know any women only beaches.  And then  the guy came up  with a brilliant idea  he was like   I know  you run that organization Youth Without Borders  right  Why don't you start a clothing line for Muslim chicks in beaches. You can call it  Youth Without Boardshorts.  And I was like   Thanks  guys.  And I remember another bloke  telling me that I should eat all the yogurt I could because that was the only culture  I was going to get around there. But  the problem is  it's kind of true because there's an intense  lack of diversity in our workforce  particularly in places of influence. Now  in       The Australian National University did an experiment where they sent out       identical applications to entry level jobs  essentially. To get the same number of interviews as someone with an Anglo Saxon name  if you were Chinese  you had  to send out    percent more applications. If you were Middle Eastern    Abdel Magied    you had to send out    percent  and if you're Italian   you're pretty lucky  you only have to send out    percent more. In places like Silicon Valley  it's not that much better. In Google  they put out  some diversity results and    percent white     percent Asian and nine  a bunch of blacks  Hispanics  all that kind of thing. And the rest of the tech world is not that much better and they've acknowledged it  but I'm not really sure what they're doing about it. The thing is  it doesn't trickle up. In a study done by Green Park  who are a British senior exec supplier  they said that over half of the FTSE     companies don't have a nonwhite leader at their board level  executive or non executive. And two out of every three don't have an executive who's from a minority. And most of the minorities  that are at that sort of level are non executive board directors. So their influence isn't that great. I've told you a bunch of terrible things. You're like   Oh my god  how bad is that  What can I do about it   Well  fortunately  we've identified that there's a problem. There's a lack of opportunity  and that's due to unconscious bias. But you might be sitting  there thinking   I ain't brown. What's that got to do with me   Let me offer you a solution. And as I've said before  we live in a world where we're looking for an ideal. And if we want to create a world where the circumstances of your birth don't matter  we all have to be part of the solution. And interestingly  the author of the lab resume experiment offered some sort of a solution. She said the one thing that brought the successful women together  the one thing that they had in common  was the fact that they had good mentors. So mentoring  we've all kind of heard that before  it's in the vernacular. Here's another challenge for you. I challenge each and every one of you to mentor someone different. Think about it. Everyone wants to mentor someone who kind of is familiar  who looks like us  we have shared experiences. If I see a Muslim chick  who's got a bit of attitude  I'm like   What's up  We can hang out.  You walk into a room and there's someone who went to the same school  you play the same sports  there's a high chance that you're going to want to help that person out. But for the person in the room who has no shared experiences with you it becomes extremely difficult  to find that connection. The idea of finding someone  different to mentor  someone who doesn't come from the same background as you  whatever that background is  is about opening doors  for people who couldn't even get to the damn hallway. Because ladies and gentlemen  the world is not just. People are not born  with equal opportunity. I was born in one of the poorest cities in the world  Khartoum. I was born brown  I was born female  and I was born Muslim in a world that is pretty suspicious of us for reasons I can't control. However  I also acknowledge the fact that I was born with privilege. I was born with amazing parents  I was given an education and had the blessing of migrating to Australia. But also  I've been blessed with amazing mentors who've opened doors for me  that I didn't even know were there. A mentor who said to me   Hey  your story's interesting. Let's write something about it so that I can share it with people.  A mentor who said   I know you're all those things that don't belong on an Australian rig  but come on anyway.  And here I am  talking to you. And I'm not the only one. There's all sorts of people in my communities that I see have been helped out by mentors. A young Muslim man in Sydney who ended up using his mentor's help to start up a poetry slam in Bankstown and now it's a huge thing. And he's able to change the lives of so many other young people. Or a lady here in Brisbane  an Afghan lady who's a refugee  who could barely speak English when she came to Australia  her mentors helped her become a doctor and she took our Young Queenslander  of the Year Award in     . She's an inspiration. This is so not smooth. This is me. But I'm also the woman in the rig clothes  and I'm also the woman who was in the abaya at the beginning. Would you have chosen to mentor me if you had seen me in one of those other versions of who I am  Because I'm that same person. We have to look past our unconscious bias  find someone to mentor who's at the opposite end of your spectrum because structural change takes time  and I don't have that level of patience. So if we're going to create a change  if we're going to create a world where we all have those kinds of opportunities  then choose to open doors for people. Because you might think that diversity has nothing to do with you  but we are all part of this system and we can all be part of that solution. And if you don't know where to find someone different  go to the places you wouldn't usually go. If you enroll in private high school tutoring  go to your local state school or maybe just drop into your local refugee tutoring center. Or perhaps you work at an office. Take out that new grad who looks totally out of place    'cause that was me    and open doors for them  not in a tokenistic way  because we're not victims  but show them the opportunities because opening up your world will make you realize that  you have access to doors that they didn't even know existed and you didn't even know they didn't have. Ladies and gentlemen  there is a problem in our community with lack of opportunity  especially due to unconscious bias. But each and every one one of you has the potential to change that. I know you've been given a lot of challenges today  but if you can take this one piece and think about it a little differently  because diversity is magic. And I encourage you to look past your initial perceptions because I bet you  they're probably wrong. Thank you. I'm here to tell you about the real search for alien life. Not little green humanoids arriving in shiny UFOs  although that would be nice. But it's the search for planets orbiting stars far away. Every star in our sky is a sun. And if our sun has planets    Mercury  Venus  Earth  Mars  etc.  surely those other stars should have planets also  and they do. And in the last two decades  astronomers have found thousands of exoplanets. Our night sky is literally teeming with exoplanets. We know  statistically speaking  that every star has at least one planet. And in the search for planets  and in the future  planets that might be like Earth  we're able to help address some of the most amazing and mysterious questions that have faced humankind for centuries. Why are we here  Why does our universe exist  How did Earth form and evolve  How and why did life originate and populate our planet  The second question that we often think about is  Are we alone  Is there life out there  Who is out there  You know  this question has been around for thousands of years  since at least the time of the Greek philosophers. But I'm here to tell you just how close we're getting to finding out the answer to this question. It's the first time in human history that this really is within reach for us. Now when I think about the possibilities for life out there  I think of the fact that our sun is but one of many stars. This is a photograph of a real galaxy  we think our Milky Way looks like this galaxy. It's a collection of bound stars. But our  sun  is one of hundreds of billions of stars and our galaxy is one of upwards of hundreds of billions of galaxies. Knowing that small planets are very common  you can just do the math. And there are just so many stars and so many planets out there  that surely  there must be life somewhere out there. Well  the biologists get furious with me for saying that  because we have absolutely no evidence for life beyond Earth yet. Well  if we were able to look at our galaxy from the outside and zoom in to where our sun is  we see a real map of the stars. And the highlighted stars are those with known exoplanets. This is really just the tip of the iceberg. Here  this animation is zooming in onto our solar system. And you'll see here the planets as well as some spacecraft that are also orbiting our sun. Now if we can imagine going to the West Coast of North America  and looking out at the night sky  here's what we'd see on a spring night. And you can see the constellations overlaid and again  so many stars with planets. There's a special patch of the sky where we have thousands of planets. This is where the Kepler Space Telescope focused for many years. Let's zoom in and look at one of the favorite exoplanets. This star is called Kepler    f. It's a system of about five planets. And by the way  most of these exoplanets  we don't know too much about. We know their size  and their orbit and things like that. But there's a very special planet here called Kepler    f. This planet is in a zone that is not too far from the star  so that the temperature may be just right for life. Here  the artist's conception is just zooming in and showing you what that planet might be like. So  many people have this romantic notion of astronomers going to the telescope on a lonely mountaintop and looking at the spectacular night sky through a big telescope. But actually  we just work on our computers like everyone else  and we get our data by email or downloading from a database. So instead of coming here to tell you about the somewhat tedious nature of the data and data analysis and the complex computer models we make  I have a different way to try to explain to you some of the things that we're thinking about exoplanets. Here's a travel poster   Kepler    f  Where the grass is always redder on the other side.  That's because Kepler    f orbits a red star  and we're just speculating that perhaps the plants there  if there is vegetation that does photosynthesis  it has different pigments and looks red.  Enjoy the gravity on HD      g  a Super Earth.  This planet is more massive than Earth and has a higher surface gravity.  Relax on Kepler   b  where your shadow always has company.  We know of a dozen planets that orbit two stars  and there's likely many more out there. If we could visit one of those planets  you literally would see two sunsets and have two shadows. So actually  science fiction got some things right. Tatooine from Star Wars. And I have a couple of other favorite exoplanets to tell you about. This one is Kepler   b  it's a hot  hot planet. It orbits over    times closer to its star than our Earth does to our sun. And actually  it's so hot  we can't visit any of these planets  but if we could  we would melt long before we got there. We think the surface is hot enough to melt rock and has liquid lava lakes. Gliese     b. This planet  we know the mass and the size and it has a fairly low density. It's somewhat warm. We actually don't know really anything about this planet  but one possibility is that it's a water world  like a scaled up version of one of Jupiter's icy moons that might be    percent water by mass. And in this case  it would have a thick steam atmosphere overlaying an ocean  not of liquid water  but of an exotic form of water  a superfluid    not quite a gas  not quite a liquid. And under that wouldn't be rock  but a form of high pressure ice  like ice IX. So out of all these planets out there  and the variety is just simply astonishing  we mostly want to find the planets that are Goldilocks planets  we call them. Not too big  not too small  not too hot  not too cold    but just right for life. But to do that  we'd have to be able to look at the planet's atmosphere  because the atmosphere acts like a blanket trapping heat    the greenhouse effect. We have to be able to assess the greenhouse gases on other planets. Well  science fiction got some things wrong. The Star Trek Enterprise had to travel vast distances at incredible speeds to orbit other planets so that First Officer Spock could analyze the atmosphere to see if the planet was habitable or if there were lifeforms there. Well  we don't need to travel at warp speeds to see other planet atmospheres  although I don't want to dissuade any budding engineers from figuring out how to do that. We actually can and do study planet atmospheres from here  from Earth orbit. This is a picture  a photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope taken by the shuttle Atlantis as it was departing after the last human space flight to Hubble. They installed a new camera  actually  that we use for exoplanet atmospheres. And so far  we've been able to study dozens of exoplanet atmospheres  about six of them in great detail. But those are not small planets like Earth. They're big  hot planets that are easy to see. We're not ready  we don't have the right technology yet to study small exoplanets. But nevertheless  I wanted to try to explain to you how we study exoplanet atmospheres. I want you to imagine  for a moment  a rainbow. And if we could look at this rainbow closely  we would see that some dark lines are missing. And here's our sun  the white light of our sun split up  not by raindrops  but by a spectrograph. And you can see all these dark  vertical lines. Some are very narrow  some are wide  some are shaded at the edges. And this is actually how astronomers have studied objects in the heavens  literally  for over a century. So here  each different atom and molecule has a special set of lines  a fingerprint  if you will. And that's how we study exoplanet atmospheres. And I'll just never forget when I started working on exoplanet atmospheres    years ago  how many people told me   This will never happen. We'll never be able to study them. Why are you bothering   And that's why I'm pleased to tell you about all the atmospheres studied now  and this is really a field of its own. So when it comes to other planets  other Earths  in the future when we can observe them  what kind of gases would we be looking for  Well  you know  our own Earth has oxygen in the atmosphere to    percent by volume. That's a lot of oxygen. But without plants and photosynthetic life  there would be no oxygen  virtually no oxygen in our atmosphere. So oxygen is here because of life. And our goal then is to look for gases in other planet atmospheres  gases that don't belong  that we might be able to attribute to life. But which molecules should we search for  I actually told you how diverse exoplanets are. We expect that to continue in the future when we find other Earths. And that's one of the main things I'm working on now  I have a theory about this. It reminds me that nearly every day  I receive an email or emails from someone with a crazy theory about physics of gravity or cosmology or some such. So  please don't email me one of your crazy theories. Well  I had my own crazy theory. But  who does the MIT professor go to  Well  I emailed a Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine and he said   Sure  come and talk to me.  So I brought my two biochemistry friends and we went to talk to him about our crazy theory. And that theory was that life produces all small molecules  so many molecules. Like  everything I could think of  but not being a chemist. Think about it  carbon dioxide  carbon monoxide  molecular hydrogen  molecular nitrogen  methane  methyl chloride    so many gases. They also exist for other reasons  but just life even produces ozone. So we go to talk to him about this  and immediately  he shot down the theory. He found an example that didn't exist. So  we went back to the drawing board and we think we have found something very interesting in another field. But back to exoplanets  the point is that life produces so many different types of gases  literally thousands of gases. And so what we're doing now is just trying to figure out on which types of exoplanets  which gases could be attributed to life. And so when it comes time when we find gases in exoplanet atmospheres that we won't know if they're being produced by intelligent aliens or by trees  or a swamp  or even just by simple  single celled microbial life. So working on the models and thinking about biochemistry  it's all well and good. But a really big challenge ahead of us is  how  How are we going to find these planets  There are actually many ways to find planets  several different ways. But the one that I'm most focused on is how can we open a gateway so that in the future  we can find hundreds of Earths. We have a real shot at finding signs of life. And actually  I just finished leading a two year project in this very special phase of a concept we call the starshade. And the starshade is a very specially shaped screen and the goal is to fly that starshade so it blocks out the light of a star so that the telescope can see the planets directly. Here  you can see myself and two team members holding up one small part of the starshade. It's shaped like a giant flower  and this is one of the prototype petals. The concept is that a starshade and telescope could launch together  with the petals unfurling from the stowed position. The central truss would expand  with the petals snapping into place. Now  this has to be made very precisely  literally  the petals to microns and they have to deploy to millimeters. And this whole structure would have to fly tens of thousands of kilometers away from the telescope. It's about tens of meters in diameter. And the goal is to block out the starlight to incredible precision so that we'd be able to see the planets directly. And it has to be a very special shape  because of the physics of defraction. Now this is a real project that we worked on  literally  you would not believe how hard. Just so you believe it's not just in movie format  here's a real photograph of a second generation starshade deployment test bed in the lab. And in this case  I just wanted you to know that that central truss has heritage left over from large radio deployables in space. So after all of that hard work where we try to think of all the crazy gases that might be out there  and we build the very complicated space telescopes that might be out there  what are we going to find  Well  in the best case  we will find an image of another exo Earth. Here is Earth as a pale blue dot. And this is actually a real photograph of Earth taken by the Voyager   spacecraft  four billion miles away. And that red light is just scattered light in the camera optics. But what's so awesome to consider is that if there are intelligent aliens orbiting on a planet around a star near to us and they build complicated space telescopes of the kind that we're trying to build  all they'll see is this pale blue dot  a pinprick of light. And so sometimes  when I pause to think about my professional struggle and huge ambition  it's hard to think about that in contrast to the vastness of the universe. But nonetheless  I am devoting the rest of my life to finding another Earth. And I can guarantee that in the next generation of space telescopes  in the second generation  we will have the capability to find and identity other Earths. And the capability to split up the starlight so that we can look for gases and assess the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  estimate the surface temperature  and look for signs of life. But there's more. In this case of searching for other planets like Earth  we are making a new kind of map of the nearby stars and of the planets orbiting them  including  planets  that actually might be inhabitable by humans. And so I envision that our descendants  hundreds of years from now  will embark on an interstellar journey to other worlds. And they will look back at all of us as the generation who first found the Earth like worlds. Thank you. June Cohen  And I give you  for a question  Rosetta Mission Manager Fred Jansen. Fred Jansen  You mentioned halfway through that the technology to actually look at the spectrum of an exoplanet like Earth is not there yet. When do you expect this will be there  and what's needed  Actually  what we expect is what we call our next generation Hubble telescope. And this is called the James Webb Space Telescope  and that will launch in       and that's what we're going to do  we're going to look at a special kind of planet called transient exoplanets  and that will be our first shot at studying small planets for gases that might indicate the planet is habitable. JC  I'm going to ask you one follow up question  too  Sara  as the generalist. So I am really struck by the notion in your career of the opposition you faced  that when you began thinking about exoplanets  there was extreme skepticism in the scientific community that they existed  and you proved them wrong. What did it take to take that on  SS  Well  the thing is that as scientists  we're supposed to be skeptical  because our job to make sure that what the other person is saying actually makes sense or not. But being a scientist  I think you've seen it from this session  it's like being an explorer. You have this immense curiosity  this stubbornness  this sort of resolute will that you will go forward no matter what other people say. JC  I love that. Thank you  Sara. Now  I've been making pictures for quite a long time  and normally speaking  a picture like this  for me  should be straightforward. I'm in southern Ethiopia. I'm with the Daasanach. There's a big family  there's a very beautiful tree  and I make these pictures with this very large  extremely cumbersome  very awkward technical plate film camera. Does anybody know  x  and   x  sheets of film  and you're setting it up  putting it on the tripod. I've got the family  spent the better part of a day talking with them. They sort of understand what I'm on about. They think I'm a bit crazy  but that's another story. And what's most important for me is the beauty and the aesthetic  and that's based on the light. So the light's setting on my left hand side  and there's a balance in the communication with the Daasanach  the family of     all ages. There's babies and there's grandparents  I'm getting them in the tree and waiting for the light to set  and it's going  going  and I've got one sheet of film left  and I think  I'm okay  I'm in control  I'm in control. I'm setting it up and I'm setting up  and the light's just about to go  and I want it to be golden  I want it to be beautiful. I want it to be hanging on the horizon so it lights these people  in all the potential glory that they could be presented. And it's about to go  and it's about to go  and I put my sheet in the camera  it's all focused  and all of a sudden there's a massive  whack   and I'm looking around  and in the top corner of the tree  one of the girls slaps the girl next to her  and the girl next to her pulls her hair  and all hell breaks loose  and I'm standing there going   But the light  the light. Wait  I need the light. Stay still  Stay still   And they start screaming  and then one of the men turns around and starts screaming  shouting  and the whole tree collapses  not the tree  but the people in the tree. They're all running around screaming  and they run back off into the village in this sort of cloud of smoke  and I'm left there standing behind my tripod. I've got my sheet  and the light's gone  and I can't make the picture. Where have they all gone  I had no idea. It took me a week  it took me a week to make the picture which you see here today  and I'll tell you why.  Applause  It's very  very  very simple    I spent a week going around the village  and I went to every single one   Hello  can you meet at the tree  What's your story  Who are you   And it all turned out to be about a boyfriend  for crying out loud. I mean  I have teenage kids. I should know. It was about a boyfriend. The girl on the top  she'd kissed the wrong boy  and they'd started having a fight. And there was a very  very beautiful lesson for me in that  If I was going to photograph these people in the dignified  respectful way that I had intended  and put them on a pedestal  I had to understand them. It wasn't just about turning up. It wasn't just about shaking a hand. It wasn't about just saying   I'm Jimmy  I'm a photographer.  I had to get to know every single one of them  right down to whose boyfriend is who and who is allowed to kiss who. So in the end  a week later  and I was absolutely exhausted  I mean on my knees going   Please get back up in that tree. It's a picture I need to make.  They all came back. I put them all back up in the tree. I made sure the girls were in the right position  and the ones that slapped  one was over there. They did look at each other. If you look at it later  they're staring at each other very angrily  and I've got the tree and everything  and then at the last minute  I go   The goat  the goat  I need something for the eye to look at. I need a white goat in the middle.  So I swapped all the goats around. I put the goats in. But even then I got it wrong  because if you can see on the left hand side  another little boy storms off because I didn't choose his goat. So the moral being I have to learn to speak Goat as well as Daasanach. But anyway  the effort that goes into that picture and the story that I've just related to you  as you can imagine  there are hundreds of other bizarre  eccentric stories of hundreds of other people around the world. And this was about four years ago  and I set off on a journey  to be honest  a very indulgent journey. I'm a real romantic. I'm an idealist  perhaps in some ways naive. But I truly believe that there are people on the planet that are beautiful. It's very  very simple. It's not rocket science. I wanted to put these people on a pedestal. I wanted to put them on a pedestal like they'd never been seen before. So  I chose about    different groups  tribes  indigenous cultures. They were chosen purely because of their aesthetic  and I'll talk more about that later. I'm not an anthropologist  I have no technical study with the subject  but I do have a very  very  very deep passion  and I believe that I had to choose the most beautiful people on the planet in the most beautiful environment that they lived in  and put the two together and present them to you. About a year ago  I published the first pictures  and something extraordinarily exciting happened. The whole world came running  and it was a bizarre experience  because everybody  from everywhere   Who are they  What are they  How many are they  Where did you find them  Are they real  You faked it. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me.  Millions of questions for which  to be honest  I don't have the answers. I really didn't have the answers  and I could sort of understand  okay  they're beautiful  that was my intention  but the questions that I was being fired at  I could not answer them. Until  it was quite amusing  about a year ago somebody said   You've been invited to do a TED Talk.  And I said   Ted  Ted  Who's Ted  I haven't met Ted before.  He said   No  a TED Talk.  I said   But who's Ted  Do I have to talk to him or do we sit with each other on the stage   And   No  no  the TED group. You must know about it.  And I said   I've been in a teepee and in a yurt for the last five years. How do I know who Ted is  Introduce me to him.  Anyway  to cut a long story short  he said   We have to do a TED Talk.  Researched. Oh  exciting. That's great  And then eventually you're going to go to TEDGlobal. Even more exciting. But what you need to do  you need to teach the people lessons  lessons that you've learned on your travels around the world with these tribes. I thought  lessons  okay  well  what did I learn  Good question. Three. You need three lessons  and they need to be terribly profound. And I thought  three lessons  well  I'm going to think about it. So I thought long and hard  and I stood here two days ago  and I had my test run  and I had my cards and my clicker in my hands and my pictures were on the screen  and I had my three lessons  and I started presenting them  and I had this very odd out of body experience. I sort of looked at myself standing there  going   Oh  Jimmy  this is complete loads of codswallop. All these people sitting here  they've had more of these talks  they've heard more lessons in their life. Who are you to tell them what you've learned  Who are you to guide them and who are you to show them what is right  what is wrong  what these people have to say   And I had a little bit of a  it was very private  a little bit of a meltdown. I went back  and a little bit like the boy walking away from the tree with his goats  very disgruntled  going  that didn't work  It wasn't what I wanted to communicate. And I thought long and hard about it  and I thought  well  the only thing I can communicate is very  very basic. You have to turn it all the way around. There's only one person I know here  and that's me. I'm still getting to know myself  and it's a lifelong journey  and I probably won't have all the answers  but I did learn some extraordinary things on this journey. So what I'm going to do is share with you my lessons. It's a very  as I explained at the beginning  very indulgent  very personal  how and why I made these pictures  and I leave it to you as the audience to interpret what these lessons have meant to me  what they could perhaps mean to you. I traveled enormously as a child. I was very nomadic. It was actually very exciting. All around the world  and I had this feeling that I was pushed off at great speed to become somebody  become that individual  Jimmy. Go off into the planet  and so I ran  and I ran  and my wife sometimes kids me   Jimmy  you look a bit like Forrest Gump   but I'm   No  it's all about something  trust me.  So I kept running and I kept running  and I sort of got somewhere and I sort of stood there and looked around me and I thought  well  where do I belong  Where do I fit  What am I  Where am I from  I had no idea. So I hope there aren't too many psychologists in this audience. Perhaps part of this journey is about me trying to find out where I belonged. So whilst going  and don't worry  I didn't when I arrived with these tribes  I didn't paint myself yellow and run around with these spears and loincloths. But what I did find were people that belonged themselves  and they inspired me  some extraordinary people  and I'd like to introduce you to some heroes of mine. They're the Huli. Now  the Huli are some of the most extraordinarily beautiful people on the planet. They're proud. They live in the Papua New Guinean highlands. There's not many of them left  and they're called the Huli wigmen. And images like this  I mean  this is what it's all about for me. And you've spent weeks and months there talking with them  getting there  and I want to put them on a pedestal  and I said   You have something that many people have not seen. You sit in this stunning nature.  And it really does look like this  and they really do look like this. This is the real thing. And you know why they're proud  You know why they look like this  and why I broke my back literally to photograph them and present them to you  It's because they have these extraordinary rituals. And the Huli have this ritual  When they're teenagers  becoming a man  they have to shave their heads  and they spend the rest of their life shaving their heads every single day  and what they do with that hair  they make it into a creation  a creation that's a very personal creation. It's their creation. It's their Huli creation. So they're called the Huli wigmen. That's a wig on his head. It's all made out of his human hair. And then they decorate that wig with the feathers of the birds of paradise  and don't worry  there are many birds there. There's very few people living  so nothing to get too upset about  and they spend the rest of their life recreating these hats and getting further and further  and it's extraordinary  and there's another group  they're called the Kalam  and they live in the next valley  but they speak a completely different language  they look completely different  and they wear a hat  and it's built out of scarabs  these fantastic emerald green little scarabs  and sometimes there are       or       scarabs in this hat  and they spend the whole of their life collecting these scarabs to build these hats. So the Huli inspired me in that they belong. Perhaps I have to work harder at finding a ritual which matters for me and going back into my past to see where I actually fit. An extremely important part of this project was about how I photograph these extraordinary people. And it's basically beauty. I think beauty matters. We spend the whole of our existence revolving around beauty  beautiful places  beautiful things  and ultimately  beautiful people. It's very  very  very significant. I've spent all of my life analyzing what do I look like  Am I perceived as beautiful  Does it matter if I'm a beautiful person or not  or is it purely based on my aesthetic  And then when I went off  I came to a very narrow conclusion. Do I have to go around the world photographing  excuse me  women between the age of    and     Is that what beauty is going to be  Is everything before and after that utterly irrelevant  And it was only until I went on a journey  a journey that was so extreme  I still get shivers when I think about it. I went to a part of the world  and I don't know whether any of you have ever heard of Chukotka. Has anybody ever heard of Chukotka  Chukotka probably is  technically  as far as one can go and still be on the living planet. It's    hours' flight from Moscow. First you've got to get to Moscow  and then    hours' flight nonstop from Moscow. And that's if you get there. As you can see  some people sort of miss the runway. And then when you land there  in Chukotka are the Chukchis. Now  the Chukchis are the last indigenous Inuits of Siberia  and they're people I'd heard about  I'd hardly seen any images of  but I knew they were there  and I'd been in touch with this guide  and this guide said   There's this fantastic tribe. There's only about    of them. You'll be okay. We'll find them.  So off we went on this journey. When we arrived there  after a month of traveling across the ice  and we'd got to them  but then I was not allowed to photograph them. They said   You cannot photograph us. You have to wait. You have to wait until you get to know us. You have to wait until you understand us. You have to wait until you see how we interact with one another.  And only then  it was many  many weeks later  I saw a respect. They had zero judgment. They observed one another  from the youth  from the middle aged to the old. They need each other. The children need to chew the meat all day because the adults don't have any teeth  but at the same time  the children take the old aged people out to the toilet because they're infirm  so there's this fantastic community of respect. And they adore and admire one another  and they truly taught me what beauty was. Now I'm going to ask for a little bit of audience interaction. This is extremely important for the end of my talk. If you could look at somebody left to the right of you  and I want you to observe them  and I want you to give them a compliment. This is very important. Now  it may be their nose or their hair or even their aura  I don't mind  but please look at each other  give them a compliment. You have to be quick  because I'm running out of time. And you have to remember it. Okay  thank you  thank you  thank you  you've given each other compliments. Hold that compliment very  very tightly. Hold it for later. And the last thing  it was extraordinarily profound  and it happened only two weeks ago. Two weeks ago I went back to the Himba. Now  the Himba live in northern Namibia on the border of Angola  and I'd been there a few times before  and I'd gone back to present this book I'd made  to show them the pictures  to get into a discussion with them  to say   This is how I saw you. This is how I love you. This is how I respect you. What do you think  Am I right  Am I wrong   So I wanted this debate. It was very  very  very emotional  and one night we were sitting around the campfire  and I have to be honest  I think I'd had a little bit too much to drink  and I was sort of sitting under the stars going   This is great  you've seen my pictures  we love each other.   Laughter  And I'm a little bit slow  and I looked around me  and I said  I thought  maybe  the fence is missing. Wasn't there a fence here last time I came  You know  this big protective fence around the village  and they sort of looked at me and go   Yeah  chief die.  And I thought  okay  chief dying  right  you know  look up at the stars again  look at the campfire. Chief die. What on Earth does chief die have to do with the fence   Chief die. First we destroy  yeah  Then we reflect. Then we rebuild. Then we respect.  And I burst out in tears  because my father had only just died prior to this journey  and I didn't ever acknowledge him  I didn't ever appreciate him for the fact that I'm probably standing here today because of him. These people taught me that we are only who we are because of our parents and our grandparents and our forefathers going on and on and on before that  and I  no matter how romantic or how idealistic I am on this journey  I did not know that until two weeks ago. I did not know that until two weeks ago. So what's this all about  Well  there's an image I'd like to show you  quite a special image  and it wasn't essentially the image I wanted to choose. I was sitting there the other day  and I have to finish on a strong image. And somebody said   You have to show them the picture of the Nenets. The Nenets.  I was like  yeah  but that's not my favorite picture. She went   No no no no no no no. It's an amazing picture. You're in his eyes.  I said   What do you mean I'm in his eyes  It's a picture of the Nenets.  She said   No  look  look closely  you're in his eyes.  And when you look closely at this picture  there is a reflection of me in his eyes  so I think perhaps he has my soul  and I'm in his soul  and whilst these pictures look at you  I ask you to look at them. You may not be reflected in his eyes  but there is something extraordinarily important about these people. I don't ultimately have the answers  as I've just shared with you  but you must do. There must be something there. So if you can briefly reflect on what I was discussing about beauty and about belonging and about our ancestors and our roots  and I need you all to stand for me  please. Now you have no excuse. It's almost lunchtime  and this is not a standing ovation  so don't worry  I'm not fishing for compliments. But you were given a compliment a few minutes ago. Now I want you to stand tall. I want you to breathe in. This is what I say. I'm not going to get on my knees for two weeks. I'm not going to ask you to carry a goat  and I know you don't have any camels. Photography's extraordinarily powerful. It's this language which we now all understand. We truly do all understand it  and we have this global digital fireplace  don't we  but I want to share you with the world  because you are also a tribe. You are the TED tribe  yeah  But you have to remember that compliment. You have to stand tall  breathe in through your nose  and I'm going to photograph you. Okay  I need to do a panoramic shot  so it's going to take a minute  so you have to concentrate  okay  Breathe in  stand tall  no laughing. Shh  breathe through your nose. I'm going to photograph. Thank you.
