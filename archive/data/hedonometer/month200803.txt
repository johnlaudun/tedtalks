A great way to start  I think  with my view of simplicity is to take a look at TED. Here you are  understanding why we're here  what's going on with no difficulty at all. The best A.I. in the planet would find it complex and confusing  and my little dog Watson would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point. He would have a great time. And of course  if you're a speaker here  like Hans Rosling  a speaker finds this complex  tricky. But in Hans Rosling's case  he had a secret weapon yesterday  literally  in his sword swallowing act. And I must say  I thought of quite a few objects that I might try to swallow today and finally gave up on  but he just did it and that was a wonderful thing. So Puck meant not only are we fools in the pejorative sense  but that we're easily fooled. In fact  what Shakespeare was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled  so we're actually looking forward to it. We go to magic shows in order to be fooled. And this makes many things fun  but it makes it difficult to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves. And our friend  Betty Edwards  the  Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain  lady  shows these two tables to her drawing class and says   The problem you have with learning to draw is not that you can't move your hand  but that the way your brain perceives images is faulty. It's trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing what's there.  And to prove it  she says   The exact size and shape of these tabletops is the same  and I'm going to prove it to you.  She does this with cardboard  but since I have an expensive computer here I'll just rotate this little guy around and ... Now having seen that    and I've seen it hundreds of times  because I use this in every talk I give    I still can't see that they're the same size and shape  and I doubt that you can either. So what do artists do  Well  what artists do is to measure. They measure very  very carefully. And if you measure very  very carefully with a stiff arm and a straight edge  you'll see that those two shapes are exactly the same size. And the Talmud saw this a long time ago  saying   We see things not as they are  but as we are.  I certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight back then  if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion. So if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are  then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here. It's a waking dream  and understanding that that is what we actually exist in is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history. And what that means   simple and understandable  might not be actually simple or understandable  and things we think are  complex  might be made simple and understandable. Somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws. We can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel. The way I think of it is  we can't learn to see until we admit we're blind. Once you start down at this very humble level  then you can start finding ways to see things. And what's happened  over the last     years in particular  is that human beings have invented  brainlets     little additional parts for our brain    made out of powerful ideas that help us see the world in different ways. And these are in the form of sensory apparatus    telescopes  microscopes    reasoning apparatus    various ways of thinking    and  most importantly  in the ability to change perspective on things. I'll talk about that a little bit. It's this change in perspective on what it is we think we're perceiving that has helped us make more progress in the last     years than we have in the rest of human history. And yet  it is not taught in any K through    curriculum in America that I'm aware of. So one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more. We like more. If we do more in a kind of a stupid way  the simplicity gets complex and  in fact  we can keep on doing it for a very long time. But Murray Gell Mann yesterday talked about emergent properties  another name for them could be  architecture  as a metaphor for taking the same old material and thinking about non obvious  non simple ways of combining it. And in fact  what Murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature    of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar    all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles are both sticky and standoffish  and they're in violent motion. Those three things give rise to all the different levels of what seem to be complexity in our world. But how simple  So  when I saw Roslings' Gapminder stuff a few years ago  I just thought it was the greatest thing I'd seen in conveying complex ideas simply. But then I had a thought of   Boy  maybe it's too simple.  And I put some effort in to try and check to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side  and I found that they matched up very well. So the Roslings have been able to do simplicity without removing what's important about the data. Whereas the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell  as a former molecular biologist  I didn't like that at all. Not because it wasn't beautiful or anything  but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology  and that is  why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed  And what we saw yesterday was every reaction was fortuitous  they just swooped in the air and bound  and something happened. But in fact  those molecules are spinning at the rate of about a million revolutions per second  they're agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds  they're completely crowded together  they're jammed  they're bashing up against each other. And if you don't understand that in your mental model of this stuff  what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous  and I think that's exactly the wrong image for when you're trying to teach science. So  another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication with the actual understanding of some principle. So a kid who's    in high school gets this version of the Pythagorean theorem  which is a truly subtle and interesting proof  but in fact it's not a good way to start learning about mathematics. So a more direct one  one that gives you more of the feeling of math  is something closer to Pythagoras' own proof  which goes like this  so here we have this triangle  and if we surround that C square with three more triangles and we copy that  notice that we can move those triangles down like this. And that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ... and bingo. That is all you have to do. And this kind of proof is the kind of proof that you need to learn when you're learning mathematics in order to get an idea of what it means before you look into the  literally        or       proofs of Pythagoras' theorem that have been discovered. Now let's go to young children. This is a very unusual teacher who was a kindergarten and first grade teacher  but was a natural mathematician. So she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music but is a terrific musician  she just had a feeling for math. And here are her six year olds  and she's got them making shapes out of a shape. So they pick a shape they like    like a diamond  or a square  or a triangle  or a trapezoid    and then they try and make the next larger shape of that same shape  and the next larger shape. You can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there. And what this teacher did on every project was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project  and then something like science. So they had created these artifacts. Now she had them look at them and do this ... laborious  which I thought for a long time  until she explained to me was to slow them down so they'll think. So they're cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here and pasting them up. But the whole point of this thing is for them to look at this chart and fill it out.  What have you noticed about what you did   And so six year old Lauren there noticed that the first one took one  and the second one took three more and the total was four on that one  the third one took five more and the total was nine on that one  and then the next one. She saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add around the edges was always going to grow by two  so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there. And she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six  where she wasn't sure what six times six was and what seven times seven was  but then she was confident again. So that's what Lauren did. And then the teacher  Gillian Ishijima  had the kids bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor  and everybody went batshit   Holy shit  They're the same   No matter what the shapes were  the growth law is the same. And the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progressions as a first order discrete differential equation and a second order discrete differential equation  derived by six year olds. Well  that's pretty amazing. That isn't what we usually try to teach six year olds. So  let's take a look now at how we might use the computer for some of this. And so the first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children do. I'm using the software that we're putting on the      laptop. So I'd like to draw a little car here    I'll just do this very quickly    and put a big tire on him. And I get a little object here and I can look inside this object  I'll call it a car. And here's a little behavior  car forward. Each time I click it  car turn. If I want to make a little script to do this over and over again  I just drag these guys out and set them going. And I can try steering the car here by ... See the car turn by five here  So what if I click this down to zero  It goes straight. That's a big revelation for nine year olds. Make it go in the other direction. But of course  that's a little bit like kissing your sister as far as driving a car  so the kids want to do a steering wheel  so they draw a steering wheel. And we'll call this a wheel. See this wheel's heading here  If I turn this wheel  you can see that number over there going minus and positive. That's kind of an invitation to pick up this name of those numbers coming out there and to just drop it into the script here  and now I can steer the car with the steering wheel. And it's interesting. You know how much trouble the children have with variables  but by learning it this way  in a situated fashion  they never forget from this single trial what a variable is and how to use it. And we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did. So if you look at the little script here  the speed is always going to be   . We're going to move the car according to that over and over again. And I'm dropping a little dot for each one of these things  they're evenly spaced because they're    apart. And what if I do this progression that the six year olds did of saying   OK  I'm going to increase the speed by two each time  and then I'm going to increase the distance by the speed each time  What do I get there   We get a visual pattern of what these nine year olds called acceleration. So how do the children do science  Student    Ooh  this is nice. Teacher  Do not pay any attention to what anybody else is doing. Who's got the apple  Alan Kay  They've got little stopwatches. Student    What did you get  What did you get  AK  Stopwatches aren't accurate enough. Student     .   seconds. Teacher  So put  sponge ball  ... Student  l   I decided to  do the shot put and the sponge ball because they're two totally different weights  and if you drop them at the same time  maybe they'll drop at the same speed. Teacher  Drop. Class  Whoa  AK  So obviously  Aristotle never asked a child about this particular point because  of course  he didn't bother doing the experiment  and neither did St. Thomas Aquinas. And it was not until Galileo actually did it that an adult thought like a child  only     years ago. We get one child like that about every classroom of    kids who will actually cut straight to the chase. Now  what if we want to look at this more closely  We can take a movie of what's going on  but even if we single stepped this movie  it's tricky to see what's going on. And so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up. So when the children see this  they say   Ah  Acceleration   remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways  and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is. So what I'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image  about a fifth of a second later  like that. And they're getting faster and faster each time  and if I stack these guys up  then we see the differences  the increase in the speed is constant. And they say   Oh  yeah. Constant acceleration. We've done that already.  And how shall we look and verify that we actually have it  So you can't tell much from just making the ball drop there  but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time  we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model. Galileo  by the way  did this very cleverly by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute. I pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that this is actually probably a Newton and the apple type story  but it's a great story. And I thought I would do just one thing on the      laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here. So once you have gravity  here's this    increase the speed by something  increase the ship's speed. If I start the little game here that the kids have done  it'll crash the space ship. But if I oppose gravity  here we go ... Oops  One more. Yeah  there we go. Yeah  OK  I guess the best way to end this is with two quotes  Marshall McLuhan said   Children are the messages that we send to the future   but in fact  if you think of it  children are the future we send to the future. Forget about messages  children are the future  and children in the first and second world and  most especially  in the third world need mentors. And this summer  we're going to build five million of these      laptops  and maybe    million next year. But we couldn't create       new teachers this summer to save our life. That means that we  once again  have a thing where we can put technology out  but the mentoring that is required to go from a simple new iChat instant messaging system to something with depth is missing. I believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface  and this new kind of user interface could be done with an expenditure of about     million dollars. It sounds like a lot  but it is literally    minutes of what we're spending in Iraq    we're spending   billion dollars a month     minutes is     million dollars    so this is actually cheap. And Einstein said   Things should be as simple as possible  but not simpler.  Thank you. You know  I've talked about some of these projects before    about the human genome and what that might mean  and discovering new sets of genes. We're actually starting at a new point  we've been digitizing biology  and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life. So  we've always been trying to ask big questions.  What is life   is something that I think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels. We've tried various approaches  paring it down to minimal components. We've been digitizing it now for almost    years  when we sequenced the human genome  it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer. Now we're trying to ask   Can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe   This is the map of a small organism  Mycoplasma genitalium  that has the smallest genome for a species that can self replicate in the laboratory  and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome. We're able to knock out on the order of     genes out of the     or so that are here. When we look at its metabolic map  it's relatively simple compared to ours    trust me  this is simple    but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time  it's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell. So we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions. And so we started down the road of  can we synthesize a chromosome  Can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we've never been before  And if we do  can we boot up a chromosome  A chromosome  by the way  is just a piece of inert chemical material. So  our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace. Our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing  and our latest point would put it on  now  an exponential curve. We started this over    years ago. It took several stages  in fact  starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments. But it turns out synthesizing DNA is very difficult. There are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA       to    letters in length    and it's a degenerate process  so the longer you make the piece  the more errors there are. So we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors. And this was our first attempt  starting with the digital information of the genome of phi X   . It's a small virus that kills bacteria. We designed the pieces  went through our error correction and had a DNA molecule of about       letters. The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria  and the bacteria started to read this genetic code  made the viral particles. The viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the E. coli. I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they clearly understood that model. They laughed more than you guys are.  Laughter  And so  we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system. But we wanted to go much larger  we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome    it's over         letters of genetic code    so we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are. Design is critical  and if you're starting with digital information in the computer  that digital information has to be really accurate. When we first sequenced this genome in       the standard of accuracy was one error per        base pairs. We actually found  on resequencing it     errors  had we used that original sequence  it never would have been able to be booted up. Part of the design is designing pieces that are    letters long that have to overlap with all the other    letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together. We design unique elements into this. You may have read that we put watermarks in. Think of this  we have a four letter genetic code    A  C  G and T. Triplets of those letters code for roughly    amino acids  such that there's a single letter designation for each of the amino acids. So we can use the genetic code to write out words  sentences  thoughts. Initially  all we did was autograph it. Some people were disappointed there was not poetry. We designed these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes  there are enzymes that repair them and put them together. And we started making pieces  starting with pieces that were       to       letters  put those together to make        letter pieces  then put sets of those going up to       . At each stage  we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust that you can see in a minute. We're trying to get to the point of automation. So  this looks like a basketball playoff. When we get into these really large pieces over         base pairs  they won't any longer grow readily in E. coli    it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology    and so we turned to other mechanisms. We knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together. Here's an example of it  there's an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation. You can see in the top panel  its chromosome just gets blown apart. Twelve to    hours later  it put it back together exactly as it was before. We have thousands of organisms that can do this. These organisms can be totally desiccated  they can live in a vacuum. I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space  move around  find a new aqueous environment. In fact  NASA has shown a lot of this is out there. Here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes  actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in  yeast puts them together automatically. This is not an electron micrograph  this is just a regular photomicrograph. It's such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope. These are pictures over about a six second period. So  this is the publication we had just a short while ago. This is over         letters of genetic code  it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure. It's over     million molecular weight. If we printed it out at a    font with no spacing  it takes     pages just to print this genetic code. Well  how do we boot up a chromosome  How do we activate this  Obviously  with a virus it's pretty simple  it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria. It's also simpler when you go into eukaryotes like ourselves  you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one  and that's what you've all heard about with cloning. With bacteria and Archaea  the chromosome is integrated into the cell  but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it. We purified a chromosome from one microbial species    roughly  these two are as distant as human and mice    we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome  we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins  and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell    and you'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here. The new chromosome went into the cell. In fact  we thought this might be as far as it went  but we tried to design the process a little bit further. This is a major mechanism of evolution right here. We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere  adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species. So  people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology. There are enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest DNA. The chromosome that was in the cell doesn't have one  the chromosome we put in does. It got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material  chewed it up  and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome. It turned blue because of the genes we put in it. And with a very short period of time  all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell. All the proteins changed  the membranes changed  when we read the genetic code  it's exactly what we had transferred in. So  this may sound like genomic alchemy  but we can  by moving the software of DNA around  change things quite dramatically. Now I've argued  this is not genesis  this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution. And I've argued that we're about to perhaps create a new version of the Cambrian explosion  where there's massive new speciation based on this digital design. Why do this  I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs. We're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next    years. To put it in context for myself  I was born in     . There are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in       within    years  there'll be four. We have trouble feeding  providing fresh  clean water  medicines  fuel for the six and a half billion. It's going to be a stretch to do it for nine. We use over five billion tons of coal     billion plus barrels of oil    that's a hundred million barrels a day. When we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that  it's going to be a huge challenge. Then of course  there's all that CO  from this material that ends up in the atmosphere. We now  from our discovery around the world  have a database with about    million genes  and I like to think of these as the design components of the future. The electronics industry only had a dozen or so components  and look at the diversity that came out of that. We're limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination. We now have techniques  because of these rapid methods of synthesis  to do what we're calling combinatorial genomics. We have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day. When you think of processing these    million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals  new vaccines  we can just with a small team  do more molecular biology than the last    years of all science. And it's just standard selection  we can select for viability  chemical or fuel production  vaccine production  etc. This is a screen snapshot of some true design software that we're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer. You know  we don't know necessarily what it'll look like  we know exactly what their genetic code looks like. We're focusing on now fourth generation fuels. You've seen recently  corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment. We have second  and third generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar  to much higher value fuels like octane or different types of butanol. But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with CO  as its feedstock  and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road. And we think we'll have the first fourth generation fuels in about    months. Sunlight and CO  is one method ... but in our discovery around the world  we have all kinds of other methods. This is an organism we described in     . It lives in the deep ocean  about a mile and a half deep  almost at boiling water temperatures. It takes CO  to methane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source. We're looking to see if we can take captured CO   which can easily be piped to sites  convert that CO  back into fuel to drive this process. So  in a short period of time  we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of  What is life   We truly  you know  have modest goals of replacing the whole petrol chemical industry    Yeah. If you can't do that at TED  where can you     become a major source of energy ... But also  we're now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines. You've seen this year with flu  we're always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine. I think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance. Here's what the future may begin to look like with changing  now  the evolutionary tree  speeding up evolution with synthetic bacteria  Archaea and  eventually  eukaryotes. We're a ways away from improving people  our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much. In this rather long sort of marathon presentation  I've tried to break it up into three parts  the first being a whole lot of examples on how it can be a little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computer and really address the qualities of the human interface. And these will be some simple design qualities and they will also be some qualities of  if you will  the intelligence of interaction. Then the second part will really just be examples of new technologies    new media falling very much into that mold. Again  I will go through them as fast as possible. And then the last one will be some examples I've been able to collect  which I think illustrate this at least as best I can  in the world of entertainment. People have this belief    and I share most of it    that we will be using the TV screens or their equivalents for electronic books of the future. But then you think   My God  What a terrible image you get when you look at still pictures on TV.  Well  it doesn't have to be terrible. And that is a slide taken from a TV set and it was pre processed to be very sympathetic to the TV medium  and it absolutely looks beautiful. Well  what's happened  How did people get into this mess  Where you are now  all of a sudden  sitting in front of personal computers and video text    teletext systems  and somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen  Well  you have to remember that TV was designed to be looked at eight times the distance of the diagonal. So you get a    inch     inch  whatever  TV  and then you should multiply that by eight and that's the distance you should sit away from the TV set. Now we've put people    inches in front of a TV  and all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen  all of a sudden  are staring you in the face  the shadow mask  the scan lines  all of that. And they can be treated very easily  there are actually ways of getting rid of them  there are actually ways of just making absolutely beautiful pictures. I'm talking here a little bit about display technologies. Let me talk about how you might input information. And my favorite example is always fingers. I'm very interested in touch sensitive displays. High tech  high touch. Isn't that what some of you said  It's certainly a very important medium for input  and a lot of people think that fingers are a very low resolution sort of stylus for inputting to a display. In fact  they're not  it's really a very  very high resolution input medium    you have to just do it twice  you have to touch the screen and then rotate your finger slightly    and you can move a cursor with great accuracy. And so when you see on the market these systems that have just a few light emitting diodes on the side and are very low resolution  it's nice that they exist because it still is better than nothing. But it  in some sense  misses the point  namely  that fingers are a very  very high resolution input medium. Now  what are some of the other advantages  Well  the one advantage is that you don't have to pick them up  and people don't realize how important that is    not having to pick up your fingers to use them.  Laughter  When you think for a second of the mouse on Macintosh    and I will not criticize the mouse too much    when you're typing    what you have    you want to now put something    first of all  you've got to find the mouse. You have to probably stop. Maybe not come to a grinding halt  but you've got to sort of find that mouse. Then you find the mouse  and you're going to have to wiggle it a little bit to see where the cursor is on the screen. And then when you finally see where it is  then you've got to move it to get the cursor over there  and then     Bang     you've got to hit a button or do whatever. That's four separate steps versus typing and then touching and typing and just doing it all in one motion    or one and a half  depending on how you want to count. Again  what I'm trying to do is just illustrate the kinds of problems that I think face the designers of new computer systems and entertainment systems and educational systems from the perspective of the quality of that interface. And another advantage  of course  of using fingers is you have    of them. And we have never known how to do this technically  so this slide is a fake slide. We never succeeded in using ten fingers  but there are certain things you can do  obviously  with more than one finger input  which is rather fascinating. What we did stumble across was something ... Again  which is typical of the computer field  is when you have a bug that you can't get rid of you turn it into a feature. And maybe ...  Laughter  maybe a mouse is a new kind of bug. But the bug in our case was in touch sensitive displays  we wanted to be able to draw    you know  rub your finger across the screen to input continuous points    and there was just too much friction created between your finger and the glass    if glass was the substrate  which it usually is. So we found that that actually was a feature in the sense you could build a pressure sensitive display. And when you touch it with your finger  you can actually  then  introduce all the forces on the face of that screen  and that actually has a certain amount of value. Let me see if I can load another disc and show you  quickly  an example. Now  imagine a screen  which is not only touch sensitive now  it's pressure sensitive. And it's pressure sensitive to the forces both in the plane of the screen    X  Y  and Z at least in one direction  we couldn't figure out how to come in the other direction. But let me get rid of the slide  and let's see if this comes on. OK. So there is the pressure sensitive display in operation. The person's just  if you will  pushing on the screen to make a curve. But this is the interesting part. I want to stop it for a second because the movie is very badly made. And the particular display was built about six years ago  and when we moved from one room to another room  a rather large person sat on it and it got destroyed. So all we have is this record.  Laughter  But imagine that screen having lots of objects on it and the person has touched an object    one of N    like he did there  and then pushed on it. Now  imagine a program where some of those objects are physically heavy and some are light  one is an anvil on a fuzzy rug and the other one is a ping pong ball on a sheet of glass. And when you touch it  you have to really push very hard to move that anvil across the screen  and yet you touch the ping pong ball very lightly and it just scoots across the screen. And what you can do    oops  I didn't mean to do that    what you can do is actually feed back to the user the feeling of the physical properties. So again  they don't have to be weight  they could be a general trying to move troops  and he's got to move an aircraft carrier versus a little boat. In fact  they funded it for that very reason. The whole notion  then  is one that at the interface there are physical properties in that transducer    in this case it's pressure and touches    that allow you to present things to the user that you could never present before. So it's not simply looking at the quality or  if you will  the luxury of that interface  but it's actually looking at the idea of presenting things that previously couldn't be presented before. I want to move on to another example  which is one of a different sort  where we're trying to use computer and video disc technology now to come up with a new kind of book. Here  the idea is that you're going to take this book  if you will  and it's going to come alive. You're going to sort of breathe life into it. We are so used to doing monologues. Filmmakers  for example  are the experts in monologue making  you make a film and it has a well formed beginning  middle and end  and in some sense the art of it is that. And you then say   There's an opportunity for making conversational movies.  Well  what does that mean  And it sort of nibbles at the core of the whole profession and all the assumptions of that medium. So  book writing is the same thing. What I'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book where it is mixed now with ... all sorts of things live in there  but you have to keep a few things in mind. One is that this book knows about itself. Each frame of the movie has information about itself. So it knows  or at least there is computer readable information in the medium itself. It's just not a static movie frame. That's one thing. The other is that you have to realize that it is a random access medium  and you can  in fact  branch and expand and elaborate and shrink. And here    again  my favorite example    is the cookbook  the  Larousse Gastronomique.  And I think I use the example all too often  but it's a great one because there is a classic ending in that little encyclopedia style cookbook that tells you how to do something like penguin  and you get to the end of the recipe and it says   Cook until done.  Now  that would be  if you will  the top green track  which doesn't mean too much. But you might have to elaborate for me or for somebody who isn't an expert  and say   Cook at     degrees for    minutes.  And then for a real beginner  you would go down even further and elaborate more    say   Open the oven  preheat  wait for the light to go out  open the door  don't leave it open too long  put the penguin in and shut the door ...   Laughter  whatever. And that's a much more elaborate one than you dribble back. That's one kind of use of random access. And the other is where you want to explain the same thing in different ways. If you're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question  the last thing you do is repeat what you just said. You try and think of a different way of saying the same thing  or if you know the particular student and that student's cognitive style  then you might say it in a way that you think would have a good impedance match with that student. There are all sorts of techniques you will use    and again  this is a different kind of branching. So  what I will show you is ... it's a rather boring book  but I'm afraid sometimes you have to do boring books because your sponsors aren't necessarily interested in fiction and entertainment. And this is a book on how to repair a transmission. Now  I don't even know what vintage the transmission is  but let me just show you very quickly some of it  and we'll move on. Nicholas Negroponte  Now  this is his table of contents. Just a picture of the transmission  and as you rub your finger across the transmission it highlights the various parts. Narrator  When I find a chapter that I want to see  I just touch the text and the system will format pages for me to read. The words or phrases that are lit up in red are glossary words  so I can get a different definition by just touching the word  and the definition appears  superimposed over the illustration. NN  This is about the oil pan  or the oil filter and all that. This is relatively important because it sets the page ... Narrator  This is another example of a page with glossary words highlighted in red. I can get a definition of these words just by touching them  and the definition will appear in the illustration corner. I can get back to the illustration  but in this case it's not a single frame  but it's actually a movie of someone coming into the frame and doing the repair that's described in the text. The two headed slider is a speed control that allows me to watch the movie at various speeds  in forward or reverse. And the movie is displayed as a full frame movie. I can go back to the beginning ... and play the movie at full speed. Here's another step by step procedure  only in this case    NN  Okay  this movie is ... Everybody's heard of sound sync movies    this is text sync movies  so as the movie plays  the text gets highlighted. We highlight the text as we go through the movie. Repairman  ... Not too far out. Front poles  preferably. Don't loosen them too far. If you loosen them too far  you'll have a big mess. NN  I suspect that some of you might not even understand that language. OK. I'm at the third and last part of this  which I said I would make an attempt to at least give you some examples that may be more directly related to the world of entertainment. And of course  good education has got to be good entertainment  so my first example will be drawn from a very recent experiment that we've been doing    in this case  in Senegal    where we have tried to use personal computers as a pedagogical medium. But not as teaching machines at all  the whole notion is to use this as an instrument where there is a complete reversal of roles    the child is  if you will  the teacher and the machine is the student    and the art of computer programming is a vehicle that sort of approximates thinking about thinking. But teaching kids programming per se is utterly irrelevant. And there are just a few slides I want to go through  but there's a story I'd like to tell. And that was when  before we did this in any developing countries    we're doing it  in fact  in three developing countries right now  Pakistan  Colombia and Senegal    we did it in some pretty rough areas of New York City. And one child  whose name I've forgotten  was about seven or eight years old  absolutely considered mentally handicapped    couldn't read  didn't even make it in the lowest section of the school's classes    and was pretty much not in school  though physically there. But did hang around the  quote   computer room   where there were quite a few computers  and learned this particular language called Logo    and learned it with great ease and found it a lot of fun  it was very interesting. And one day  by chance  some visitors from the NIE came by in their double breasted suits looking at this setup  and none of the children who were normally there  except for this one child  were there. He was  and he said   Let me show you how this works   and they got an absolutely ingenuous  wonderful description of Logo. And the child was just zipping right through it  showing them all sorts of things until they asked him how to do something which he couldn't explain and so he flipped through the manual  found the explanation and typed the command and got it to do what they asked. They were delighted  and by the time it was time to go see the principal  whom they'd actually come to see    not the computer room    they went upstairs and they said   This is absolutely remarkable  That child was very articulate and showed us and even dealt with the things he couldn't do automatically with that manual. It was just absolutely fantastic.  The principal said   There's a dreadful mistake  because that child can't read. And you obviously have been hoodwinked or you've talked about somebody else.  And they all got up and they all went downstairs and the child was still there. And they did something very intelligent  they asked the child   Can you read   And the child said   No  I can't.  And then they said   But wait a minute. You just looked through that manual and you found ...   and he said   Oh  but that's not reading.  And so they said   Well  what's reading then   He says   Well  reading is this junk they give me in little books to read. It's absolutely irrelevant   Laughter  and I get nothing for it. But here  with a little bit of effort I get a lot of return.  And it really meant something to the child. The child read beautifully  it turned out  and was really very competent. So it actually meant something. And that story has many other anecdotes that are similar  but wow. The key to the future of computers in education is right there  and it is  when does it mean something to a child  There is a myth  and it truly is a myth  we believe    and I'm sure a lot of you believe in this room    that it is harder to read and write than it is to learn how to speak. And it's not  but we think speech     My God  little children pick it up somehow  and by the age of two they're doing a mediocre job  and by three and four they're speaking reasonably well. And yet you've got to go to school to learn how to read  and you have to sit in a classroom and somebody has to teach you. Hence  it must be harder.  Well  it's not harder. What the truth is is that speaking has great value to a child  the child can get a great deal by talking to you. Reading and writing is utterly useless. There is no reason for a child to read and write except blind faith  and that it's going to help you.  Laughter  So what happens is you go to school and people say   Just believe me  you're going to like it. You're going to like reading   and just read and read. On the other hand  you give a kid    a three year old kid    a computer and they type a little command and    Poof     something happens. And all of a sudden ... You may not call that reading and writing  but a certain bit of typing and reading stuff on the screen has a huge payoff  and it's a lot of fun. And in fact  it's a powerful educational instrument. Well  in Senegal we found that this was the traditional classroom      kids    three per desk    one teacher  a little bit of chalk. This student was one of our first students  and it's the girl on the left leaning with her chalkboard  and she came ... within two days    I want to show you the program she wrote  and remember her hairstyle. And that is the program she made. That's what meant something to her  is doing the hair pattern  and actually did it within two days    an hour each day    and found it was  to her  absolutely the most meaningful piece ... But rooted in that  little did she know how much knowledge she was acquiring about geometry and just math and logic and all the rest. And again  I could talk for three hours about this subject. I will come to my last example and then quit. And my last example    as some of my former colleagues  whom I see in the room  can imagine what it will be. Yes  it is. It's our work    that was a while ago  and it still is my favorite project    of teleconferencing. And the reason it remains a favorite project is that we were asked to do a teleconferencing system where you had the following situation  you had five people at five different sites    they were known people    and you had to have these people in teleconference  such that each one was utterly convinced that the other four were physically present. Now  that is sufficiently zany that we would  obviously  jump to the bait  and we did. And the fact that we knew the people    we had to take a page out of the history of Walt Disney    we actually went so far as to build CRTs in the shapes of the people's faces. So if I wanted to call my friend Peter Sprague on the phone  my secretary would get his head out and bring it and set it on the desk  and that would be the TV used for the occasion. And it's uncanny  there's no way I can explain to you the amount of eye contact you get with that physical face projected on a  D CRT of that sort. The next thing that we had to do is to persuade them that there needed to be spatial correspondence  which is straightforward  but again  it's something that didn't fall naturally out of a telecommunications or computing style of thinking  it was a very  if you will  architectural or spatial concept. And that was to recognize that when you sit around the table  the actual location of the people becomes rather important. And when somebody gets up  in fact  to go answer a phone or use a bathroom or something  the empty seat becomes  if you will  that person. And you point frequently to the empty seat and you say   He or she wouldn't agree   and the empty chair is that person and the spatiality is crucial. So we said   Well  these will be on round tables and the order around the table had to be the same  so that at my site  I would be  if you will  real and then at each other's site you'd have these plastic heads. And the plastic heads  sometimes you want to project them. And there are a number of schemes  which I don't want to dwell on  but this is the one that we finally used where we projected onto rear screen material that was molded in the face    literally in the face of the person. And I'll show you one more slide  where this is actually made from something called a solid photograph and is the screen. Now  we track  on the person's head  the head motions    so we transmit with a video the head positions    and so this head moves in about two axes. So if I  all of a sudden  turn to the person to my left and start talking to that person  then at the person to my right's site  he'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other. And then if that person interrupts  then those two heads may turn. And it really is reconstructing  quite accurately  teleconferencing. I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder  schizophrenia. And as a sister and later  as a scientist  I wanted to understand  why is it that I can take my dreams  I can connect them to my reality  and I can make my dreams come true  What is it about my brother's brain and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality  so they instead become delusion  So I dedicated my career to research into the severe mental illnesses. And I moved from my home state of Indiana to Boston  where I was working in the lab of Dr. Francine Benes  in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry. And in the lab  we were asking the question   What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control  as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia  schizoaffective or bipolar disorder   So we were essentially mapping the microcircuitry of the brain  which cells are communicating with which cells  with which chemicals  and then in what quantities of those chemicals  So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing this type of research during the day  but then in the evenings and on the weekends  I traveled as an advocate for NAMI  the National Alliance on Mental Illness. But on the morning of December           I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own. A blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain. And in the course of four hours  I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information. On the morning of the hemorrhage  I could not walk  talk  read  write or recall any of my life. I essentially became an infant in a woman's body. If you've ever seen a human brain  it's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another. And I have brought for you a real human brain. So this is a real human brain. This is the front of the brain  the back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down  and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head. And when you look at the brain  it's obvious that the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another. For those of you who understand computers  our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor  while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor. The two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum  which is made up of some     million axonal fibers. But other than that  the two hemispheres are completely separate. Because they process information differently  each of our hemispheres think about different things  they care about different things  and  dare I say  they have very different personalities. Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy. Assistant  It has been. Our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment. It's all about  right here  right now.  Our right hemisphere  it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies. Information  in the form of energy  streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like  what this present moment smells like and tastes like  what it feels like and what it sounds like. I am an energy being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere. We are energy beings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family. And right here  right now  we are brothers and sisters on this planet  here to make the world a better place. And in this moment we are perfect  we are whole and we are beautiful. My left hemisphere  our left hemisphere  is a very different place. Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically. Our left hemisphere is all about the past and it's all about the future. Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details  and more details about those details. It then categorizes and organizes all that information  associates it with everything in the past we've ever learned  and projects into the future all of our possibilities. And our left hemisphere thinks in language. It's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world. It's that little voice that says to me   Hey  you've got to remember to pick up bananas on your way home. I need them in the morning.  It's that calculating intelligence that reminds me when I have to do my laundry. But perhaps most important  it's that little voice that says to me   I am. I am.  And as soon as my left hemisphere says to me  I am   I become separate. I become a single solid individual  separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you. And this was the portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke. On the morning of the stroke  I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye. And it was the kind of caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream. And it just gripped me    and then it released me. And then it just gripped me    and then it released me. And it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain  so I thought   OK  I'll just start my normal routine.  So I got up and I jumped onto my cardio glider  which is a full body  full exercise machine. And I'm jamming away on this thing  and I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar. And I thought   That's very peculiar.  And I looked down at my body and I thought   Whoa  I'm a weird looking thing.  And it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality  where I'm the person on the machine having the experience  to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself having this experience. And it was all very peculiar  and my headache was just getting worse. So I get off the machine  and I'm walking across my living room floor  and I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down. And every step is very rigid and very deliberate. There's no fluidity to my pace  and there's this constriction in my area of perception  so I'm just focused on internal systems. And I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower  and I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body. I heard a little voice saying   OK. You muscles  you've got to contract. You muscles  you relax.  And then I lost my balance  and I'm propped up against the wall. And I look down at my arm and I realize that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body. I can't define where I begin and where I end  because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall. And all I could detect was this energy    energy. And I'm asking myself   What is wrong with me  What is going on   And in that moment  my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent. Just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button. Total silence. And at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind. But then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me. And because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body  I felt enormous and expansive. I felt at one with all the energy that was  and it was beautiful there. Then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me   Hey  We've got a problem  We've got to get some help.  And I'm going   Ahh  I've got a problem   So it's like   OK  I've got a problem.  But then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness    and I affectionately refer to this space as La La Land. But it was beautiful there. Imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world. So here I am in this space  and my job  and any stress related to my job    it was gone. And I felt lighter in my body. And imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those    they were gone. And I felt this sense of peacefulness. And imagine what it would feel like to lose    years of emotional baggage  euphoria. It was beautiful. And again  my left hemisphere comes online and it says   Hey  You've got to pay attention. We've got to get help.  And I'm thinking   I've got to get help. I've got to focus.  So I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment  and I'm thinking   I've got to get to work. Can I drive   And in that moment  my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side. Then I realized   Oh my gosh  I'm having a stroke   And the next thing my brain says to me is  Wow  This is so cool  This is so cool  How many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out   And then it crosses my mind   But I'm a very busy woman    I don't have time for a stroke   So I'm like   OK  I can't stop the stroke from happening  so I'll do this for a week or two  and then I'll get back to my routine. OK. So I've got to call help. I've got to call work.  I couldn't remember the number at work  so I remembered  in my office I had a business card with my number. So I go into my business room  I pull out a three inch stack of business cards. And I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly in my mind's eye what my business card looked like  I couldn't tell if this was my card or not  because all I could see were pixels. And the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols  and I just couldn't tell. And then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity. And in that moment  I would be able to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card... that's not the card. It took me    minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards. In the meantime  for    minutes  the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere. I do not understand numbers  I do not understand the telephone  but it's the only plan I have. So I take the phone pad and I put it right here. I take the business card  I put it right here  and I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the phone pad. But then I would drift back out into La La Land  and not remember when I came back if I'd already dialed those numbers. So I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them  so that as I would come back to normal reality  I'd be able to tell   Yes  I've already dialed that number.  Eventually  the whole number gets dialed and I'm listening to the phone  and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me   Woo woo woo woo.   Laughter  And I think to myself   Oh my gosh  he sounds like a Golden Retriever   And so I say to him    clear in my mind  I say to him   This is Jill  I need help   And what comes out of my voice is   Woo woo woo woo woo.  I'm thinking   Oh my gosh  I sound like a Golden Retriever.  So I couldn't know    I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand language until I tried. So he recognizes that I need help and he gets me help. And a little while later  I am riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston to  Massachusetts  General Hospital. And I curl up into a little fetal ball. And just like a balloon with the last bit of air  just right out of the balloon  I just felt my energy lift and just I felt my spirit surrender. And in that moment  I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life. And either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life  or this was perhaps my moment of transition. When I woke later that afternoon  I was shocked to discover that I was still alive. When I felt my spirit surrender  I said goodbye to my life. And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality. Stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain. Light burned my brain like wildfire  and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise  and I just wanted to escape. Because I could not identify the position of my body in space  I felt enormous and expansive  like a genie just liberated from her bottle. And my spirit soared free  like a great whale gliding through the sea of silent euphoria. Nirvana. I found Nirvana. And I remember thinking  there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body. But then I realized   But I'm still alive  I'm still alive  and I have found Nirvana. And if I have found Nirvana and I'm still alive  then everyone who is alive can find Nirvana.  And I pictured a world filled with beautiful  peaceful  compassionate  loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time. And that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres    and find this peace. And then I realized what a tremendous gift this experience could be  what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives. And it motivated me to recover. Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage  the surgeons went in  and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers. Here I am with my mama  who is a true angel in my life. It took me eight years to completely recover. So who are we  We are the life force power of the universe  with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds. And we have the power to choose  moment by moment  who and how we want to be in the world. Right here  right now  I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere  where we are. I am the life force power of the universe. I am the life force power of the    trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form  at one with all that is. Or  I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere  where I become a single individual  a solid. Separate from the flow  separate from you. I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor  intellectual  neuroanatomist. These are the  we  inside of me. Which would you choose  Which do you choose  And when  I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner peace circuitry of our right hemispheres  the more peace we will project into the world  and the more peaceful our planet will be. And I thought that was an idea worth spreading. Thank you. I'm going to go right into the slides. And all I'm going to try and prove to you with these slides is that I do just very straight stuff. And my ideas are    in my head  anyway    they're very logical and relate to what's going on and problem solving for clients. I either convince clients at the end that I solve their problems  or I really do solve their problems  because usually they seem to like it. Let me go right into the slides. Can you turn off the light  Down. I like to be in the dark. I don't want you to see what I'm doing up here. Anyway  I did this house in Santa Monica  and it got a lot of notoriety. In fact  it appeared in a porno comic book  which is the slide on the right. This is in Venice. I just show it because I want you to know I'm concerned about context. On the left hand side  I had the context of those little houses  and I tried to build a building that fit into that context. When people take pictures of these buildings out of that context they look really weird  and my premise is that they make a lot more sense when they're photographed or seen in that space. And then  once I deal with the context  I then try to make a place that's comfortable and private and fairly serene  as I hope you'll find that slide on the right. And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown L.A. I was concerned about making a place for the study of law. And we continue to work with this client. The building on the right at the top is now under construction. The garage on the right    the gray structure    will be torn down  finally  and several small classrooms will be placed along this avenue that we've created  this campus. And it all related to the clients and the students from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place. They wanted a sense of place. And so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space in downtown  in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into. And it was my theory  or my point of view  that one didn't upstage the neighborhood    one made accommodations. I tried to be inclusive  to include the buildings in the neighborhood  whether they were buildings I liked or not. In the '  s I started working with paper furniture and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in Bloomingdale's. We even made flooring  walls and everything  out of cardboard. And the success of it threw me for a loop. I couldn't deal with the success of furniture    I wasn't secure enough as an architect    and so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like. So  nobody would like this. And it was in this  preliminary to these pieces of furniture  that Ricky and I worked on furniture by the slice. And after we failed  I just kept failing. The piece on the left    and that ultimately led to the piece on the right    happened when the kid that was working on this took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up to put it in the wastebasket. And I put a piece of tape around it  as you see there  and realized you could sit on it  and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on. So  it was an accidental discovery. I got into fish. I mean  the story I tell is that I got mad at postmodernism    at po mo    and said that fish were     million years earlier than man  and if you're going to go back  we might as well go back to the beginning. And so I started making these funny things. And they started to have a life of their own and got bigger    as the one glass at the Walker. And then  I sliced off the head and the tail and everything and tried to translate what I was learning about the form of the fish and the movement. And a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it    accidental  again    it was an intuitive kind of thing  and I just kept going with it  and made this proposal for a building  which was only a proposal. I did this building in Japan. I was taken out to dinner after the contract for this little restaurant was signed. And I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff. And after I got    I was really drunk    I was asked to do some sketches on napkins. And I made some sketches on napkins    little boxes and Morandi like things that I used to do. And the client said   Why no fish   And so I made a drawing with a fish  and I left Japan. Three weeks later  I received a complete set of drawings saying we'd won the competition. Now  it's hard to do. It's hard to translate a fish form  because they're so beautiful    perfect    into a building or object like this. And Oldenburg  who I work with a little once in a while  told me I couldn't do it  and so that made it even more exciting. But he was right    I couldn't do the tail. I started to get the head OK  but the tail I couldn't do. It was pretty hard. The thing on the right is a snake form  a ziggurat. And I put them together  and you walk between them. It was a dialog with the context again. Now  if you saw a picture of this as it was published in Architectural Record    they didn't show the context  so you would think   God  what a pushy guy this is.  But a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here looking for this restaurant. Couldn't find it. So ... As for craft and technology and all those things that you've all been talking about  I was thrown for a complete loop. This was built in six months. The way we sent drawings to Japan  we used the magic computer in Michigan that does carved models  and we used to make foam models  which that thing scanned. We made the drawings of the fish and the scales. And when I got there  everything was perfect    except the tail. So  I decided to cut off the head and the tail. And I made the object on the left for my show at the Walker. And it's one of the nicest pieces I've ever made  I think. And then Jay Chiat  a friend and client  asked me to do his headquarters building in L.A. For reasons we don't want to talk about  it got delayed. Toxic waste  I guess  is the key clue to that one. And so we built a temporary building    I'm getting good at temporary    and we put a conference room in that's a fish. And  finally  Jay dragged me to my hometown  Toronto  Canada. And there is a story    it's a real story    about my grandmother buying a carp on Thursday  bringing it home  putting it in the bathtub when I was a kid. I played with it in the evening. When I went to sleep  the next day it wasn't there. And the next night  we had gefilte fish. And so I set up this interior for Jay's offices and I made a pedestal for a sculpture. And he didn't buy a sculpture  so I made one. I went around Toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother's  and I put the fish in. It was a joke. I play with funny people like  Claes  Oldenburg. We've been friends for a long time. And we've started to work on things. A few years ago  we did a performance piece in Venice  Italy  called  Il Corso del Coltello     the Swiss Army knife. And most of the imagery is    Claes'  but those two little boys are my sons  and they were Claes' assistants in the play. He was the Swiss Army knife. He was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter  and I was Frankie P. Toronto. P for Palladio. Dressed up like the AT T building by Claes    with a fish hat. The highlight of the performance was at the end. This beautiful object  the Swiss Army knife  which I get credit for participating in. And I can tell you    it's totally an Oldenburg. I had nothing to do with it. The only thing I did was  I made it possible for them to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal  because I love sailing. We made it into a sailing craft. I've been known to mess with things like chain link fencing. I do it because it's a curious thing in the culture  when things are made in such great quantities  absorbed in such great quantities  and there's so much denial about them. People hate it. And I'm fascinated with that  which  like the paper furniture    it's one of those materials. And I'm always drawn to that. And so I did a lot of dirty things with chain link  which nobody will forgive me for. But Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School. And that chain link is really expensive. It's in perspective and everything. And then we did a camp together for children with cancer. And you can see  we started making a building together. Of course  the milk can is his. But we were trying to collide our ideas  to put objects next to each other. Like a Morandi    like the little bottles    composing them like a still life. And it seemed to work as a way to put he and I together. Then Jay Chiat asked me to do this building on this funny lot in Venice  and I started with this three piece thing  and you entered in the middle. And Jay asked me what I was going to do with the piece in the middle. And he pushed that. And one day I had a    oh  well  the other way. I had the binoculars from Claes  and I put them there  and I could never get rid of them after that. Oldenburg made the binoculars incredible when he sent me the first model of the real proposal. It made my building look sick. And it was this interaction between that kind of  up the ante stuff that became pretty interesting. It led to the building on the left. And I still think the Time magazine picture will be of the binoculars  you know  leaving out the    what the hell. I use a lot of metal in my work  and I have a hard time connecting with the craft. The whole thing about my house  the whole use of rough carpentry and everything  was the frustration with the crafts available. I said   If I can't get the craft that I want  I'll use the craft I can get.  There were plenty of models for that  in Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns  and many artists who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials. I went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture. And it was all of one material  and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls. The metalworkers  for the most part  do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff. I was given an opportunity to design an exhibit for the metalworkers' unions of America and Canada in Washington  and I did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all future metal buildings  etc. etc. And it's working very well to have these people  these craftsmen  interested in it. I just tell the stories. It's a way of connecting  at least  with some of those people that are so important to the realization of architecture. The metal continued into a building    Herman Miller  in Sacramento. And it's just a complex of factory buildings. And Herman Miller has this philosophy of having a place    a people place. I mean  it's kind of a trite thing to say  but it is real that they wanted to have a central place where the cafeteria would be  where the people would come and where the people working would interact. So it's out in the middle of nowhere  and you approach it. It's copper and galvanize. I used the galvanize and copper in a very light gauge  so it would buckle. I spent a lot of time undoing Richard Meier's aesthetic. Everybody's trying to get the panels perfect  and I always try to get them sloppy and fuzzy. And they end up looking like stone. This is the central area. There's a ramp. And that little dome in there is a building by Stanley Tigerman. Stanley was instrumental in my getting this job. And when I was awarded the contract I  at the very beginning  asked the client if they would let Stanley do a cameo piece with me. Because these were ideas that we were talking about  building things next to each other  making    it's all about  a  metaphor for a city  maybe. And so Stanley did the little dome thing. And we did it over the phone and by fax. He would send me a fax and show me something. He'd made a building with a dome and he had a little tower. I told him   No  no  that's too ongepotchket. I don't want the tower.  So he came back with a simpler building  but he put some funny details on it  and he moved it closer to my building. And so I decided to put him in a depression. I put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in. And so then he put two bridges    this all happened on the fax  going back and forth over a couple of weeks' period. And he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it. And so then I put this big billboard behind it. And I call it   David and Goliath.  And that's my cafeteria. In Boston  we had that old building on the left. It was a very prominent building off the freeway  and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up and used the kind of    I thought    the language of the neighborhood  which had these cornices  projecting cornices. Mine got a little exuberant  but I used lead copper  which is a beautiful material  and it turns green in     years. Instead of  like  copper in    or   . We redid the side of the building and re proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space. And it surprised both Boston and myself that we got it approved  because they have very strict kind of design guideline  and they wouldn't normally think I would fit them. The detailing was very careful with the lead copper and making panels and fitting it tightly into the fabric of the existing building. In Barcelona  on Las Ramblas for some film festival  I did the Hollywood sign going and coming  made a building out of it  and they built it. I flew in one night and took this picture. But they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me. And then more metal and some chain link in Santa Monica    a little shopping center. And this is a laser laboratory at the University of Iowa  in which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back. It's the support labs  which  by some coincidence  required no windows. And the shape fit perfectly. I just joined the points. In the curved part there's all the mechanical equipment. That solid wall behind it is a pipe chase    a pipe canyon    and so it was an opportunity that I seized  because I didn't have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form. It gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it. This is a small house somewhere. They've been building it so long I don't remember where it is. It's in the West Valley. And we started with the stream and built the house along the stream    dammed it up to make a lake. These are the models. The reality  with the lake    the workmanship is pretty bad. And it reminded me why I play defensively in things like my house. When you have to do something really cheaply  it's hard to get perfect corners and stuff. That big metal thing is a passage  and in it is    you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom  which is on the right. It's kind of like a whole built town. I was asked to do a hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at Yale. I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that. This is a house next to a Philip Johnson house in Minnesota. The owners had a dilemma    they asked Philip to do it. He was too busy. He didn't recommend me  by the way. We ended up having to make it a sculpture  because the dilemma was  how do you build a building that doesn't look like the language  Is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub divided  Etc. etc. You've got the idea. And so we finally ended up making it. These people are art collectors. And we finally made it so it appears very sculptural from the main house and all the windows are on the other side. And the building is very sculptural as you walk around it. It's made of metal and the brown stuff is Fin Ply    it's that formed lumber from Finland. We used it at Loyola on the chapel  and it didn't work. I keep trying to make it work. In this case we learned how to detail it. In Cleveland  there's Burnham Mall  on the left. It's never been finished. Going out to the lake  you can see all those new buildings we built. And we had the opportunity to build a building on this site. There's a railroad track. This is the city hall over here somewhere  and the courthouse. And the centerline of the mall goes out. Burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built  and so we followed. Sohio is on the axis here  and we followed the axis  and they're two kind of goalposts. And this is our building  which is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company. We collaborated with Oldenburg and put the newspaper on top  folded. The health club is fastened to the garage with a C clamp  for Cleveland. You drive down. So it's about a    story C clamp. And all this stuff at the bottom is a museum  and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry. This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries. And this would be a hotel. So  the centerline of this thing    we'd preserve it  and it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings by Pelli and Kohn Pederson Fox  etc.  that are underway. It's hard to do high rise. I feel much more comfortable down here. This is a piece of property in Brentwood. And a long time ago  about '   or something  after my house    I designed a house for myself that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard    and the owner of this lot worked for me and built that actual model on the left. And she came back  I guess wealthier or something    something happened    and asked me to design a house for her on this site. And following that basic idea of the village  we changed it as we got into it. I locked the house into the site by cutting the back end    here you see on the photographs of the site    slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms like a retaining wall  creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom  which I designed like a kind of a barge  looking like a boat. And that's it  built. The dome was a request from the client. She wanted a dome somewhere in the house. She didn't care where. When you sleep in this bedroom  I hope    I mean  I haven't slept in it yet. I've offered to marry her so I could sleep there  but she said I didn't have to do that. But when you're in that room  you feel like you're on a kind of barge on some kind of lake. And it's very private. The landscape is being built around to create a private garden. And then up above there's a garden on this side of the living room  and one on the other side. These aren't focused very well. I don't know how to do it from here. Focus the one on the right. It's up there. Left    it's my right. Anyway  you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees. That's the living room. Servants' quarters. A guest bedroom  which has this dome with marble on it. And then you enter into the living room and then so on. This is the bedroom. You come down from this level along the stairway  and you enter the bedroom here  going into the lake. And the bed is back in this space  with windows looking out onto the lake. These Stonehenge things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot. The material is lead copper  like in the building in Boston. And so it was an intent to make this small piece of land    it's     by        into a kind of an estate by separating these areas and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space in it. And this happened by accident that I got this right on axis with the dining room table. It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free. But the idea is  the windows are all placed so you see pieces of the house outside. Eventually this will be screened    these trees will come up    and it will be very private. And you feel like you're in your own kind of village. This is for Michael Eisner    Disney. We're doing some work for him. And this is in Anaheim  California  and it's a freeway building. You go under this bridge at about    miles an hour  and there's another bridge here. And you're through this room in a split second  and the building will sort of reflect that. On the backside  it's much more humane    entrance  dining hall  etc. And then this thing here    I'm hoping as you drive by you'll hear the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it. Kind of a fun thing to do. I'm doing a building in Switzerland  Basel  which is an office building for a furniture company. And we struggled with the image. These are the early studies  but they have to sell furniture to normal people  so if I did the building and it was too fancy  then people might say   Well  the furniture looks OK in his thing  but no  it ain't going to look good in my normal building.  So we've made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here  and we've taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them so that the communal space is very sculptural and separate. And you're looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of interaction between these pieces. This is in Paris  along the Seine. Palais des Sports  the Gare de Lyon over here. The Minister of Finance    the guy that moved from the Louvre    goes in here. There's a new library across the river. And back in here  in this already treed park  we're doing a very dense building called the American Center  which has a theater  apartments  dance school  an art museum  restaurants and all kinds of    it's a very dense program    bookstores  etc. In a very tight  small    this is the ground level. And the French have this extraordinary way of screwing things up by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off. They call it the plan coupe. And I struggled with that thing    how to get around the corner. These are the models for it. I showed you the other model  the one    this is the way I organized myself so I could make the drawing    so I understood the problem. I was trying to get around this plan coupe    how do you do it  Apartments  etc. And these are the kind of study models we did. And the one on the left is pretty awful. You can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built. But out of it came finally this resolution  where the elevator piece worked frontally to this  parallel to this street  and also parallel to here. And then this kind of twist  with this balcony and the skirt  kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer. The restaurants here    the apartments and the theater  etc. So it would all be built in stone  in French limestone  except for this metal piece. And it faces into a park. And the idea was to make this express the energy of this. On the side facing the street it's much more normal  except I slipped a few mansards down  so that coming on the point  these housing units made a gesture to the corner. And this will be some kind of high tech billboard. If any of you guys have any ideas for it  please contact me. I don't know what to do. Jay Chiat is a glutton for punishment  and he hired me to do a house for him in the Hamptons. And it's got a fish. And I keep thinking   This is going to be the last fish.  It's like a drug addict. I say   I'm not going to do it anymore    I don't want to do it anymore    I'm not going to do it.  And then I do it. There it is. But it's the living room. And this piece here is    I don't know what it is. I just added it so that we'd have enough money in the budget so we could take something out. This is Euro Disney  and I've worked with all of the guys that presented to you earlier. We've had a lot of fun working together. I think I'm from Mars for them  and they are for me  but somehow we all manage to work together  and I think  productively. So far. This is a shopping thing. You come into the Magic Kingdom and the hotel that Tony Baxter's group is doing out here. And then this is a kind of a shopping mall  with a rodeo and restaurants. And another restaurant. What I did    because of the Paris skies being quite dull  I made a light grid that's perpendicular to the train station  to the route of the train. It looks like it's kind of been there  and then crashed all these simpler forms into it. The light grid will have a light  be lit up at night and give a kind of light ceiling. In Switzerland    Germany  actually    on the Rhine across from Basel  we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum. And I tried to    there's a Nick Grimshaw building over here  there's an Oldenburg sculpture over here    I tried to make a relationship urbanistically. And I don't gave good slides to show    it's just been completed    but this piece here is this building  and these pieces here and here. And as you pass by it's always part    you see it as all of these pieces accrue and become part of an overall neighborhood. It's plaster and just zinc. And you wonder  if this is a museum  what it's going to be like inside  If it's going to be so busy and crazy that you wouldn't show anything  and just wait. I'm so cunning and clever    I made it quiet and wonderful. But on the outside it does scream out at you a bit. It's actually basically three square rooms with a couple of skylights and stuff. And from the building in the back  you see it as an iceberg floating by in the hills. I know I'm over time. See  that skylight goes down and becomes that one. So it's pretty quiet inside. This is the Disney Hall    the concert hall. It's a complicated project. It has a chamber hall. It's related to an existing Chandler Pavilion that was built with a lot of love and tears and caring. And it's not a great building  but I approached it optimistically  that we would make a compositional relationship between us that would strengthen both of us. And the plan of this    it's a concert hall. This is the foyer  which is kind of a garden structure. There's commercial at the ground floor. These are offices  which  really  in the competition  we didn't have to design. But finally  there's a hotel there. These were the kind of relationships made to the Chandler  composing these elevations together and relating them to the buildings that existed    to MOCA  etc. The acoustician in the competition gave us criteria  which led to this compartmentalized scheme  which we found out after the competition would not work at all. But everybody liked these forms and liked the space  and so that's one of the problems of a competition. You have to then try and get that back in some way. And we studied many models. This was our original model. These were the three buildings that were the ideal    the Concertgebouw  Boston and Berlin. Everybody liked the surround. Actually  this is the smallest hall in size  and it has more seats than any of these because it has double balconies. Our client doesn't want balconies  so    and when we met our new acoustician  he told us this was the right shape or this was the right shape. And we tried many shapes  trying to get the energy of the original design within an acoustical  acceptable format. We finally settled on a shape that was the proportion of the Concertgebouw with the sloping outside walls  which the acoustician said were crucial to this and later decided they weren't  but now we have them. And our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room. That's the idea. And the corners would have skylights and these columns would be structural. And the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit  and create intimacy. Now  this is not a final design    these are just on the way to being    and so I wouldn't take it literally  except the feeling of the space. We studied the acoustics with laser stuff  and they bounce them off this and see where it all works. But you get the sense of the hall in section. Most halls come straight down into a proscenium. In this case we're opening it back up and getting skylights in the four corners. And so it will be quite a different shape. The original building  because it was frog like  fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well. When you get into a box  it's harder to do it    and here we are  struggling with how to put the hotel in. And this is a teapot I designed for Alessi. I just stuck it on there. But this is how I do work. I do take pieces and bits and look at it and struggle with it and cut it away. And of course it's not going to look like that  but it is the crazy way I tend to work. And then finally  in L.A. I was asked to do a sculpture at the foot of Interstate Bank Tower  the highest building in L.A. Larry Halprin is doing the stairs. And I was asked to do a fish  and so I did a snake. It's a public space  and I made it kind of a garden structure  and you can go in it. It's a kiva  and Larry's putting some water in there  and it works much better than a fish. In Barcelona I was asked to do a fish  and we're working on that  at the foot of a Ritz Carlton Tower being done by Skidmore  Owings and Merrill. And the Ritz Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel  non fire proof  much like those old gas tanks. And so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it  perverted it  into the form of the fish  and created a kind of a   th century contraption that looks like  that will sit    this is the beach and the harbor out in front  and this is really a shopping center with department stores. And we split these bridges. Originally  this was all solid with a hole in it. We cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of a foreground for this hotel. We showed this to the hotel people the other day  and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the Ritz Carlton anymore  because of this fish. And finally  I just threw these in    Lou Danziger. I didn't expect Lou Danziger to be here  but this is a building I did for him in       I think. A little studio    and it's sadly for sale. Time goes on. And this is my son working with me on a small fast food thing. He designed the robot as the cashier  and the head moves  and I did the rest of it. And the food wasn't as good as the stuff  and so it failed. It should have been the other way around    the food should have been good first. It didn't work. Thank you very much. Thank you so much everyone from TED  and Chris and Amy in particular. I cannot believe I'm here. I have not slept in weeks. Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we've slept in anticipation for this. I've never been so nervous    and I do this when I'm nervous  I just realized.  Laughter  So  I'm going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called     Valencia  and then I'm going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things. Back in about       I was living in Brooklyn  I was trying to finish my first book  I was wandering around dazed every day because I wrote from    a.m. to   a.m. So I would walk around in a daze during the day. I had no mental acuity to speak of during the day  but I had flexible hours. In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in  Park Slope  there are a lot of writers    it's like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people. Meanwhile  I had grown up around a lot of teachers. My mom was a teacher  my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching. And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were  and they were really sort of the most hard working and constantly inspiring people I knew. But I knew so many of the things they were up against  so many of the struggles they were dealing with. And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level  in their reading and writing in particular. Now  so many of these students had come from households where English isn't spoken in the home  where a lot of them have different special needs  learning disabilities. And of course they're working in schools which sometimes and very often are under funded. And so they would talk to me about this and say   You know  what we really need is just more people  more bodies  more one on one attention  more hours  more expertise from people that have skills in English and can work with these students one on one.  Now  I would say   Well  why don't you just work with them one on one   And they would say   Well  we have five classes of    to    students each. This can lead up to               students a day. How can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one on one attention   You'd have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers. And so we started talking about this. And at the same time  I thought about this massive group of people I knew  writers  editors  journalists  graduate students  assistant professors  you name it. All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the English word    I hope to have an interest in the English language  but I'm not speaking it well right now.  Laughter  I'm trying. That clock has got me. But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word in terms of nurturing a democracy  nurturing an enlightened life. And so they had  you know  their time and their interest  but at the same time there wasn't a conduit that I knew of in my community to bring these two communities together. So when I moved back to San Francisco  we rented this building. And the idea was to put McSweeney's    McSweeney's Quarterly  that we published twice or three times a year  and a few other magazines    we were going to move it into an office for the first time. It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn. We were going to move it into an office  and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center. So we thought   We'll have all these writers and editors and everybody    sort of a writing community    coming into the office every day anyway  why don't we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school  get extra help on their written homework  so you have basically no border between these two communities   So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we're working on  at      p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you're doing  or you trade  or you work a little bit later or whatever it is. You give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood. So  we had this place  we rented it  the landlord was all for it. We did this mural  that's a Chris Ware mural  that basically explains the entire history of the printed word  in mural form    it takes a long time to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road. So we rented this space. And everything was great except the landlord said   Well  the space is zoned for retail  you have to come up with something. You've gotta sell something. You can't just have a tutoring center.  So we thought   Ha ha  Really   And we couldn't think of anything necessarily to sell  but we did all the necessary research. It used to be a weight room  so there were rubber floors below  acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights. We took all that down  and we found beautiful wooden floors  whitewashed beams and it had the look    while we were renovating this place  somebody said   You know  it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship.  And we looked around and somebody else said   Well  you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer.   Laughter  And so this is what we did. So it made everybody laugh  and we said   There's a point to that. Let's sell pirate supplies.  This is the pirate supply store. You see  this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin. A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see  we made it look sort of pirate supply like. Here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy. We have the peg legs there  that are all handmade and fitted to you. Up at the top  you see the eyepatch display  which is the black column there for everyday use for your eyepatch  and then you have the pastel and other colors for stepping out at night    special occasions  bar mitzvahs and whatever. So we opened this place. And this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in. This is replacement eyes in case you lose one. These are some signs that we have all over the place   Practical Joking with Pirates.  While you're reading the sign  we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head. That was just my one thing    I said we had to have something that drops on people's heads. It became mop heads. And this is the fish theater  which is just a saltwater tank with three seats  and then right behind it we set up this space  which was the tutoring center. So right there is the tutoring center  and then behind the curtain were the McSweeney's offices  where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that. The kids would come in    or we thought they would come in. I should back up. We set the place up  we opened up  we spent months and months renovating this place. We had tables  chairs  computers  everything. I went to a dot com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto and I bought    G s with a stroke of a paddle. Anyway  we bought 'em  we set everything up and then we waited. It was started with about    of my friends  people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood. And we sat. And at      p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just said   Free Tutoring for Your English Related and Writing Related Needs    Just Come In  It's All Free.  And we thought   Oh  they're going to storm the gates  they're gonna love it.  And they didn't. And so we waited  we sat at the tables  we waited and waited. And everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited  really  where nobody came in. And then somebody alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap  because we were operating behind a pirate supply store.  Laughter  We never put it together  you know  And so then  around that time  I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari  a longtime San Francisco educator    she was teaching in Mexico City  she had all the experience necessary  knew everything about education  was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood    I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching. She took over as executive director. Immediately  she made the inroads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything  and so suddenly it was actually full every day. And what we were trying to offer every day was one on one attention. The goal was to have a one to one ratio with every one of these students. You know  it's been proven that    to    hours a year with one on one attention  a student can get one grade level higher. And so most of these students  English is not spoken in the home. They come there  many times their parents    you can't see it  but there's a church pew that I bought in a Berkeley auction right there    the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored. So that was the basis of it  was one on one attention. And we found ourselves full every day with kids. If you're on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around   p.m.       p.m.  you will get run over  often  by the kids and their big backpacks  or whatever  actually running to this space  which is very strange  because it's school  in a way. But there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different. And the other thing was  there was no stigma. Kids weren't going into the  Center for Kids That Need More Help   or something like that. It was     Valencia. First of all  it was a pirate supply store  which is insane. And then secondly  there's a publishing company in the back. And so our interns were actually working at the same tables very often  and shoulder to shoulder  computer next to computer with the students. And so it became a tutoring center    publishing center  is what we called it    and a writing center. They go in  and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel    because we had very gifted kids  too. So there's no stigma. They're all working next to each other. It's all a creative endeavor. They're seeing adults. They're modeling their behavior. These adults  they're working in their field. They can lean over  ask a question of one of these adults and it all sort of feeds on each other. There's a lot of cross pollination. The only problem  especially for the adults working at McSweeney's who hadn't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up  was that there was just the one bathroom.  Laughter  With like    kids a day  this is a problem. But you know  there's something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day  working one on one  getting all this attention    they go home  they're finished. They don't stall. They don't do their homework in front of the TV. They're allowed to go home at      p.m.  enjoy their family  enjoy other hobbies  get outside  play. And that makes a happy family. A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community. A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world. So the key to it all is homework   Laughter   Applause  There you have it  you know    one on one attention. So we started off with about    volunteers  and then we had about     and then a couple hundred. And we now have       volunteers on our roster. And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer. The key thing is  even if you only have a couple of hours a month  those two hours shoulder to shoulder  next to one student  concentrated attention  shining this beam of light on their work  on their thoughts and their self expression  is going to be absolutely transformative  because so many of the students have not had that ever before. So we said   Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months  it doesn't matter. That's going to be enough.  So that's partly why the tutor corps grew so fast. Then we said   Well  what are we going to do with the space during the day  because it has to be used before      p.m.   So we started bringing in classes during the day. So every day  there's a field trip where they together create a book    you can see it being typed up above. This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing. You just point a camera at a class  and it always looks like this. So this is one of the books that they do. Notice the title of the book   The Book That Was Never Checked Out  Titanic.  And the first line of that book is   Once there was a book named Cindy that was about the Titanic.  So  meanwhile  there's an adult in the back typing this up  taking it completely seriously  which blows their mind. So then we still had more tutors to use. This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events. The teachers that we work with    and everything is different to teachers    they tell us what to do. We went in there thinking   We're ultimately  completely malleable. You're going to tell us. The neighborhood's going to tell us  the parents are going to tell us. The teachers are going to tell us how we're most useful.  So then they said   Why don't you come into the schools  Because what about the students that wouldn't come to you  necessarily  who don't have really active parents that are bringing them in  or aren't close enough   So then we started saying   Well  we've got       people on our tutor roster. Let's just put out the word.  A teacher will say   I need    tutors for the next five Sundays. We're working on our college essays. Send them in.  So we put that out on the wire        tutors. Whoever can make it signs up. They go in about a half an hour before the class. The teacher tells them what to do  how to do it  what their training is  what their project is so far. They work under the teacher's guide  and it's all in one big room. And that's actually the brunt of what we do is  people going straight from their workplace  straight from home  straight into the classroom and working directly with the students. So then we're able to work with thousands and thousands of more students. Then another school said   Well  what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day   So this is the Everett Middle School Writers' Room  where we decorated it in buccaneer style. It's right off the library. And there we serve all     kids in this middle school. This is their newspaper  the  Straight Up News   that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom in both languages    English and Spanish. So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said   Hey  why don't you assign a book with high school students  I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world.  And so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School  which is a school that we had worked with on some other things  and we gave that assignment to the students. And we said   Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end. She's going to publish them in a book. She's going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form. It's going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area and throughout the world  on Amazon and you name it.  So these kids worked harder than they've ever worked on anything in their lives  because there was that outside audience  there was Isabel Allende on the other end. I think we had about     tutors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well. We had a big party at the end. This is a book that you can find anywhere. So that led to a series of these. You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one   I Might Get Somewhere.  And this became an ongoing thing. More and more books. Now we're sort of addicted to the book thing. The kids will work harder than they've ever worked in their life if they know it's going to be permanent  know it's going to be on a shelf  know that nobody can diminish what they've thought and said  that we've honored their words  honored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five drafts  six drafts    all this attention that we give to their thoughts. And once they achieve that level  once they've written at that level  they can never go back. It's absolutely transformative. And so then they're all sold in the store. This is near the planks. We sell all the student books. Where else would you put them  right  So we sell 'em  and then something weird had been happening with the stores. The store  actually    even though we started out as just a gag    the store actually made money. So it was paying the rent. And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing    I don't know  I don't want to judge. But people would come in    and this was before the pirate movies and everything  It was making a lot of money. Not a lot of money  but it was paying the rent  paying a full time staff member there. There's the ocean maps you can see on the left. And it became a gateway to the community. People would come in and say   What the     What is this   I don't want to swear on the web.  Laughter  Is that a rule  I don't know. They would say   What is this   And people would come in and learn more about it. And then right beyond    there's usually a little chain there    right beyond  they would see the kids being tutored. This is a field trip going on. And so they would be shopping  and they might be more likely to buy some lard  or millet for their parrot  or  you know  a hook  or hook protector for nighttime  all of these things we sell. So the store actually did really well. But it brought in so many people    teachers  donors  volunteers  everybody    because it was street level. It was open to the public. It wasn't a non profit buried  you know  on the   th floor of some building downtown. It was right in the neighborhood that it was serving  and it was open all the time to the public. So  it became this sort of weird  happy accident. So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn  they said   Well  why don't we have a place like that here   And a lot of them had been former educators or would be educators  so they combined with a lot of local designers  local writers  and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing. They didn't want to sell pirate supplies. They didn't think that that was going to work there. So  knowing the crime fighting community in New York  they opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company. This is Sam Potts' great design that did this. And this was to make it look sort of like one of those keysmith's shops that has to have every service they've ever offered  you know  all over there. So they opened this place. Inside  it's like a Costco for superheroes    all the supplies in kind of basic form. These are all handmade. These are all sort of repurposed other products  or whatever. All the packaging is done by Sam Potts. So then you have the villain containment unit  where kids put their parents. You have the office. This is a little vault    you have to put your product in there  it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism  which you do  if you want to buy anything. And it limits  really  their sales. Personally  I think it's a problem. Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything. These are some of the products. These are all handmade. This is a secret identity kit. If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone  one American female marketing executive from Hoboken  New Jersey. It's a full dossier on everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone. So  this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape  and then you walk up these three steel graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans from every side and then you can see the cape in action. There's nothing worse than  you know  getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that. So then  the secret door    this is one of the shelves you don't see when you walk in  but it slowly opens. You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks. It opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back.  Applause  So you can see the full effect  But this is    I just want to emphasize    locally funded  locally built. All the designers  all of the builders  everybody was local  all the time was pro bono. I just came and visited and said   Yes  you guys are doing great   or whatever. That was it. You can see the time in all five boroughs of New York in the back.  Laughter   Applause  So this is the space during tutoring hours. It's very busy. Same principles  one on one attention  complete devotion to the students' work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas. And this switch is flicked in their heads when they walk through those    feet of this bizarre store  right  So it's school  but it's not school. It's clearly not school  even though they're working shoulder to shoulder on tables  pencils and papers  whatever. This is one of the students  Khaled Hamdan. You can read this quote. Addicted to video games and TV. Couldn't concentrate at home. Came in. Got this concentrated attention. And he couldn't escape it. So  soon enough  he was writing. He would finish his homework early    got really addicted to finishing his homework early. It's an addictive thing to sort of be done with it  and to have it checked  and to know he's going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day. So he got hooked on that  and then he started doing other things. He's now been published in five books. He co wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes called  Super Has Beens.  He wrote a series on  Penguin Balboa   which is a fighting    a boxing    penguin. And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to     people at Symphony Space  at a benefit for     New York. So he's there every day. He's evangelical about it. He brings his cousins in now. There's four family members that come in every day. So  I'll go through really quickly. This is L.A.  The Echo Park Time Travel Mart   Whenever You Are  We're Already Then.   Laughter  This is sort of a   Eleven for time travelers. So you see everything  it's exactly as a   Eleven would be. Leeches. Mammoth chunks. They even have their own Slurpee machine   Out of Order. Come Back Yesterday.   Laughter   Applause  Anyway. So I'm going to jump ahead. These are spaces that are only affiliated with us  doing this same thing  Word St. in Pittsfield  Massachusetts  Ink Spot in Cincinnati  Youth Speaks  San Francisco  California  which inspired us  Studio St. Louis in St. Louis  Austin Bat Cave in Austin  Fighting Words in Dublin  Ireland  started by Roddy Doyle  this will be open in April. Now I'm going to the TED Wish    is that okay  All right  I've got a minute. So  the TED Wish  I wish that you    you personally and every creative individual and organization you know    will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you'll then tell the story of how you got involved  so that within a year we have a thousand examples    a thousand     of transformative partnerships. Profound leaps forward  And these can be things that maybe you're already doing. I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things. I know that for a fact. So  tell us these stories and inspire others on the website. We created a website. I'm going to switch to  we   and not  I   hope  We hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools. We hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community. Always let the teachers lead the way. They will tell you how to be useful. I hope that you'll step in and help out. There are a million ways. You can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers. They'll always tell you how to help. So  this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco  they did this phenomenal job. This website is already up  it's already got a bunch of stories  a lot of ideas. It's called  Once Upon a School   which is a great title  I think. This site will document every story  every project that comes out of this conference and around the world. So you go to the website  you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started. Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline. So  visit the site. If you have any questions  you can ask this guy  who's our director of national programs. He'll be on the phone. You email him  he'll answer any question you possibly want. And he'll get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change. And it can be fun  That's the point of this talk    it needn't be sterile. It needn't be bureaucratically untenable. You can do and use the skills that you have. The schools need you. The teachers need you. Students and parents need you. They need your actual person  your physical personhood and your open minds and open ears and boundless compassion  sitting next to them  listening and nodding and asking questions for hours at a time. Some of these kids just don't plain know how good they are  how smart and how much they have to say. You can tell them. You can shine that light on them  one human interaction at a time. So we hope you'll join us. Thank you so much. Well  this is such an honor. And it's wonderful to be in the presence of an organization that is really making a difference in the world. And I'm intensely grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today. And I'm also rather surprised  because when I look back on my life the last thing I ever wanted to do was write  or be in any way involved in religion. After I left my convent  I'd finished with religion  frankly. I thought that was it. And for    years I kept clear of it. I wanted to be an English literature professor. And I certainly didn't even want to be a writer  particularly. But then I suffered a series of career catastrophes  one after the other  and finally found myself in television.  Laughter  I said that to Bill Moyers  and he said   Oh  we take anybody.   Laughter  And I was doing some rather controversial religious programs. This went down very well in the U.K.  where religion is extremely unpopular. And so  for once  for the only time in my life  I was finally in the mainstream. But I got sent to Jerusalem to make a film about early Christianity. And there  for the first time  I encountered the other religious traditions  Judaism and Islam  the sister religions of Christianity. And while I found I knew nothing about these faiths at all    despite my own intensely religious background  I'd seen Judaism only as a kind of prelude to Christianity  and I knew nothing about Islam at all. But in that city  that tortured city  where you see the three faiths jostling so uneasily together  you also become aware of the profound connection between them. And it has been the study of other religious traditions that brought me back to a sense of what religion can be  and actually enabled me to look at my own faith in a different light. And I found some astonishing things in the course of my study that had never occurred to me. Frankly  in the days when I thought I'd had it with religion  I just found the whole thing absolutely incredible. These doctrines seemed unproven  abstract. And to my astonishment  when I began seriously studying other traditions  I began to realize that belief    which we make such a fuss about today    is only a very recent religious enthusiasm that surfaced only in the West  in about the   th century. The word  belief  itself originally meant to love  to prize  to hold dear. In the   th century  it narrowed its focus  for reasons that I'm exploring in a book I'm writing at the moment  to include    to mean an intellectual assent to a set of propositions  a credo.  I believe   it did not mean   I accept certain creedal articles of faith.  It meant   I commit myself. I engage myself.  Indeed  some of the world traditions think very little of religious orthodoxy. In the Quran  religious opinion    religious orthodoxy    is dismissed as  zanna   self indulgent guesswork about matters that nobody can be certain of one way or the other  but which makes people quarrelsome and stupidly sectarian.  Laughter  So if religion is not about believing things  what is it about  What I've found  across the board  is that religion is about behaving differently. Instead of deciding whether or not you believe in God  first you do something. You behave in a committed way  and then you begin to understand the truths of religion. And religious doctrines are meant to be summons to action  you only understand them when you put them into practice. Now  pride of place in this practice is given to compassion. And it is an arresting fact that right across the board  in every single one of the major world faiths  compassion    the ability to feel with the other in the way we've been thinking about this evening    is not only the test of any true religiosity  it is also what will bring us into the presence of what Jews  Christians and Muslims call  God  or the  Divine.  It is compassion  says the Buddha  which brings you to Nirvana. Why  Because in compassion  when we feel with the other  we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put another person there. And once we get rid of ego  then we're ready to see the Divine. And in particular  every single one of the major world traditions has highlighted    has said    and put at the core of their tradition what's become known as the Golden Rule. First propounded by Confucius five centuries before Christ   Do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you.  That  he said  was the central thread which ran through all his teaching and that his disciples should put into practice all day and every day. And it was    the Golden Rule would bring them to the transcendent value that he called  ren   human heartedness  which was a transcendent experience in itself. And this is absolutely crucial to the monotheisms  too. There's a famous story about the great rabbi  Hillel  the older contemporary of Jesus. A pagan came to him and offered to convert to Judaism if the rabbi could recite the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg. Hillel stood on one leg and said   That which is hateful to you  do not do to your neighbor. That is the Torah. The rest is commentary. Go and study it.   Laughter  And  go and study it  was what he meant. He said   In your exegesis  you must make it clear that every single verse of the Torah is a commentary  a gloss upon the Golden Rule.  The great Rabbi Meir said that any interpretation of Scripture which led to hatred and disdain  or contempt of other people    any people whatsoever    was illegitimate. Saint Augustine made exactly the same point. Scripture  he says   teaches nothing but charity  and we must not leave an interpretation of Scripture until we have found a compassionate interpretation of it.  And this struggle to find compassion in some of these rather rebarbative texts is a good dress rehearsal for doing the same in ordinary life.  Applause  But now look at our world. And we are living in a world that is    where religion has been hijacked. Where terrorists cite Quranic verses to justify their atrocities. Where instead of taking Jesus' words   Love your enemies. Don't judge others   we have the spectacle of Christians endlessly judging other people  endlessly using Scripture as a way of arguing with other people  putting other people down. Throughout the ages  religion has been used to oppress others  and this is because of human ego  human greed. We have a talent as a species for messing up wonderful things. So the traditions also insisted    and this is an important point  I think    that you could not and must not confine your compassion to your own group  your own nation  your own co religionists  your own fellow countrymen. You must have what one of the Chinese sages called  jian ai   concern for everybody. Love your enemies. Honor the stranger. We formed you  says the Quran  into tribes and nations so that you may know one another. And this  again    this universal outreach    is getting subdued in the strident use of religion    abuse of religion    for nefarious gains. Now  I've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who  when I say to them what I do for a living  inform me that religion has been the cause of all the major world wars in history. Wrong. The causes of our present woes are political. But  make no mistake about it  religion is a kind of fault line  and when a conflict gets ingrained in a region  religion can get sucked in and become part of the problem. Our modernity has been exceedingly violent. Between      and          million people died in Europe alone as a result of armed conflict. And so many of our institutions  even football  which used to be a pleasant pastime  now causes riots where people even die. And it's not surprising that religion  too  has been affected by this violent ethos. There's also a great deal  I think  of religious illiteracy around. People seem to think  now equate religious faith with believing things. As though that    we call religious people often believers  as though that were the main thing that they do. And very often  secondary goals get pushed into the first place  in place of compassion and the Golden Rule. Because the Golden Rule is difficult. I sometimes    when I'm speaking to congregations about compassion  I sometimes see a mutinous expression crossing some of their faces because a lot of religious people prefer to be right  rather than compassionate.  Laughter  Now    but that's not the whole story. Since September the   th  when my work on Islam suddenly propelled me into public life  in a way that I'd never imagined  I've been able to sort of go all over the world  and finding  everywhere I go  a yearning for change. I've just come back from Pakistan  where literally thousands of people came to my lectures  because they were yearning  first of all  to hear a friendly Western voice. And especially the young people were coming. And were asking me    the young people were saying   What can we do  What can we do to change things   And my hosts in Pakistan said   Look  don't be too polite to us. Tell us where we're going wrong. Let's talk together about where religion is failing.  Because it seems to me that with    our current situation is so serious at the moment that any ideology that doesn't promote a sense of global understanding and global appreciation of each other is failing the test of the time. And religion  with its wide following ... Here in the United States  people may be being religious in a different way  as a report has just shown    but they still want to be religious. It's only Western Europe that has retained its secularism  which is now beginning to look rather endearingly old fashioned. But people want to be religious  and religion should be made to be a force for harmony in the world  which it can and should be    because of the Golden Rule.  Do not do to others what you would not have them do to you   an ethos that should now be applied globally. We should not treat other nations as we would not wish to be treated ourselves. And these    whatever our wretched beliefs    is a religious matter  it's a spiritual matter. It's a profound moral matter that engages and should engage us all. And as I say  there is a hunger for change out there. Here in the United States  I think you see it in this election campaign  a longing for change. And people in churches all over and mosques all over this continent after September the   th  coming together locally to create networks of understanding. With the mosque  with the synagogue  saying   We must start to speak to one another.  I think it's time that we moved beyond the idea of toleration and move toward appreciation of the other. I'd    there's one story I'd just like to mention. This comes from  The Iliad.  But it tells you what this spirituality should be. You know the story of  The Iliad   the    year war between Greece and Troy. In one incident  Achilles  the famous warrior of Greece  takes his troops out of the war  and the whole war effort suffers. And in the course of the ensuing muddle  his beloved friend  Patroclus  is killed    and killed in single combat by one of the Trojan princes  Hector. And Achilles goes mad with grief and rage and revenge  and he mutilates the body. He kills Hector  he mutilates his body and then he refuses to give the body back for burial to the family  which means that  in Greek ethos  Hector's soul will wander eternally  lost. And then one night  Priam  king of Troy  an old man  comes into the Greek camp incognito  makes his way to Achilles' tent to ask for the body of his son. And everybody is shocked when the old man takes off his head covering and shows himself. And Achilles looks at him and thinks of his father. And he starts to weep. And Priam looks at the man who has murdered so many of his sons  and he  too  starts to weep. And the sound of their weeping filled the house. The Greeks believed that weeping together created a bond between people. And then Achilles takes the body of Hector  he hands it very tenderly to the father  and the two men look at each other  and see each other as divine. That is the ethos found  too  in all the religions. It's what is meant by overcoming the horror that we feel when we are under threat of our enemies  and beginning to appreciate the other. It's of great importance that the word for  holy  in Hebrew  applied to God  is  Kadosh   separate  other. And it is often  perhaps  the very otherness of our enemies which can give us intimations of that utterly mysterious transcendence which is God. And now  here's my wish  I wish that you would help with the creation  launch and propagation of a Charter for Compassion  crafted by a group of inspirational thinkers from the three Abrahamic traditions of Judaism  Christianity and Islam  and based on the fundamental principle of the Golden Rule. We need to create a movement among all these people that I meet in my travels    you probably meet  too    who want to join up  in some way  and reclaim their faith  which they feel  as I say  has been hijacked. We need to empower people to remember the compassionate ethos  and to give guidelines. This Charter would not be a massive document. I'd like to see it    to give guidelines as to how to interpret the Scriptures  these texts that are being abused. Remember what the rabbis and what Augustine said about how Scripture should be governed by the principle of charity. Let's get back to that. And the idea  too  of Jews  Christians and Muslims    these traditions now so often at loggerheads    working together to create a document which we hope will be signed by a thousand  at least  of major religious leaders from all the traditions of the world. And you are the people. I'm just a solitary scholar. Despite the idea that I love a good time  which I was rather amazed to see coming up on me    I actually spend a great deal of time alone  studying  and I'm not very    you're the people with media knowledge to explain to me how we can get this to everybody  everybody on the planet. I've had some preliminary talks  and Archbishop Desmond Tutu  for example  is very happy to give his name to this  as is Imam Feisal Rauf  the Imam in New York City. Also  I would be working with the Alliance of Civilizations at the United Nations. I was part of that United Nations initiative called the Alliance of Civilizations  which was asked by Kofi Annan to diagnose the causes of extremism  and to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism. And the Alliance has told me that they are very happy to work with it. The importance of this is that this is    I can see some of you starting to look worried  because you think it's a slow and cumbersome body    but what the United Nations can do is give us some neutrality  so that this isn't seen as a Western or a Christian initiative  but that it's coming  as it were  from the United Nations  from the world    who would help with the sort of bureaucracy of this. And so I do urge you to join me in making    in this charter    to building this charter  launching it and propagating it so that it becomes    I'd like to see it in every college  every church  every mosque  every synagogue in the world  so that people can look at their tradition  reclaim it  and make religion a source of peace in the world  which it can and should be. Thank you very much.  Applause  It was an incredible surprise to me to find out that there was actually an organization that cared about both parts of my life. Because  basically  I work as a theoretical physicist. I develop and test models of the Big Bang  using observational data. And I've been moonlighting for the last five years helping with a project in Africa. And  I get a lot of flak for this at Cambridge. People wonder  you know   How do you have time to do this   And so on. And so it was simply astonishing to me to find an organization that actually appreciated both those sides. So I thought I'd start off by just telling you a little bit about myself and why I lead this schizophrenic life. Well  I was born in South Africa and my parents were imprisoned for resisting the racist regime. When they were released  we left and we went as refugees to Kenya and Tanzania. Both were very young countries then  and full of hope for the future. We had an amazing childhood. We didn't have any money  but we were outdoors most of the time. We had fantastic friends and we saw the wonders of the world  like Kilimanjaro  Serengeti and the Olduvai Gorge. Well  then we moved to London for high school. And after that    there's nothing much to say about that. It was rather dull. But I came back to Africa at the age of     as a volunteer teacher to Lesotho  which is a tiny country  surrounded at that time by apartheid South Africa. Well     percent of the men in Lesotho worked in the mines over the border  in brutal conditions. Nevertheless  I    as I'm sure    as a rather irritating young  white man coming into their village  I was welcomed with incredible hospitality and warmth. But the kids were the best part. The kids were amazing  extremely eager and often very bright. And I'm just going to tell you one story  which got through to me. I used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible  to try to connect the academic stuff with the real world. And they weren't used to that. But I took them outside one day and I said   I want you to estimate the height of the building.  And I expected them to put a ruler next to the wall  size it up with a finger  and make an estimate of the height. But there was one little boy  very small for his age. He was the son of one of the poorest families in the village. And he wasn't doing that. He was scribbling with chalk on the pavement. And so  I said    I was annoyed    I said   What are you doing  I want you to estimate the height of the building.  He said   OK. I measured the height of a brick. I counted the number of bricks and now I'm multiplying.  Well     Laughter     I hadn't thought of that one. And many experiences like this happened to me. Another one is that I met a miner. He was home on his three month leave from the mines. Sitting next to him one day  he said   There's only one thing that I really loved at school. And you know what it was  Shakespeare.  And he recited some to me. And these and many similar experiences convinced me that there are just tons of bright kids in Africa    inventive kids  intellectual kids    and starved of opportunity. And if Africa is going to get fixed  it's by them  not by us. Well  after     Applause     that's the truth. Well  after Lesotho  I traveled across Africa before returning to England    so gray and depressing  in comparison. And I went to Cambridge. And there  I fell for theoretical physics. Well  I'm not going to explain this equation  but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject. We can write down all the laws of physics we know in one line. And  admittedly  it's in a very shorthand notation. And it contains    free parameters  OK  which we have to fit to the data. So it's not the final story  but it's an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know about nature at the most basic level. And apart from a few very important loose ends  which you've heard about here    like dark energy and dark matter    this equation describes  seems to describe everything about the universe and what's in it. But there's one big puzzle remaining  and this was most succinctly put to me by my primary school math teacher in Tanzania  who's a wonderful Scottish lady who I still stay in touch with. And she's now in her   s. And when I try to explain my work to her  she waved away all the details  and she said   Neil  there's only one question that really matters. What banged    Laughter   Everyone talks about the Big Bang. What banged   And she's right. It's a question we've all been avoiding. The standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence  full of a strange kind of energy    inflationary energy    which blew it up. But the puzzle of why the universe emerged in that peculiar state is completely unsolved. Now  I worked on that theory for a while  with Stephen Hawking and others. But then I began to explore another alternative. The alternative is that the Big Bang wasn't the beginning. Perhaps the universe existed before the bang  and the bang was just a violent event in a pre existing universe. Well  this possibility is actually suggested by the latest theories  the unified theories  which try to explain all those    free parameters in a single framework  which will hopefully predict all of them. And I'll just share a cartoon of this idea here. It's all I can convey. According to these theories  there are extra dimensions of space  not just the three we're familiar with  but at every point in the room there are more dimensions. And in particular  there's one rather strange one  in the most elegant unified theories we have. The strange one looks likes this  that we live in a three dimensional world. We live in one of these worlds  and I can only show it as a sheet  but it's really three dimensional. And a tiny distance away  there's another sheet  also three dimensional  and they're separated by a gap. The gap is very tiny  and I've blown it up so you can see it. But it's really a tiny fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus. I won't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this  but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know. Well  I got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question. Which is  what happens if these two  three dimensional worlds should actually collide  And if they collide  it would look a lot like the Big Bang. But it's slightly different than in the conventional picture. The conventional picture of the Big Bang is a point. Everything comes out of a point  you have infinite density. And all the equations break down. No hope of describing that. In this picture  you'll notice  the bang is extended. It's not a point. The density of matter is finite  and we have a chance of a consistent set of equations that can describe the whole process. So  to cut a long story short  we've explored this alternative. We've shown that it can fit all of the data that we have about the formation of galaxies  the fluctuations in the microwave background. Furthermore  there's an experimental way to tell this theory  apart from the inflationary explanation that I told you before. It involves gravitational waves. And in this scenario  not only was the Big Bang not the beginning  as you can see from the picture  it can happen over and over again. It may be that we live in an endless universe  both in space and in time. And there've been bangs in the past  and there will be bangs in the future. And maybe we live in an endless universe. Well  making and testing models of the universe is  for me  the best way I have of enjoying and appreciating the universe. We need to make the best mathematical models we can  the most consistent ones. And then we scrutinize them  logically and with data. And we try to convince ourselves    we really try to convince ourselves they're wrong. That's progress  when we prove things wrong. And gradually  we hopefully move closer and closer to understanding the world. As I pursued my career  something was always gnawing away inside me. What about Africa  What about those kids I'd left behind  Instead of developing  as we'd all hoped in the '  s  things had gotten worse. Africa was gripped by poverty  disease and war. This is very graphically shown by the Worldmapper website and project. And so the idea is to represent each country on a map  but scale the area according to some quantity. So here's just the standard area map of the world. By the way  Africa is very large. And the next map now shows Africa's GDP in       around the time of independence for many African states. Now  this is       and then     . And here's a projection for     . Big changes are happening in the world  but they're not helping Africa. What about Africa's population  The population isn't out of proportion to its area  but Africa leads the world in deaths from often preventable causes  malnutrition  simple infections and birth complications. Then there's HIV AIDS. And then there are deaths from war. OK  currently there are        people a month dying in the Congo  as a consequence of the war there over coltan and diamonds and other things. It's still going on. What about Africa's capacity to do something about these problems  Well  here's the number of physicians in Africa. Here's the number of people in higher education. And here    most shocking to me    the number of scientific research papers coming out of Africa. It just doesn't exist scientifically. And this was very eloquently argued at TED Africa  that all of the aid that's been given has completely failed to put Africa onto its own two feet. Well  the transition to democracy in South Africa in      was literally a dream come true for many of us. My parents were both elected to the first parliament  alongside Nelson and Winnie Mandela. They were the only other couple. And in       I took a research leave to visit them. And while I was busy working    I was working on these colliding worlds  in the day. But I learned that there was a desperate shortage of skills  especially mathematical skills  in industry  in government  in education. The ability to make and test models has become essential  not only to every single area of science today  but also to modern society itself. And if you don't have math  you're not going to enter the modern age. So I had an idea. And the idea was very simple. The idea was to set up an African Institute for Mathematical Sciences  or AIMS. And let's recruit students from the whole of Africa  bring them together with lecturers from all over the world  and we'll try to give them a fantastic education. Well  as a Cambridge professor  I had many contacts. And to my astonishment  they backed me     percent. They said   Go and do it  and we'll come and lecture.  And I knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant students from these countries    where they don't have any opportunities    together with the best lecturers in the world    who I knew would come  because of the interest in Africa    and put them together and just let the sparks fly. So we bought a derelict hotel near Cape Town. It's an    room Art Deco hotel from the     s. The area was kind of seedy  so we got an    room hotel for         dollars. It's a beautiful building. We decided we would refurbish it and then put out the word  we're going to start the best math institute in Africa in this hotel. Well  the new South Africa is a very exciting country. And those of you who haven't been there  you should go. It's very  very interesting what's happening. And we recruited wonderful staff  highly motivated staff. The other thing that's happened  which was good for us  is the Internet. Even though the Internet is very expensive all over Africa  there are Internet cafes everywhere. And bright young Africans are desperate to join the global community  to be successful    and they're very ambitious. They want to be the next Einstein. And so when word came out that AIMS was opening  it spread very quickly via e mail and our website. And we got lots of applicants. Well  we designed AIMS as a    hour learning environment  and it was fantastic to start a university from the beginning. You have to rethink  what is the university for  And that's really exciting. So we designed it to have interactive teaching. No droning on at the chalkboard. We emphasize problem solving  working in groups  every student discovering and maximizing their own potential and not chasing grades. Everyone lives together in this hotel    lecturers and students    and it's not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at   a.m. The students don't usually leave the computer lab till   or   a.m. And then they're up again at eight in the morning. Lectures  problem solving and so on. It's an extraordinary place. We especially emphasize areas of great relevance to Africa's development  because  in those areas  scientists working in Africa will have a competitive advantage. They'll publish  be invited to conferences. They'll do well. They'll have successful careers. And AIMS has done extremely well. Here is a list of last year's graduates  graduated in June  and what they're currently doing       of them. And where they are is indicated over here. And where they've gone. So these are all postgraduate students. And they've all gone on to master's and Ph.D. degrees in excellent places. Five students can be educated at AIMS for the cost of educating one in the U.S. or Europe. But more important  the pan African student body is a continual source of strength  pride and commitment to Africa. We illustrate AIMS' progress by coloring in the countries of Africa. So here you can see behind this list. When a county is colored yellow  we've received an application  orange  we've accepted an application  and green  a student has graduated. So here is where we were after the first graduation in     . And we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green. So there's                 . We're well on the way to achieving our initial goal. We had some of the students filmed at home before they came to AIMS. And I'll just show you one. Tendai Mugwagwa  My name is Tendai Mugwagwa. I have a Bachelor of Science with an education degree. I will be attending AIMS. My understanding of the course is that it covers quite a lot. You know  from physics to medicine  in particular  epidemiology and also mathematical modeling. Neil Turok  So Tendai came to AIMS and did very well. And I'll let her take it from there. TM  My name is Tendai Mugwagwa and I was a student at AIMS in      and     . After leaving AIMS  I went on to do a master's in applied mathematics at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. After that  I came to the Netherlands where I'm now doing a Ph.D. in theoretical immunology. Professor  Tendai is working very independently. She communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital. So all in all I have a very good Ph.D. student from South Africa. So I'm happy she's here. NT  Another student in the first year of AIMS was Shehu. And he's shown here with his favorite high school teacher. And then entering university in northern Nigeria. And after AIMS  Shehu wanted to do high energy physics  and he came to Cambridge. He's about to finish his Ph.D.  and he was filmed recently with someone you all know. Shehu  And from there we will be able to  hopefully  make better predictions and then we compare it to the graph and also make some predictions. Stephen Hawking  That is nice. NT  Here are the current students at AIMS. There are    of them from    different countries  including    women. So now I'm going to get to my TED business. Well  we had a party. This is Africa    we have good parties in Africa. And last month  they threw a surprise party for me. Here's somebody you've seen already. I want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture. So  we were having a party  as you can see they're completely eclipsing me at this point. This is Ezra. She's from Darfur. She's a physicist  and somehow stays smiling  in spite of everything going on back home. But she wants to continue in physics  and she's doing extremely well. This is Lydia. Lydia is the first ever woman to graduate in mathematics in the Central African Republic. And she's now at AIMS.  Applause  So now let me get to our TED wish. Well  it's not my TED wish  it's our wish  as you've already gathered. And our wish has two parts  one is a dream and the other's a plan. OK. Our TED dream is that the next Einstein will be African.  Applause  In striving for the heights of creative genius  we want to give thousands of people the motivation  the encouragement and the courage to obtain the high level skills they need to help Africa. Among them will be not only brilliant scientists    I'm sure of that from what we've seen at AIMS    they'll also be the African Gates  Brins and Pages of the future. Well  I said we also have a plan. And our plan is quite simple. AIMS is now a proven model. And what we need to do is to replicate it. We want to roll out    AIMS centers in the next five years  all over Africa. Each will have a pan African student body  but specialize in a different area of science. We want to use science to overcome the national and cultural barriers  as it does at AIMS. And we want to add elements to the curriculum. We want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills. The expanded AIMS will be a coherent pan African institution  and its graduates will form a powerful network  working together for peace and progress across the continent. Over the last year  we've been visiting sites in Africa  looking at potential sites for new AIMS centers. And here are the ones we've selected. And each of these centers has a strong local team  each is in a beautiful place  an interesting place  which international lecturers will be happy to visit. And our partners across Africa are extremely enthusiastic about this. Everyone wants an AIMS center in their country. And last November  the conference of all the African ministers of science and technology  held in Mombasa  called for a comprehensive plan to roll out AIMS. So we have political support right across the continent. It won't be easy. At every site there will be huge challenges. Local scientists must play leading roles and governments must be persuaded to buy in. Conditions are very difficult  but we cannot afford to compromise on those principles which made AIMS work. And we summarize them this way  the institutes have got to be relevant  innovative  cost effective and high quality. Why  Because we want Africa to be rich. Easy to remember the basic rules we need. So  just in ending  let me say the only people who can fix Africa are talented young Africans. By unlocking and nurturing their creative potential  we can create a step change in Africa's future. Over time  they will contribute to African development and to science in ways we can only imagine. Thank you. As an architect you design for the present  with an awareness of the past  for a future which is essentially unknown. The green agenda is probably the most important agenda and issue of the day. And I'd like to share some experience over the last    years    we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year    and to explore and to touch on some observations about the nature of sustainability. How far you can anticipate  what follows from it  what are the threats  what are the possibilities  the challenges  the opportunities  I think that    I've said in the past  many  many years ago  before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda  that it wasn't about fashion    it was about survival. But what I never said  and what I'm really going to make the point is  that really  green is cool. I mean  all the projects which have  in some way  been inspired by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle  in a way celebrating the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life. I rarely actually quote anything  so I'm going to try and find a piece of paper if I can   in  which somebody  at the end of last year  ventured the thought about what for that individual  as a kind of important observer  analyst  writer    a guy called Thomas Friedman  who wrote in the Herald Tribune  about     . He said   I think the most important thing to happen in      was that living and thinking green hit Main Street. We reached a tipping point this year where living  acting  designing  investing and manufacturing green came to be understood by a critical mass of citizens  entrepreneurs and officials as the most patriotic  capitalistic  geo political and competitive thing they could do. Hence my motto  green is the new red  white and blue.  And I asked myself  in a way  looking back   When did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear   And I think it was July           when  for the first time  man could look back at planet Earth. And  in a way  it was Buckminster Fuller who coined that phrase. And before the kind of collapse of the communist system  I was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts in Space City and other places in Russia. And interestingly  as I think back  they were the first true environmentalists. They were filled with a kind of pioneering passion  fired about the problems of the Aral Sea. And at that period it was    in a way  a number of things were happening. Buckminster Fuller was the kind of green guru    again  a word that had not been coined. He was a design scientist  if you like  a poet  but he foresaw all the things that are happening now. It's another subject. It's another conversation. You can go back to his writings  it's quite extraordinary. It was at that time  with an awareness fired by Bucky's prophecies  his concerns as a citizen  as a kind of citizen of the planet  that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time. And it's a number of projects. I select this one because it was       and it was a master plan for one of the Canary Islands. And this probably coincided with the time when you had the planet Earth's sourcebook  and you had the hippie movement. And there are some of those qualities in this drawing  which seeks to sum up the recommendations. And all the components are there which are now in common parlance  in our vocabulary  you know     odd years later  wind energy  recycling  biomass  solar cells. And in parallel at that time  there was a very kind of exclusive design club. People who were really design conscious were inspired by the work of Dieter Rams  and the objects that he would create for the company called Braun. This is going back the mid '  s  '  s. And despite Bucky's prophecies that everything would be miniaturized and technology would make an incredible style    access to comfort  to amenities    it was very  very difficult to imagine that everything that we see in this image  would be very  very stylishly packaged. And that  and more besides  would be in the palm of your hand. And I think that that digital revolution now is coming to the point where  as the virtual world  which brings so many people together here  finally connects with the physical world  there is the reality that that has become humanized  so that digital world has all the friendliness  all the immediacy  the orientation of the analog world. Probably summed up in a way by the stylish or alternative available here  as we generously had gifted at lunchtime  the  unclear   which is a further kind of development    and again  inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel. A very  very beautiful object. So  something which in  the  '  s  '  s was very exclusive has now become  interestingly  quite inclusive. And the reference to the iPod as iconic  and in a way evocative of performance  delivery    quite interesting that  in  the beginning of the year       the Financial Times commented that the Detroit companies envy the halo effect that Toyota has gained from the Prius as the hybrid  energy conscious vehicle  which rivals the iPod as an iconic product. And I think it's very tempting to  in a way  seduce ourselves    as architects  or anybody involved with the design process    that the answer to our problems lies with buildings. Buildings are important  but they're only a component of a much bigger picture. In other words  as I might seek to demonstrate  if you could achieve the impossible  the equivalent of perpetual motion  you could design a carbon free house  for example. That would be the answer. Unfortunately  it's not the answer. It's only the beginning of the problem. You cannot separate the buildings out from the infrastructure of cites and the mobility of transit. For example  if  in that Bucky inspired phrase  we draw back and we look at planet Earth  and we take a kind of typical  industrialized society  then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings     percent  transport     percent  and industry. But again  that only shows part of the picture. If you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport  in other words  the transport of people  which is    percent  then    percent of the energy consumption is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together. So the problems of sustainability cannot be separated from the nature of the cities  of which the buildings are a part. For example  if you take  and you make a comparison between a recent kind of city  what I'll call  simplistically  a North American city    and Detroit is not a bad example  it is very car dependent. The city goes out in annular rings  consuming more and more green space  and more and more roads  and more and more energy in the transport of people between the city center    which again  the city center  as it becomes deprived of the living and just becomes commercial  again becomes dead. If you compared Detroit with a city of a Northern European example    and Munich is not a bad example of that  with the greater dependence on walking and cycling    then a city which is really only twice as dense  is only using one tenth of the energy. In other words  you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous. So basically  if you wanted to generalize  you can demonstrate that as the density increases along the bottom there  that the energy consumed reduces dramatically. Of course you can't separate this out from issues like social diversity  mass transit  the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance  the quality of civic spaces. But again  you can see Detroit  in yellow at the top  extraordinary consumption  down below Copenhagen. And Copenhagen  although it's a dense city  is not dense compared with the really dense cities. In the year       a rather interesting thing happened. You had for the first time mega cities   of    million or more  which were occurring in the developing world. And now  out of typically    cities     of those mega cities are in the developing world. So you have to ask yourself    the environmental impact of  for example  China or India. If you take China  and you just take Beijing  you can see on that traffic system  and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles. In other words  if you put onto the roads  as is currently happening        new cars every day    statistically  it's the biggest booming auto market in the world    and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing. And that urbanization is extraordinary  accelerated pace. So  if we think of the transition in our society of the movement from the land to the cities  which took     years  then that same process is happening in    years. In other words  it is accelerating by a factor of   . And quite interestingly  over something like a    year period  we're seeing the doubling in life expectancy  over that period where the urbanization has trebled. If I pull back from that global picture  and I look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology    which  as a tool  is a tool for designers  and I cite our own experience as a company  and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects    then how do you measure that change of technology  How does it affect the design of buildings  And particularly  how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy  create less pollution and are more socially responsible  That story  in terms of buildings  started in the late '  s  early '  s. The one example I take is a corporate headquarters for a company called Willis and Faber  in a small market town in the northeast of England  commuting distance with London. And here  the first thing you can see is that this building  the roof is a very warm kind of overcoat blanket  a kind of insulating garden  which is also about the celebration of public space. In other words  for this community  they have this garden in the sky. So the humanistic ideal is very  very strong in all this work  encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here  where you can see greenery  you can see sunlight  you have a connection with nature. And nature is part of the generator  the driver for this building. And symbolically  the colors of the interior are green and yellow. It has facilities like swimming pools  it has flextime  it has a social heart  a space  you have contact with nature. Now this was     . In       this building received an award. And the award was about a celebration for a building which had been in use over a long period of time. And the people who'd created it came back  the project managers  the company chairmen then. And they were saying  you know   The architects  Norman was always going on about designing for the future  and you know  it didn't seem to cost us any more. So we humored him  we kept him happy.  The image at the top  what it doesn't    if you look at it in detail  really what it is saying is you can wire this building. This building was wired for change. So  in       the image there is of typewriters. And when the photograph was taken  it's word processors. And what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors had to build new buildings for the new technology. We were fortunate  because in a way our building was future proofed. It anticipated change  even though those changes were not known. Round about that design period leading up to this building  I did a sketch  which we pulled out of the archive recently. And I was saying  and I wrote   But we don't have the time  and we really don't have the immediate expertise at a technical level.  In other words  we didn't have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building. And that would be to create a kind of three dimensional bubble    a really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate  would breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads. Notwithstanding the fact that the building  as a green building  is very much a pioneering building. And if I fast forward in time  what is interesting is that the technology is now available and celebratory. The library of the Free University  which opened last year  is an example of that. And again  the transition from one of the many thousands of sketches and computer images to the reality. And a combination of devices here  the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks  and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin  which enables the building to be ventilated  to consume dramatically less energy  and where it's really working with the forces of nature. And what is interesting is that this is hugely popular by the people who use it. Again  coming back to that thing about the lifestyle  and in a way  the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit. So it's not a kind of sacrifice  quite the reverse. I think it's a great    it's a celebration. And you can measure the performance  in terms of energy consumption  of that building against a typical library. If I show another aspect of that technology then  in a completely different context    this apartment building in the Alps in Switzerland. Prefabricated from the most traditional of materials  but that material    because of the technology  the computing ability  the ability to prefabricate  make high performance components out of timber    very much at the cutting edge. And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology  the ability to plot points in the sky and to transmit  to transfer that information now  directly into the factory. So if you cross the border    just across the border    a small factory in Germany  and here you can see the guy with his computer screen  and those points in space are communicated. And on the left are the cutting machines  which then  in the factory  enable those individual pieces to be fabricated and plus or minus very  very few millimeters  to be slotted together on site. And then interestingly  that building to then be clad in the oldest technology  which is the kind of hand cut shingles. One quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish. And again  the way in which that works as a building  for those of us who can enjoy the spaces  to live and visit there. If I made the leap into these new technologies  then how did we    what happened before that  I mean  you know  what was life like before the mobile phone  the things that you take for granted  Well  obviously the building still happened. I mean  this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank of       which opened in       with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight deep into the heart of this space here. And in the absence of computers  you have to physically model. So for example  we would put models under an artificial sky. For wind tunnels  we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air  and the many kilometers of cable and so on. And the turning point was probably  in our terms  when we had the first computer. And that was at the time that we sought to redesign  reinvent the airport. This is Terminal Four at Heathrow  typical of any terminal    big  heavy roof  blocking out the sunlight  lots of machinery  big pipes  whirring machinery. And Stansted  the green alternative  which uses natural light  is a friendly place  you know where you are  you can relate to the outside. And for a large part of its cycle  not needing electric light    electric light  which in turn creates more heat  which creates more cooling loads and so on. And at that particular point in time  this was one of the few solitary computers. And that's a little image of the tree of Stansted. Not going back very far in time        that's our office. And if you looked very closely  you'd see that people were drawing with pencils  and they were pushing  you know  big rulers and triangles. It's not that long ago     years  and here we are now. I mean  major transformation. Going back in time  there was a lady called Valerie Larkin  and in       she had all our information on one disk. Now  every week  we have the equivalent of    million disks  which record our archival information on past  current and future projects. That reaches    kilometers into the sky. This is the view you would get  if you looked down on that. But meanwhile  as you know  wonderful protagonists like Al Gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature  set in the context of that  interestingly  those buildings which are celebratory and very  very relevant to this place. Our Reichstag project  which has a very familiar agenda  I'm sure  as a public place where we sought to  in a way  through a process of advocacy  reinterpret the relationship between society and politicians  public space. And maybe its hidden agenda  an energy manifesto    something that would be free  completely free of fuel as we know it. So it would be totally renewable. And again  the humanistic sketch  the translation into the public space  but this very  very much a part of the ecology. But here  not having to model it for real. Obviously the wind tunnel had a place  but the ability now with the computer to explore  to plan  to see how that would work in terms of the forces of nature  natural ventilation  to be able to model the chamber below  and to look at biomass. A combination of biomass  aquifers  burning vegetable oil    a process that  quite interestingly  was developed in Eastern Germany  at the time of its dependence on the Soviet Bloc. So really  retranslating that technology and developing something which was so clean  it was virtually pollution free. You can measure it again. You can compare how that building  in terms of its emission in tons of carbon dioxide per year    at the time that we took that project  over       tons    what it would have been with natural gas and finally  with the vegetable oil      tons. I mean  a    percent reduction    virtually clean. We can see the same processes at work in terms of the Commerce Bank    its dependence on natural ventilation  the way that you can model those gardens  the way they spiral around. But again  very much about the lifestyle  the quality    something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work. And again  we can measure the reduction in terms of energy consumption. There is an evolution here between the projects  and Swiss Re again develops that a little bit further    the project in the city in London. And this sequence shows the buildup of that model. But what it shows first  which I think is quite interesting  is that here you see the circle  you see the public space around it. What are the other ways of putting the same amount of space on the site  If  for example  you seek to do a building which goes right to the edge of the pavement  it's the same amount of space. And finally  you profile this  you cut grooves into it. The grooves become the kind of green lungs which give views  which give light  ventilation  make the building fresher. And you enclose that with something that also is central to its appearance  which is a mesh of triangulated structures    again  in a long connection evocative of some of those works of Buckminster Fuller  and the way in which triangulation can increase performance and also give that building its sense of identity. And here  if we look at a detail of the way that the building opens up and breathes into those atria  the way in which now  with a computer  we can model the forces  we can see the high pressure  the low pressure  the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing. So it also has the ability  all the time  regardless of the direction of the wind  to be able to make the building fresh and efficient. And unlike conventional buildings  the top of the building is celebratory. It's a viewing place for people  not machinery. And the base of the building is again about public space. Comparing it with a typical building  what happens if we seek to use such design strategies in terms of really large scale thinking  And I'm just going to give two images out of a kind of company research project. It's been well known that the Dead Sea is dying. The level is dropping  rather like the Aral Sea. And the Dead Sea is obviously much lower than the oceans and seas around it. So there has been a project which rescues the Dead Sea by creating a pipeline  a pipe  sometimes above the surface  sometimes buried  that will redress that  and will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba into the Dead Sea. And our translation of that  using a lot of the thinking built up over the    years  is to say  what if that  instead of being just a pipe  what if it is a lifeline  What if it is the equivalent  depending on where you are  of the Grand Canal  in terms of tourists  habitation  desalination  agriculture  In other words  water is the lifeblood. And if you just go back to the previous image  and you look at this area of volatility and hostility  that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together in a united cause  in terms of something that would be genuinely green and productive in the widest sense. Infrastructure at that large scale is also inseparable from communication. And whether that communication is the virtual world or it is the physical world  then it's absolutely central to society. And how do we make more legible in this growing world  especially in some of the places that I'm talking about    China  for example  which in the next ten years will create     new airports. Now what form do they take  How do you make them more friendly at that scale  Hong Kong I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age  because you always have a point of reference. So what happens when we take that and you expand that further into the Chinese society  And what is interesting is that that produces in a way perhaps the ultimate mega building. It is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment.        excuse me         people working    hours  seven days. Larger by    percent than every terminal put together at Heathrow    built    plus the new  un built Terminal Five. And the challenge here is a building that will be green  that is compact despite its size and is about the human experience of travel  is about friendly  is coming back to that starting point  is very  very much about the lifestyle. And perhaps these  in the end  as celebratory spaces. As Hubert was talking over lunch  as we sort of engaged in conversation  talked about this  talked about cities. Hubert was saying  absolutely correctly   These are the new cathedrals.  And in a way  one aspect of this conversation was triggered on New Year's Eve  when I was talking about the Olympic agenda in China in terms of its green ambitions and aspirations. And I was voicing the thought that    it just crossed my mind that New Year's Eve  a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from      to         that maybe  you know  the future was the most powerful  innovative sort of nation. The way in which somebody like Kennedy inspirationally could say   We put a man on the moon.  You know  who is going to say that we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels  with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes  and so on. And that's a concerted platform. It's more than one device  you know  it's renewable. And I voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year  I thought that the inspiration was more likely to come from those other  larger countries out there    the Chinas  the Indias  the Asian Pacific tigers. Thank you very much. Hi. I'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back  just the way I am    kind of a royal wave. You can mimic what you can see. You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm. Soon  you'll be able to look inside your brain and program  control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there. I'm going to tell you about that technology. People have wanted to look inside the human mind  the human brain  for thousands of years. Well  coming out of the research labs just now  for our generation  is the possibility to do that. People envision this as being very difficult. You had to take a spaceship  shrink it down  inject it into the bloodstream. It was terribly dangerous.  Laughter  You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries. But now  we have a real technology to do this. We're going to fly into my colleague Peter's brain. We're going to do it non invasively using MRI. We don't have to inject anything. We don't need radiation. We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain    literally  fly into his body    but more importantly  we can look into his mind. When Peter moves his arm  that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of Peter's mind taking place. Now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms  that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains. What's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis. We've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds  and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner. He can look at these        points of activation per second. If he can see this pattern in his own brain  he can learn how to control it. There have been three ways to try to impact the brain  the therapist's couch  pills and the knife. This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have. We all know that as we form thoughts  they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains. Chronic pain is an example. If you burn yourself  you pull your hand away. But if you're still in pain in six months' or six years' time  it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you. If we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain  we can form  D models and watch in real time the brain process information  and then we can select the areas that produce the pain. So put your arms back up and flex your bicep. Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing. What you're seeing here is  we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient. This may shock you  but we're literally reading this person's brain in real time. They're watching their own brain activation  and they're controlling the pathway that produces their pain. They're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates. As they do it  in the upper left is a display that's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled. When they control their brain  they can control their pain. This is an investigational technology  but  in clinical trials  we're seeing a    to    percent decrease in chronic pain patients. This is not  The Matrix.  You can only do this to yourself. You take control. I've seen inside my brain. You will too  soon. When you do  what do you want to control  You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself  all your experiences. These are some of the areas we're working on today that I don't have time to go into in detail. But I want to leave with you the big question. We are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into  using this technology  the human mind and brain. Where will we take it  I'm delighted to be here. I'm honored by the invitation  and thanks. I would love to talk about stuff that I'm interested in  but unfortunately  I suspect that what I'm interested in won't interest many other people. First off  my badge says I'm an astronomer. I would love to talk about my astronomy  but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer in non gray atmospheres and polarization of light in Jupiter's upper atmosphere are the number of people who'd fit in a bus shelter. So I'm not going to talk about that. It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in      and       when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs. And I caught the guys  and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB  and stealing information and selling it. And I'd love to talk about that    and it'd be fun    but     years later ... I find computer security  frankly  to be kind of boring. It's tedious. I'm    The first time you do something  it's science. The second time  it's engineering. A third time  it's just being a technician. I'm a scientist. Once I do something  I do something else. So  I'm not going to talk about that. Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book   Silicon Snake Oil   or my second book  nor am I going to talk about why I believe computers don't belong in schools. I feel that there's a massive and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools. My idea is  no  No  Get them out of schools  and keep them out of schools. And I'd love to talk about this  but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who's hung around a fourth grade classroom that it doesn't need much talking about    but I guess I may be very wrong about that  and everything else that I've said. So don't go back and read my dissertation. It probably has lies in it as well. Having said that  I outlined my talk about five minutes ago. And if you look at it over here  the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future. I'm supposed to talk about the future  yes  Oh  right. And my feeling is  asking me to talk about the future is bizarre  because I've got gray hair  and so  it's kind of silly for me to talk about the future. In fact  I think that if you really want to know what the future's going to be  if you really want to know about the future  don't ask a technologist  a scientist  a physicist. No  Don't ask somebody who's writing code. No  if you want to know what society's going to be like in    years  ask a kindergarten teacher. They know. In fact  don't ask just any kindergarten teacher  ask an experienced one. They're the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation. I don't. Nor  I suspect  do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring. Certainly  all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there. But to me  things aren't the future. What I ask myself is  what's society is going to be like  when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on screen time  but have never gone bowling together  Change is happening  and the change that is happening is not one that is in software. But that's not what I'm going to talk about. I'd love to talk about it  it'd be fun  but I want to talk about what I'm doing now. What am I doing now  Oh    the other thing that I think I'd like to talk about is right over here. Right over here. Is that visible  What I'd like to talk about is one sided things. I would dearly love to talk about things that have one side. Because I love Mobius loops. I not only love Mobius loops  but I'm one of the very few people  if not the only person in the world  that makes Klein bottles. Right away  I hope that all of your eyes glaze over. This is a Klein bottle. For those of you in the audience who know  you roll your eyes and say  yup  I know all about it. It's one sided. It's a bottle whose inside is its outside. It has zero volume. And it's non orientable. It has wonderful properties. If you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together  you get one of these  and I make them out of glass. And I'd love to talk to you about this  but I don't have much in the way of ... things to say because    However  the  D  in TED of course stands for design. Just two weeks ago I made    you know  I've been making small  medium and big Klein bottles for the trade. But what I've just made    and I'm delighted to show you  first time in public here. This is a Klein bottle wine bottle  which  although in four dimensions it shouldn't be able to hold any fluid at all  it's perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions. And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions  it can hold fluids. So it's highly    that one's the cool one. That was a month of my life. But although I would love to talk about topology with you  I'm not going to. Instead  I'm going to mention my mom  who passed away last summer. Had collected photographs of me  as mothers will do. Could somebody put this guy up  And I looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me  standing    well  sitting    in       in front of a bunch of dials. And I looked at it  and said  oh my god  that was me  when I was working at the electronic music studio  As a technician  repairing and maintaining the electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo. And wow  Way back machine. And I said to myself  oh yeah  And it sent me back. Soon after that  I found in another picture that she had  a picture of me. This guy over here of course is me. This man is Robert Moog  the inventor of the Moog synthesizer  who passed away this past August. Robert Moog was a generous  kind person  extraordinarily competent engineer. A musician who took time from his life to teach me  a sophomore  a freshman at SUNY Buffalo. He'd come up from Trumansburg to teach me not just about the Moog synthesizer  but we'd be sitting there    I'm studying physics at the time. This is             . We're studying physics  I'm studying physics  and he's saying   That's a good thing to do. Don't get caught up in electronic music if you're doing physics.  Mentoring me. He'd come up and spend hours and hours with me. He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school. In the background  my bicycle. I realize that this picture was taken at a friend's living room. Bob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment to show Greg Flint and I things about this. We sat around talking about Fourier transforms  Bessel functions  modulation transfer functions  stuff like this. Bob's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us. Anyone who's a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog. And I'll just say what I'm about to do. What I'm about to do    I hope you can recognize that there's a distorted sine wave  almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett Packard oscilloscope. Oh  cool. I can get to this place over here  right  Kids. Kids is what I'm going to talk about    is that okay  It says kids over here  that's what I'd like to talk about. I've decided that  for me at least  I don't have a big enough head. So I think locally and I act locally. I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very  very locally. So Ph.D. this  and degree there  and the yadda yadda. I was talking about this stuff to some schoolteachers about a year ago. And one of them  several of them would come up to me and say   Well  how come you ain't teaching   And I said   Well  I've taught graduate    I've had graduate students  I've taught undergraduate classes.  No  they said   If you're so into kids and all this stuff  how come you ain't over here on the front lines  Put your money where you mouth is.  Is true. Is true. I teach eighth grade science four days a week. Not just showing up every now and then. No  no  no  no  no. I take attendance. I take lunch hour.  Applause  This is not    no  no  no  this is not claps. I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do. Not just show up to class every now and then. Teach a solid week. Okay  I'm teaching three quarters time  but good enough. One of the things that I've done for my science students is to tell them   Look  I'm going to teach you college level physics. No calculus  I'll cut out that. You won't need to know trig. But you will need to know eighth grade algebra  and we're going to do serious experiments. None of this open to chapter seven and do all the odd problem sets. We're going to be doing genuine physics.  And that's one of the things I thought I'd do right now. Oh  before I even turn that on  one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class    this is through the lens  and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light. My students in El Cerrito    with my help  of course  and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope    measured the speed of light. We were off by    percent. How many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light  In addition to that  we've measured the speed of sound. I'd love to measure the speed of light here. I was all set to do it and I was thinking   Aw man   I was just going to impose upon the powers that be  and measure the speed of light. And I'm all set to do it. I'm all set to do it  but then it turns out that to set up here  you have like    minutes to set up  And there's no time to do it. So  next time  maybe  I'll measure the speed of light  But meanwhile  let's measure the speed of sound  Well  the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo. But  probably    one of my students  Ariel  unclear   said   Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation   And all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ... is a constant. When the frequency goes up  the wavelength comes down. Wavelength goes up  frequency goes down. So  if we have a wave here    over here  that's what's interesting    as the pitch goes up  things get closer  pitch goes down  things stretch out. Right  This is simple physics. All of you know this from eighth grade  remember  What they didn't tell you in physics    in eighth grade physics    but they should have  and I wish they had  was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light  you get a constant. And that constant is the speed of sound. So  in order to measure the speed of sound  all I've got to do is know its frequency. Well  that's easy. I've got a frequency counter right here. Set it up to around A  above A  above A. There's an A  more or less. Now  so I know the frequency. It's  .   kilohertz. I measure its wavelength. All I need now is to flip on another beam  and the bottom beam is me talking  right  So anytime I talk  you'd see it on the screen. I'll put it over here  and as I move this away from the source  you'll notice the spiral. The slinky moves. We're going through different nodes of the wave  coming out this way. Those of you who are physicists  I hear you rolling your eyes  but bear with me.  Laughter  To measure the wavelength  all I need to do is measure the distance from here    one full wave    over to here. From here to here is the wavelength of sound. So  I'll put a measuring tape here  measuring tape here  move it back over to here. I've moved the microphone    centimeters.  .  meters from here  back to here     centimeters. OK  let's go back to Mr. Elmo. And we'll say the frequency is  .   kilohertz  or     . The wavelength was  .  meters. Let's figure out what this is.  .   times  .  over here is     meters per second. If you look it up in the book  it's really    . But  here with kludgy material  and lousy drink    we've been able to measure the speed of sound to    not bad. Pretty good. All of which comes to what I wanted to say. Go back to this picture of me a million years ago. It was       the Vietnam War was going on  and I'm like   Oh my God   I'm studying physics  Landau  Lipschitz  Resnick and Halliday. I'm going home for a midterm. A riot's going on on campus. There's a riot  Hey  Elmo's done  off. There's a riot going on on campus  and the police are chasing me  right  I'm walking across campus. Cop comes and looks at me and says   You  You're a student.  Pulls out a gun. Goes boom  And a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head. Whoosh  I get a breath of tear gas and I can't breathe. This cop comes after me with a rifle. He wants to clunk me over the head  I'm saying   I got to clear out of here   I go running across campus quick as I can. I duck into Hayes Hall. It's one of these bell tower buildings. The cop's chasing me. Chasing me up the first floor  second floor  third floor. Chases me into this room. The entranceway to the bell tower. I slam the door behind me  climb up  go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking. And I'm thinking   Oh yeah  the square root of the length is proportional to its period.   Laughter  I keep climbing up  go back. I go to a place where a dowel splits off. There's a clock  clock  clock  clock. The time's going backwards because I'm inside of it. I'm thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity. I climb up  and there's this place  way in the back  that you climb up this wooden ladder. I pop up the top  and there's a cupola. A dome  one of these ten foot domes. I'm looking out and I'm seeing the cops bashing students' heads  shooting tear gas  and watching students throwing bricks. And I'm asking   What am I doing here  Why am I here   Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said. Namely  that when they cast bells  they write inscriptions on them. So  I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells  and I look at it. I'm asking myself   Why am I here   So  at this time  I'd like to tell you the words inscribed upon the Hayes Hall tower bells   All truth is one. In this light  may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind  from darkness to light  from narrowness to broad mindedness  from prejudice to tolerance. It is the voice of life  which calls us to come and learn.  Thank you very much.
