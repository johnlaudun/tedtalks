What you just heard are the interactions of barometric pressure  wind and temperature readings that were recorded of Hurricane Noel in     . The musicians played off a three dimensional graph of weather data like this. Every single bead  every single colored band  represents a weather element that can also be read as a musical note. I find weather extremely fascinating. Weather is an amalgam of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us. So I use sculpture and music to make it  not just visible  but also tactile and audible. All of my work begins very simple. I extract information from a specific environment using very low tech data collecting devices    generally anything I can find in the hardware store. I then compare my information to the things I find on the Internet    satellite images  weather data from weather stations as well as offshore buoys. That's both historical as well as real data. And then I compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here. These clipboards are filled with numbers. And from all of these numbers  I start with only two or three variables. That begins my translation process. My translation medium is a very simple basket. A basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements. When I assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements  I can use the changes of those data points over time to create the form. I use natural reed  because natural reed has a lot of tension in it that I cannot fully control. That means that it is the numbers that control the form  not me. What I come up with are forms like these. These forms are completely made up of weather data or science data. Every colored bead  every colored string  represents a weather element. And together  these elements  not only construct the form  but they also reveal behavioral relationships that may not come across through a two dimensional graph. When you step closer  you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers. The vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day. So all the way around  you have a    hour timeline. But it's also used to assign a temperature range. On that grid  I can then weave the high tide readings  water temperature  air temperature and Moon phases. I also translate weather data into musical scores. And musical notation allows me a more nuanced way of translating information without compromising it. So all of these scores are made up of weather data. Every single color  dot  every single line  is a weather element. And together  these variables construct a score. I use these scores to collaborate with musicians. This is the      Trio performing one of my pieces at the Milwaukee Art Museum. Meanwhile  I use these scores as blueprints to translate into sculptural forms like this  that function still in the sense of being a three dimensional weather visualization  but now they're embedding the visual matrix of the musical score  so it can actually be read as a musical score. What I love about this work is that it challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art  versus science. This piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it. You place it in an art museum  it becomes a sculpture. You place it in a science museum  it becomes a three dimensional visualization of data. You place it in a music hall  it all of a sudden becomes a musical score. And I really like that  because the viewer is really challenged as to what visual language is part of science versus art versus music. The other reason why I really like this is because it offers an alternative entry point into the complexity of science. And not everyone has a Ph.D. in science. So for me  that was my way into it. Thank you. You all know the truth of what I'm going to say. I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the French Revolution. What's changed is we now can look at the evidence  we can compare societies  more and less equal societies  and see what inequality does. I'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links I'm going to be showing you exist. But first  see what a miserable lot we are. I want to start though with a paradox. This shows you life expectancy against gross national income    how rich countries are on average. And you see the countries on the right  like Norway and the USA  are twice as rich as Israel  Greece  Portugal on the left. And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all. There's no suggestion of a relationship there. But if we look within our societies  there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society. This  again  is life expectancy. These are small areas of England and Wales    the poorest on the right  the richest on the left. A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us. Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top. So income means something very important within our societies  and nothing between them. The explanation of that paradox is that  within our societies  we're looking at relative income or social position  social status    where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us. And as soon as you've got that idea  you should immediately wonder  what happens if we widen the differences  or compress them  make the income differences bigger or smaller  And that's what I'm going to show you. I'm not using any hypothetical data. I'm taking data from the U.N.    it's the same as the World Bank has    on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies. The measure we've used  because it's easy to understand and you can download it  is how much richer the top    percent than the bottom    percent in each country. And you see in the more equal countries on the left    Japan  Finland  Norway  Sweden    the top    percent are about three and a half  four times as rich as the bottom    percent. But on the more unequal end    U.K.  Portugal  USA  Singapore    the differences are twice as big. On that measure  we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies. Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies. We collected data on problems with social gradients  the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder. Internationally comparable data on life expectancy  on kids' maths and literacy scores  on infant mortality rates  homicide rates  proportion of the population in prison  teenage birthrates  levels of trust  obesity  mental illness    which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction    and social mobility. We put them all in one index. They're all weighted equally. Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things. And there  you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you  which I shall use over and over again in the data. The more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems. It's an extraordinarily close correlation. But if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita  gross national income  there's nothing there  no correlation anymore. We were a little bit worried that people might think we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence  so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well being. It has    different components put together by other people. It contains whether kids can talk to their parents  whether they have books at home  what immunization rates are like  whether there's bullying at school. Everything goes into it. Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality. Kids do worse in the more unequal societies. Highly significant relationship. But once again  if you look at that measure of child well being  in relation to national income per person  there's no relationship  no suggestion of a relationship. What all the data I've shown you so far says is the same thing. The average well being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth. That's very important in poorer countries  but not in the rich developed world. But the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much. I'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index. Here  for instance  is trust. It's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted. It comes from the World Values Survey. You see  at the more unequal end  it's about    percent of the population who feel they can trust others. But in the more equal societies  it rises to    or    percent. And if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital  very similar relationships closely related to inequality. I may say  we did all this work twice. We did it first on these rich  developed countries  and then as a separate test bed  we repeated it all on the    American states    asking just the same question  do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures  So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality. Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust. Same thing is going on. Basically we found that almost anything that's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the    states in that separate test bed. We're not just talking about a fluke. This is mental illness. WHO put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society. This is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year. And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that    whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others. And again  closely related to inequality. This is violence. These red dots are American states  and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces. But look at the scale of the differences. It goes from    homicides per million up to    . This is the proportion of the population in prison. There's a about a tenfold difference there  log scale up the side. But it goes from about    to     people in prison. That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime. In some places  that's part of it. But most of it is about more punitive sentencing  harsher sentencing. And the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty. Here we have children dropping out of high school. Again  quite big differences. Extraordinarily damaging  if you're talking about using the talents of the population. This is social mobility. It's actually a measure of mobility based on income. Basically  it's asking  do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons  or is there no relationship between the two  And at the more unequal end  fathers' income is much more important    in the U.K.  USA. And in Scandinavian countries  fathers' income is much less important. There's more social mobility. And as we like to say    and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here    if Americans want to live the American dream  they should go to Denmark. I've shown you just a few things in italics here. I could have shown a number of other problems. They're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient. But there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries    not just a little bit worse  but anything from twice as common to    times as common. Think of the expense  the human cost of that. I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points. One is that  in graph after graph  we find the countries that do worse  whatever the outcome  seem to be the more unequal ones  and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan. So what we're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality. It's not just one or two things that go wrong  it's most things. The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that  if you look at the bottom  Sweden and Japan  they're very different countries in all sorts of ways. The position of women  how closely they keep to the nuclear family  are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world. But another really important difference is how they get their greater equality. Sweden has huge differences in earnings  and it narrows the gap through taxation  general welfare state  generous benefits and so on. Japan is rather different though. It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax. It has lower taxes. It has a smaller welfare state. And in our analysis of the American states  we find rather the same contrast. There are some states that do well through redistribution  some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax. So we conclude that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality  as long as you get there somehow. I am not talking about perfect equality  I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies. Another really surprising part of this picture is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality. There seems to be some truth in John Donne's  No man is an island.  And in a number of studies  it's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy. This is just one example. It's infant mortality. Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification. And so it's anachronistically a classification by fathers' occupations  so single parents go on their own. But then where it says  low social class   that's unskilled manual occupations. It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle  then the junior non manual  going up high to the professional occupations    doctors  lawyers  directors of larger companies. You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across the social hierarchy. The biggest differences are at the bottom of society. But even at the top  there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society. We show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally. And that seems to be the general picture    that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom  but has some benefits even at the top. But I should say a few words about what's going on. I think I'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality. More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority  of being valued and devalued  respected and disrespected. And of course  those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society. It also leads to status insecurity. We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others  whether we're regarded as attractive  clever  all that kind of thing. The social evaluative judgments increase  the fear of those social evaluative judgments. Interestingly  some parallel work going on in social psychology  some people reviewed     different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones  their responses to doing stressful tasks  measured. And in the review  what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol  the central stress hormone. And the conclusion was it was tasks that included social evaluative threat    threats to self esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance. Those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress. Now we have been criticized. Of course  there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising. I should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data  we never pick and choose data. We have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at  it goes into the analysis. Our data source decides whether it's reliable data  we don't. Otherwise that would introduce bias. What about other countries  There are     studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer reviewed journals. This isn't confined to these countries here  hiding a very simple demonstration. The same countries  the same measure of inequality  one problem after another. Why don't we control for other factors  Well we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't make any difference. And of course  others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on. What about causality  Correlation in itself doesn't prove causality. We spend a good bit of time. And indeed  people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes. The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system  the cardiovascular system. Or for instance  the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on. I should say that to deal with this  we've got to deal with the post tax things and the pre tax things. We've got to constrain income  the bonus culture incomes at the top. I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can. I think the take home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes between us. Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well being of whole societies  and that's exciting. Thank you. Thank you. It's a real pleasure to be here. I last did a TED Talk I think about seven years ago or so. I talked about spaghetti sauce. And so many people  I guess  watch those videos. People have been coming up to me ever since to ask me questions about spaghetti sauce  which is a wonderful thing in the short term    but it's proven to be less than ideal over seven years. And so I though I would come and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me. The theme of this morning's session is Things We Make. And so I thought I would tell a story about someone who made one of the most precious objects of his era. And the man's name is Carl Norden. Carl Norden was born in     . And he was Swiss. And of course  the Swiss can be divided into two general categories  those who make small  exquisite  expensive objects and those who handle the money of those who buy small  exquisite  expensive objects. And Carl Norden is very firmly in the former camp. He's an engineer. He goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich. In fact  one of his classmates is a young man named Lenin who would go on to break small  expensive  exquisite objects. And he's a Swiss engineer  Carl. And I mean that in its fullest sense of the word. He wears three piece suits  and he has a very  very small  important mustache  and he is domineering and narcissistic and driven and has an extraordinary ego  and he works    hour days  and he has very strong feelings about alternating current  and he feels like a suntan is a sign of moral weakness  and he drinks lots of coffee  and he does his best work sitting in his mother's kitchen in Zurich for hours in complete silence with nothing but a slide rule. In any case  Carl Norden emigrates to the United States just before the First World War and sets up shop on Lafayette Street in downtown Manhattan. And he becomes obsessed with the question of how to drop bombs from an airplane. Now if you think about it  in the age before GPS and radar  that was obviously a really difficult problem. It's a complicated physics problem. You've got a plane that's thousands of feet up in the air  going at hundreds of miles an hour  and you're trying to drop an object  a bomb  towards some stationary target in the face of all kinds of winds and cloud cover and all kinds of other impediments. And all sorts of people  moving up to the First World War and between the wars  tried to solve this problem  and nearly everybody came up short. The bombsights that were available were incredibly crude. But Carl Norden is really the one who cracks the code. And he comes up with this incredibly complicated device. It weighs about    lbs. It's called the Norden Mark    bombsight. And it has all kinds of levers and ball bearings and gadgets and gauges. And he makes this complicated thing. And what he allows people to do is he makes the bombardier take this particular object  visually sight the target  because they're in the Plexiglas cone of the bomber  and then they plug in the altitude of the plane  the speed of the plane  the speed of the wind and the coordinates of the target. And the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb. And as Norden famously says   Before that bombsight came along  bombs would routinely miss their target by a mile or more.  But he said  with the Mark    Norden bombsight  he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at        ft. Now I cannot tell you how incredibly excited the U.S. military was by the news of the Norden bombsight. It was like manna from heaven. Here was an army that had just had experience in the First World War  where millions of men fought each other in the trenches  getting nowhere  making no progress  and here someone had come up with a device that allowed them to fly up in the skies high above enemy territory and destroy whatever they wanted with pinpoint accuracy. And the U.S. military spends  .  billion dollars    billion dollars in      dollars    developing the Norden bombsight. And to put that in perspective  the total cost of the Manhattan project was three billion dollars. Half as much money was spent on this Norden bombsight as was spent on the most famous military industrial project of the modern era. And there were people  strategists  within the U.S. military who genuinely thought that this single device was going to spell the difference between defeat and victory when it came to the battle against the Nazis and against the Japanese. And for Norden as well  this device had incredible moral importance  because Norden was a committed Christian. In fact  he would always get upset when people referred to the bombsight as his invention  because in his eyes  only God could invent things. He was simply the instrument of God's will. And what was God's will  Well God's will was that the amount of suffering in any kind of war be reduced to as small an amount as possible. And what did the Norden bombsight do  Well it allowed you to do that. It allowed you to bomb only those things that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb. So in the years leading up to the Second World War  the U.S. military buys        of these Norden bombsights at a cost of         each    again  in      dollars  that's a lot of money. And they trained        bombardiers on how to use them    long extensive  months long training sessions    because these things are essentially analog computers  they're not easy to use. And they make every one of those bombardiers take an oath  to swear that if they're ever captured  they will not divulge a single detail of this particular device to the enemy  because it's imperative the enemy not get their hands on this absolutely essential piece of technology. And whenever the Norden bombsight is taken onto a plane  it's escorted there by a series of armed guards. And it's carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it. And the box is handcuffed to one of the guards. It's never allowed to be photographed. And there's a little incendiary device inside of it  so that  if the plane ever crashes  it will be destroyed and there's no way the enemy can ever get their hands on it. The Norden bombsight is the Holy Grail. So what happens during the Second World War  Well  it turns out it's not the Holy Grail. In practice  the Norden bombsight can drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at        ft.  but that's under perfect conditions. And of course  in wartime  conditions aren't perfect. First of all  it's really hard to use    really hard to use. And not all of the people who are of those        men who are bombardiers have the ability to properly program an analog computer. Secondly  it breaks down a lot. It's full of all kinds of gyroscopes and pulleys and gadgets and ball bearings  and they don't work as well as they ought to in the heat of battle. Thirdly  when Norden was making his calculations  he assumed that a plane would be flying at a relatively slow speed at low altitudes. Well in a real war  you can't do that  you'll get shot down. So they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds. And the Norden bombsight doesn't work as well under those conditions. But most of all  the Norden bombsight required the bombardier to make visual contact with the target. But of course  what happens in real life  There are clouds  right. It needs cloudless sky to be really accurate. Well how many cloudless skies do you think there were above Central Europe between      and       Not a lot. And then to give you a sense of just how inaccurate the Norden bombsight was  there was a famous case in      where the Allies bombed a chemical plant in Leuna  Germany. And the chemical plant comprised     acres. And over the course of    bombing missions  the Allies dropped        bombs on this     acre chemical plant  using the Norden bombsight. Well what percentage of those bombs do you think actually landed inside the     acre perimeter of the plant     percent.    percent. And of those    percent that landed     percent didn't even go off  they were duds. The Leuna chemical plant  after one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war  was up and running within weeks. And by the way  all those precautions to keep the Norden bombsight out of the hands of the Nazis  Well it turns out that Carl Norden  as a proper Swiss  was very enamored of German engineers. So in the     s  he hired a whole bunch of them  including a man named Hermann Long who  in       gave a complete set of the plans for the Norden bombsight to the Nazis. So they had their own Norden bombsight throughout the entire war    which also  by the way  didn't work very well. So why do we talk about the Norden bombsight  Well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of Norden bombsights. We live in a time where there are all kinds of really  really smart people running around  saying that they've invented gadgets that will forever change our world. They've invented websites that will allow people to be free. They've invented some kind of this thing  or this thing  or this thing that will make our world forever better. If you go into the military  you'll find lots of Carl Nordens as well. If you go to the Pentagon  they will say   You know what  now we really can put a bomb inside a pickle barrel at        ft.  And you know what  it's true  they actually can do that now. But we need to be very clear about how little that means. In the Iraq War  at the beginning of the first Iraq War  the U.S. military  the air force  sent two squadrons of F   E Fighter Eagles to the Iraqi desert equipped with these five million dollar cameras that allowed them to see the entire desert floor. And their mission was to find and to destroy    remember the Scud missile launchers  those surface to air missiles that the Iraqis were launching at the Israelis  The mission of the two squadrons was to get rid of all the Scud missile launchers. And so they flew missions day and night  and they dropped thousands of bombs  and they fired thousands of missiles in an attempt to get rid of this particular scourge. And after the war was over  there was an audit done    as the army always does  the air force always does    and they asked the question  how many Scuds did we actually destroy  You know what the answer was  Zero  not a single one. Now why is that  Is it because their weapons weren't accurate  Oh no  they were brilliantly accurate. They could have destroyed this little thing right here from        ft. The issue was they didn't know where the Scud launchers were. The problem with bombs and pickle barrels is not getting the bomb inside the pickle barrel  it's knowing how to find the pickle barrel. That's always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars. Or take the battle in Afghanistan. What is the signature weapon of the CIA's war in Northwest Pakistan  It's the drone. What is the drone  Well it is the grandson of the Norden Mark    bombsight. It is this weapon of devastating accuracy and precision. And over the course of the last six years in Northwest Pakistan  the CIA has flown hundreds of drone missiles  and it's used those drones to kill       suspected Pakistani and Taliban militants. Now what is the accuracy of those drones  Well it's extraordinary. We think we're now at    percent accuracy when it comes to drone strikes.    percent of the people we kill need to be killed  right  That is one of the most extraordinary records in the history of modern warfare. But do you know what the crucial thing is  In that exact same period that we've been using these drones with devastating accuracy  the number of attacks  of suicide attacks and terrorist attacks  against American forces in Afghanistan has increased tenfold. As we have gotten more and more efficient in killing them  they have become angrier and angrier and more and more motivated to kill us. I have not described to you a success story. I've described to you the opposite of a success story. And this is the problem with our infatuation with the things we make. We think the things we make can solve our problems  but our problems are much more complex than that. The issue isn't the accuracy of the bombs you have  it's how you use the bombs you have  and more importantly  whether you ought to use bombs at all. There's a postscript to the Norden story of Carl Norden and his fabulous bombsight. And that is  on August          a B    bomber called the Enola Gay flew over Japan and  using a Norden bombsight  dropped a very large thermonuclear device on the city of Hiroshima. And as was typical with the Norden bombsight  the bomb actually missed its target by     ft. But of course  it didn't matter. And that's the greatest irony of all when it comes to the Norden bombsight. the air force's  .  billion dollar bombsight was used to drop its three billion dollar bomb  which didn't need a bombsight at all. Meanwhile  back in New York  no one told Carl Norden that his bombsight was used over Hiroshima. He was a committed Christian. He thought he had designed something that would reduce the toll of suffering in war. It would have broken his heart. I moved to Boston    years ago  from Chicago  with an interest in cancer and in chemistry. You might know that chemistry is the science of making molecules    or to my taste  new drugs for cancer. And you might also know that  for science and medicine  Boston is a bit of a candy store. You can't roll a stop sign in Cambridge without hitting a graduate student. The bar is called the Miracle of Science. The billboards say  Lab Space Available.  And it's fair to say that in these    years  we've witnessed absolutely the start of a scientific revolution    that of genome medicine. We know more about the patients that enter our clinic now than ever before. And we're able  finally  to answer the question that's been so pressing for so many years  why do I have cancer  This information is also pretty staggering. You might know that  so far in just the dawn of this revolution  we know that there are perhaps        unique mutations affecting more than        genes  and that there are     of these genes that are bona fide drivers  causes of cancer. Yet comparatively  we have about a dozen targeted medications. And this inadequacy of cancer medicine really hit home when my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. We didn't fly him to Boston. We didn't sequence his genome. It's been known for decades what causes this malignancy. It's three proteins    Ras  Myc and P  . This is old information we've known since about the   s  yet there's no medicine I can prescribe to a patient with this or any of the numerous solid tumors caused by these three horsemen of the apocalypse that is cancer. There's no Ras  no Myc  no P   drug. And you might fairly ask  why is that  And the very unsatisfying  yet scientific  answer is it's too hard. That for whatever reason  these three proteins have entered a space in the language of our field that's called the undruggable genome    which is like calling a computer unsurfable or the Moon unwalkable. It's a horrible term of trade. But what it means is that we fail to identify a greasy pocket in these proteins  into which we  like molecular locksmiths  can fashion an active  small  organic molecule or drug substance. Now as I was training in clinical medicine and hematology and oncology and stem cell transplantation  what we had instead  cascading through the regulatory network at the FDA  were these substances    arsenic  thalidomide and this chemical derivative of nitrogen mustard gas. And this is the   st century. And so  I guess you'd say  dissatisfied with the performance and quality of these medicines  I went back to school in chemistry with the idea that perhaps by learning the trade of discovery chemistry and approaching it in the context of this brave new world of the open source  the crowd source  the collaborative network that we have access to within academia  that we might more quickly bring powerful and targeted therapies to our patients. And so please consider this a work in progress  but I'd like to tell you today a story about a very rare cancer called midline carcinoma  about the protein target  the undruggable protein target that causes this cancer  called BRD   and about a molecule developed at my lab at Dana Farber Cancer Institute called JQ   which we affectionately named for Jun Qi  the chemist that made this molecule. Now BRD  is an interesting protein. You might ask yourself  with all the things cancer's trying to do to kill our patient  how does it remember it's cancer  When it winds up its genome  divides into two cells and unwinds again  why does it not turn into an eye  into a liver  as it has all the genes necessary to do this  It remembers that it's cancer. And the reason is that cancer  like every cell in the body  places little molecular bookmarks  little Post it notes  that remind the cell  I'm cancer  I should keep growing.  And those Post it notes involve this and other proteins of its class    so called bromodomains. So we developed an idea  a rationale  that perhaps  if we made a molecule that prevented the Post it note from sticking by entering into the little pocket at the base of this spinning protein  then maybe we could convince cancer cells  certainly those addicted to this BRD  protein  that they're not cancer. And so we started to work on this problem. We developed libraries of compounds and eventually arrived at this and similar substances called JQ . Now not being a drug company  we could do certain things  we had certain flexibilities  that I respect that a pharmaceutical industry doesn't have. We just started mailing it to our friends. I have a small lab. We thought we'd just send it to people and see how the molecule behaves. And we sent it to Oxford  England where a group of talented crystallographers provided this picture  which helped us understand exactly how this molecule is so potent for this protein target. It's what we call a perfect fit of shape complimentarity  or hand in glove. Now this is a very rare cancer  this BRD  addicted cancer. And so we worked with samples of material that were collected by young pathologists at Brigham Women's Hospital. And as we treated these cells with this molecule  we observed something really striking. The cancer cells  small  round and rapidly dividing  grew these arms and extensions. They were changing shape. In effect  the cancer cell was forgetting it was cancer and becoming a normal cell. This got us very excited. The next step would be to put this molecule into mice. The only problem was there's no mouse model of this rare cancer. And so at the time that we were doing this research  I was caring for a    year old firefighter from Connecticut who was very much at the end of life with this incurable cancer. This BRD  addicted cancer was growing throughout his left lung  and he had a chest tube in that was draining little bits of debris. And every nursing shift we would throw this material out. And so we approached this patient and asked if he would collaborate with us. Could we take this precious and rare cancerous material from this chest tube and drive it across town and put it into mice and try to do a clinical trial and stage it with a prototype drug  Well that would be impossible and  rightly  illegal to do in humans. And he obliged us. At the Lurie Family Center for Animal Imaging  my colleague  Andrew Kung  grew this cancer successfully in mice without ever touching plastic. And you can see this PET scan of a mouse    what we call a pet PET. The cancer is growing as this red  huge mass in the hind limb of this animal. And as we treat it with our compound  this addiction to sugar  this rapid growth  faded. And on the animal on the right  you see that the cancer was responding. We've completed now clinical trials in four mouse models of this disease. And every time  we see the same thing. The mice with this cancer that get the drug live  and the ones that don't rapidly perish. So we started to wonder  what would a drug company do at this point  Well they probably would keep this a secret until they turn a prototype drug into an active pharmaceutical substance. And so we did just the opposite. We published a paper that described this finding at the earliest prototype stage. We gave the world the chemical identity of this molecule  typically a secret in our discipline. We told people exactly how to make it. We gave them our email address  suggesting that  if they write us  we'll send them a free molecule. We basically tried to create the most competitive environment for our lab as possible. And this was  unfortunately  successful. Because now when we've shared this molecule  just since December of last year  with    laboratories in the United States and    more in Europe    many of them pharmaceutical companies seeking now to enter this space  to target this rare cancer that  thankfully right now  is quite desirable to study in that industry. But the science that's coming back from all of these laboratories about the use of this molecule has provided us insights that we might not have had on our own. Leukemia cells treated with this compound turn into normal white blood cells. Mice with multiple myeloma  an incurable malignancy of the bone marrow  respond dramatically to the treatment with this drug. You might know that fat has memory. Nice to be able to demonstrate that for you. And in fact  this molecule prevents this adipocyte  this fat stem cell  from remembering how to make fat such that mice on a high fat diet  like the folks in my hometown of Chicago  fail to develop fatty liver  which is a major medical problem. What this research taught us    not just my lab  but our institute  and Harvard Medical School more generally    is that we have unique resources in academia for drug discovery    that our center that has tested perhaps more cancer molecules in a scientific way than any other  never made one of its own. For all the reasons you see listed here  we think there's a great opportunity for academic centers to participate in this earliest  conceptually tricky and creative discipline of prototype drug discovery. So what next  We have this molecule  but it's not a pill yet. It's not orally available. We need to fix it  so that we can deliver it to our patients. And everyone in the lab  especially following the interaction with these patients  feels quite compelled to deliver a drug substance based on this molecule. It's here where I have to say that we could use your help and your insights  your collaborative participation. Unlike a drug company  we don't have a pipeline that we can deposit these molecules into. We don't have a team of salespeople and marketeers that can tell us how to position this drug against the other. What we do have is the flexibility of an academic center to work with competent  motivated  enthusiastic  hopefully well funded people to carry these molecules forward into the clinic while preserving our ability to share the prototype drug worldwide. This molecule will soon leave our benches and go into a small startup company called Tensha Therapeutics. And really this is the fourth of these molecules to kind of graduate from our little pipeline of drug discovery  two of which    a topical drug for lymphoma of the skin  an oral substance for the treatment of multiple myeloma    will actually come to the bedside for first clinical trial in July of this year. For us  a major and exciting milestone. I want to leave you with just two ideas. The first is if anything is unique about this research  it's less the science than the strategy    that this for us was a social experiment  an experiment in what would happen if we were as open and honest at the earliest phase of discovery chemistry research as we could be. This string of letters and numbers and symbols and parentheses that can be texted  I suppose  or Twittered worldwide  is the chemical identity of our pro compound. It's the information that we most need from pharmaceutical companies  the information on how these early prototype drugs might work. Yet this information is largely a secret. And so we seek really to download from the amazing successes of the computer science industry two principles  that of opensource and that of crowdsourcing to quickly  responsibly accelerate the delivery of targeted therapeutics to patients with cancer. Now the business model involves all of you. This research is funded by the public. It's funded by foundations. And one thing I've learned in Boston is that you people will do anything for cancer    and I love that. You bike across the state. You walk up and down the river. I've never seen really anywhere this unique support for cancer research. And so I want to thank you for your participation  your collaboration and most of all for your confidence in our ideas. I am a papercutter. I cut stories. So my process is very straightforward. I take a piece of paper  I visualize my story  sometimes I sketch  sometimes I don't. And as my image is already inside the paper  I just have to remove what's not from that story. So I didn't come to papercutting in a straight line. In fact  I see it more as a spiral. I was not born with a blade in my hand. And I don't remember papercutting as a child. As a teenager  I was sketching  drawing  and I wanted to be an artist. But I was also a rebel. And I left everything and went for a long series of odd jobs. So among them  I have been a shepherdess  a truck driver  a factory worker  a cleaning lady. I worked in tourism for one year in Mexico  one year in Egypt. I moved for two years in Taiwan. And then I settled in New York where I became a tour guide. And I still worked as a tour leader  traveled back and forth in China  Tibet and Central Asia. So of course  it took time  and I was nearly     and I decided it's time to start as an artist. I chose papercutting because paper is cheap  it's light  and you can use it in a lot of different ways. And I chose the language of silhouette because graphically it's very efficient. And it's also just getting to the essential of things. So the word  silhouette  comes from a minister of finance  Etienne de Silhouette. And he slashed so many budgets that people said they couldn't afford paintings anymore  and they needed to have their portrait  a la silhouette.  So I made series of images  cuttings  and I assembled them in portfolios. And people told me    like these    views of the Empire State building    they told me   You're making artist books.  So artist books have a lot of definitions. They come in a lot of different shapes. But to me  they are fascinating objects to visually narrate a story. They can be with words or without words. And I have a passion for images and for words. I love pun and the relation to the unconscious. I love oddities of languages. And everywhere I lived  I learned the languages  but never mastered them. So I'm always looking for the false cognates or identical words in different languages. So as you can guess  my mother tongue is French. And my daily language is English. So I did a series of work where it was identical words in French and in English. So one of these works is the  Spelling Spider.  So the Spelling Spider is a cousin of the spelling bee. But it's much more connected to the Web. And this spider spins a bilingual alphabet. So you can read  architecture active  or  active architecture.  So this spider goes through the whole alphabet with identical adjectives and substantives. So if you don't know one of these languages  it's instant learning. And one ancient form of the book is scrolls. So scrolls are very convenient  because you can create a large image on a very small table. So the unexpected consequences of that is that you only see one part of your image  so it makes a very freestyle architecture. And I'm making all those kinds of windows. So it's to look beyond the surface. It's to have a look at different worlds. And very often I've been an outsider. So I want to see how things work and what's happening. So each window is an image and is a world that I often revisit. And I revisit this world thinking about the image or clich  about what we want to do  and what are the words  colloquialisms  that we have with the expressions. It's all if. So what if we were living in balloon houses  It would make a very uplifting world. And we would leave a very low footprint on the planet. It would be so light. So sometimes I view from the inside  like EgoCentriCity and the inner circles. Sometimes it's a global view  to see our common roots and how we can use them to catch dreams. And we can use them also as a safety net. And my inspirations are very eclectic. I'm influenced by everything I read  everything I see. I have some stories that are humorous  like  Dead Beats.  Other ones are historical. Here it's  CandyCity.  It's a non sugar coated history of sugar. It goes from slave trade to over consumption of sugar with some sweet moments in between. And sometimes I have an emotional response to news  such as the      Haitian earthquake. Other times  it's not even my stories. People tell me their lives  their memories  their aspirations  and I create a mindscape. I channel their history  so that  they have a place to go back to look at their life and its possibilities. I call them Freudian cities. I cannot speak for all my images  so I'll just go through a few of my worlds just with the title.  ModiCity.   ElectriCity.   MAD Growth on Columbus Circle.   ReefCity.   A Web of Time.   Chaos City.   Daily Battles.   FeliCity.   Floating Islands.  And at one point  I had to do  The Whole Nine Yards.  So it's actually a papercut that's nine yards long. So in life and in papercutting  everything is connected. One story leads to another. I was also interested in the physicality of this format  because you have to walk to see it. And parallel to my cutting is my running. I started with small images  I started with a few miles. Larger images  I started to run marathons. Then I went to run   K  then   K. Then I ran    miles    ultramarathons. And I still feel I'm running  it's just the training to become a long distance papercutter. And running gives me a lot of energy. Here is a three week papercutting marathon at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City. The result is  Hells and Heavens.  It's two panels    ft. high. They were installed in the museum on two floors  but in fact  it's a continuous image. And I call it  Hells and Heavens  because it's daily hells and daily heavens. There is no border in between. Some people are born in hells  and against all odds  they make it to heavens. Other people make the opposite trip. That's the border. You have sweatshops in hells. You have people renting their wings in the heavens. And then you have all those individual stories where sometimes we even have the same action  and the result puts you in hells or in heavens. So the whole  Hells and Heavens  is about free will and determinism. And in papercutting  you have the drawing as the structure itself. So you can take it off the wall. Here it's an artist book installation called  Identity Project.  It's not autobiographical identities. They are more our social identities. And then you can just walk behind them and try them on. So it's like the different layers of what we are made of and what we present to the world as an identity. That's another artist book project. In fact  in the picture  you have two of them. It's one I'm wearing and one that's on exhibition at the Center for Books Arts in New York City. Why do I call it a book  It's called  Fashion Statement   and there are quotes about fashion  so you can read it  and also  because the definition of artist book is very generous. So artist books  you take them off the wall. You take them for a walk. You can also install them as public art. Here it's in Scottsdale  Arizona  and it's called  Floating Memories.  So it's regional memories  and they are just randomly moved by the wind. I love public art. And I entered competitions for a long time. After eight years of rejection  I was thrilled to get my first commission with the Percent for Art in New York City. It was for a merger station for emergency workers and firemen. I made an artist book that's in stainless steel instead of paper. I called it  Working in the Same Direction.  But I added weathervanes on both sides to show that they cover all directions. With public art  I could also make cut glass. Here it's faceted glass in the Bronx. And each time I make public art  I want something that's really relevant to the place it's installed. So for the subway in New York  I saw a correspondence between riding the subway and reading. It is travel in time  travel on time. And Bronx literature  it's all about Bronx writers and their stories. Another glass project is in a public library in San Jose  California. So I made a vegetable point of view of the growth of San Jose. So I started in the center with the acorn for the Ohlone Indian civilization. Then I have the fruit from Europe for the ranchers. And then the fruit of the world for Silicon Valley today. And it's still growing. So the technique  it's cut  sandblasted  etched and printed glass into architectural glass. And outside the library  I wanted to make a place to cultivate your mind. I took library material that had fruit in their title and I used them to make an orchard walk with these fruits of knowledge. I also planted the bibliotree. So it's a tree  and in its trunk you have the roots of languages. And it's all about international writing systems. And on the branches you have library material growing. You can also have function and form with public art. So in Aurora  Colorado it's a bench. But you have a bonus with this bench. Because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts  you will walk away with temporary branding of the story element on your thighs. Another functional work  it's in the south side of Chicago for a subway station. And it's called  Seeds of the Future are Planted Today.  It's a story about transformation and connections. So it acts as a screen to protect the rail and the commuter  and not to have objects falling on the rails. To be able to change fences and window guards into flowers  it's fantastic. And here I've been working for the last three years with a South Bronx developer to bring art to life to low income buildings and affordable housing. So each building has its own personality. And sometimes it's about a legacy of the neighborhood  like in Morrisania  about the jazz history. And for other projects  like in Paris  it's about the name of the street. It's called Rue des Prairies    Prairie Street. So I brought back the rabbit  the dragonfly  to stay in that street. And in       I was asked to make a poster to be placed in the subway cars in New York City for a year. So that was a very captive audience. And I wanted to give them an escape. I created  All Around Town.  It is a papercutting  and then after  I added color on the computer. So I can call it techno crafted. And along the way  I'm kind of making papercuttings and adding other techniques. But the result is always to have stories. So the stories  they have a lot of possibilities. They have a lot of scenarios. I don't know the stories. I take images from our global imagination  from clich   from things we are thinking about  from history. And everybody's a narrator  because everybody has a story to tell. But more important is everybody has to make a story to make sense of the world. And in all these universes  it's like imagination is the vehicle to be transported with  but the destination is our minds and how we can reconnect with the essential and with the magic. And it's what story cutting is all about. Hi there. I'm Hasan. I'm an artist. And usually when I tell people I'm an artist  they just look at me and say   Do you paint   or  What kind of medium do you work in   Well most of my work that I work with is really a little bit about methodologies of working rather than actually a specific discipline or a specific technique. So what I'm really interested in is creative problem solving. And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago. So let me show you a little of that. So it started over here. And this is the Detroit airport in June   th of     . I was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas. And as I was coming back  well I was taken by the FBI  met by an FBI agent  and went into a little room and he asked me all sorts of questions     Where were you  What were you doing  Who were you talking with  Why were you there  Who pays for your trips      all these little details. And then literally just out of nowhere  the guy asks me   Where were you September   th   And when most of us get asked   Where were you September   th   or any date for that fact  it's like   I don't exactly remember  but I can look it up for you.  So I pulled out my little PDA  and I said   Okay  let's look up my appointments for September   th.  I had September   th    from       a.m. to       a.m.  I paid my storage bill. From       a.m. to       p.m.  I met with Judith who was one of my graduate students at the time. From       p.m. to      p.m.  I taught my intro class       p.m. to      p.m.  I taught my advanced class.  Where were you the   th    Where were you the   th    Where were you the   th  the   th    Where were you October  th   We read about six months of my calendar. And I don't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records of what I did. But good thing I did  because I don't look good in orange. So he asked me     So this storage unit that you paid the rent on  what did you have in it   This was in Tampa  Florida  so I was like   Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida. Furniture that I can't fit in my ratty apartment. Just assorted garage sale junk  because I'm a pack rat.  And he looks at me really confused and says   No explosives   I was like   No  no. I'm pretty certain there were no explosives. And if there were  I would have remembered that one.  And he's still a little confused  but I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes realizes I'm not exactly a terrorist threat. And so we're sitting there  and eventually after about an hour  hour and a half of just going back and forth  he says   Okay  I have enough information here. I'm going to pass this onto the Tampa office. They're the ones who initiated this. They'll follow up with you  and we'll take care of it.  I was like   Great.  So I got home and the phone rings  and a man introduced himself. Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampa where I spent six months of my life    back and forth  not six months continuously. By the way  you folks know that in the United States  you can't take photographs of federal buildings  but Google can do it for you. So to the folks from Google  thank you. So I spent a lot of time in this building. Questions like   Have you ever witnessed or participated in any act that may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation   And you also have to consider the state of mind you're in when you're doing this. You're basically face to face with someone that essentially decides life or death. Or questions such as    actually  during the polygraph  which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them    one of the polygraph questions was ... well the first one was   Is your name Hasan    Yes.   Are we in Florida    Yes.   Is today Tuesday    Yes.  Because you have to base it on a yes or no. Then  of course  the next question is   Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States   I work at a university. So I was like   Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly.  But they said   Okay  aside from what we had discussed  do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States   I was like   No.  So at the end of six months of this and nine consecutive polygraphs  they said   Hey  everything's fine.  I was like   I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys all along. I know everything's fine.  So they're looking at me really odd. And it's like   Guys  I travel a lot.  This is with the FBI. And I was like   All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo  and here we go all over again.  And there was a sincere concern there. And he was like   You know  if you get into trouble  give us a call    we'll take care of it.  So ever since then  before I would go anywhere  I would call the FBI. I would tell them   Hey guys  this is where I'm going. This is my flight. Northwest flight seven coming into Seattle on March   th  or whatever. A couple weeks later  I'd call again  let them know. It wasn't that I had to  but I chose to. Just wanted to say   Hey guys. Don't want to make it look like I'm making any sudden moves.   I don't want you guys to think that I'm about to flee. Just letting you know. Heads up.  And so I just kept doing this over and over and over. And then the phone calls turned into emails  and the emails got longer and longer and longer ... with pictures  with travel tips. Then I'd make websites. And then I built this over here. Let me go back to it over here. So I actually designed this back in     . So this kind of tracks me at any given moment. I wrote some code for my mobile phone. Basically  what I decided is okay guys  you want to watch me  that's cool. But I'll watch myself. It's okay. You don't have to waste your energy or your resources. And I'll help you out. So in the process  I start thinking  well what else might they know about me  Well they probably have all my flight records  so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online. So you can see  Delta      going from Kansas City to Atlanta. And then you see  these are some of the meals that I've been fed on the planes. This was on Delta     going from JFK to San Francisco. See that  They won't let me on a plane with that  but they'll give it to me on the plane. These are the airports that I hang out in  because I like airports. That's Kennedy airport  May   th  Tuesday. This is in Warsaw. Singapore. You can see  they're kind of empty. These images are shot really anonymously to the point where it could be anyone. But if you can cross reference this with the other data  then you're basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent and putting it all together. And when you're in a situation where you have to justify every moment of your existence  you're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner. At the time that this was going on  the last thing on my mind was  art project.  I was certainly not thinking  hey  I got new work here. But after going through this  after realizing  well what just happened  And after piecing together this  this and this  this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this  and it actually became this project. So these are the stores that I shop in    some of them    because they need to know. This is me buying some duck flavored paste at the Ranch    in Daly City on Sunday  November   th. At Coreana Supermarket buying my kimchi because I like kimchi. And I bought some crabs too right around there  and some chitlins at the Safeway in Emoryville. And laundry too. Laundry detergent at West Oakland    East Oakland  sorry. And then my pickled jellyfish at the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route    in East Brunswick. Now if you go to my bank records  it'll actually show something from there  so you know that  on May  th  that I bought    .   in fuel from Safeway Vallejo. So not only that I'm giving this information here and there  but now there's a third party  an independent third party  my bank  that's verifying that  yes indeed  I was there at this time. So there's points  and these points are actually being cross referenced. And there's a verification taking place. Sometimes they're really small purchases. So    cents foreign transaction fee. All of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts  and everything pops up right away. Sometimes there's a lot of information. This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was. And then sometimes you get this. Sometimes you just get this  just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City  January   nd. And I can tell you exactly who I was with  where I was  because this is what I had to do with the FBI. I had to tell them every little detail of everything. I spend a lot of time on the road. This is a parking lot in Elko  Nevada off of Route    at      p.m. on August   th. I spend a lot of time in gas stations too    empty train stations. So there's multiple databases. And there's thousands and thousands and thousands of images. There's actually        images right now on my site  and the FBI has seen all of them    at least I trust they've seen all of them. And then sometimes you don't get much information at all  you just get this empty bed. And sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information. So you get something like this. This  by the way  is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California    Vietnamese sandwich. So there's different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations  empty gas stations. These are some of the meals that I've been cooking at home. So how do you know these are meals eaten at home  Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times. So again  you have to do some detective work here. So sometimes the databases get so specific. These are all tacos eaten in Mexico City near a train station on July fifth to July sixth. At       a.m. was this one. At      p.m. was this one. At      p.m. was this one. So I time stamp my life every few moments. Every few moments I shoot the image. Now it's all done on my iPhone  and it all goes straight up to my server  and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together. They need to know where I'm doing my business  because they want to know about my business. So on December  th  I went here. And on Sunday  June   th at         this was actually about two o'clock in the afternoon in Skowhegan  Maine    this was my apartment there. So what you're basically seeing here is all bits and pieces and all this information. If you go to my site  there's tons of things. And really  it's not the most user friendly interface. It's actually quite user unfriendly. And one of the reasons  also being part of the user unfriendliness  is that everything is there  but you have to really work through it. So by me putting all this information out there  what I'm basically telling you is I'm telling you everything. But in this barrage of noise that I'm putting out  I actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life. And you know very little about me actually. And really so I've come to the conclusion that the way you protect your privacy  particularly in an era where everything is cataloged and everything is archived and everything is recorded  there's no need to delete information anymore. So what do you do when everything is out there  Well you have to take control over it. And if I give you this information directly  it's a very different type of identity than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces. The other thing that's also interesting that's going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies    and it doesn't matter who they are    they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information  or restricted access to information. And the reason their information has any value is  well  because no one else has access to it. And by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you  the information that the FBI has has no value  so thus devaluing their currency. And I understand that  on an individual level  it's purely symbolic. But if     million people in the U.S. started doing this  we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up. Because it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything. And we're getting to that. When I first started this project  people were looking at me and saying   Why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing  where you're at  Why are you posting these photos   This was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere and     million people were posting status messages or poking people. So in a way  I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete. I'm still doing this project  but it is obsolete  because you're all doing it. This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis  whether we're aware of it or not. So we're creating our own archives and so on. And you know  some of my friends have always said   Hey  you're just paranoid. Why are you doing this  Because no one's really watching. No one's really going to bother you.  So one of the things that I do is I actually look through my server logs very carefully. Because it's about surveillance. I'm watching who's watching me. And I came up with these. So these are some of my sample logs. And just little bits and pieces  and you can see some of the things there. And I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see. So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by    Department of Homeland Security. You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by. I actually moved very close to them. I live right down the street from them now. Central Intelligence Agency. Executive Office of the President. Not really sure why they show up  but they do. I think they kind of like to look at art. And I'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields. So thank you very much. I appreciate it. Bruno Giussani  Hasan  just curious. You said   Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone   but actually you do take the pictures and put on information. So how many hours of the day does that take  HE  Almost none. It's no different than sending a text. It's no different than checking an email. It's one of those things  we got by just fine before we had to do any of those. So it's just become another day. I mean  when we update a status message  we don't really think about how long that's going to take. So it's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks  send  and then it's done. And everything's automated at the other end. BG  On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage  the FBI gets crazy  HE  Well it goes to the last point that I was at. So it holds onto the very last point. So if I'm on a    hour flight  you'll see the last airport that I departed from. BG  Hasan  thank you very much.  HE  Thank you.  The night before I was heading for Scotland  I was invited to host the final of  China's Got Talent  show in Shanghai with the        live audience in the stadium. Guess who was the performing guest  Susan Boyle. And I told her   I'm going to Scotland the next day.  She sang beautifully  and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese      So it's not like  hello  or  thank you   that ordinary stuff. It means  green onion for free.  Why did she say that  Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle    a    some year old woman  a vegetable vendor in Shanghai  who loves singing Western opera  but she didn't understand any English or French or Italian  so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese. And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma that she was singing in the stadium was  green onion for free.  So  as  Susan Boyle was saying that         live audience sang together. That was hilarious. So I guess both Susan Boyle and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai belonged to otherness. They were the least expected to be successful in the business called entertainment  yet their courage and talent brought them through. And a show and a platform gave them the stage to realize their dreams. Well  being different is not that difficult. We are all different from different perspectives. But I think being different is good  because you present a different point of view. You may have the chance to make a difference. My generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of China that has made so many changes in the past        years. I remember that in the year of       when I was graduating from college  I was applying for a job in the sales department of the first five star hotel in Beijing  Great Wall Sheraton    it's still there. So after being interrogated by this Japanese manager for a half an hour  he finally said   So  Miss Yang  do you have any questions to ask me   I summoned my courage and poise and said   Yes  but could you let me know  what actually do you sell   I didn't have a clue what a sales department was about in a five star hotel. That was the first day I set my foot in a five star hotel. Around the same time  I was going through an audition    the first ever open audition by national television in China    with another thousand college girls. The producer told us they were looking for some sweet  innocent and beautiful fresh face. So when it was my turn  I stood up and said   Why  do  women's personalities on television always have to be beautiful  sweet  innocent and  you know  supportive  Why can't they have their own ideas and their own voice   I thought I kind of offended them. But actually  they were impressed by my words. And so I was in the second round of competition  and then the third and the fourth. After seven rounds of competition  I was the last one to survive it. So I was on a national television prime time show. And believe it or not  that was the first show on Chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own minds without reading an approved script. And my weekly audience at that time was between     to     million people. Well after a few years  I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University to pursue my postgraduate studies  and then started my own media company  which was unthought of during the years that I started my career. So we do a lot of things. I've interviewed more than a thousand people in the past. And sometimes I have young people approaching me say   Lan  you changed my life   and I feel proud of that. But then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country. I was in Beijing's bidding for the Olympic Games. I was representing the Shanghai Expo. I saw China embracing the world and vice versa. But then sometimes I'm thinking  what are today's young generation up to  How are they different  and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China  or at large  the world  So today I want to talk about young people through the platform of social media. First of all  who are they   What  do they look like  Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei       years old  beautiful. She showed off her expensive bags  clothes and car on her microblog  which is the Chinese version of Twitter. And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross at the Chamber of Commerce. She didn't realize that she stepped on a sensitive nerve and aroused national questioning  almost a turmoil  against the credibility of Red Cross. The controversy was so heated that the Red Cross had to open a press conference to clarify it  and the investigation is going on. So far  as of today  we know that she herself made up that title    probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity. All those expensive items were given to her as gifts by her boyfriend  who used to be a board member in a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce. It's very complicated to explain. But anyway  the public still doesn't buy it. It is still boiling. It shows us a general mistrust of government or government backed institutions  which lacked transparency in the past. And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog. Microblog boomed in the year of       with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled. Sina.com  a major news portal  alone has more than     million microbloggers. On Tencent      million. The most popular blogger    it's not me    it's a movie star  and she has more than  .  million followers  or fans. About    percent of those microbloggers are young people  under    years old. And because  as you know  the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government  social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit. But because you don't have many other openings  the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong  active and even violent. So through microblogging  we are able to understand Chinese youth even better. So how are they different  First of all  most of them were born in the   s and   s  under the one child policy. And because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls  now we have ended up with    million more young men than women. That could pose a potential danger to the society  but who knows  we're in a globalized world  so they can look for girlfriends from other countries. Most of them have fairly good education. The illiteracy rate in China among this generation is under one percent. In cities     percent of kids go to college. But they are facing an aging China with a population above    years old coming up with seven point some percent this year  and about to be    percent by the year of     . And you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially  and taking care of them when they're sick. So it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of    years old. So making a living is not that easy for young people. College graduates are not in short supply. In urban areas  college graduates find the starting salary is about     U.S. dollars a month  while the average rent is above     . So what do they do  They have to share space    squeezed in very limited space to save money    and they call themselves  tribe of ants.  And for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment  they figured out they have to work for    to    years to afford their first apartment. That ratio in America would only cost a couple five years to earn  but in China it's    to    years with the skyrocketing real estate price. Among the     million migrant workers     percent of them are young people. They find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas. Most of them don't want to go back to the countryside  but they don't have the sense of belonging. They work for longer hours with less income  less social welfare. And they're more vulnerable to job losses  subject to inflation  tightening loans from banks  appreciation of the renminbi  or decline of demand from Europe or America for the products they produce. Last year  though  an appalling incident in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China     young workers in their late teens and early   s committed suicide  just one by one like causing a contagious disease. But they died because of all different personal reasons. But this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society about the isolation  both physical and mental  of these migrant workers. For those who do return back to the countryside  they find themselves very welcome locally  because with the knowledge  skills and networks they have learned in the cities  with the assistance of the Internet  they're able to create more jobs  upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market. So for the past few years  the coastal areas  they found themselves in a shortage of labor. These diagrams show a more general social background. The first one is the Engels coefficient  which explains that the cost of daily necessities has dropped its percentage all through the past decade  in terms of family income  to about    some percent. But then in the last two years  it goes up again to    percent  indicating a rising living cost. The Gini coefficient has already passed the dangerous line of  . . Now it's  .     even worse than that in America    showing us the income inequality. And so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility. And also  the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread. So any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest. So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging  we can see what young people care most about. Social justice and government accountability runs the first in what they demand. For the past decade or so  a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property. And it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation. Sometimes people get killed  and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest. So when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the Internet  people cry for the government to take actions to stop this. So the good news is that earlier this year  the state council passed a new regulation on house requisition and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court. Similarly  many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the Internet. We heard about polluted air  polluted water  poisoned food. And guess what  we have faked beef. They have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish  and it turns it to look like beef. And then lately  people are very concerned about cooking oil  because thousands of people have been found  refining  cooking oil from restaurant slop. So all these things have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet. And fortunately  we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns. While young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy making  but sometimes they're a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life. China is soon to pass the U.S. as the number one market for luxury brands    that's not including the Chinese expenditures in Europe and elsewhere. But you know what  half of those consumers are earning a salary below       U.S. dollars. They're not rich at all. They're taking those bags and clothes as a sense of identity and social status. And this is a girl explicitly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle. But of course  we do have young people who would still prefer to smile  whether in a BMW or  on  a bicycle. So in the next picture  you see a very popular phenomenon called  naked  wedding  or  naked  marriage. It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding  but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house  without a car  without a diamond ring and without a wedding banquet  to show their commitment to true love. And also  people are doing good through social media. And the first picture showed us that a truck caging     homeless and kidnapped dogs for food processing was spotted and stopped on the highway with the whole country watching through microblogging. People were donating money  dog food and offering volunteer work to stop that truck. And after hours of negotiation      dogs were rescued. And here also people are helping to find missing children. A father posted his son's picture onto the Internet. After thousands of resends in relay  the child was found  and we witnessed the reunion of the family through microblogging. So happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years. Happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values  but also  it's about the environment. People are thinking about the following questions  Are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP  How are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth  to keep sustainability and stability  And also  how capable is the system of self correctness to keep more people content with all sorts of friction going on at the same time  I guess these are the questions people are going to answer. And our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves. Thank you very much. So I have a strange career. I know it because people come up to me  like colleagues  and say   Chris  you have a strange career.  And I can see their point  because I started my career as a theoretical nuclear physicist. And I was thinking about quarks and gluons and heavy ion collisions  and I was only    years old. No  no  I wasn't    years old. But after that  I actually had my own lab in the computational neuroscience department  and I wasn't doing any neuroscience. Later  I would work on evolutionary genetics  and I would work on systems biology. But I'm going to tell you about something else today. I'm going to tell you about how I learned something about life. And I was actually a rocket scientist. I wasn't really a rocket scientist  but I was working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in sunny California where it's warm  whereas now I'm in the mid West  and it's cold. But it was an exciting experience. One day a NASA manager comes into my office  sits down and says   Can you please tell us  how do we look for life outside Earth   And that came as a surprise to me  because I was actually hired to work on quantum computation. Yet  I had a very good answer. I said   I have no idea.  And he told me   Biosignatures  we need to look for a biosignature.  And I said   What is that   And he said   It's any measurable phenomenon that allows us to indicate the presence of life.  And I said   Really  Because isn't that easy  I mean  we have life. Can't you apply a definition  like for example  a Supreme Court like definition of life   And then I thought about it a little bit  and I said   Well  is it really that easy  Because  yes  if you see something like this  then all right  fine  I'm going to call it life    no doubt about it. But here's something.  And he goes   Right  that's life too. I know that.  Except  if you think life is also defined by things that die  you're not in luck with this thing  because that's actually a very strange organism. It grows up into the adult stage like that and then goes through a Benjamin Button phase  and actually goes backwards and backwards until it's like a little embryo again  and then actually grows back up  and back down and back up    sort of yo yo    and it never dies. So it's actually life  but it's actually not as we thought life would be. And then you see something like that. And he was like   My God  what kind of a life form is that   Anyone know  It's actually not life  it's a crystal. So once you start looking and looking at smaller and smaller things    so this particular person wrote a whole article and said   Hey  these are bacteria.  Except  if you look a little bit closer  you see  in fact  that this thing is way too small to be anything like that. So he was convinced  but  in fact  most people aren't. And then  of course  NASA also had a big announcement  and President Clinton gave a press conference  about this amazing discovery of life in a Martian meteorite. Except that nowadays  it's heavily disputed. If you take the lesson of all these pictures  then you realize  well actually maybe it's not that easy. Maybe I do need a definition of life in order to make that kind of distinction. So can life be defined  Well how would you go about it  Well of course  you'd go to Encyclopedia Britannica and open at L. No  of course you don't do that  you put it somewhere in Google. And then you might get something. And what you might get    and anything that actually refers to things that we are used to  you throw away. And then you might come up with something like this. And it says something complicated with lots and lots of concepts. Who on Earth would write something as convoluted and complex and inane  Oh  it's actually a really  really  important set of concepts. So I'm highlighting just a few words and saying definitions like that rely on things that are not based on amino acids or leaves or anything that we are used to  but in fact on processes only. And if you take a look at that  this was actually in a book that I wrote that deals with artificial life. And that explains why that NASA manager was actually in my office to begin with. Because the idea was that  with concepts like that  maybe we can actually manufacture a form of life. And so if you go and ask yourself   What on Earth is artificial life    let me give you a whirlwind tour of how all this stuff came about. And it started out quite a while ago when someone wrote one of the first successful computer viruses. And for those of you who aren't old enough  you have no idea how this infection was working    namely  through these floppy disks. But the interesting thing about these computer virus infections was that  if you look at the rate at which the infection worked  they show this spiky behavior that you're used to from a flu virus. And it is in fact due to this arms race between hackers and operating system designers that things go back and forth. And the result is kind of a tree of life of these viruses  a phylogeny that looks very much like the type of life that we're used to  at least on the viral level. So is that life  Not as far as I'm concerned. Why  Because these things don't evolve by themselves. In fact  they have hackers writing them. But the idea was taken very quickly a little bit further when a scientist working at the Scientific Institute decided   Why don't we try to package these little viruses in artificial worlds inside of the computer and let them evolve   And this was Steen Rasmussen. And he designed this system  but it really didn't work  because his viruses were constantly destroying each other. But there was another scientist who had been watching this  an ecologist. And he went home and says   I know how to fix this.  And he wrote the Tierra system  and  in my book  is in fact one of the first truly artificial living systems    except for the fact that these programs didn't really grow in complexity. So having seen this work  worked a little bit on this  this is where I came in. And I decided to create a system that has all the properties that are necessary to see the evolution of complexity  more and more complex problems constantly evolving. And of course  since I really don't know how to write code  I had help in this. I had two undergraduate students at California Institute of Technology that worked with me. That's Charles Offria on the left  Titus Brown on the right. They are now actually respectable professors at Michigan State University  but I can assure you  back in the day  we were not a respectable team. And I'm really happy that no photo survives of the three of us anywhere close together. But what is this system like  Well I can't really go into the details  but what you see here is some of the entrails. But what I wanted to focus on is this type of population structure. There's about        programs sitting here. And all different strains are colored in different colors. And as you see here  there are groups that are growing on top of each other  because they are spreading. Any time there is a program that's better at surviving in this world  due to whatever mutation it has acquired  it is going to spread over the others and drive the others to extinction. So I'm going to show you a movie where you're going to see that kind of dynamic. And these kinds of experiments are started with programs that we wrote ourselves. We write our own stuff  replicate it  and are very proud of ourselves. And we put them in  and what you see immediately is that there are waves and waves of innovation. By the way  this is highly accelerated  so it's like a thousand generations a second. But immediately the system goes like   What kind of dumb piece of code was this  This can be improved upon in so many ways so quickly.  So you see waves of new types taking over the other types. And this type of activity goes on for quite awhile  until the main easy things have been acquired by these programs. And then you see sort of like a stasis coming on where the system essentially waits for a new type of innovation  like this one  which is going to spread over all the other innovations that were before and is erasing the genes that it had before  until a new type of higher level of complexity has been achieved. And this process goes on and on and on. So what we see here is a system that lives in very much the way we're used to life  going.  But what the NASA people had asked me really was   Do these guys have a biosignature  Can we measure this type of life  Because if we can  maybe we have a chance of actually discovering life somewhere else without being biased by things like amino acids.  So I said   Well  perhaps we should construct a biosignature based on life as a universal process. In fact  it should perhaps make use of the concepts that I developed just in order to sort of capture what a simple living system might be.  And the thing I came up with    I have to first give you an introduction about the idea  and maybe that would be a meaning detector  rather than a life detector. And the way we would do that    I would like to find out how I can distinguish text that was written by a million monkeys  as opposed to text that  is  in our books. And I would like to do it in such a way that I don't actually have to be able to read the language  because I'm sure I won't be able to. As long as I know that there's some sort of alphabet. So here would be a frequency plot of how often you find each of the    letters of the alphabet in a text written by random monkeys. And obviously each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent. But if you now look at the same distribution in English texts  it looks like that. And I'm telling you  this is very robust across English texts. And if I look at French texts  it looks a little bit different  or Italian or German. They all have their own type of frequency distribution  but it's robust. It doesn't matter whether it writes about politics or about science. It doesn't matter whether it's a poem or whether it's a mathematical text. It's a robust signature  and it's very stable. As long as our books are written in English    because people are rewriting them and recopying them    it's going to be there. So that inspired me to think about  well  what if I try to use this idea in order  not to detect random texts from texts with meaning  but rather detect the fact that there is meaning in the biomolecules that make up life. But first I have to ask  what are these building blocks  like the alphabet  elements that I showed you  Well it turns out  we have many different alternatives for such a set of building blocks. We could use amino acids  we could use nucleic acids  carboxylic acids  fatty acids. In fact  chemistry's extremely rich  and our body uses a lot of them. So that we actually  to test this idea  first took a look at amino acids and some other carboxylic acids. And here's the result. Here is  in fact  what you get if you  for example  look at the distribution of amino acids on a comet or in interstellar space or  in fact  in a laboratory  where you made very sure that in your primordial soup that there is not living stuff in there. What you find is mostly glycine and then alanine and there's some trace elements of the other ones. That is also very robust    what you find in systems like Earth where there are amino acids  but there is no life. But suppose you take some dirt and dig through it and then put it into these spectrometers  because there's bacteria all over the place  or you take water anywhere on Earth  because it's teaming with life  and you make the same analysis  the spectrum looks completely different. Of course  there is still glycine and alanine  but in fact  there are these heavy elements  these heavy amino acids  that are being produced because these are valuable to the organism. And some other ones that are not used in the set of     they will not appear at all in any type of concentration. So this also turns out to be extremely robust. It doesn't matter what kind of sediment you're using to grind up  whether it's bacteria or any other plants or animals. Anywhere there's life  you're going to have this distribution  as opposed to that distribution. And it is detectable not just in amino acids. Now you could ask  well  what about these Avidians  The Avidians being the denizens of this computer world where they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity. So this is the distribution that you get if  in fact  there is no life. They have about    of these instructions. And if you have a system where they're being replaced one by the other  it's like the monkeys writing on a typewriter. Each of these instructions appears with roughly the equal frequency. But if you now take a set of replicating guys like in the video that you saw  it looks like this. So there are some instructions that are extremely valuable to these organisms  and their frequency is going to be high. And there's actually some instructions that you only use once  if ever. So they are either poisonous or really should be used at less of a level than random. In this case  the frequency is lower. And so now we can see  is that really a robust signature  I can tell you indeed it is  because this type of spectrum  just like what you've seen in books  and just like what you've seen in amino acids  it doesn't really matter how you change the environment  it's very robust  it's going to reflect the environment. So I'm going to show you now a little experiment that we did. And I have to explain to you  the top of this graph shows you that frequency distribution that I talked about. Here  in fact  that's the lifeless environment where each instruction occurs at an equal frequency. And below there  I show  in fact  the mutation rate in the environment. And I'm starting this at a mutation rate that is so high that  even if you would drop a replicating program that would otherwise happily grow up to fill the entire world  if you drop it in  it gets mutated to death immediately. So there is no life possible at that type of mutation rate. But then I'm going to slowly turn down the heat  so to speak  and then there's this viability threshold where now it would be possible for a replicator to actually live. And indeed  we're going to be dropping these guys into that soup all the time. So let's see what that looks like. So first  nothing  nothing  nothing. Too hot  too hot. Now the viability threshold is reached  and the frequency distribution has dramatically changed and  in fact  stabilizes. And now what I did there is  I was being nasty  I just turned up the heat again and again. And of course  it reaches the viability threshold. And I'm just showing this to you again because it's so nice. You hit the viability threshold. The distribution changes to  alive   And then  once you hit the threshold where the mutation rate is so high that you cannot self reproduce  you cannot copy the information forward to your offspring without making so many mistakes that your ability to replicate vanishes. And then that signature is lost. What do we learn from that  Well  I think we learn a number of things from that. One of them is  if we are able to think about life in abstract terms    and we're not talking about things like plants  and we're not talking about amino acids  and we're not talking about bacteria  but we think in terms of processes    then we could start to think about life  not as something that is so special to Earth  but that  in fact  could exist anywhere. Because it really only has to do with these concepts of information  of storing information within physical substrates    anything  bits  nucleic acids  anything that's an alphabet    and make sure that there's some process so that this information can be stored for much longer than you would expect the time scales for the deterioration of information. And if you can do that  then you have life. So the first thing that we learn is that it is possible to define life in terms of processes alone  without referring at all to the type of things that we hold dear  as far as the type of life on Earth is. And that in a sense removes us again  like all of our scientific discoveries  or many of them    it's this continuous dethroning of man    of how we think we're special because we're alive. Well we can make life. We can make life in the computer. Granted  it's limited  but we have learned what it takes in order to actually construct it. And once we have that  then it is not such a difficult task anymore to say  if we understand the fundamental processes that do not refer to any particular substrate  then we can go out and try other worlds  figure out what kind of chemical alphabets might there be  figure enough about the normal chemistry  the geochemistry of the planet  so that we know what this distribution would look like in the absence of life  and then look for large deviations from this    this thing sticking out  which says   This chemical really shouldn't be there.  Now we don't know that there's life then  but we could say   Well at least I'm going to have to take a look very precisely at this chemical and see where it comes from.  And that might be our chance of actually discovering life when we cannot visibly see it. And so that's really the only take home message that I have for you. Life can be less mysterious than we make it out to be when we try to think about how it would be on other planets. And if we remove the mystery of life  then I think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live  and how perhaps we're not as special as we always think we are. And I'm going to leave you with that. And thank you very much. What's in the box  Whatever it is must be pretty important  because I've traveled with it  moved it  from apartment to apartment to apartment. Sound familiar  Did you know that we Americans have about three times the amount of space we did    years ago  Three times. So you'd think  with all this extra space  we'd have plenty of room for all our stuff. Nope. There's a new industry in town  a    billion dollar   .  billion sq. ft. industry  that of personal storage. So we've got triple the space  but we've become such good shoppers that we need even more space. So where does this lead  Lots of credit card debt  huge environmental footprints  and perhaps not coincidentally  our happiness levels flat lined over the same    years. Well I'm here to suggest there's a better way  that less might actually equal more. I bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less  college    in your dorm  traveling    in a hotel room  camping    rig up basically nothing  maybe a boat. Whatever it was for you  I bet that  among other things  this gave you a little more freedom  a little more time. So I'm going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint. It's actually a great way to save you some money. And it's going to give you a little more ease in your life. So I started a project called Life Edited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area. First up  crowd sourcing my     sq. ft. apartment in Manhattan with partners Mutopo and Jovoto.com. I wanted it all    home office  sit down dinner for     room for guests  and all my kite surfing gear. With over     entries from around the world  I got it  my own little jewel box. By buying a space that was     sq. ft. instead of      immediately I'm saving     grand. Smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities    save some more money there  but also a smaller footprint. And because it's really designed around an edited set of possessions    my favorite stuff    and really designed for me  I'm really excited to be there. So how can you live little  Three main approaches. First of all  you have to edit ruthlessly. We've got to clear the arteries of our lives. And that shirt that I hadn't worn in years  It's time for me to let it go. We've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives  and we've got to learn to stem the inflow. We need to think before we buy. Ask ourselves   Is that really going to make me happier  Truly   By all means  we should buy and own some great stuff. But we want stuff that we're going to love for years  not just stuff. Secondly  our new mantra  small is sexy. We want space efficiency. We want things that are designed for how they're used the vast majority of the time  not that rare event. Why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three  So we want things that nest  we want things that stack  and we want it digitized. You can take paperwork  books  movies  and you can make it disappear    it's magic. Finally  we want multifunctional spaces and housewares    a sink combined with a toilet  a dining table becomes a bed    same space  a little side table stretches out to seat   . In the winning Life Edited scheme in a render here  we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space. Look at the coffee table    it grows in height and width to seat   . My office folds away  easily hidden. My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers. Guests  Move the moving wall  have some fold down guest beds. And of course  my own movie theater. So I'm not saying that we all need to live in     sq. ft. But consider the benefits of an edited life. Go from       to        from       to      . Most of us  maybe all of us  are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with a couple of bags  maybe a small space  a hotel room. So when you go home and you walk through your front door  take a second and ask yourselves   Could I do with a little life editing  Would that give me a little more freedom  Maybe a little more time   What's in the box  It doesn't really matter. I know I don't need it. What's in yours  Maybe  just maybe  less might equal more. So let's make room for the good stuff. Thank you. I'm a garbage man. And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man  because I absolutely hate waste. I hope  within the next    minutes  to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life. And I'd like to start at the very beginning. Think back when you were just a kid. How did look at the stuff in your life  Perhaps it was like these toddler rules  It's my stuff if I saw it first. The entire pile is my stuff if I'm building something. The more stuff that's mine  the better. And of course  it's your stuff if it's broken. Well after spending about    years in the recycling industry  it's become pretty clear to me that we don't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults. And let me tell you why I have that perspective. Because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people's discarded stuff. Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff  but it's a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world    well less than one percent. In fact  the United Nations estimates that there's about    billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year    and that's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream. And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth  that number well more than doubles. And of course  the more developed the country  the bigger these mountains. Now when you see these mountains  most people think of garbage. We see above ground mines. And the reason we see mines is because there's a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place. And it's becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams. Because as we've heard all week at TED  the world's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff. And of course  they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted. And what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day  It's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals. And the metals  we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world. And the plastics  we get from oil  which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract. And these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we're already starting to see today. The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end of life stuff and starting to recycle our end of life stuff  particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner. Most of what's extracted from our end of life stuff  if it makes it to a recycler  are the metals. To put that in perspective    and I'm using steel as a proxy here for metals  because it's the most common metal    if your stuff makes it to a recycler  probably over    percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose. Plastics are a whole other story  well less than    percent are recovered. In fact  it's more like five percent. Most of it's incinerated or landfilled. Now most people think that's because plastics are a throw away material  have very little value. But actually  plastics are several times more valuable than steel. And there's more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel. So why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material  Well it's predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another. They have very different densities. They have different electrical and magnetic properties. And they even have different colors. So it's very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials. Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range. They have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties. And any plastic can be any color  as you probably well know. So the traditional ways of separating materials just simply don't work for plastics. Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world    and sadly to say  particularly from the United States  where we don't have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe    finds its way to developing countries for low cost recycling. People  for as little as a dollar a day  pick through our stuff. They extract what they can  which is mostly the metals    circuit boards and so forth    and they leave behind mostly what they can't recover  which is  again  mostly the plastics. Or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here. And they extract the metals by hand. Now while this may be the low economic cost solution  this is certainly not the low environmental or human health and safety solution. I call this environmental arbitrage. And it's not fair  it's not safe and it's not sustainable. Now because the plastics are so plentiful    and by the way  those other methods don't lead to the recovery of plastics  obviously    but people do try to recover the plastics. This is just one example. This is a photo I took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai  India. They store the plastics on the roofs. They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these  and people try very hard to separate the plastics  by color  by shape  by feel  by any technique they can. And sometimes they'll resort to what's known as the  burn and sniff  technique where they'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes to try to determine the type of plastic. None of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way. And by the way  please don't try this technique at home. So what are we to do about this space age material  at least what we used to call a space aged material  these plastics  Well I certainly believe that it's far too valuable and far too abundant to keep putting back in the ground or certainly send up in smoke. So about    years ago  I literally started in my garage tinkering around  trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other  and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends  in the mining world actually  and in the plastics world  and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world. Because after all  we're doing above ground mining. And we eventually broke the code. This is the last frontier of recycling. It's the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth. And we finally figured out how to do it. And in the process  we started recreating how the plastics industry makes plastics. The traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals. You breakdown the molecules  you recombine them in very specific ways  to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day. We said  there's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics. And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint  sustainable from an economic standpoint as well. Well a good place to start is with waste. It certainly doesn't cost as much as oil  and it's plentiful  as I hope that you've been able to see from the photographs. And because we're not breaking down the plastic into molecules and recombining them  we're using a mining approach to extract the materials. We have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment. We have enormous energy savings. I don't know how many other projects on the planet right now can save    to    percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way. And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life  our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them. And we make a drop in replacement for that plastic that's made from petrochemicals. Our customers get to enjoy huge CO  savings. They get to close the loop with their products. And they get to make more sustainable products. In the short time period I have  I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this. It starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits. They recover the metals and leave behind what's called shredder residue    it's their waste    a very complex mixture of materials  but predominantly plastics. We take out the things that aren't plastics  such as the metals they missed  carpeting  foam  rubber  wood  glass  paper  you name it. Even an occasional dead animal  unfortunately. And it goes in the first part of our process here  which is more like traditional recycling. We're sieving the material  we're using magnets  we're using air classification. It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point. At the end of this process  we have a mixed plastic composite  many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics. This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process  and the really hard work  multi step separation process begins. We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail. We use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics  not only by type  but by grade. And out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic  one type  one grade. We then use optical sorting to color sort this material. We blend it in        lb. blending silos. We push that material to extruders where we melt it  push it through small die holes  make spaghetti like plastic strands. And we chop those strands into what are called pellets. And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry. This is the same material that you would get from oil. And today  we're producing it from your old stuff  and it's going right back into your new stuff. So now  instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke  you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products  in your office  or back at work in your home. And these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic  replacing virgin plastic  to make their new products. So I hope I've changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life. We took our clues from mother nature. Mother nature wastes very little  reuses practically everything. And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer    that's a label I've always hated my entire life    and think of yourself as just using resources in one form  until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time. And finally  I hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to   If it's broken  it's my stuff.  Thank you for your time. I am a conductor  and I'm here today to talk to you about trust. My job depends upon it. There has to be  between me and the orchestra  an unshakable bond of trust  born out of mutual respect  through which we can spin a musical narrative that we all believe in. Now in the old days  conducting  music making  was less about trust and more  frankly  about coercion. Up to and around about the Second World War  conductors were invariably dictators    these tyrannical figures who would rehearse  not just the orchestra as a whole  but individuals within it  within an inch of their lives. But I'm happy to say now that the world has moved on  music has moved on with it. We now have a more democratic view and way of making music    a two way street. I  as the conductor  have to come to the rehearsal with a cast iron sense of the outer architecture of that music  within which there is then immense personal freedom for the members of the orchestra to shine. For myself  of course  I have to completely trust my body language. That's all I have at the point of sale. It's silent gesture. I can hardly bark out instructions while we're playing. Ladies and gentlemen  the Scottish Ensemble. So in order for all this to work  obviously I have got to be in a position of trust. I have to trust the orchestra  and  even more crucially  I have to trust myself. Think about it  when you're in a position of not trusting  what do you do  You overcompensate. And in my game  that means you overgesticulate. You end up like some kind of rabid windmill. And the bigger your gesture gets  the more ill defined  blurry and  frankly  useless it is to the orchestra. You become a figure of fun. There's no trust anymore  only ridicule. And I remember at the beginning of my career  again and again  on these dismal outings with orchestras  I would be going completely insane on the podium  trying to engender a small scale crescendo really  just a little upsurge in volume. Bugger me  they wouldn't give it to me. I spent a lot of time in those early years weeping silently in dressing rooms. And how futile seemed the words of advice to me from great British veteran conductor Sir Colin Davis who said   Conducting  Charles  is like holding a small bird in your hand. If you hold it too tightly  you crush it. If you hold it too loosely  it flies away.  I have to say  in those days  I couldn't really even find the bird. Now a fundamental and really viscerally important experience for me  in terms of music  has been my adventures in South Africa  the most dizzyingly musical country on the planet in my view  but a country which  through its musical culture  has taught me one fundamental lesson  that through music making can come deep levels of fundamental life giving trust. Back in       I had the opportunity to go to South Africa to form a new opera company. So I went out there  and I auditioned  mainly in rural township locations  right around the country. I heard about       singers and pulled together a company of    of the most jaw droppingly amazing young performers  the majority of whom were black  but there were a handful of white performers. Now it emerged early on in the first rehearsal period that one of those white performers had  in his previous incarnation  been a member of the South African police force. And in the last years of the old regime  he would routinely be detailed to go into the township to aggress the community. Now you can imagine what this knowledge did to the temperature in the room  the general atmosphere. Let's be under no illusions. In South Africa  the relationship most devoid of trust is that between a white policeman and the black community. So how do we recover from that  ladies and gentlemen  Simply through singing. We sang  we sang  we sang  and amazingly new trust grew  and indeed friendship blossomed. And that showed me such a fundamental truth  that music making and other forms of creativity can so often go to places where mere words cannot. So we got some shows off the ground. We started touring them internationally. One of them was  Carmen.  We then thought we'd make a movie of  Carmen   which we recorded and shot outside on location in the township outside Cape Town called Khayelitsha. The piece was sung entirely in Xhosa  which is a beautifully musical language  if you don't know it. It's called  U Carmen e Khayelitsha     literally  Carmen of Khayelitsha.  I want to play you a tiny clip of it now for no other reason than to give you proof positive that there is nothing tiny about South African music making. Something which I find utterly enchanting about South African music making is that it's so free. South Africans just make music really freely. And I think  in no small way  that's due to one fundamental fact  they're not bound to a system of notation. They don't read music. They trust their ears. You can teach a bunch of South Africans a tune in about five seconds flat. And then  as if by magic  they will spontaneously improvise a load of harmony around that tune because they can. Now those of us that live in the West  if I can use that term  I think have a much more hidebound attitude or sense of music    that somehow it's all about skill and systems. Therefore it's the exclusive preserve of an elite  talented body. And yet  ladies and gentlemen  every single one of us on this planet probably engages with music on a daily basis. And if I can broaden this out for a second  I'm willing to bet that every single one of you sitting in this room would be happy to speak with acuity  with total confidence  about movies  probably about literature. But how many of you would be able to make a confident assertion about a piece of classical music  Why is this  And what I'm going to say to you now is I'm just urging you to get over this supreme lack of self confidence  to take the plunge  to believe that you can trust your ears  you can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue  fiber  DNA  what makes a great piece of music great. I've got a little experiment I want to try with you. Did you know that TED is a tune  A very simple tune based on three notes    T  E  D. Now hang on a minute. I know you're going to say to me   T doesn't exist in music.  Well ladies and gentlemen  there's a time honored system  which composers have been using for hundreds of years  which proves actually that it does. If I sing you a musical scale  A  B  C  D  E  F  G    and I just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet  same scale  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T    there you go. T  see it's the same as F in music. So T is F. So T  E  D is the same as F  E  D. Now that piece of music that we played at the start of this session had enshrined in its heart the theme  which is TED. Have a listen. Do you hear it  Or do I smell some doubt in the room  Okay  we'll play it for you again now  and we're going to highlight  we're going to poke out the T  E  D. If you'll pardon the expression. Oh my goodness me  there it was loud and clear  surely. I think we should make this even more explicit. Ladies and gentlemen  it's nearly time for tea. Would you reckon you need to sing for your tea  I think  I think we need to sing for our tea. We're going to sing those three wonderful notes  T  E  D. Will you have a go for me  Audience  T  E  D. Charles Hazlewood  Yeah  you sound a bit more like cows really than human beings. Shall we try that one again  And look  if you're adventurous  you go up the octave. T  E  D. Audience  T  E  D. CH  Once more with vim.  Audience  T  E  D.  There I am like a bloody windmill again  you see. Now we're going to put that in the context of the music. The music will start  and then at a signal from me  you will sing that. One more time  with feeling  ladies and gentlemen. You won't make the key otherwise. Well done  ladies and gentlemen. It wasn't a bad debut for the TED choir  not a bad debut at all. Now there's a project that I'm initiating at the moment that I'm very excited about and wanted to share with you  because it is all about changing perceptions  and  indeed  building a new level of trust. The youngest of my children was born with cerebral palsy  which as you can imagine  if you don't have an experience of it yourself  is quite a big thing to take on board. But the gift that my gorgeous daughter has given me  aside from her very existence  is that it's opened my eyes to a whole stretch of the community that was hitherto hidden  the community of disabled people. And I found myself looking at the Paralympics and thinking how incredible how technology's been harnessed to prove beyond doubt that disability is no barrier to the highest levels of sporting achievement. Of course there's a grimmer side to that truth  which is that it's actually taken decades for the world at large to come to a position of trust  to really believe that disability and sports can go together in a convincing and interesting fashion. So I find myself asking  where is music in all of this  You can't tell me that there aren't millions of disabled people  in the U.K. alone  with massive musical potential. So I decided to create a platform for that potential. It's going to be Britain's first ever national disabled orchestra. It's called Paraorchestra. I'm going to show you a clip now of the very first improvisation session that we had. It was a really extraordinary moment. Just me and four astonishingly gifted disabled musicians. Normally when you improvise    and I do it all the time around the world    there's this initial period of horror  like everyone's too frightened to throw the hat into the ring  an awful pregnant silence. Then suddenly  as if by magic  bang  We're all in there and it's complete bedlam. You can't hear anything. No one's listening. No one's trusting. No one's responding to each other. Now in this room with these four disabled musicians  within five minutes a rapt listening  a rapt response and some really insanely beautiful music. Nicholas   My name's Nicholas McCarthy. I'm     and I'm a left handed pianist. And I was born without my left hand    right hand. Can I do that one again  Lyn  When I'm making music  I feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane. I become alive. Clarence  I would rather be able to play an instrument again than walk. There's so much joy and things I could get from playing an instrument and performing. It's removed some of my paralysis. CH  I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today  so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are. Paraorchestra is the name of that project. If any of you thinks you want to help me in any way to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point  please let me know. Now my parting shot comes courtesy of the great Joseph Haydn  wonderful Austrian composer in the second half of the   th century    spent the bulk of his life in the employ of Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy  along with his orchestra. Now this prince loved his music  but he also loved the country castle that he tended to reside in most of the time  which is just on the Austro Hungarian border  a place called Esterhazy    a long way from the big city of Vienna. Now one day in       the prince decreed that the musicians' families  the orchestral musicians' families  were no longer welcome in the castle. They weren't allowed to stay there anymore  they had to be returned to Vienna    as I say  an unfeasibly long way away in those days. You can imagine  the musicians were disconsolate. Haydn remonstrated with the prince  but to no avail. So given the prince loved his music  Haydn thought he'd write a symphony to make the point. And we're going to play just the very tail end of this symphony now. And you'll see the orchestra in a kind of sullen revolt. I'm pleased to say  the prince did take the tip from the orchestral performance  and the musicians were reunited with their families. But I think it sums up my talk rather well  this  that where there is trust  there is music    by extension life. Where there is no trust  the music quite simply withers away. What is going on in this baby's mind  If you'd asked people this    years ago  most people  including psychologists  would have said that this baby was irrational  illogical  egocentric    that he couldn't take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect. In the last    years  developmental science has completely overturned that picture. So in some ways  we think that this baby's thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists. Let me give you just one example of this. One thing that this baby could be thinking about  that could be going on in his mind  is trying to figure out what's going on in the mind of that other baby. After all  one of the things that's hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling. And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn't actually exactly like what we think and feel. Anyone who's followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get. We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people. Now the question is  How could we ask them  Babies  after all  can't talk  and if you ask a three year old to tell you what he thinks  what you'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that. So how do we actually ask them the question  Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli. What we did    Betty Rapacholi  who was one of my students  and I    was actually to give the babies two bowls of food  one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers. Now all of the babies  even in Berkley  like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli. But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl. And she would act as if she liked it or she didn't. So half the time  she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli    just like a baby and any other sane person. But half the time  what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go   Mmmmm  broccoli. I tasted the broccoli. Mmmmm.  And then she would take a little bit of the crackers  and she'd go   Eww  yuck  crackers. I tasted the crackers. Eww  yuck.  So she'd act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted. We did this with    and    month old babies. And then she would simply put her hand out and say   Can you give me some   So the question is  What would the baby give her  what they liked or what she liked  And the remarkable thing was that    month old babies  just barely walking and talking  would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers  but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli. On the other hand     month olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli  like they couldn't figure this out. But then after they stared for a long time  they would just give her the crackers  what they thought everybody must like. So there are two really remarkable things about this. The first one is that these little    month old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature  that we don't always want the same thing. And what's more  they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted. Even more remarkably though  the fact that    month olds didn't do this suggests that these    month olds had learned this deep  profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were    months old. So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought. And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last    years that's actually demonstrated it. The question you might ask though is  Why do children learn so much  And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time  I mean  after all  if you look at babies superficially  they seem pretty useless. And actually in many ways  they're worse than useless  because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive. But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies  it turns out that there's actually an answer. If we look across many  many different species of animals  not just us primates  but also including other mammals  birds  even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats  it turns out that there's a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are. And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there. On one side is a New Caledonian crow. And crows and other corvidae  ravens  rooks and so forth  are incredibly smart birds. They're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects. And this is a bird on the cover of science who's learned how to use a tool to get food. On the other hand  we have our friend the domestic chicken. And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps. So they're very  very good at pecking for grain  and they're not much good at doing anything else. Well it turns out that the babies  the New Caledonian crow babies  are fledglings. They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years  which is a really long time in the life of a bird. Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months. So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of Science and the chickens end up in the soup pot. There's something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning. Well what kind of explanation could we have for this  Well some animals  like the chicken  seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well. So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment. Other creatures  like the crows  aren't very good at doing anything in particular  but they're extremely good at learning about laws of different environments. And of course  we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows. We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal. We're smarter  we're more flexible  we can learn more  we survive in more different environments  we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space. And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species. My son is   . And at least until they're     we're still popping those worms into those little open mouths. All right  why would we see this correlation  Well an idea is that that strategy  that learning strategy  is an extremely powerful  great strategy for getting on in the world  but it has one big disadvantage. And that one big disadvantage is that  until you actually do all that learning  you're going to be helpless. So you don't want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself   A slingshot or maybe a spear might work. Which would actually be better   You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up. And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor. So the idea is that we have this early period when we're completely protected. We don't have to do anything. All we have to do is learn. And then as adults  we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world. So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species. So they're the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas  and we're production and marketing. We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use. Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups  we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species    kind of like caterpillars and butterflies    except that they're actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring  and we're the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow  grownup  adult path. If this is true  if these babies are designed to learn    and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning  that's what they're for    we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms. And in fact  the baby's brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet. But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better. And there's been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently. And it all depends on the ideas of this guy  the Reverend Thomas Bayes  who was a statistician and mathematician in the   th century. And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize  describe  the way that scientists find out about the world. So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with. They go out and test it against the evidence. The evidence makes them change that hypothesis. Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth. And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that. And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now. And some    years ago  I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing. So if you want to know what's going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes  I think it actually looks something like this. This is Reverend Bayes's notebook. So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they're revising to figure out how the world works. All right  now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate. Because after all  if you ask even grownups about statistics  they look extremely stupid. How could it be that children are doing statistics  So to test this we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector. This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others. And using this very simple machine  my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world. Let me mention just one that we did with Tumar Kushner  my student. If I showed you this detector  you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector. But actually  this detector works in a bit of a strange way. Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector  something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with  the detector will actually activate two out of three times. Whereas  if you do the likely thing  put the block on the detector  it will only activate two out of six times. So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence. It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy. So we did just this  we gave four year olds this pattern of evidence  and we just asked them to make it go. And sure enough  the four year olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector. Now there are two things that are really interesting about this. The first one is  again  remember  these are four year olds. They're just learning how to count. But unconsciously  they're doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure. And the other interesting thing is that they're using that evidence to get to an idea  get to a hypothesis about the world  that seems very unlikely to begin with. And in studies we've just been doing in my lab  similar studies  we've show that four year olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task. So in these circumstances  the children are using statistics to find out about the world  but after all  scientists also do experiments  and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments. When children do experiments we call it  getting into everything  or else  playing.  And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program. Here's one from Cristine Legare's lab. What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors. And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn't  and then she showed them an anomaly. And what you'll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes. Same as the other side. Alison Gopnik  Okay  so his first hypothesis has just been falsified. Boy  This one lighted up  and this one nothing. AG  Okay  he's got his experimental notebook out. Boy  What's making this light up. I don't know. AG  Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair. Boy  Oh  it's because this needs to be like this  and this needs to be like this. AG  Okay  hypothesis two. Boy  That's why. Oh. AG  Now this is his next idea. He told the experimenter to do this  to try putting it out onto the other location. Not working either. Boy  Oh  because the light goes only to here  not here. Oh  the bottom of this box has electricity in here  but this doesn't have electricity. AG  Okay  that's a fourth hypothesis. Boy  It's lighting up. So when you put four. So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up. AG  Okay there's his fifth hypothesis. Now that is a particularly    that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy  but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical. If you look at the way children play  when you ask them to explain something  what they really do is do a series of experiments. This is actually pretty typical of four year olds. Well  what's it like to be this kind of creature  What's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes  Well  if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers  a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all. And I think just the opposite is true. I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults. Now here's what we know about how adult consciousness works. And adults' attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight. So what happens for adults is we decide that something's relevant or important  we should pay attention to it. Our consciousness of that thing that we're attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid  and everything else sort of goes dark. And we even know something about the way the brain does this. So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex  the sort of executive part of our brains  sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible  more plastic  better at learning  and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains. So we have a very focused  purpose driven kind of attention. If we look at babies and young children  we see something very different. I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness. So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing. But they're very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once. And if you actually look in their brains  you see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity  and the inhibitory parts haven't come on yet. So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention  what we really mean is that they're bad at not paying attention. So they're bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that's important. That's the kind of attention  the kind of consciousness  that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn. Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults  I think the best thing is think about cases where we're put in a new situation that we've never been in before    when we fall in love with someone new  or when we're in a new city for the first time. And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts  it expands  so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking  talking  faculty meeting attending zombie back home. And by the way  that coffee  that wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs  actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters. So what's it like to be a baby  It's like being in love in Paris for the first time after you've had three double espressos. That's a fantastic way to be  but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o'clock in the morning. Now it's good to be a grownup. I don't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are. It's good to be a grownup. We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves. And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do. But if what we want is to be like those butterflies  to have open mindedness  open learning  imagination  creativity  innovation  maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children. When I was little    and by the way  I was little once    my father told me a story about an   th century watchmaker. And what this guy had done  he used to produce these fabulously beautiful watches. And one day  one of his customers came into his workshop and asked him to clean the watch that he'd bought. And the guy took it apart  and one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels. And as he did so  his customer noticed that on the back side of the balance wheel was an engraving  were words. And he said to the guy   Why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see   And the watchmaker turned around and said   God can see it.  Now I'm not in the least bit religious  neither was my father  but at that point  I noticed something happening here. I felt something in this plexus of blood vessels and nerves  and there must be some muscles in there as well somewhere  I guess. But I felt something. And it was a physiological response. And from that point on  from my age at the time  I began to think of things in a different way. And as I took on my career as a designer  I began to ask myself the simple question  Do we actually think beauty  or do we feel it  Now you probably know the answer to this already. You probably think  well  I don't know which one you think it is  but I think it's about feeling beauty. And so I then moved on into my design career and began to find some exciting things. One of the most early work was done in automotive design    some very exciting work was done there. And during a lot of this work  we found something  or I found something  that really fascinated me  and maybe you can remember it. Do you remember when lights used to just go on and off  click click  when you closed the door in a car  And then somebody  I think it was BMW  introduced a light that went out slowly. Remember that  I remember it clearly. Do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that  I remember sitting there thinking  this is fantastic. In fact  I've never found anybody that doesn't like the light that goes out slowly. I thought  well what the hell's that about  So I started to ask myself questions about it. And the first was  I'd ask other people   Do you like it    Yes.   Why   And they'd say   Oh  it feels so natural   or   It's nice.  I thought  well that's not good enough. Can we cut down a little bit further  because  as a designer  I need the vocabulary  I need the keyboard  of how this actually works. And so I did some experiments. And I suddenly realized that there was something that did exactly that    light to dark in six seconds    exactly that. Do you know what it is  Anyone  You see  using this bit  the thinky bit  the slow bit of the brain    using that. And this isn't a think  it's a feel. And would you do me a favor  For the next    minutes or whatever it is  will you feel stuff  I don't need you to think so much as I want you to feel it. I felt a sense of relaxation tempered with anticipation. And that thing that I found was the cinema or the theater. It's actually just happened here    light to dark in six seconds. And when that happens  are you sitting there going   No  the movie's about to start   or are you going   That's fantastic. I'm looking forward to it. I get a sense of anticipation   Now I'm not a neuroscientist. I don't know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex. But it might be. Because the people I speak to in the northern hemisphere that used to go in the cinema get this. And some of the people I speak to that have never seen a movie or been to the theater don't get it in the same way. Everybody likes it  but some like it more than others. So this leads me to think of this in a different way. We're not feeling it. We're thinking beauty is in the limbic system    if that's not an outmoded idea. These are the bits  the pleasure centers  and maybe what I'm seeing and sensing and feeling is bypassing my thinking. The wiring from your sensory apparatus to those bits is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thinky bit  the cortex. They arrive first. So how do we make that actually work  And how much of that reactive side of it is due to what we already know  or what we're going to learn  about something  This is one of the most beautiful things I know. It's a plastic bag. And when I looked at it first  I thought  no  there's no beauty in that. Then I found out  post exposure  that this plastic bag if I put it into a filthy puddle or a stream filled with coliforms and all sorts of disgusting stuff  that that filthy water will migrate through the wall of the bag by osmosis and end up inside it as pure  potable drinking water. And all of a sudden  this plastic bag was extremely beautiful to me. Now I'm going to ask you again to switch on the emotional bit. Would you mind taking the brain out  and I just want you to feel something. Look at that. What are you feeling about it  Is it beautiful  Is it exciting  I'm watching your faces very carefully. There's some rather bored looking gentlemen and some slightly engaged looking ladies who are picking up something off that. Maybe there's an innocence to it. Now I'm going to tell you what it is. Are you ready  This is the last act on this Earth of a little girl called Heidi  five years old  before she died of cancer to the spine. It's the last thing she did  the last physical act. Look at that picture. Look at the innocence. Look at the beauty in it. Is it beautiful now  Stop. Stop. How do you feel  Where are you feeling this  I'm feeling it here. I feel it here. And I'm watching your faces  because your faces are telling me something. The lady over there is actually crying  by the way. But what are you doing  I watch what people do. I watch faces. I watch reactions. Because I have to know how people react to things. And one of the most common faces on something faced with beauty  something stupefyingly delicious  is what I call the OMG. And by the way  there's no pleasure in that face. It's not a  this is wonderful   The eyebrows are doing this  the eyes are defocused  and the mouth is hanging open. That's not the expression of joy. There's something else in that. There's something weird happening. So pleasure seems to be tempered by a whole series of different things coming in. Poignancy is a word I love as a designer. It means something triggering a big emotional response  often quite a sad emotional response  but it's part of what we do. It isn't just about nice. And this is the dilemma  this is the paradox  of beauty. Sensorily  we're taking in all sorts of things    mixtures of things that are good  bad  exciting  frightening    to come up with that sensorial exposure  that sensation of what's going on. Pathos appears obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl's drawing. And also triumph  this sense of transcendence  this  I never knew that. Ah  this is something new.  And that's packed in there as well. And as we assemble these tools  from a design point of view  I get terribly excited about it  because these are things  as we've already said  they're arriving at the brain  it would seem  before cognition  before we can manipulate them    electrochemical party tricks. Now what I'm also interested in is  Is it possible to separate intrinsic and extrinsic beauty  By that  I mean intrinsically beautiful things  just something that's exquisitely beautiful  that's universally beautiful. Very hard to find. Maybe you've got some examples of it. Very hard to find something that  to everybody  is a very beautiful thing  without a certain amount of information packed in there before. So a lot of it tends to be extrinsic. It's mediated by information before the comprehension. Or the information's added on at the back  like that little girl's drawing that I showed you. Now when talking about beauty you can't get away from the fact that a lot experiments have been done in this way with faces and what have you. And one of the most tedious ones  I think  was saying that beauty was about symmetry. Well it obviously isn't. This is a more interesting one where half faces were shown to some people  and then to add them into a list of most beautiful to least beautiful and then exposing a full face. And they found that it was almost exact coincidence. So it wasn't about symmetry. In fact  this lady has a particularly asymmetrical face  of which both sides are beautiful. But they're both different. And as a designer  I can't help meddling with this  so I pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this  and tried to understand what the individual elements were  but feeling it as I go. Now I can feel a sensation of delight and beauty if I look at that eye. I'm not getting it off the eyebrow. And the earhole isn't doing it to me at all. So I don't know how much this is helping me  but it's helping to guide me to the places where the signals are coming off. And as I say  I'm not a neuroscientist  but to understand how I can start to assemble things that will very quickly bypass this thinking part and get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements. Anais Nin and the Talmud have told us time and time again that we see things not as they are  but as we are. So I'm going to shamelessly expose something to you  which is beautiful to me. And this is the F  MV Agusta. Ahhhh. It is really    I mean  I can't express to you how exquisite this object is. But I also know why it's exquisite to me  because it's a palimpsest of things. It's masses and masses of layers. This is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension. It's something much bigger. Layer after layer of legend  sport  details that resonate. I mean  if I just go through some of them now    I know about laminar flow when it comes to air piercing objects  and that does it consummately well  you can see it can. So that's getting me excited. And I feel that here. This bit  the big secret of automotive design    reflection management. It's not about the shapes  it's how the shapes reflect light. Now that thing  light flickers across it as you move  so it becomes a kinetic object  even though it's standing still    managed by how brilliantly that's done on the reflection. This little relief on the footplate  by the way  to a rider means there's something going on underneath it    in this case  a drive chain running at     miles and hour probably  taking the power from the engine. I'm getting terribly excited as my mind and my eyes flick across these things. Titanium lacquer on this. I can't tell you how wonderful this is. That's how you stop the nuts coming off at high speed on the wheel. I'm really getting into this now. And of course  a racing bike doesn't have a prop stand  but this one  because it's a road bike  it all goes away and it folds into this little gap. So it disappears. And then I can't tell you how hard it is to do that radiator  which is curved. Why would you do that  Because I know we need to bring the wheel farther into the aerodynamics. So it's more expensive  but it's wonderful. And to cap it all  brand royalty    Agusta  Count Agusta  from the great histories of this stuff. The bit that you can't see is the genius that created this. Massimo Tamburini. They call him  The Plumber  in Italy  as well as  Maestro   because he actually is engineer and craftsman and sculptor at the same time. There's so little compromise on this  you can't see it. But unfortunately  the likes of me and people that are like me have to deal with compromise all the time with beauty. We have to deal with it. So I have to work with a supply chain  and I've got to work with the technologies  and I've got to work with everything else all the time  and so compromises start to fit into it. And so look at her. I've had to make a bit of a compromise there. I've had to move that part across  but only a millimeter. No one's noticed  have they yet  Did you see what I did  I moved three things by a millimeter. Pretty  Yes. Beautiful  Maybe lesser. But then  of course  the consumer says that doesn't really matter. So that's okay  isn't it  Another millimeter  No one's going to notice those split lines and changes. It's that easy to lose beauty  because beauty's incredibly difficult to do. And only a few people can do it. And a focus group cannot do it. And a team rarely can do it. It takes a central cortex  if you like  to be able to orchestrate all those elements at the same time. This is a beautiful water bottle    some of you know of it    done by Ross Lovegrove  the designer. This is pretty close to intrinsic beauty. This one  as long as you know what water is like then you can experience this. It's lovely because it is an embodiment of something refreshing and delicious. I might like it more than you like it  because I know how bloody hard it is to do it. It's stupefyingly difficult to make something that refracts light like that  that comes out of the tool correctly  that goes down the line without falling over. Underneath this  like the story of the swan  is a million things very difficult to do. So all hail to that. It's a fantastic example  a simple object. And the one I showed you before was  of course  a massively complex one. And they're working in beauty in slightly different ways because of it. You all  I guess  like me  enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance. And part of the joy of it is  you know the difficulty. You also may be taking into account the fact that it's incredibly painful. Anybody seen a ballet dancer's toes when they come out of the points  While she's doing these graceful arabesques and plies and what have you  something horrible's going on down here. The comprehension of it leads us to a greater and heightened sense of the beauty of what's actually going on. Now I'm using microseconds wrongly here  so please ignore me. But what I have to do now  feeling again  what I've got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes  of these triggers into something early on in the process  that you pick it up  not through your thinking  but through your feeling. So we're going to have a little experiment. Right  are you ready  I'm going to show you something for a very  very brief moment. Are you ready  Okay. Did you think that was a bicycle when I showed it to you at the first flash  It's not. Tell me something  did you think it was quick when you first saw it  Yes you did. Did you think it was modern  Yes you did. That blip  that information  shot into you before that. And because your brain starter motor began there  now it's got to deal with it. And the great thing is  this motorcycle has been styled this way specifically to engender a sense that it's green technology and it's good for you and it's light and it's all part of the future. So is that wrong  Well in this case it isn't  because it's a very  very ecologically sound piece of technology. But you're a slave of that first flash. We are slaves to the first few fractions of a second    and that's where much of my work has to win or lose  on a shelf in a shop. It wins or loses at that point. You may see              things on a shelf as you walk down it  but I have to work within that domain  to ensure that it gets you there first. And finally  the layer that I love  of knowledge. Some of you  I'm sure  will be familiar with this. What's incredible about this  and the way I love to come back to it  is this is taking something that you hate or bores you  folding clothes  and if you can actually do this    who can actually do this  Anybody try to do this  Yeah  It's fantastic  isn't it  Look at that. Do you want to see it again  No time. It says I have two minutes left  so we can't do this. But just go to the Web  YouTube  pull it down   folding T shirt.  That's how underpaid younger aged people have to fold your T shirt. You didn't maybe know it. But how do you feel about it  It feels fantastic when you do it  you look forward to doing it  and when you tell somebody else about it    like you probably have    you look really smart. The knowledge bubble that sits around the outside  the stuff that costs nothing  because that knowledge is free    bundle that together and where do we come out  Form follows function  Only sometimes. Only sometimes. Form is function. Form is function. It informs  it tells us  it supplies us answers before we've even thought about it. And so I've stopped using words like  form   and I've stopped using words like  function  as a designer. What I try to pursue now is the emotional functionality of things. Because if I can get that right  I can make them wonderful  and I can make them repeatedly wonderful. And you know what those products and services are  because you own some of them. They're the things that you'd snatch if the house was on fire. Forming the emotional bond between this thing and you is an electrochemical party trick that happens before you even think about it. Thank you very much. Well we all know the World Wide Web has absolutely transformed publishing  broadcasting  commerce and social connectivity  but where did it all come from  And I'll quote three people  Vannevar Bush  Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners Lee. So let's just run through these guys. This is Vannevar Bush. Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government's chief scientific adviser during the war. And in       he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly. And the article was called  As We May Think.  And what Vannevar Bush was saying was the way we use information is broken. We don't work in terms of libraries and catalog systems and so forth. The brain works by association. With one item in its thought  it snaps instantly to the next item. And the way information is structured is totally incapable of keeping up with this process. And so he suggested a machine  and he called it the memex. And the memex would link information  one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth. Now this was in     . A computer in those days was something the secret services used to use for code breaking. And nobody knew anything about it. So this was before the computer was invented. And he proposed this machine called the memex. And he had a platform where you linked information to other information  and then you could call it up at will. So spinning forward  one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart  and he was a U.S. Air Force officer. And he was reading it in their library in the Far East. And he was so inspired by this article  it kind of directed the rest of his life. And by the mid   s  he was able to put this into action when he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California. He built a system. The system was designed to augment human intelligence  it was called. And in a premonition of today's world of cloud computing and softwares of service  his system was called NLS for oN Line System. And this is Doug Engelbart. He was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in     . What he showed    he sat on a stage like this  and he demonstrated this system. He had his head mic like I've got. And he works this system. And you can see  he's working between documents and graphics and so forth. And he's driving it all with this platform here  with a five finger keyboard and the world's first computer mouse  which he specially designed in order to do this system. So this is where the mouse came from as well. So this is Doug Engelbart. The trouble with Doug Engelbart's system was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds. So for a personal computer  a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane  it wasn't really very practical. But spin on to the   s when personal computers did arrive  then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers. And my company  OWL built a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh. And we delivered the world's first hypertext system. And this began to get a head of steam. Apple introduced a thing called HyperCard  and they made a bit of a fuss about it. They had a    page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched. The magazines started to cover it. Byte magazine and Communications at the ACM had special issues covering hypertext. We developed a PC version of this product as well as the Macintosh version. And our PC version became quite mature. These are some examples of this system in action in the late   s. You were able to deliver documents  were able to do it over networks. We developed a system such that it had a markup language based on html. We called it hml  hypertext markup language. And the system was capable of doing very  very large documentation systems over computer networks. So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris in late November     . And I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners Lee who said   Are you Ian Ritchie   and I said   Yeah.  And he said   I need to talk to you.  And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web. And I thought  well  that's got a pretentious name  especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office. But he was completely convinced that his World Wide Web would take over the world one day. And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it  because his system didn't have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything  it was just plain text. I thought  well  you know  interesting  but a guy from CERN  he's not going to do this. So we didn't do it. In the next couple of years  the hypertext community didn't recognize him either. In       his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference. In       there was a table at the conference in Seattle  and a guy called Marc Andreessen was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web. And I saw it  and I thought  yep  that's it. And the very next year  in       we had the conference here in Edinburgh  and I had no opposition in having Tim Berners Lee as the keynote speaker. So that puts me in pretty illustrious company. There was a guy called Dick Rowe who was at Decca Records and turned down The Beatles. There was a guy called Gary Kildall who went flying his plane when IBM came looking for an operating system for the IBM PC  and he wasn't there  so they went back to see Bill Gates. And the    publishers who turned down J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter  I guess. On the other hand  there's Marc Andreessen who wrote the world's first browser for the World Wide Web. And according to Fortune magazine  he's worth     million dollars. But is he happy  Okay  now I don't want to alarm anybody in this room  but it's just come to my attention that the person to your right is a liar. Also  the person to your left is a liar. Also the person sitting in your very seats is a liar. We're all liars. What I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you what the research says about why we're all liars  how you can become a liespotter and why you might want to go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking  and ultimately to trust building. Now  speaking of trust  ever since I wrote this book   Liespotting   no one wants to meet me in person anymore  no  no  no  no  no. They say   It's okay  we'll email you.  I can't even get a coffee date at Starbucks. My husband's like   Honey  deception  Maybe you could have focused on cooking. How about French cooking   So before I get started  what I'm going to do is I'm going to clarify my goal for you  which is not to teach a game of Gotcha. Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids  those kids in the back of the room that are shouting   Gotcha  Gotcha  Your eyebrow twitched. You flared your nostril. I watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.' I know you're lying.  No  liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge of how to spot deception. They use it to get to the truth  and they do what mature leaders do everyday  they have difficult conversations with difficult people  sometimes during very difficult times. And they start up that path by accepting a core proposition  and that proposition is the following  Lying is a cooperative act. Think about it  a lie has no power whatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie. So I know it may sound like tough love  but look  if at some point you got lied to  it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth number one about lying  Lying's a cooperative act. Now not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing participants in deception for the sake of social dignity  maybe to keep a secret that should be kept secret  secret. We say   Nice song.   Honey  you don't look fat in that  no.  Or we say  favorite of the digiratti   You know  I just fished that email out of my Spam folder. So sorry.  But there are times when we are unwilling participants in deception. And that can have dramatic costs for us. Last year saw     billion dollars in corporate fraud alone in the United States. That's an eyelash under a trillion dollars. That's seven percent of revenues. Deception can cost billions. Think Enron  Madoff  the mortgage crisis. Or in the case of double agents and traitors  like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames  lies can betray our country  they can compromise our security  they can undermine democracy  they can cause the deaths of those that defend us. Deception is actually serious business. This con man  Henry Oberlander  he was such an effective con man  British authorities say he could have undermined the entire banking system of the Western world. And you can't find this guy on Google  you can't find him anywhere. He was interviewed once  and he said the following. He said   Look  I've got one rule.  And this was Henry's rule  he said   Look  everyone is willing to give you something. They're ready to give you something for whatever it is they're hungry for.  And that's the crux of it. If you don't want to be deceived  you have to know  what is it that you're hungry for  And we all kind of hate to admit it. We wish we were better husbands  better wives  smarter  more powerful  taller  richer    the list goes on. Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap  to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were  how we wish we could be  with what we're really like. And boy are we willing to fill in those gaps in our lives with lies. On a given day  studies show that you may be lied to anywhere from    to     times. Now granted  many of those are white lies. But in another study  it showed that strangers lied three times within the first    minutes of meeting each other. Now when we first hear this data  we recoil. We can't believe how prevalent lying is. We're essentially against lying. But if you look more closely  the plot actually thickens. We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers. Extroverts lie more than introverts. Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you're an average married couple  you're going to lie to your spouse in one out of every    interactions. Now  you may think that's bad. If you're unmarried  that number drops to three. Lying's complex. It's woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives. We're deeply ambivalent about the truth. We parse it out on an as needed basis  sometimes for very good reasons  other times just because we don't understand the gaps in our lives. That's truth number two about lying. We're against lying  but we're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned for centuries and centuries and centuries. It's as old as breathing. It's part of our culture  it's part of our history. Think Dante  Shakespeare  the Bible  News of the World. Lying has evolutionary value to us as a species. Researchers have long known that the more intelligent the species  the larger the neocortex  the more likely it is to be deceptive. Now you might remember Koko. Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla who was taught sign language  Koko was taught to communicate via sign language. Here's Koko with her kitten. It's her cute little  fluffy pet kitten. Koko once blamed her pet kitten for ripping a sink out of the wall. We're hardwired to become leaders of the pack. It's starts really  really early. How early  Well babies will fake a cry  pause  wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. One year olds learn concealment. Two year olds bluff. Five year olds lie outright. They manipulate via flattery. Nine year olds  masters of the cover up. By the time you enter college  you're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world and we're breadwinners  we enter a world that is just cluttered with Spam  fake digital friends  partisan media  ingenious identity thieves  world class Ponzi schemers  a deception epidemic    in short  what one author calls a post truth society. It's been very confusing for a long time now. What do you do  Well  there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass. Trained liespotters get to the truth    percent of the time. The rest of us  we're only    percent accurate. Why is it so easy to learn  There are good liars and bad liars. There are no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes. We all use the same techniques. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you two patterns of deception. And then we're going to look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves. We're going to start with speech. I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations with that woman  Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie  not a single time  never. And these allegations are false. And I need to go back to work for the American people. Thank you. Pamela Meyer  Okay  what were the telltale signs  Well first we heard what's known as a non contracted denial. Studies show that people who are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather than informal language. We also heard distancing language   that woman.  We know that liars will unconsciously distance themselves from their subject  using language as their tool. Now if Bill Clinton had said   Well  to tell you the truth ...  or Richard Nixon's favorite   In all candor ...  he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter that knows that qualifying language  as it's called  qualifying language like that  further discredits the subject. Now if he had repeated the question in its entirety  or if he had peppered his account with a little too much detail    and we're all really glad he didn't do that    he would have further discredited himself. Freud had it right. Freud said  look  there's much more to it than speech   No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent  he chatters with his fingertips.  And we all do it no matter how powerful you are. We all chatter with our fingertips. I'm going to show you Dominique Strauss Kahn with Obama who's chattering with his fingertips. Now this brings us to our next pattern  which is body language. With body language  here's what you've got to do. You've really got to just throw your assumptions out the door. Let the science temper your knowledge a little bit. Because we think liars fidget all the time. Well guess what  they're known to freeze their upper bodies when they're lying. We think liars won't look you in the eyes. Well guess what  they look you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth. We think warmth and smiles convey honesty  sincerity. But a trained liespotter can spot a fake smile a mile away. Can you all spot the fake smile here  You can consciously contract the muscles in your cheeks. But the real smile's in the eyes  the crow's feet of the eyes. They cannot be consciously contracted  especially if you overdid the Botox. Don't overdo the Botox  nobody will think you're honest. Now we're going to look at the hot spots. Can you tell what's happening in a conversation  Can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone's words and someone's actions  Now  I know it seems really obvious  but when you're having a conversation with someone you suspect of deception  attitude is by far the most overlooked but telling of indicators. An honest person is going to be cooperative. They're going to show they're on your side. They're going to be enthusiastic. They're going to be willing and helpful to getting you to the truth. They're going to be willing to brainstorm  name suspects  provide details. They're going to say   Hey  maybe it was those guys in payroll that forged those checks.  They're going to be infuriated if they sense they're wrongly accused throughout the entire course of the interview  not just in flashes  they'll be infuriated throughout the entire course of the interview. And if you ask someone honest what should happen to whomever did forge those checks  an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather than lenient punishment. Now let's say you're having that exact same conversation with someone deceptive. That person may be withdrawn  look down  lower their voice  pause  be kind of herky jerky. Ask a deceptive person to tell their story  they're going to pepper it with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places. And then they're going to tell their story in strict chronological order. And what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways over the course of several hours  they will ask that person to tell that story backwards  and then they'll watch them squirm  and track which questions produce the highest volume of deceptive tells. Why do they do that  Well  we all do the same thing. We rehearse our words  but we rarely rehearse our gestures. We say  yes   we shake our heads  no.  We tell very convincing stories  we slightly shrug our shoulders. We commit terrible crimes  and we smile at the delight in getting away with it. Now  that smile is known in the trade as  duping delight.  And we're going to see that in several videos moving forward  but we're going to start    for those of you who don't know him  this is presidential candidate John Edwards who shocked America by fathering a child out of wedlock. We're going to see him talk about getting a paternity test. See now if you can spot him saying   yes  while shaking his head  no   slightly shrugging his shoulders. I know that it's not possible that this child could be mine  because of the timing of events. So I know it's not possible. Happy to take a paternity test  and would love to see it happen. Interviewer  Are you going to do that soon  Is there somebody    JE  Well  I'm only one side. I'm only one side of the test. But I'm happy to participate in one. PM  Okay  those head shakes are much easier to spot once you know to look for them. There are going to be times when someone makes one expression while masking another that just kind of leaks through in a flash. Murderers are known to leak sadness. Your new joint venture partner might shake your hand  celebrate  go out to dinner with you and then leak an expression of anger. And we're not all going to become facial expression experts overnight here  but there's one I can teach you that's very dangerous and it's easy to learn  and that's the expression of contempt. Now with anger  you've got two people on an even playing field. It's still somewhat of a healthy relationship. But when anger turns to contempt  you've been dismissed. It's associated with moral superiority. And for that reason  it's very  very hard to recover from. Here's what it looks like. It's marked by one lip corner pulled up and in. It's the only asymmetrical expression. And in the presence of contempt  whether or not deception follows    and it doesn't always follow    look the other way  go the other direction  reconsider the deal  say   No thank you. I'm not coming up for just one more nightcap. Thank you.  Science has surfaced many  many more indicators. We know  for example  we know liars will shift their blink rate  point their feet towards an exit. They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves and the person that is interviewing them. They'll alter their vocal tone  often making their vocal tone much lower. Now here's the deal. These behaviors are just behaviors. They're not proof of deception. They're red flags. We're human beings. We make deceptive flailing gestures all over the place all day long. They don't mean anything in and of themselves. But when you see clusters of them  that's your signal. Look  listen  probe  ask some hard questions  get out of that very comfortable mode of knowing  walk into curiosity mode  ask more questions  have a little dignity  treat the person you're talking to with rapport. Don't try to be like those folks on  Law   Order  and those other TV shows that pummel their subjects into submission. Don't be too aggressive  it doesn't work. Now  we've talked a little bit about how to talk to someone who's lying and how to spot a lie. And as I promised  we're now going to look at what the truth looks like. But I'm going to show you two videos  two mothers    one is lying  one is telling the truth. And these were surfaced by researcher David Matsumoto in California. And I think they're an excellent example of what the truth looks like. This mother  Diane Downs  shot her kids at close range  drove them to the hospital while they bled all over the car  claimed a scraggy haired stranger did it. And you'll see when you see the video  she can't even pretend to be an agonizing mother. What you want to look for here is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes and her very  very cool demeanor. And if you look closely  you'll see duping delight throughout this video. I can see Christie reaching her hand out to me while I'm driving  and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth. And that    maybe it'll fade too with time    but I don't think so. That bothers me the most. PM  Now I'm going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother  Erin Runnion  confronting her daughter's murderer and torturer in court. Here you're going to see no false emotion  just the authentic expression of a mother's agony. on the third anniversary of the night you took my baby  and you hurt her  and you crushed her  you terrified her until her heart stopped. And she fought  and I know she fought you. But I know she looked at you with those amazing brown eyes  and you still wanted to kill her. And I don't understand it  and I never will. PM  Okay  there's no doubting the veracity of those emotions. Now the technology around what the truth looks like is progressing on  the science of it. We know  for example  that we now have specialized eye trackers and infrared brain scans  MRI's that can decode the signals that our bodies send out when we're trying to be deceptive. And these technologies are going to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit  and they will prove incredibly useful some day. But you've got to ask yourself in the meantime  Who do you want on your side of the meeting  someone who's trained in getting to the truth or some guy who's going to drag a     pound electroencephalogram through the door  Liespotters rely on human tools. They know  as someone once said   Character's who you are in the dark.  And what's kind of interesting is that today  we have so little darkness. Our world is lit up    hours a day. It's transparent with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live their lives in public. It's a much more noisy world. So one challenge we have is to remember  oversharing  that's not honesty. Our manic tweeting and texting can blind us to the fact that the subtleties of human decency    character integrity    that's still what matters  that's always what's going to matter. So in this much noisier world  it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit about our moral code. When you combine the science of recognizing deception with the art of looking  listening  you exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie. You start up that path of being just a little bit more explicit  because you signal to everyone around you  you say   Hey  my world  our world  it's going to be an honest one. My world is going to be one where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized and marginalized.  And when you do that  the ground around you starts to shift just a little bit. And that's the truth. Thank you. So I'm here to explain why I'm wearing these ninja pajamas. And to do that  I'd like to talk first about environmental toxins in our bodies. So some of you may know about the chemical Bisphenol A  BPA. It's a material hardener and synthetic estrogen that's found in the lining of canned foods and some plastics. So BPA mimics the body's own hormones and causes neurological and reproductive problems. And it's everywhere. A recent study found BPA in    percent of people six and older. But it's just one chemical. The Center for Disease Control in the U.S. says we have     toxic pollutants in our bodies  and this includes preservatives  pesticides and heavy metals like lead and mercury. To me  this says three things. First  don't become a cannibal. Second  we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution. And third  our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins. So what happens to all these toxins when we die  The short answer is  They return to the environment in one way or another  continuing the cycle of toxicity. But our current funeral practices make the situation much worse. If you're cremated  all those toxins I mentioned are released into the atmosphere. And this includes       pounds of mercury from our dental fillings alone every year. And in a traditional American funeral  a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics to make it look alive. It's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde to slow decomposition    a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer in funeral personnel. So by trying to preserve our dead bodies  we deny death  poison the living and further harm the environment. Green or natural burials  which don't use embalming  are a step in the right direction  but they don't address the existing toxins in our bodies. I think there's a better solution. I'm an artist  so I'd like to offer a modest proposal at the intersection of art  science and culture. The Infinity Burial Project  an alternative burial system that uses mushrooms to decompose and clean toxins in bodies. The Infinity Burial Project began a few years ago with a fantasy to create the Infinity Mushroom    a new hybrid mushroom that would decompose bodies  clean the toxins and deliver nutrients to plant roots  leaving clean compost. But I learned it's nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom. I also learned that some of our tastiest mushrooms can clean environmental toxins in soil. So I thought maybe I could train an army of toxin cleaning edible mushrooms to eat my body. So today  I'm collecting what I shed or slough off    my hair  skin and nails    and I'm feeding these to edible mushrooms. As the mushrooms grow  I pick the best feeders to become Infinity Mushrooms. It's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process for the afterlife. So when I die  the Infinity Mushrooms will recognize my body and be able to eat it. All right  so for some of you  this may be really  really out there. Just a little. I realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food. We want to eat  not be eaten by  our food. But as I watch the mushrooms grow and digest my body  I imagine the Infinity Mushroom as a symbol of a new way of thinking about death and the relationship between my body and the environment. See for me  cultivating the Infinity Mushroom is more than just scientific experimentation or gardening or raising a pet  it's a step towards accepting the fact that someday I will die and decay. It's also a step towards taking responsibility for my own burden on the planet. Growing a mushroom is also part of a larger practice of cultivating decomposing organisms called decompiculture  a concept that was developed by an entomologist  Timothy Myles. The Infinity Mushroom is a subset of decompiculture I'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation    the cultivation of organisms that decompose and clean toxins in bodies. And now about these ninja pajamas. Once it's completed  I plan to integrate the Infinity Mushrooms into a number of objects. First  a burial suit infused with mushroom spores  the Mushroom Death Suit. I'm wearing the second prototype of this burial suit. It's covered with a crocheted netting that is embedded with mushroom spores. The dendritic pattern you see mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia  which are the equivalent of plant roots. I'm also making a decompiculture kit  a cocktail of capsules that contain Infinity Mushroom spores and other elements that speed decomposition and toxin remediation. These capsules are embedded in a nutrient rich jelly  a kind of second skin  which dissolves quickly and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms. So I plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit in the next year or two  and then I'd like to begin testing them  first with expired meat from the market and then with human subjects. And believe it or not  a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project to be eaten by mushrooms. What I've learned from talking to these folks is that we share a common desire to understand and accept death and to minimize the impact of our death on the environment. I wanted to cultivate this perspective just like the mushrooms  so I formed the Decompiculture Society  a group of people called decompinauts who actively explore their postmortem options  seek death acceptance and cultivate decomposing organisms like the Infinity Mushroom. The Decompiculture Society shares a vision of a cultural shift  from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture  a radical acceptance of death and decomposition. Accepting death means accepting that we are physical beings who are intimately connected to the environment  as the research on environmental toxins confirms. And the saying goes  we came from dust and will return to dust. And once we understand that we're connected to the environment  we see that the survival of our species depends on the survival of the planet. I believe this is the beginning of true environmental responsibility. Thank you. I'd like to take you to another world. And I'd like to share a    year old love story with the poor  living on less than one dollar a day. I went to a very elitist  snobbish  expensive education in India  and that almost destroyed me. I was all set to be a diplomat  teacher  doctor    all laid out. Then  I don't look it  but I was the Indian national squash champion for three years. The whole world was laid out for me. Everything was at my feet. I could do nothing wrong. And then I thought out of curiosity I'd like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like. So in       I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India  and I saw starvation  death  people dying of hunger  for the first time. It changed my life. I came back home  told my mother   I'd like to live and work in a village.  Mother went into a coma.  What is this  The whole world is laid out for you  the best jobs are laid out for you  and you want to go and work in a village  I mean  is there something wrong with you   I said   No  I've got the best eduction. It made me think. And I wanted to give something back in my own way.   What do you want to do in a village  No job  no money  no security  no prospect.  I said   I want to live and dig wells for five years.   Dig wells for five years  You went to the most expensive school and college in India  and you want to dig wells for five years   She didn't speak to me for a very long time  because she thought I'd let my family down. But then  I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have  which are never brought into the mainstream    which is never identified  respected  applied on a large scale. And I thought I'd start a Barefoot College    college only for the poor. What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college. I went to this village for the first time. Elders came to me and said   Are you running from the police   I said   No.   You failed in your exam   I said   No.   You didn't get a government job   I said   No.   What are you doing here  Why are you here  The education system in India makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich  what are you doing in this village  Is there something wrong with you you're not telling us   I said   No  I want to actually start a college only for the poor. What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college.  So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice. They said   Please  don't bring anyone with a degree and qualification into your college.  So it's the only college in India where  if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master's  you are disqualified to come. You have to be a cop out or a wash out or a dropout to come to our college. You have to work with your hands. You have to have a dignity of labor. You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community. So we started the Barefoot College  and we redefined professionalism. Who is a professional  A professional is someone who has a combination of competence  confidence and belief. A water diviner is a professional. A traditional midwife is a professional. A traditional bone setter is a professional. These are professionals all over the world. You find them in any inaccessible village around the world. And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream and show that the knowledge and skills that they have is universal. It needs to be used  needs to be applied  needs to be shown to the world outside    that these knowledge and skills are relevant even today. So the college works following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi. You eat on the floor  you sleep on the floor  you work on the floor. There are no contracts  no written contracts. You can stay with me for    years  go tomorrow. And no one can get more than      a month. You come for the money  you don't come to Barefoot College. You come for the work and the challenge  you'll come to the Barefoot College. That is where we want you to try crazy ideas. Whatever idea you have  come and try it. It doesn't matter if you fail. Battered  bruised  you start again. It's the only college where the teacher is the learner and the learner is the teacher. And it's the only college where we don't give a certificate. You are certified by the community you serve. You don't need a paper to hang on the wall to show that you are an engineer. So when I said that  they said   Well show us what is possible. What are you doing  This is all mumbo jumbo if you can't show it on the ground.  So we built the first Barefoot College in     . It was built by    Barefoot architects who can't read and write  built on   .   a sq. ft.     people lived there  worked there. They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in     . But then they suspected  they thought there was an architect behind it. I said   Yes  they made the blueprints  but the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college.  We are the only ones who actually returned the award for          because they didn't believe us  and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions on the Barefoot architects of Tilonia. I asked a forester    high powered  paper qualified expert    I said   What can you build in this place   He had one look at the soil and said   Forget it. No way. Not even worth it. No water  rocky soil.  I was in a bit of a spot. And I said   Okay  I'll go to the old man in village and say  'What should I grow in this spot '  He looked quietly at me and said   You build this  you build this  you put this  and it'll work.  This is what it looks like today. Went to the roof  and all the women said   Clear out. The men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men. This is waterproofing the roof.  It is a bit of jaggery  a bit of urens and a bit of other things I don't know. But it actually doesn't leak. Since       it hasn't leaked. This technology  the women will not share with the men. It's the only college which is fully solar electrified. All the power comes from the sun.    kilowatts of panels on the roof. And everything works off the sun for the next    years. So long as the sun shines  we'll have no problem with power. But the beauty is that is was installed by a priest  a Hindu priest  who's only done eight years of primary schooling    never been to school  never been to college. He knows more about solar than anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed. Food  if you come to the Barefoot College  is solar cooked. But the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women  illiterate women  who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker. It's a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker. Unfortunately  they're almost half German  they're so precise. You'll never find Indian women so precise. Absolutely to the last inch  they can make that cooker. And we have    meals twice a day of solar cooking. We have a dentist    she's a grandmother  illiterate  who's a dentist. She actually looks after the teeth of       children. Barefoot technology  this was         no engineer  no architect thought of it    but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs. Very little water is wasted. All the roofs are connected underground to a         liter tank  and no water is wasted. If we have four years of drought  we still have water on the campus  because we collect rainwater.    percent of children don't go to school  because they have to look after animals    sheep  goats    domestic chores. So we thought of starting a school at night for the children. Because the night schools of Tilonia  over        children have gone through these night schools. Because it's for the convenience of the child  it's not for the convenience of the teacher. And what do we teach in these schools  Democracy  citizenship  how you should measure your land  what you should do if you're arrested  what you should do if your animal is sick. This is what we teach in the night schools. But all the schools are solar lit. Every five years we have an election. Between six to    year old children participate in a democratic process  and they elect a prime minister. The prime minister is    years old. She looks after    goats in the morning  but she's prime minister in the evening. She has a cabinet  a minister of education  a minister for energy  a minister for health. And they actually monitor and supervise     schools for       children. She got the World's Children's Prize five years ago  and she went to Sweden. First time ever going out of her village. Never seen Sweden. Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening. And the Queen of Sweden  who's there  turned to me and said   Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from  She's only    years old  and she's not dazzled by anything.  And the girl  who's on her left  turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye and said   Please tell her I'm the prime minister.  Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high  we use puppetry. Puppets is the way we communicate. You have Jokhim Chacha who is     years old. He is my psychoanalyst. He is my teacher. He's my doctor. He's my lawyer. He's my donor. He actually raises money  solves my disputes. He solves my problems in the village. If there's tension in the village  if attendance at the schools goes down and there's a friction between the teacher and the parent  the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village and says   Shake hands. The attendance must not drop.  These puppets are made out of recycled World Bank reports. So this decentralized  demystified approach of solar electrifying villages  we've covered all over India from Ladakh up to Bhutan    all solar electrified villages by people who have been trained. And we went to Ladakh  and we asked this woman    this  at minus     you have to come out of the roof  because there's no place  it was all snowed up on both sides    and we asked this woman   What was the benefit you had from solar electricity   And she thought for a minute and said   It's the first time I can see my husband's face in winter.  Went to Afghanistan. One lesson we learned in India was men are untrainable. Men are restless  men are ambitious  men are compulsively mobile  and they all want a certificate. All across the globe  you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate. Why  Because they want to leave the village and go to a city  looking for a job. So we came up with a great solution  train grandmothers. What's the best way of communicating in the world today  Television  No. Telegraph  No. Telephone  No. Tell a woman. So we went to Afghanistan for the first time  and we picked three women and said   We want to take them to India.  They said   Impossible. They don't even go out of their rooms  and you want to take them to India.  I said   I'll make a concession. I'll take the husbands along as well.  So I took the husbands along. Of course  the women were much more intelligent than the men. In six months  how do we train these women  Sign language. You don't choose the written word. You don't choose the spoken word. You use sign language. And in six months they can become solar engineers. They go back and solar electrify their own village. This woman went back and solar electrified the first village  set up a workshop    the first village ever to be solar electrified in Afghanistan  was  by the three women. This woman is an extraordinary grandmother.    years old  and she's solar electrified     houses for me in Afghanistan. And they haven't collapsed. She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan and told the head of the department the difference between AC and DC. He didn't know. Those three women have trained    more women and solar electrified     villages in Afghanistan. We went to Africa  and we did the same thing. All these women sitting at one table from eight  nine countries  all chatting to each other  not understanding a word  because they're all speaking a different language. But their body language is great. They're speaking to each other and actually becoming solar engineers. I went to Sierra Leone  and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night    comes across this village. Comes back  goes into the village  says   Well what's the story   They said   These two grandmothers ...    Grandmothers   The minister couldn't believe what was happening.  Where did they go    Went to India and back.  Went straight to the president. He said   Do you know there's a solar electrified village in Sierra Leone   He said   No.  Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day.  What's the story.  So he summoned me and said   Can you train me     grandmothers   I said   I can't  Mr. President. But they will. The grandmothers will.  So he built me the first Barefoot training center in Sierra Leone. And     grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone. Gambia  we went to select a grandmother in Gambia. Went to this village. I knew which woman I would like to take. The community got together and said   Take these two women.  I said   No  I want to take this woman.  They said   Why  She doesn't know the language. You don't know her.  I said   I like the body language. I like the way she speaks.   Difficult husband  not possible.  Called the husband  the husband came  swaggering  politician  mobile in his hand.  Not possible.   Why not    The woman  look how beautiful she is.  I said   Yeah  she is very beautiful.   What happens if she runs off with an Indian man   That was his biggest fear. I said   She'll be happy. She'll ring you up on the mobile.  She went like a grandmother and came back like a tiger. She walked out of the plane and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran. She handled the national press  and she was a star. And when I went back six months later  I said   Where's your husband    Oh  somewhere. It doesn't matter.  Success story. I'll just wind up by saying that I think you don't have to look for solutions outside. Look for solutions within. And listen to people. They have the solutions in front of you. They're all over the world. Don't even worry. Don't listen to the World Bank  listen to the people on the ground. They have all the solutions in the world. I'll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi.  First they ignore you  then they laugh at you  then they fight you  and then you win.  Thank you. Why can't we solve these problems  We know what they are. Something always seems to stop us. Why  I remember March the   th      . The B   iceberg broke off the Ross Ice Shelf. In the newspaper it said  it was all part of a normal process.  A little bit further on in the article it said  a loss that would normally take the ice shelf        years to replace.  That same word   normal   had two different  almost opposite meanings. If we walk into the B   iceberg when we leave here today  we're going to bump into something a thousand feet tall     miles long     miles wide  and it's going to weigh two gigatons. I'm sorry  there's nothing normal about this. And yet I think it's this perspective of us as humans to look at our world through the lens of normal is one of the forces that stops us developing real solutions. Only    days after this  arguably the greatest discovery of the last century occurred. It was the sequencing for the first time of the human genome. This is the code that's in every single one of our    trillion cells that makes us who we are and what we are. And if we just take one cell's worth of this code and unwind it  it's a meter long  two nanometers thick. Two nanometers is    atoms in thickness. And I wondered  what if the answer to some of our biggest problems could be found in the smallest of places  where the difference between what is valuable and what is worthless is merely the addition or subtraction of a few atoms  And what if we could get exquisite control over the essence of energy  the electron  So I started to go around the world finding the best and brightest scientists I could at universities whose collective discoveries have the chance to take us there  and we formed a company to build on their extraordinary ideas. Six and a half years later  a hundred and eighty researchers  they have some amazing developments in the lab  and I will show you three of those today  such that we can stop burning up our planet and instead  we can generate all the energy we need right where we are  cleanly  safely  and cheaply. Think of the space that we spend most of our time. A tremendous amount of energy is coming at us from the sun. We like the light that comes into the room  but in the middle of summer  all that heat is coming into the room that we're trying to keep cool. In winter  exactly the opposite is happening. We're trying to heat up the space that we're in  and all that is trying to get out through the window. Wouldn't it be really great if the window could flick back the heat into the room if we needed it or flick it away before it came in  One of the materials that can do this is a remarkable material  carbon  that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction where graphite is blasted by a vapor  and when the vaporized carbon condenses  it condenses back into a different form  chickenwire rolled up. But this chickenwire carbon  called a carbon nanotube  is a hundred thousand times smaller than the width of one of your hairs. It's a thousand times more conductive than copper. How is that possible  One of the things about working at the nanoscale is things look and act very differently. You think of carbon as black. Carbon at the nanoscale is actually transparent and flexible. And when it's in this form  if I combine it with a polymer and affix it to your window when it's in its colored state  it will reflect away all heat and light  and when it's in its bleached state it will let all the light and heat through and any combination in between. To change its state  by the way  takes two volts from a millisecond pulse. And once you've changed its state  it stays there until you change its state again. As we were working on this incredible discovery at University of Florida  we were told to go down the corridor to visit another scientist  and he was working on a pretty incredible thing. Imagine if we didn't have to rely on artificial lighting to get around at night. We'd have to see at night  right  This lets you do it. It's a nanomaterial  two nanomaterials  a detector and an imager. The total width of it is     times smaller than the width of a decimal place. And it takes all the infrared available at night  converts it into an electron in the space of two small films  and is enabling you to play an image which you can see through. I'm going to show to TEDsters  the first time  this operating. Firstly I'm going to show you the transparency. Transparency is key. It's a film that you can look through. And then I'm going to turn the lights out. And you can see  off a tiny film  incredible clarity. As we were working on this  it dawned on us  this is taking infrared radiation  wavelengths  and converting it into electrons. What if we combined it with this  Suddenly you've converted energy into an electron on a plastic surface that you can stick on your window. But because it's flexible  it can be on any surface whatsoever. The power plant of tomorrow is no power plant. We talked about generating and using. We want to talk about storing energy  and unfortunately the best thing we've got going is something that was developed in France a hundred and fifty years ago  the lead acid battery. In terms of dollars per what's stored  it's simply the best. Knowing that we're not going to put fifty of these in our basements to store our power  we went to a group at University of Texas at Dallas  and we gave them this diagram. It was in actually a diner outside of Dallas Fort Worth Airport. We said   Could you build this   And these scientists  instead of laughing at us  said   Yeah.  And what they built was eBox. EBox is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside  hold it until you need it  and then be able to release it and pass it off. Being able to do that means that I can generate energy cleanly  efficiently and cheaply right where I am. It's my energy. And if I don't need it  I can convert it back up on the window to energy  light  and beam it  line of site  to your place. And for that I do not need an electric grid between us. The grid of tomorrow is no grid  and energy  clean efficient energy  will one day be free. If you do this  you get the last puzzle piece  which is water. Each of us  every day  need just eight glasses of this  because we're human. When we run out of water  as we are in some parts of the world and soon to be in other parts of the world  we're going to have to get this from the sea  and that's going to require us to build desalination plants.    trillion dollars is what we're going to have to spend. These also require tremendous amounts of energy. In fact  it's going to require twice the world's supply of oil to run the pumps to generate the water. We're simply not going to do that. But in a world where energy is freed and transmittable easily and cheaply  we can take any water wherever we are and turn it into whatever we need. I'm glad to be working with incredibly brilliant and kind scientists  no kinder than many of the people in the world  but they have a magic look at the world. And I'm glad to see their discoveries coming out of the lab and into the world. It's been a long time in coming for me.    years ago  I saw a photograph in the paper. It was taken by Kevin Carter who went to the Sudan to document their famine there. I've carried this photograph with me every day since then. It's a picture of a little girl dying of thirst. By any standard this is wrong. It's just wrong. We can do better than this. We should do better than this. And whenever I go round to somebody who says   You know what  you're working on something that's too difficult. It'll never happen. You don't have enough money. You don't have enough time. There's something much more interesting around the corner   I say   Try saying that to her.  That's what I say in my mind. And I just say  thank you   and I go on to the next one. This is why we have to solve our problems  and I know the answer as to how is to be able to get exquisite control over a building block of nature  the stuff of life  the simple electron. Thank you. Good afternoon. If you have followed diplomatic news in the past weeks  you may have heard of a kind of crisis between China and the U.S. regarding cyberattacks against the American company Google. Many things have been said about this. Some people have called a cyberwar what may actually be just a spy operation    and obviously  a quite mishandled one. However  this episode reveals the growing anxiety in the Western world regarding these emerging cyber weapons. It so happens that these weapons are dangerous. They're of a new nature  they could lead the world into a digital conflict that could turn into an armed struggle. These virtual weapons can also destroy the physical world. In       in the middle of the Cold War in Soviet Siberia  a pipeline exploded with a burst of   kilotons  the equivalent of a fourth of the Hiroshima bomb. Now we know today    this was revealed by Thomas Reed  Ronald Reagan's former U.S. Air Force Secretary    this explosion was actually the result of a CIA sabotage operation  in which they had managed to infiltrate the IT management systems of that pipeline. More recently  the U.S. government revealed that in September       more than   million people in the state of Espirito Santo in Brazil were plunged into darkness  victims of a blackmail operation from cyber pirates. Even more worrying for the Americans  in December      the holiest of holies  the IT systems of CENTCOM  the central command managing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  may have been infiltrated by hackers who used these  plain but infected USB keys. And with these keys  they may have been able to get inside CENTCOM's systems  to see and hear everything  and maybe even infect some of them. As a result  the Americans take the threat very seriously. I'll quote General James Cartwright  Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  who says in a report to Congress that cyberattacks could be as powerful as weapons of mass destruction. Moreover  the Americans have decided to spend over    billion dollars in the next five years to build up their cyberwar capabilities. And across the world today  we see a sort of cyber arms race  with cyberwar units built up by countries like North Korea or even Iran. Yet  what you'll never hear from spokespeople from the Pentagon or the French Department of Defence is that the question isn't really who's the enemy  but actually the very nature of cyber weapons. And to understand why  we must look at how  through the ages  military technologies have maintained or destroyed world peace. For example  if we'd had TEDxParis     years ago  we would have talked about the military innovation of the day    the massive Vauban style fortifications    and we could have predicted a period of stability in the world or in Europe. which was indeed the case in Europe between      and     . Similarly  if we'd had this talk    or    years ago  we would have seen how the rise of nuclear weapons  and the threat of mutually assured destruction they imply  prevents a direct fight between the two superpowers. However  if we'd had this talk    years ago  we would have seen how the emergence of new aircraft and tank technologies  which give the advantage to the attacker  make the Blitzkrieg doctrine very credible and thus create the possibility of war in Europe. So military technologies can influence the course of the world  can make or break world peace    and there lies the issue with cyber weapons. The first issue  Imagine a potential enemy announcing they're building a cyberwar unit  but only for their country's defense. Okay  but what distinguishes it from an offensive unit  It gets even more complicated when the doctrines of use become ambiguous. Just   years ago  both the U.S. and France were saying they were investing militarily in cyberspace  strictly to defend their IT systems. But today both countries say the best defense is to attack. And so  they're joining China  whose doctrine of use for    years has been both defensive and offensive. The second issue  Your country could be under cyberattack with entire regions plunged into total darkness  and you may not even know who's attacking you. Cyber weapons have this peculiar feature  they can be used without leaving traces. This gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker  because the defender doesn't know who to fight back against. And if the defender retaliates against the wrong adversary  they risk making one more enemy and ending up diplomatically isolated. This issue isn't just theoretical. In May       Estonia was the victim of cyberattacks  that damaged its communication and banking systems. Estonia accused Russia. But NATO  though it defends Estonia  reacted very prudently. Why  Because NATO couldn't be      sure that the Kremlin was indeed behind these attacks. So to sum up  on the one hand  when a possible enemy announces they're building a cyberwar unit  you don't know whether it's for attack or defense. On the other hand  we know that these weapons give an advantage to attacking. In a major article published in       Professor Robert Jervis of Columbia University in New York described a model to understand how conflicts could arise. In this context  when you don't know if the potential enemy is preparing for defense or attack  and if the weapons give an advantage to attacking  then this environment is most likely to spark a conflict. This is the environment that's being created by cyber weapons today  and historically it was the environment in Europe at the onset of World War I. So cyber weapons are dangerous by nature  but in addition  they're emerging in a much more unstable environment. If you remember the Cold War  it was a very hard game  but a stable one played only by two players  which allowed for some coordination between the two superpowers. Today we're moving to a multipolar world in which coordination is much more complicated  as we have seen at Copenhagen. And this coordination may become even trickier with the introduction of cyber weapons. Why  Because no nation knows for sure whether its neighbor is about to attack. So nations may live under the threat of what Nobel Prize winner Thomas Schelling called the  reciprocal fear of surprise attack   as I don't know if my neighbor is about to attack me or not    I may never know    so I might take the upper hand and attack first. Just last week  in a New York Times article dated January           it was revealed for the first time that officials at the National Security Agency were considering the possibility of preemptive attacks in cases where the U.S. was about to be cyberattacked. And these preemptive attacks might not just remain in cyberspace. In May       General Kevin Chilton  commander of the U.S. nuclear forces  stated that in the event of cyberattacks against the U.S.  all options would be on the table. Cyber weapons do not replace conventional or nuclear weapons    they just add a new layer to the existing system of terror. But in doing so  they also add their own risk of triggering a conflict    as we've just seen  a very important risk    and a risk we may have to confront with a collective security solution which includes all of us  European allies  NATO members  our American friends and allies  our other Western allies  and maybe  by forcing their hand a little  our Russian and Chinese partners. The information technologies Jo l de Rosnay was talking about  which were historically born from military research  are today on the verge of developing an offensive capability of destruction  which could tomorrow  if we're not careful  completely destroy world peace. Thank you. So today  I would like to talk with you about bionics  which is the popular term for the science of replacing part of a living organism with a mechatronic device  or a robot. It is essentially the stuff of life meets machine. And specifically  I'd like to talk with you about how bionics is evolving for people with arm amputations. This is our motivation. Arm amputation causes a huge disability. I mean  the functional impairment is clear. Our hands are amazing instruments. And when you lose one  far less both  it's a lot harder to do the things we physically need to do. There's also a huge emotional impact. And actually  I spend as much of my time in clinic dealing with the emotional adjustment of patients as with the physical disability. And finally  there's a profound social impact. We talk with our hands. We greet with our hands. And we interact with the physical world with our hands. And when they're missing  it's a barrier. Arm amputation is usually caused by trauma  with things like industrial accidents  motor vehicle collisions or  very poignantly  war. There are also some children who are born without arms  called congenital limb deficiency. Unfortunately  we don't do great with upper limb prosthetics. There are two general types. They're called body powered prostheses  which were invented just after the Civil War  refined in World War I and World War II. Here you see a patent for an arm in     . It's not a lot different than the one you see on my patient. They work by harnessing shoulder power. So when you squish your shoulders  they pull on a bicycle cable. And that bicycle cable can open or close a hand or a hook or bend an elbow. And we still use them commonly  because they're very robust and relatively simple devices. The state of the art is what we call myoelectric prostheses. These are motorized devices that are controlled by little electrical signals from your muscle. Every time you contract a muscle  it emits a little electricity that you can record with antennae or electrodes and use that to operate the motorized prosthesis. They work pretty well for people who have just lost their hand  because your hand muscles are still there. You squeeze your hand  these muscles contract. You open it  these muscles contract. So it's intuitive  and it works pretty well. Well how about with higher levels of amputation  Now you've lost your arm above the elbow. You're missing not only these muscles  but your hand and your elbow too. What do you do  Well our patients have to use very code y systems of using just their arm muscles to operate robotic limbs. We have robotic limbs. There are several available on the market  and here you see a few. They contain just a hand that will open and close  a wrist rotator and an elbow. There's no other functions. If they did  how would we tell them what to do  We built our own arm at the Rehab Institute of Chicago where we've added some wrist flexion and shoulder joints to get up to six motors  or six degrees of freedom. And we've had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms that were funded by the U.S. military  using these prototypes  that had up to    different degrees of freedom including movable hands. But at the end of the day  how do we tell these robotic arms what to do  How do we control them  Well we need a neural interface  a way to connect to our nervous system or our thought processes so that it's intuitive  it's natural  like for you and I. Well the body works by starting a motor command in your brain  going down your spinal cord  out the nerves and to your periphery. And your sensation's the exact opposite. You touch yourself  there's a stimulus that comes up those very same nerves back up to your brain. When you lose your arm  that nervous system still works. Those nerves can put out command signals. And if I tap the nerve ending on a World War II vet  he'll still feel his missing hand. So you might say  let's go to the brain and put something in the brain to record signals  or in the end of the peripheral nerve and record them there. And these are very exciting research areas  but it's really  really hard. You have to put in hundreds of microscopic wires to record from little tiny individual neurons    ordinary fibers that put out tiny signals that are microvolts. And it's just too hard to use now and for my patients today. So we developed a different approach. We're using a biological amplifier to amplify these nerve signals    muscles. Muscles will amplify the nerve signals about a thousand fold  so that we can record them from on top of the skin  like you saw earlier. So our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation. Imagine  with somebody who's lost their whole arm  we still have four major nerves that go down your arm. And we take the nerve away from your chest muscle and let these nerves grow into it. Now you think   Close hand   and a little section of your chest contracts. You think   Bend elbow   a different section contracts. And we can use electrodes or antennae to pick that up and tell the arm to move. That's the idea. So this is the first man that we tried it on. His name is Jesse Sullivan. He's just a saint of a man       year old lineman who touched the wrong wire and had both of his arms burnt so badly they had to be amputated at the shoulder. Jesse came to us at the RIC to be fit with these state of the art devices  and here you see them. I'm still using that old technology with a bicycle cable on his right side. And he picks which joint he wants to move with those chin switches. On the left side he's got a modern motorized prosthesis with those three joints  and he operates little pads in his shoulder that he touches to make the arm go. And Jesse's a good crane operator  and he did okay by our standards. He also required a revision surgery on his chest. And that gave us the opportunity to do targeted reinnervation. So my colleague  Dr. Greg Dumanian  did the surgery. First  we cut away the nerve to his own muscle  then we took the arm nerves and just kind of had them shift down onto his chest and closed him up. And after about three months  the nerves grew in a little bit and we could get a twitch. And after six months  the nerves grew in well  and you could see strong contractions. And this is what it looks like. This is what happens when Jesse thinks open and close his hand  or bend or straighten your elbow. You can see the movements on his chest  and those little hash marks are where we put our antennae  or electrodes. And I challenge anybody in the room to make their chest go like this. His brain is thinking about his arm. He has not learned how to do this with the chest. There is not a learning process. That's why it's intuitive. So here's Jesse in our first little test with him. On the left hand side  you see his original prosthesis  and he's using those switches to move little blocks from one box to the other. He's had that arm for about    months  so he's pretty good with it. On the right side  two months after we fit him with his targeted reinnervation prosthesis    which  by the way  is the same physical arm  just programmed a little different    you can see that he's much faster and much smoother as he moves these little blocks. And we're only able to use three of the signals at this time. Then we had one of those little surprises in science. So we're all motivated to get motor commands to drive robotic arms. And after a few months  you touch Jesse on his chest  and he felt his missing hand. His hand sensation grew into his chest again probably because we had also taken away a lot of fat  so the skin was right down to the muscle and deinnervated  if you would  his skin. So you touch Jesse here  he feels his thumb  you touch it here  he feels his pinky. He feels light touch down to one gram of force. He feels hot  cold  sharp  dull  all in his missing hand  or both his hand and his chest  but he can attend to either. So this is really exciting for us  because now we have a portal  a portal  or a way to potentially give back sensation  so that he might feel what he touches with his prosthetic hand. Imagine sensors in the hand coming up and pressing on this new hand skin. So it was very exciting. We've also gone on with what was initially our primary population of people with above the elbow amputations. And here we deinnervate  or cut the nerve away  just from little segments of muscle and leave others alone that give us our up down signals and two others that will give us a hand open and close signal. This was one of our first patients  Chris. You see him with his original device on the left there after eight months of use  and on the right  it is two months. He's about four or five times as fast with this simple little performance metric. All right. So one of the best parts of my job is working with really great patients who are also our research collaborators. And we're fortunate today to have Amanda Kitts come and join us. Please welcome Amanda Kitts. So Amanda  would you please tell us how you lost your arm  Amanda Kitts  Sure. In       I had a car accident. And I was driving home from work  and a truck was coming the opposite direction  came over into my lane  ran over the top of my car and his axle tore my arm off. Todd Kuiken  Okay  so after your amputation  you healed up. And you've got one of these conventional arms. Can you tell us how it worked  AK  Well  it was a little difficult  because all I had to work with was a bicep and a tricep. So for the simple little things like picking something up  I would have to bend my elbow  and then I would have to cocontract to get it to change modes. When I did that  I had to use my bicep to get the hand to close  use my tricep to get it to open  cocontract again to get the elbow to work again. TK  So it was a little slow  AK  A little slow  and it was just hard to work. You had to concentrate a whole lot. TK  Okay  so I think about nine months later that you had the targeted reinnervation surgery  took six more months to have all the reinnervation. Then we fit her with a prosthesis. And how did that work for you  AK  It works good. I was able to use my elbow and my hand simultaneously. I could work them just by my thoughts. So I didn't have to do any of the cocontracting and all that. TK  A little faster  AK  A little faster. And much more easy  much more natural. TK  Okay  this was my goal. For    years  my goal was to let somebody  be  able to use their elbow and hand in an intuitive way and at the same time. And we now have over    patients around the world who have had this surgery  including over a dozen of our wounded warriors in the U.S. armed services. The success rate of the nerve transfers is very high. It's like    percent. Because we're putting a big fat nerve onto a little piece of muscle. And it provides intuitive control. Our functional testing  those little tests  all show that they're a lot quicker and a lot easier. And the most important thing is our patients have appreciated it. So that was all very exciting. But we want to do better. There's a lot of information in those nerve signals  and we wanted to get more. You can move each finger. You can move your thumb  your wrist. Can we get more out of it  So we did some experiments where we saturated our poor patients with zillions of electrodes and then had them try to do two dozen different tasks    from wiggling a finger to moving a whole arm to reaching for something    and recorded this data. And then we used some algorithms that are a lot like speech recognition algorithms  called pattern recognition. See. And here you can see  on Jesse's chest  when he just tried to do three different things  you can see three different patterns. But I can't put in an electrode and say   Go there.  So we collaborated with our colleagues in University of New Brunswick  came up with this algorithm control  which Amanda can now demonstrate. AK  So I have the elbow that goes up and down. I have the wrist rotation that goes    and it can go all the way around. And I have the wrist flexion and extension. And I also have the hand closed and open. TK  Thank you  Amanda. Now this is a research arm  but it's made out of commercial components from here down and a few that I've borrowed from around the world. It's about seven pounds  which is probably about what my arm would weigh if I lost it right here. Obviously  that's heavy for Amanda. And in fact  it feels even heavier  because it's not glued on the same. She's carrying all the weight through harnesses. So the exciting part isn't so much the mechatronics  but the control. So we've developed a small microcomputer that is blinking somewhere behind her back and is operating this all by the way she trains it to use her individual muscle signals. So Amanda  when you first started using this arm  how long did it take to use it  AK  It took just about probably three to four hours to get it to train. I had to hook it up to a computer  so I couldn't just train it anywhere. So if it stopped working  I just had to take it off. So now it's able to train with just this little piece on the back. I can wear it around. If it stops working for some reason  I can retrain it. Takes about a minute. TK  So we're really excited  because now we're getting to a clinically practical device. And that's where our goal is    to have something clinically pragmatic to wear. We've also had Amanda able to use some of our more advanced arms that I showed you earlier. Here's Amanda using an arm made by DEKA Research Corporation. And I believe Dean Kamen presented it at TED a few years ago. So Amanda  you can see  has really good control. It's all the pattern recognition. And it now has a hand that can do different grasps. What we do is have the patient go all the way open and think   What hand grasp pattern do I want   It goes into that mode  and then you can do up to five or six different hand grasps with this hand. Amanda  how many were you able to do with the DEKA arm  AK  I was able to get four. I had the key grip  I had a chuck grip  I had a power grasp and I had a fine pinch. But my favorite one was just when the hand was open  because I work with kids  and so all the time you're clapping and singing  so I was able to do that again  which was really good. TK  That hand's not so good for clapping. AK  Can't clap with this one. TK  All right. So that's exciting on where we may go with the better mechatronics  if we make them good enough to put out on the market and use in a field trial. I want you to watch closely. TK  That's Claudia  and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic. She had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis that then she rubbed over different surfaces  and she could feel different textures of sandpaper  different grits  ribbon cable  as it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin. She said that when she just ran it across the table  it felt like her finger was rocking. So that's an exciting laboratory experiment on how to give back  potentially  some skin sensation. But here's another video that shows some of our challenges. This is Jesse  and he's squeezing a foam toy. And the harder he squeezes    you see a little black thing in the middle that's pushing on his skin proportional to how hard he squeezes. But look at all the electrodes around it. I've got a real estate problem. You're supposed to put a bunch of these things on there  but our little motor's making all kinds of noise right next to my electrodes. So we're really challenged on what we're doing there. The future is bright. We're excited about where we are and a lot of things we want to do. So for example  one is to get rid of my real estate problem and get better signals. We want to develop these little tiny capsules about the size of a piece of risotto that we can put into the muscles and telemeter out the EMG signals  so that it's not worrying about electrode contact. And we can have the real estate open to try more sensation feedback. We want to build a better arm. This arm    they're always made for the   th percentile male    which means they're too big for five eighths of the world. So rather than a super strong or super fast arm  we're making an arm that is    we're starting with  the   th percentile female    that will have a hand that wraps around  opens all the way  two degrees of freedom in the wrist and an elbow. So it'll be the smallest and lightest and the smartest arm ever made. Once we can do it that small  it's a lot easier making them bigger. So those are just some of our goals. And we really appreciate you all being here today. I'd like to tell you a little bit about the dark side  with yesterday's theme. So Amanda came jet lagged  she's using the arm  and everything goes wrong. There was a computer spook  a broken wire  a converter that sparked. We took out a whole circuit in the hotel and just about put on the fire alarm. And none of those problems could I have dealt with  but I have a really bright research team. And thankfully Dr. Annie Simon was with us and worked really hard yesterday to fix it. That's science. And fortunately  it worked today. So thank you very much.
