This is the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam  where I work as a curator. It's my job to make sure the collection stays okay  and that it grows  and basically it means I collect dead animals. Back in       we got a new wing next to the museum. It was made of glass  and this building really helped me to do my job good. The building was a true bird killer. You may know that birds don't understand the concept of glass. They don't see it  so they fly into the windows and get killed. The only thing I had to do was go out  pick them up  and have them stuffed for the collection. And in those days  I developed an ear to identify birds just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass. And it was on June          that I heard a loud bang against the glass that changed my life and ended that of a duck. And this is what I saw when I looked out of the window. This is the dead duck. It flew against the window. It's laying dead on its belly. But next to the dead duck is a live duck  and please pay attention. Both are of the male sex. And then this happened. The live duck mounted the dead duck  and started to copulate. Well  I'm a biologist. I'm an ornithologist. I said   Something's wrong here.  One is dead  one is alive. That must be necrophilia. I look. Both are of the male sex. Homosexual necrophilia. So I     Laughter  I took my camera  I took my notebook  took a chair  and started to observe this behavior. After    minutes    Laughter    I had seen enough  and I got hungry  and I wanted to go home. So I went out  collected the duck  and before I put it in the freezer  I checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex. And here's a rare picture of a duck's penis  so it was indeed of the male sex. It's a rare picture because there are        species of birds and only     possess a penis.  The first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard Anas platyrhynchos  Aves Anatidae   I knew I'd seen something special  but it took me six years to decide to publish it. I mean  it's a nice topic for a birthday party or at the coffee machine  but to share this among your peers is something different. I didn't have the framework. So after six years  my friends and colleagues urged me to publish  so I published  The first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard.  And here's the situation again. A is my office  B is the place where the duck hit the glass  and C is from where I watched it. And here are the ducks again. As you probably know  in science  when you write a kind of special paper  only six or seven people read it. But then something good happened. I got a phone call from a person called Marc Abrahams  and he told me   You've won a prize with your duck paper  the Ig Nobel Prize.  And the Ig Nobel Prize   the Ig Nobel Prize honors research that first makes people laugh  and then makes them think  with the ultimate goal to make more people interested in science. That's a good thing  so I accepted the prize. I went    let me remind you that Marc Abrahams didn't call me from Stockholm. He called me from Cambridge  Massachusetts. So I traveled to Boston  to Cambridge  and I went to this wonderful Ig Nobel Prize ceremony held at Harvard University  and this ceremony is a very nice experience. Real Nobel laureates hand you the prize. That's the first thing. And there are nine other winners who get prizes. Here's one of my fellow winners. That's Charles Paxton who won the      biology prize for his paper   Courtship behavior of ostriches towards humans under farming conditions in Britain.  And I think there are one or two more Ig Nobel Prize winners in this room. Dan  where are you  Dan Ariely  Applause for Dan. Dan won his prize in medicine for demonstrating that high priced fake medicine works better than low priced fake medicine. So here's my one minute of fame  my acceptance speech  and here's the duck. This is its first time on the U.S. West Coast. I'm going to pass it around. Yeah  You can pass it around. Please note it's a museum specimen  but there's no chance you'll get the avian flu. After winning this prize  my life changed. In the first place  people started to send me all kinds of duck related things  and I got a real nice collection. More importantly  people started to send me their observations of remarkable animal behavior  and believe me  if there's an animal misbehaving on this planet  I know about it. This is a moose. It's a moose trying to copulate with a bronze statue of a bison. This is in Montana      . This is a frog that tries to copulate with a goldfish. This is the Netherlands      . These are cane toads in Australia. This is roadkill. Please note that this is necrophilia. It's remarkable  the position. The missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom. These are pigeons in Rotterdam. Barn swallows in Hong Kong      . This is a turkey in Wisconsin on the premises of the Ethan Allen juvenile correctional institution. It took all day  and the prisoners had a great time. So what does this mean  I mean  the question I ask myself  why does this happen in nature  Well  what I concluded from reviewing all these cases is that it is important that this happens only when death is instant and in a dramatic way and in the right position for copulation. At least  I thought it was till I got these slides. And here you see a dead duck. It's been there for three days  and it's laying on its back. So there goes my theory of necrophilia. Another example of the impact of glass buildings on the life of birds. This is Mad Max  a blackbird who lives in Rotterdam. The only thing this bird did was fly against this window from      to       day in and day out. Here he goes  and here's a short video. So what this bird does is fight his own image. He sees an intruder in his territory  and it's coming all the time and he's there  so there is no end to it. And I thought  in the beginning    I studied this bird for a couple of years    that  well  shouldn't the brain of this bird be damaged  It's not. I show you here some slides  some frames from the video  and at the last moment before he hits the glass  he puts his feet in front  and then he bangs against the glass. So I'll conclude to invite you all to Dead Duck Day. That's on June   every year. At five minutes to six in the afternoon  we come together at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam  the duck comes out of the museum  and we try to discuss new ways to prevent birds from colliding with windows. And as you know  or as you may not know  this is one of the major causes of death for birds in the world. In the U.S. alone  a billion birds die in collision with glass buildings. And when it's over  we go to a Chinese restaurant and we have a six course duck dinner. So I hope to see you next year in Rotterdam  the Netherlands  for Dead Duck Day. Thank you. Oh  sorry. May I have my duck back  please  Thank you. Today I'm going to show you an electric vehicle that weighs less than a bicycle  that you can carry with you anywhere  that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in    minutes  and you can run it for       kilometers on about a dollar of electricity. But when I say the word electric vehicle  people think about vehicles. They think about cars and motorcycles and bicycles  and the vehicles that you use every day. But if you come about it from a different perspective  you can create some more interesting  more novel concepts. So we built something. I've got some of the pieces in my pocket here. So this is the motor. This motor has enough power to take you up the hills of San Francisco at about    miles per hour  about    kilometers an hour  and this battery  this battery right here has about six miles of range  or    kilometers  which is enough to cover about half of the car trips in the U.S. alone. But the best part about these components is that we bought them at a toy store. These are from remote control airplanes. And the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently  you can really change things. So today we're going to show you one example of how you can use this. Pay attention to not only how fun this thing is  but also how the portability that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like San Francisco.    Mile Range   Top Speed Near   mph   Uphill Climbing   Regenerative Braking  So we're going to show you what this thing can do. It's really maneuverable. You have a hand held remote  so you can pretty easily control acceleration  braking  go in reverse if you like  also have braking. It's incredible just how light this thing is. I mean  this is something you can pick up and carry with you anywhere you go. So I'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles. This uses    times less energy for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car  which means not only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build  but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use in terms of your transportation. So instead of looking at large amounts of energy needed for each person in this room to get around in a city  now you can look at much smaller amounts and more sustainable transportation. So next time you think about a vehicle  I hope  like us  you're thinking about something new. Thank you. Once upon a time  there was a place called Lesterland. Now Lesterland looks a lot like the United States. Like the United States  it has about     million people  and of that     million people  it turns out         are called Lester. If Matt's in the audience  I just borrowed that  I'll return it in a second  this character from your series. So         are called Lester  which means about .   percent is named Lester. Now  Lesters in Lesterland have this extraordinary power. There are two elections every election cycle in Lesterland. One is called the general election. The other is called the Lester election. And in the general election  it's the citizens who get to vote  but in the Lester election  it's the Lesters who get to vote. And here's the trick. In order to run in the general election  you must do extremely well in the Lester election. You don't necessarily have to win  but you must do extremely well. Now  what can we say about democracy in Lesterland  What we can say  number one  as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United  that people have the ultimate influence over elected officials  because  after all  there is a general election  but only after the Lesters have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in the general election. And number two  obviously  this dependence upon the Lesters is going to produce a subtle  understated  we could say camouflaged  bending to keep the Lesters happy. Okay  so we have a democracy  no doubt  but it's dependent upon the Lesters and dependent upon the people. It has competing dependencies  we could say conflicting dependencies  depending upon who the Lesters are. Okay. That's Lesterland. Now there are three things I want you to see now that I've described Lesterland. Number one  the United States is Lesterland. The United States is Lesterland. The United States also looks like this  also has two elections  one we called the general election  the second we should call the money election. In the general election  it's the citizens who get to vote  if you're over     in some states if you have an ID. In the money election  it's the funders who get to vote  the funders who get to vote  and just like in Lesterland  the trick is  to run in the general election  you must do extremely well in the money election. You don't necessarily have to win. There is Jerry Brown. But you must do extremely well. And here's the key  There are just as few relevant funders in USA land as there are Lesters in Lesterland. Now you say  really  Really .   percent  Well  here are the numbers from       .   percent of America gave     dollars or more to any federal candidate  .   percent gave the maximum amount to any federal candidate  .   percent    the one percent of the one percent    gave        dollars or more to federal candidates  and in this election cycle  my favorite statistic is .       percent   for those of you doing the numbers  you know that's     Americans   gave    percent of the Super PAC money spent in the cycle we have just seen ending. So I'm just a lawyer  I look at this range of numbers  and I say it's fair for me to say it's .   percent who are our relevant funders in America. In this sense  the funders are our Lesters. Now  what can we say about this democracy in USA land  Well  as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United  we could say  of course the people have the ultimate influence over the elected officials. We have a general election  but only after the funders have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in that general election. And number two  obviously  this dependence upon the funders produces a subtle  understated  camouflaged bending to keep the funders happy. Candidates for Congress and members of Congress spend between    and    percent of their time raising money to get back to Congress or to get their party back into power  and the question we need to ask is  what does it do to them  these humans  as they spend their time behind the telephone  calling people they've never met  but calling the tiniest slice of the one percent  As anyone would  as they do this  they develop a sixth sense  a constant awareness about how what they do might affect their ability to raise money. They become  in the words of  The X Files   shape shifters  as they constantly adjust their views in light of what they know will help them to raise money  not on issues one to     but on issues    to      . Leslie Byrne  a Democrat from Virginia  describes that when she went to Congress  she was told by a colleague   Always lean to the green.  Then to clarify  she went on   He was not an environmentalist.   Laughter  So here too we have a democracy  a democracy dependent upon the funders and dependent upon the people  competing dependencies  possibly conflicting dependencies depending upon who the funders are. Okay  the United States is Lesterland  point number one. Here's point number two. The United States is worse than Lesterland  worse than Lesterland because you can imagine in Lesterland if we Lesters got a letter from the government that said   Hey  you get to pick who gets to run in the general election   we would think maybe of a kind of aristocracy of Lesters. You know  there are Lesters from every part of social society. There are rich Lesters  poor Lesters  black Lesters  white Lesters  not many women Lesters  but put that to the side for one second. We have Lesters from everywhere. We could think   What could we do to make Lesterland better   It's at least possible the Lesters would act for the good of Lesterland. But in our land  in this land  in USA land  there are certainly some sweet Lesters out there  many of them in this room here today  but the vast majority of Lesters act for the Lesters  because the shifting coalitions that are comprising the .   percent are not comprising it for the public interest. It's for their private interest. In this sense  the USA is worse than Lesterland. And finally  point number three  Whatever one wants to say about Lesterland  against the background of its history  its traditions  in our land  in USA land  Lesterland is a corruption  a corruption. Now  by corruption I don't mean brown paper bag cash secreted among members of Congress. I don't mean Rod Blagojevich sense of corruption. I don't mean any criminal act. The corruption I'm talking about is perfectly legal. It's a corruption relative to the framers' baseline for this republic. The framers gave us what they called a republic  but by a republic they meant a representative democracy  and by a representative democracy  they meant a government  as Madison put it in Federalist     that would have a branch that would be dependent upon the people alone. So here's the model of government. They have the people and the government with this exclusive dependency  but the problem here is that Congress has evolved a different dependence  no longer a dependence upon the people alone  increasingly a dependence upon the funders. Now this is a dependence too  but it's different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone so long as the funders are not the people. This is a corruption. Now  there's good news and bad news about this corruption. One bit of good news is that it's bipartisan  equal opportunity corruption. It blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about. It blocks the right too  as it makes principled arguments of the right increasingly impossible. So the right wants smaller government. When Al Gore was Vice President  his team had an idea for deregulating a significant portion of the telecommunications industry. The chief policy man took this idea to Capitol Hill  and as he reported back to me  the response was   Hell no  If we deregulate these guys  how are we going to raise money from them   This is a system that's designed to save the status quo  including the status quo of big and invasive government. It works against the left and the right  and that  you might say  is good news. But here's the bad news. It's a pathological  democracy destroying corruption  because in any system where the members are dependent upon the tiniest fraction of us for their election  that means the tiniest number of us  the tiniest  tiniest number of us  can block reform. I know that should have been  like  a rock or something. I can only find cheese. I'm sorry. So there it is. Block reform. Because there is an economy here  an economy of influence  an economy with lobbyists at the center which feeds on polarization. It feeds on dysfunction. The worse that it is for us  the better that it is for this fundraising. Henry David Thoreau   There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root.  This is the root. Okay  now  every single one of you knows this. You couldn't be here if you didn't know this  yet you ignore it. You ignore it. This is an impossible problem. You focus on the possible problems  like eradicating polio from the world  or taking an image of every single street across the globe  or building the first real universal translator  or building a fusion factory in your garage. These are the manageable problems  so you ignore   so you ignore this corruption. But we cannot ignore this corruption anymore. We need a government that works. And not works for the left or the right  but works for the left and the right  the citizens of the left and right  because there is no sensible reform possible until we end this corruption. So I want you to take hold  to grab the issue you care the most about. Climate change is mine  but it might be financial reform or a simpler tax system or inequality. Grab that issue  sit it down in front of you  look straight in its eyes  and tell it there is no Christmas this year. There will never be a Christmas. We will never get your issue solved until we fix this issue first. So it's not that mine is the most important issue. It's not. Yours is the most important issue  but mine is the first issue  the issue we have to solve before we get to fix the issues you care about. No sensible reform  and we cannot afford a world  a future  with no sensible reform. Okay. So how do we do it  Turns out  the analytics here are easy  simple. If the problem is members spending an extraordinary amount of time fundraising from the tiniest slice of America  the solution is to have them spend less time fundraising but fundraise from a wider slice of Americans  to spread it out  to spread the funder influence so that we restore the idea of dependence upon the people alone. And to do this does not require a constitutional amendment  changing the First Amendment. To do this would require a single statute  a statute establishing what we think of as small dollar funded elections  a statute of citizen funded campaigns  and there's any number of these proposals out there  Fair Elections Now Act  the American Anti Corruption Act  an idea in my book that I call the Grant and Franklin Project to give vouchers to people to fund elections  an idea of John Sarbanes called the Grassroots Democracy Act. Each of these would fix this corruption by spreading out the influence of funders to all of us. The analytics are easy here. It's the politics that's hard  indeed impossibly hard  because this reform would shrink K Street  and Capitol Hill  as Congressman Jim Cooper  a Democrat from Tennessee  put it  has become a farm league for K Street  a farm league for K Street. Members and staffers and bureaucrats have an increasingly common business model in their head  a business model focused on their life after government  their life as lobbyists. Fifty percent of the Senate between      and      left to become lobbyists     percent of the House. Those numbers have only gone up  and as United Republic calculated last April  the average increase in salary for those who they tracked was       percent. So it's fair to ask  how is it possible for them to change this  Now I get this skepticism. I get this cynicism. I get this sense of impossibility. But I don't buy it. This is a solvable issue. If you think about the issues our parents tried to solve in the   th century  issues like racism  or sexism  or the issue that we've been fighting in this century  homophobia  those are hard issues. You don't wake up one day no longer a racist. It takes generations to tear that intuition  that DNA  out of the soul of a people. But this is a problem of just incentives  just incentives. Change the incentives  and the behavior changes  and the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems have seen overnight a change in the practice. When Connecticut adopted this system  in the very first year     percent of elected representatives gave up large contributions and took small contributions only. It's solvable  not by being a Democrat  not by being a Republican. It's solvable by being citizens  by being citizens  by being TEDizens. Because if you want to kickstart reform  look  I could kickstart reform at half the price of fixing energy policy  I could give you back a republic. Okay. But even if you're not yet with me  even if you believe this is impossible  what the five years since I spoke at TED has taught me as I've spoken about this issue again and again is  even if you think it's impossible  that is irrelevant. Irrelevant. I spoke at Dartmouth once  and a woman stood up after I spoke  I write in my book  and she said to me   Professor  you've convinced me this is hopeless. Hopeless. There's nothing we can do.  When she said that  I scrambled. I tried to think   How do I respond to that hopelessness  What is that sense of hopelessness   And what hit me was an image of my six year old son. And I imagined a doctor coming to me and saying   Your son has terminal brain cancer  and there's nothing you can do. Nothing you can do.  So would I do nothing  Would I just sit there  Accept it  Okay  nothing I can do  I'm going off to build Google Glass. Of course not. I would do everything I could  and I would do everything I could because this is what love means  that the odds are irrelevant and that you do whatever the hell you can  the odds be damned. And then I saw the obvious link  because even we liberals love this country. And so when the pundits and the politicians say that change is impossible  what this love of country says back is   That's just irrelevant.  We lose something dear  something everyone in this room loves and cherishes  if we lose this republic  and so we act with everything we can to prove these pundits wrong. So here's my question  Do you have that love  Do you have that love  Because if you do  then what the hell are you  what are the hell are we doing  When Ben Franklin was carried from the constitutional convention in September of       he was stopped in the street by a woman who said   Mr. Franklin  what have you wrought   Franklin said   A republic  madam  if you can keep it.  A republic. A representative democracy. A government dependent upon the people alone. We have lost that republic. All of us have to act to get it back. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  This is me building a prototype for six hours straight. This is slave labor to my own project. This is what the DIY and maker movements really look like. And this is an analogy for today's construction and manufacturing world with brute force assembly techniques. And this is exactly why I started studying how to program physical materials to build themselves. But there is another world. Today at the micro  and nanoscales  there's an unprecedented revolution happening. And this is the ability to program physical and biological materials to change shape  change properties and even compute outside of silicon based matter. There's even a software called cadnano that allows us to design three dimensional shapes like nano robots or drug delivery systems and use DNA to self assemble those functional structures. But if we look at the human scale  there's massive problems that aren't being addressed by those nanoscale technologies. If we look at construction and manufacturing  there's major inefficiencies  energy consumption and excessive labor techniques. In infrastructure  let's just take one example. Take piping. In water pipes  we have fixed capacity water pipes that have fixed flow rates  except for expensive pumps and valves. We bury them in the ground. If anything changes    if the environment changes  the ground moves  or demand changes    we have to start from scratch and take them out and replace them. So I'd like to propose that we can combine those two worlds  that we can combine the world of the nanoscale programmable adaptive materials and the built environment. And I don't mean automated machines. I don't just mean smart machines that replace humans. But I mean programmable materials that build themselves. And that's called self assembly  which is a process by which disordered parts build an ordered structure through only local interaction. So what do we need if we want to do this at the human scale  We need a few simple ingredients. The first ingredient is materials and geometry  and that needs to be tightly coupled with the energy source. And you can use passive energy    so heat  shaking  pneumatics  gravity  magnetics. And then you need smartly designed interactions. And those interactions allow for error correction  and they allow the shapes to go from one state to another state. So now I'm going to show you a number of projects that we've built  from one dimensional  two dimensional  three dimensional and even four dimensional systems. So in one dimensional systems    this is a project called the self folding proteins. And the idea is that you take the three dimensional structure of a protein    in this case it's the crambin protein    you take the backbone    so no cross linking  no environmental interactions    and you break that down into a series of components. And then we embed elastic. And when I throw this up into the air and catch it  it has the full three dimensional structure of the protein  all of the intricacies. And this gives us a tangible model of the three dimensional protein and how it folds and all of the intricacies of the geometry. So we can study this as a physical  intuitive model. And we're also translating that into two dimensional systems    so flat sheets that can self fold into three dimensional structures. In three dimensions  we did a project last year at TEDGlobal with Autodesk and Arthur Olson where we looked at autonomous parts    so individual parts not pre connected that can come together on their own. And we built     of these glass beakers. They had different molecular structures inside and different colors that could be mixed and matched. And we gave them away to all the TEDsters. And so these became intuitive models to understand how molecular self assembly works at the human scale. This is the polio virus. You shake it hard and it breaks apart. And then you shake it randomly and it starts to error correct and built the structure on its own. And this is demonstrating that through random energy  we can build non random shapes. We even demonstrated that we can do this at a much larger scale. Last year at TED Long Beach  we built an installation that builds installations. The idea was  could we self assemble furniture scale objects  So we built a large rotating chamber  and people would come up and spin the chamber faster or slower  adding energy to the system and getting an intuitive understanding of how self assembly works and how we could use this as a macroscale construction or manufacturing technique for products. So remember  I said  D. So today for the first time  we're unveiling a new project  which is a collaboration with Stratasys  and it's called  D printing. The idea behind  D printing is that you take multi material  D printing    so you can deposit multiple materials    and you add a new capability  which is transformation  that right off the bed  the parts can transform from one shape to another shape directly on their own. And this is like robotics without wires or motors. So you completely print this part  and it can transform into something else. We also worked with Autodesk on a software they're developing called Project Cyborg. And this allows us to simulate this self assembly behavior and try to optimize which parts are folding when. But most importantly  we can use this same software for the design of nanoscale self assembly systems and human scale self assembly systems. These are parts being printed with multi material properties. Here's the first demonstration. A single strand dipped in water that completely self folds on its own into the letters M I T. I'm biased. This is another part  single strand  dipped in a bigger tank that self folds into a cube  a three dimensional structure  on its own. So no human interaction. And we think this is the first time that a program and transformation has been embedded directly into the materials themselves. And it also might just be the manufacturing technique that allows us to produce more adaptive infrastructure in the future. So I know you're probably thinking  okay  that's cool  but how do we use any of this stuff for the built environment  So I've started a lab at MIT  and it's called the Self Assembly Lab. And we're dedicated to trying to develop programmable materials for the built environment. And we think there's a few key sectors that have fairly near term applications. One of those is in extreme environments. These are scenarios where it's difficult to build  our current construction techniques don't work  it's too large  it's too dangerous  it's expensive  too many parts. And space is a great example of that. We're trying to design new scenarios for space that have fully reconfigurable and self assembly structures that can go from highly functional systems from one to another. Let's go back to infrastructure. In infrastructure  we're working with a company out of Boston called Geosyntec. And we're developing a new paradigm for piping. Imagine if water pipes could expand or contract to change capacity or change flow rate  or maybe even undulate like peristaltics to move the water themselves. So this isn't expensive pumps or valves. This is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own. So I want to remind you today of the harsh realities of assembly in our world. These are complex things built with complex parts that come together in complex ways. So I would like to invite you from whatever industry you're from to join us in reinventing and reimagining the world  how things come together from the nanoscale to the human scale  so that we can go from a world like this to a world that's more like this. Thank you. In two weeks time  that's the ninth anniversary of the day I first stepped out onto that hallowed  Jeopardy  set. I mean  nine years is a long time. And given  Jeopardy's  average demographics  I think what that means is most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead. But not all  a few are still alive. Occasionally I still get recognized at the mall or whatever. And when I do  it's as a bit of a know it all. I think that ship has sailed  it's too late for me. For better or for worse  that's what I'm going to be known as  as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff. And I can't complain about this. I feel like that was always sort of my destiny  although I had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet. If nothing else  you realize very quickly as a teenager  it is not a hit with girls to know Captain Kirk's middle name. And as a result  I was sort of the deeply closeted kind of know it all for many years. But if you go further back  if you look at it  it's all there. I was the kind of kid who was always bugging Mom and Dad with whatever great fact I had just read about    Haley's comet or giant squids or the size of the world's biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was. I now have a    year old of my own who's exactly the same. And I know how deeply annoying it is  so karma does work. And I loved game shows  fascinated with game shows. I remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in      because it had just hit me  as badly as I wanted to go to school  that I was also going to miss  Hollywood Squares  and  Family Feud.  I was going to miss my game shows. And later  in the mid '  s  when  Jeopardy  came back on the air  I remember running home from school every day to watch the show. It was my favorite show  even before it paid for my house. And we lived overseas  we lived in South Korea where my dad was working  where there was only one English language TV channel. There was Armed Forces TV  and if you didn't speak Korean  that's what you were watching. So me and all my friends would run home every day and watch  Jeopardy.  I was always that kind of obsessed trivia kid. I remember being able to play Trivial Pursuit against my parents back in the '  s and holding my own  back when that was a fad. There's a weird sense of mastery you get when you know some bit of boomer trivia that Mom and Dad don't know. You know some Beatles factoid that Dad didn't know. And you think  ah hah  knowledge really is power    the right fact deployed at exactly the right place. I never had a guidance counselor who thought this was a legitimate career path  that thought you could major in trivia or be a professional ex game show contestant. And so I sold out way too young. I didn't try to figure out what one does with that. I studied computers because I heard that was the thing  and I became a computer programmer    not an especially good one  not an especially happy one at the time when I was first on  Jeopardy  in     . But that's what I was doing. And it made it doubly ironic    my computer background    a few years later  I think      or so  when I got another phone call from  Jeopardy  saying   It's early days yet  but IBM tells us they want to build a supercomputer to beat you at 'Jeopardy.' Are you up for this   This was the first I'd heard of it. And of course I said yes  for several reasons. One  because playing  Jeopardy  is a great time. It's fun. It's the most fun you can have with your pants on. And I would do it for nothing. I don't think they know that  luckily  but I would go back and play for Arby's coupons. I just love  Jeopardy   and I always have. And second of all  because I'm a nerdy guy and this seemed like the future. People playing computers on game shows was the kind of thing I always imagined would happen in the future  and now I could be on the stage with it. I was not going to say no. The third reason I said yes is because I was pretty confident that I was going to win. I had taken some artificial intelligence classes. I knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on  Jeopardy.  People don't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program that can read a  Jeopardy  clue in a natural language like English and understand all the double meanings  the puns  the red herrings  unpack the meaning of the clue. The kind of thing that a three  or four year old human  little kid could do  very hard for a computer. And I thought  well this is going to be child's play. Yes  I will come destroy the computer and defend my species. But as the years went on  as IBM started throwing money and manpower and processor speed at this  I started to get occasional updates from them  and I started to get a little more worried. I remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph. It was a scatter chart showing performance on  Jeopardy   tens of thousands of dots representing  Jeopardy  champions up at the top with their performance plotted on number of    I was going to say questions answered  but answers questioned  I guess  clues responded to    versus the accuracy of those answers. So there's a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to. And at first  it was very low. There was no software that could compete at this kind of arena. But then you see the line start to go up. And it's getting very close to what they call the winner's cloud. And I noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart some darker dots  some black dots  that were a different color. And thought  what are these   The black dots in the upper right represent    time 'Jeopardy' champion Ken Jennings.  And I saw this line coming for me. And I realized  this is it. This is what it looks like when the future comes for you. It's not the Terminator's gun sight  it's a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do  the only thing that makes you special  the thing you're best at. And when the game eventually happened about a year later  it was very different than the  Jeopardy  games I'd been used to. We were not playing in L.A. on the regular  Jeopardy  set. Watson does not travel. Watson's actually huge. It's thousands of processors  a terabyte of memory  trillions of bytes of memory. We got to walk through his climate controlled server room. The only other  Jeopardy  contestant to this day I've ever been inside. And so Watson does not travel. You must come to it  you must make the pilgrimage. So me and the other human player wound up at this secret IBM research lab in the middle of these snowy woods in Westchester County to play the computer. And we realized right away that the computer had a big home court advantage. There was a big Watson logo in the middle of the stage. Like you're going to play the Chicago Bulls  and there's the thing in the middle of their court. And the crowd was full of IBM V.P.s and programmers cheering on their little darling  having poured millions of dollars into this hoping against hope that the humans screw up  and holding up  Go Watson  signs and just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right. I think guys had  W A T S O N  written on their bellies in grease paint. If you can imagine computer programmers with the letters  W A T S O N  written on their gut  it's an unpleasant sight. But they were right. They were exactly right. I don't want to spoil it  if you still have this sitting on your DVR  but Watson won handily. And I remember standing there behind the podium as I could hear that little insectoid thumb clicking. It had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer. And you could hear that little tick  tick  tick  tick. And I remember thinking  this is it. I felt obsolete. I felt like a Detroit factory worker of the '  s seeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line. I felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete under this new regime of thinking computers. And it hasn't been the last. If you watch the news  you'll see occasionally    and I see this all the time    that pharmacists now  there's a machine that can fill prescriptions automatically without actually needing a human pharmacist. And a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals because there's software that can sum up case laws and legal briefs and decisions. You don't need human assistants for that anymore. I read the other day about a program where you feed it a box score from a baseball or football game and it spits out a news article as if a human had watched the game and was commenting on it. And obviously these new technologies can't do as clever or creative a job as the humans they're replacing  but they're faster  and crucially  they're much  much cheaper. So it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be. I've read economists saying that  as a result of these new technologies  we'll enter a new golden age of leisure when we'll all have time for the things we really love because all these onerous tasks will be taken over by Watson and his digital brethren. I've heard other people say quite the opposite  that this is yet another tier of the middle class that's having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technology and that this is actually something ominous  something that we should worry about. I'm not an economist myself. All I know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work. And it was friggin' demoralizing. It was terrible. Here's the one thing that I was ever good at  and all it took was IBM pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people and thousands of processors working in parallel and they could do the same thing. They could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national TV  and  I'm sorry  Ken. We don't need you anymore.  And it made me think  what does this mean  if we're going to be able to start outsourcing  not just lower unimportant brain functions. I'm sure many of you remember a distant time when we had to know phone numbers  when we knew our friends' phone numbers. And suddenly there was a machine that did that  and now we don't need to remember that anymore. I have read that there's now actually evidence that the hippocampus  the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships  physically shrinks and atrophies in people who use tools like GPS  because we're not exercising our sense of direction anymore. We're just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard. And as a result  a part of our brain that's supposed to do that kind of stuff gets smaller and dumber. And it made me think  what happens when computers are now better at knowing and remembering stuff than we are  Is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that  Are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less  As somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know  this was a terrifying idea to me. The more I thought about it  I realized  no  it's still important. The things we know are still important. I came to believe there were two advantages that those of us who have these things in our head have over somebody who says   Oh  yeah. I can Google that. Hold on a second.  There's an advantage of volume  and there's an advantage of time. The advantage of volume  first  just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays. There's so much information out there. Being a Renaissance man or woman  that's something that was only possible in the Renaissance. Now it's really not possible to be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor. There's just too much. They say that the scope of human information is now doubling every    months or so  the sum total of human information. That means between now and late       we will generate as much information  in terms of gigabytes  as all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together. It's doubling every    months now. This is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make require the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts. A decision like where do I go to school  What should I major in  Who do I vote for  Do I take this job or that one  These are the decisions that require correct judgments about many different kinds of facts. If we have those facts at our mental fingertips  we're going to be able to make informed decisions. If  on the other hand  we need to look them all up  we may be in trouble. According to a National Geographic survey I just saw  somewhere along the lines of    percent of the people who vote in a U.S. presidential election about issues like foreign policy cannot find Iraq or Afghanistan on a map. If you can't do that first step  are you really going to look up the other thousand facts you're going to need to know to master your knowledge of U.S. foreign policy  Quite probably not. At some point you're just going to be like   You know what  There's too much to know. Screw it.  And you'll make a less informed decision. The other issue is the advantage of time that you have if you have all these things at your fingertips. I always think of the story of a little girl named Tilly Smith. She was a    year old girl from Surrey  England on vacation with her parents a few years ago in Phuket  Thailand. She runs up to them on the beach one morning and says   Mom  Dad  we've got to get off the beach.  And they say   What do you mean  We just got here.  And she said   In Mr. Kearney's geography class last month  he told us that when the tide goes out abruptly out to sea and you see the waves churning way out there  that's the sign of a tsunami  and you need to clear the beach.  What would you do if your    year old daughter came up to you with this  Her parents thought about it  and they finally  to their credit  decided to believe her. They told the lifeguard  they went back to the hotel  and the lifeguard cleared over     people off the beach  luckily  because that was the day of the Boxing Day tsunami  the day after Christmas        that killed thousands of people in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean. But not on that beach  not on Mai Khao Beach  because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before. Now when facts come in handy like that    I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact  one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time    normally something that's easier to see on game shows than in real life. But in this case it happened in real life. And it happens in real life all the time. It's not always a tsunami  often it's a social situation. It's a meeting or job interview or first date or some relationship that gets lubricated because two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge. You say where you're from  and I say   Oh  yeah.  Or your alma mater or your job  and I know just a little something about it  enough to get the ball rolling. People love that shared connection that gets created when somebody knows something about you. It's like they took the time to get to know you before you even met. That's often the advantage of time. And it's not effective if you say   Well  hold on. You're from Fargo  North Dakota. Let me see what comes up. Oh  yeah. Roger Maris was from Fargo.  That doesn't work. That's just annoying. The great   th century British theologian and thinker  friend of Dr. Johnson  Samuel Parr once said   It's always better to know a thing than not to know it.  And if I have lived my life by any kind of creed  it's probably that. I have always believed that the things we know    that knowledge is an absolute good  that the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads are what make us who we are  as individuals and as a species. I don't know if I want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete. I don't want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced by these little bubbles of specialty  so that none of us know about the common associations that used to bind our civilization together. I don't want to be the last trivia know it all sitting on a mountain somewhere  reciting to himself the state capitals and the names of  Simpsons  episodes and the lyrics of Abba songs. I feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all share and that we know without having to outsource it to our devices  to our search engines and our smartphones. In the movies  when computers like Watson start to think  things don't always end well. Those movies are never about beautiful utopias. It's always a terminator or a matrix or an astronaut getting sucked out an airlock in      .  Things always go terribly wrong. And I feel like we're sort of at the point now where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in. This is a question of leadership  because it becomes a question of who leads the future. On the one hand  we can choose between a new golden age where information is more universally available than it's ever been in human history  where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips. And on the other hand  we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia where the machines have taken over and we've all decided it's not important what we know anymore  that knowledge isn't valuable because it's all out there in the cloud  and why would we ever bother learning anything new. Those are the two choices we have. I know which future I would rather be living in. And we can all make that choice. We make that choice by being curious  inquisitive people who like to learn  who don't just say   Well  as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over  I don't have to learn anymore   or  Thank goodness I have my diploma. I'm done learning for a lifetime. I don't have to learn new things anymore.  No  every day we should be striving to learn something new. We should have this unquenchable curiosity for the world around us. That's where the people you see on  Jeopardy  come from. These know it alls  they're not Rainman style savants sitting at home memorizing the phone book. I've met a lot of them. For the most part  they are just normal folks who are universally interested in the world around them  curious about everything  thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject. We can live in one of these two worlds. We can live in a world where our brains  the things that we know  continue to be the thing that makes us special  or a world in which we've outsourced all of that to evil supercomputers from the future like Watson. Ladies and gentlemen  the choice is yours. Thank you very much. So I'll be talking about the success of my campus  the University of Maryland  Baltimore County  UMBC  in educating students of all types  across the arts and humanities and the science and engineering areas. What makes our story especially important is that we have learned so much from a group of students who are typically not at the top of the academic ladder    students of color  students underrepresented in selected areas. And what makes the story especially unique is that we have learned how to help African American students  Latino students  students from low income backgrounds  to become some of the best in the world in science and engineering. And so I begin with a story about my childhood. We all are products of our childhood experiences. It's hard for me to believe that it's been    years since I had the experience of being a ninth grade kid in Birmingham  Alabama  a kid who loved getting A's  a kid who loved math  who loved to read  a kid who would say to the teacher    when the teacher said   Here are    problems   to the class  this little fat kid would say   Give us    more.  And the whole class would say   Shut up  Freeman.  And there was a designated kicker every day. And so I was always asking this question   Well how could we get more kids to really love to learn   And amazingly  one week in church  when I really didn't want to be there and I was in the back of the room being placated by doing math problems  I heard this man say this   If we can get the children to participate in this peaceful demonstration here in Birmingham  we can show America that even children know the difference between right and wrong and that children really do want to get the best possible education.  And I looked up and said   Who is that man   And they said his name was Dr. Martin Luther King. And I said to my parents   I've got to go. I want to go. I want to be a part of this.  And they said   Absolutely not.  And we had a rough go of it. And at that time  quite frankly  you really did not talk back to your parents. And somehow I said   You know  you guys are hypocrites. You make me go to this. You make me listen. The man wants me to go  and now you say no.  And they thought about it all night. And they came into my room the next morning. They had not slept. They had been literally crying and praying and thinking   Will we let our    year old participate in this march and probably have to go to jail   And they decided to do it. And when they came in to tell me  I was at first elated. And then all of a sudden I began thinking about the dogs and the fire hoses  and I got really scared  I really did. And one of the points I make to people all the time is that sometimes when people do things that are courageous  it doesn't really mean that they're that courageous. It simply means that they believe it's important to do it. I wanted a better education. I did not want to have to have hand me down books. I wanted to know that the school I attended not only had good teachers  but the resources we needed. And as a result of that experience  in the middle of the week  while I was there in jail  Dr. King came and said with our parents   What you children do this day will have an impact on children who have not been born.  I recently realized that two thirds of Americans today had not been born at the time of     . And so for them  when they hear about the Children's Crusade in Birmingham  in many ways  if they see it on TV  it's like our looking at the       Lincoln  movie  It's history. And the real question is  what lessons did we learn  Well amazingly  the most important for me was this  That children can be empowered to take ownership of their education. They can be taught to be passionate about wanting to learn and to love the idea of asking questions. And so it is especially significant that the university I now lead  the University of Maryland  Baltimore County  UMBC  was founded the very year I went to jail with Dr. King  in     . And what made that institutional founding especially important is that Maryland is the South  as you know  and  quite frankly  it was the first university in our state founded at a time when students of all races could go there. And so we had black and white students and others who began to attend. And it has been for    years an experiment. The experiment is this  Is it possible to have institutions in our country  universities  where people from all backgrounds can come and learn and learn to work together and learn to become leaders and to support each other in that experience  Now what is especially important about that experience for me is this  We found that we could do a lot in the arts and humanities and social sciences. And so we began to work on that  for years in the '  s. And we produced a number of people in law  all the way to the humanities. We produced great artists. Beckett is our muse. A lot of our students get into theater. It's great work. The problem that we faced was the same problem America continues to face    that students in the sciences and engineering  black students were not succeeding. But when I looked at the data  what I found was that  quite frankly  students in general  large numbers were not making it. And as a result of that  we decided to do something that would help  first of all  the group at the bottom  African American students  and then Hispanic students. And Robert and Jane Meyerhoff  philanthropists  said   We'd like to help.  Robert Meyerhoff said   Why is it that everything I see on TV about black boys  if it's not about basketball  is not positive  I'd like to make a difference  to do something that's positive.  We married those ideas  and we created this Meyerhoff Scholars program. And what is significant about the program is that we learned a number of things. And the question is this  How is it that now we lead the country in producing African Americans who go on to complete Ph.D.'s in science and engineering and M.D. Ph.D.'s  That's a big deal. Give me a hand for that. That's a big deal. That's a big deal. It really is. You see  most people don't realize that it's not just minorities who don't do well in science and engineering. Quite frankly  you're talking about Americans. If you don't know it  while    percent of blacks and Hispanics who begin with a major in science and engineering will actually graduate in science and engineering  only    percent of whites who begin with majors in those areas actually succeed and graduate in those areas  and only    percent of Asian Americans. And so  the real question is  what is the challenge  Well a part of it  of course  is K   . We need to strengthen K   . But the other part has to do with the culture of science and engineering on our campuses. Whether you know it or not  large numbers of students with high SAT's and large numbers of A.P. credits who go to the most prestigious universities in our country begin in pre med or pre engineering and engineering  and they end up changing their majors. And the number one reason  we find  quite frankly  is they did not do well in first year science courses. In fact  we call first year science and engineering  typically around America  weed out courses or barrier courses. How many of you in this audience know somebody who started off in pre med or engineering and changed their major within a year or two  It's an American challenge. Half of you in the room. I know. I know. I know. And what is interesting about that is that so many students are smart and can do it. We need to find ways of making it happen. So what are the four things we did to help minority students that now are helping students in general  Number one  high expectations. It takes an understanding of the academic preparation of students    their grades  the rigor of the course work  their test taking skills  their attitude  the fire in their belly  the passion for the work  to make it. And so doing things to help students prepare to be in that position  very important. But equally important  it takes an understanding that it's hard work that makes the difference. I don't care how smart you are or how smart you think you are. Smart simply means you're ready to learn. You're excited about learning and you want to ask good questions. I. I. Rabi  a Nobel laureate  said that when he was growing up in New York  all of his friends' parents would ask them  What did you learn in school   at the end of a day. And he said  in contrast  his Jewish mother would say   Izzy  did you ask a good question today   And so high expectations have to do with curiosity and encouraging young people to be curious. And as a result of those high expectations  we began to find students we wanted to work with to see what could we do to help them  not simply to survive in science and engineering  but to become the very best  to excel. Interestingly enough  an example  One young man who earned a C in the first course and wanted to go on to med school  we said   We need to have you retake the course  because you need a strong foundation if you're going to move to the next level.  Every foundation makes the difference in the next level. He retook the course. That young man went on to graduate from UMBC  to become the first black to get the M.D. Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. He now works at Harvard. Nice story. Give him a hand for that too. Secondly  it's not about test scores only. Test scores are important  but they're not the most important thing. One young woman had great grades  but test scores were not as high. But she had a factor that was very important. She never missed a day of school  K   . There was fire in that belly. That young woman went on  and she is today with an M.D. Ph.D. from Hopkins. She's on the faculty  tenure track in psychiatry  Ph.D. in neuroscience. She and her adviser have a patent on a second use of Viagra for diabetes patients. Big hand for her. Big hand for her. And so high expectations  very important. Secondly  the idea of building community among the students. You all know that so often in science and engineering we tend to think cutthroat. Students are not taught to work in groups. And that's what we work to do with that group to get them to understand each other  to build trust among them  to support each other  to learn how to ask good questions  but also to learn how to explain concepts with clarity. As you know  it's one thing to earn an A yourself  it's another thing to help someone else do well. And so to feel that sense of responsibility makes all the difference in the world. So building community among those students  very important. Third  the idea of  it takes researchers to produce researchers. Whether you're talking about artists producing artists or you're talking about people getting into the social sciences  whatever the discipline    and especially in science and engineering  as in art  for example    you need scientists to pull the students into the work. And so our students are working in labs regularly. And one great example that you'll appreciate  During a snowstorm in Baltimore several years ago  the guy on our campus with this Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant literally came back to work in his lab after several days  and all these students had refused to leave the lab. They had food they had packed out. They were in the lab working  and they saw the work  not as schoolwork  but as their lives. They knew they were working on AIDS research. They were looking at this amazing protein design. And what was interesting was each one of them focused on that work. And he said   It doesn't get any better than that.  And then finally  if you've got the community and you've got the high expectations and you've got researchers producing researchers  you have to have people who are willing as faculty to get involved with those students  even in the classroom. I'll never forget a faculty member calling the staff and saying   I've got this young man in class  a young black guy  and he seems like he's just not excited about the work. He's not taking notes. We need to talk to him.  What was significant was that the faculty member was observing every student to understand who was really involved and who was not and was saying   Let me see how I can work with them. Let me get the staff to help me out.  It was that connecting. That young man today is actually a faculty member M.D. Ph.D. in neuroengineering at Duke. Give him a big hand for that. And so the significance is that we have now developed this model that is helping us  not only finally with evaluation  assessing what works. And what we learned was that we needed to think about redesigning courses. And so we redesigned chemistry  we redesigned physics. But now we are looking at redesigning the humanities and social sciences. Because so many students are bored in class. Do you know that  Many students  K    and in universities  don't want to just sit there and listen to somebody talk. They need to be engaged. And so we have done    if you look at our website at the Chemistry Discovery Center  you'll see people coming from all over the country to look at how we are redesigning courses  having an emphasis on collaboration  use of technology  using problems out of our biotech companies on our campus  and not giving students the theories  but having them struggle with those theories. And it's working so well that throughout our university system in Maryland  more and more courses are being redesigned. It's called academic innovation. And what does all of that mean  It means that now  not just in science and engineering  we now have programs in the arts  in the humanities  in the social sciences  in teacher education  even particularly for women in I.T. If you don't know it  there's been a    percent decline in the number of women majoring in computer science just since     . And what I'm saying is that what will make the difference will be building community among students  telling young women  young minority students and students in general  you can do this work. And most important  giving them a chance to build that community with faculty pulling them into the work and our assessing what works and what does not work. Most important  if a student has a sense of self  it is amazing how the dreams and the values can make all the difference in the world. When I was a    year old child in the jail in Birmingham  I kept thinking   I wonder what my future could be.  I had no idea that it was possible for this little black boy in Birmingham to one day be president of a university that has students from     countries  where students are not there just to survive  where they love learning  where they enjoy being the best  where they will one day change the world. Aristotle said   Excellence is never an accident. It is the result of high intention  sincere effort and intelligent execution. It represents the wisest option among many alternatives.  And then he said something that gives me goosebumps. He said   Choice  not chance  determines your destiny.  Choice  not chance  determines your destiny  dreams and values. Thank you all very much. So just by a show of hands  how many of you all have a robot at home  Not very many of you. Okay. And actually of those hands  if you don't include Roomba how many of you have a robot at home  So a couple. That's okay. That's the problem that we're trying to solve at Romotive    that I and the other    nerds at Romotive are obsessed with solving. So we really want to build a robot that anyone can use  whether you're eight or   . And as it turns out  that's a really hard problem  because you have to build a small  portable robot that's not only really affordable  but it has to be something that people actually want to take home and have around their kids. This robot can't be creepy or uncanny. He should be friendly and cute. So meet Romo. Romo's a robot that uses a device you already know and love    your iPhone    as his brain. And by leveraging the power of the iPhone's processor  we can create a robot that is wi fi enabled and computer vision capable for     bucks  which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past. When Romo wakes up  he's in creature mode. So he's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face. If I duck down  he'll follow me. He's wary  so he'll keep his eyes on me. If I come over here  he'll turn to follow me. If I come over here     Laughs  He's smart. And if I get too close to him  he gets scared just like any other creature. So in a lot of ways  Romo is like a pet that has a mind of his own. Thanks  little guy. Bless you. And if I want to explore the world    uh oh  Romo's tired    if I want to explore the world with Romo  I can actually connect him from any other iOS device. So here's the iPad. And Romo will actually stream video to this device. So I can see everything that Romo sees  and I get a robot's eye view of the world. Now this is a free app on the App Store  so if any of you guys had this app on your phones  we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together. So I'll show you really quickly  Romo actually    he's streaming video  so you can see me and the entire TED audience. If I get in front of Romo here. And if I want to control him  I can just drive. So I can drive him around  and I can take pictures of you. I've always wanted a picture of a       person TED audience. So I'll snap a picture. And in the same way that you scroll through content on an iPad  I can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device. So there are all of you through Romo's eyes. And finally  because Romo is an extension of me  I can express myself through his emotions. So I can go in and I can say let's make Romo excited. But the most important thing about Romo is that we wanted to create something that was literally completely intuitive. You do not have to teach someone how to drive Romo. In fact  who would like to drive a robot  Okay. Awesome. Here you go. Thank you  Scott. And even cooler  you actually don't have to be in the same geographic location as the robot to control him. So he actually streams two way audio and video between any two smart devices. So you can log in through the browser  and it's kind of like Skype on wheels. So we were talking before about telepresence  and this is a really cool example. You can imagine an eight year old girl  for example  who has an iPhone  and her mom buys her a robot. That girl can take her iPhone  put it on the robot  send an email to Grandma  who lives on the other side of the country. Grandma can log into that robot and play hide and go seek with her granddaughter for fifteen minutes every single night  when otherwise she might only be able to get to see her granddaughter once or twice a year. Thanks  Scott. So those are a couple of the really cool things that Romo can do today. But I just want to finish by talking about something that we're working on in the future. This is actually something that one of our engineers  Dom  built in a weekend. It's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly. This allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code and create any behavior for this robot you want. You do not have to know how to code to create a behavior for Romo. And you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser  which is what you see Romo doing on the left. And then if you have something you like  you can download it onto your robot and execute it in real life  run the program in real life. And then if you have something you're proud of  you can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world. So all of these wi fi enabled robots actually learn from each other. The reason we're so focused on building robots that everyone can train is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal. They change from person to person. So we think that if you're going to have a robot in your home  that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination. So I wish that I could tell you what the future of personal robotics looks like. To be honest  I have no idea. But what we do know is that it isn't    years or    billion dollars or a large humanoid robot away. The future of personal robotics is happening today  and it's going to depend on small  agile robots like Romo and the creativity of people like yourselves. So we can't wait to get you all robots  and we can't wait to see what you build. Thank you. I want to talk a little bit today about labor and work. When we think about how people work  the naive intuition we have is that people are like rats in a maze    that all people care about is money  and the moment we give them money  we can direct them to work one way  we can direct them to work another way. This is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways. And we really have this incredibly simplistic view of why people work  and what the labor market looks like. At the same time  if you think about it  there's all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around us. Think about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing. If you read books of people who climb mountains  difficult mountains  do you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness  No  they are full of misery. In fact  it's all about frostbite and having difficulty walking  and difficulty breathing    cold  challenging circumstances. And if people were just trying to be happy  the moment they would get to the top  they would say   This was a terrible mistake. I'll never do it again.   Instead  let me sit on a beach somewhere drinking mojitos.  But instead  people go down  and after they recover  they go up again. And if you think about mountain climbing as an example  it suggests all kinds of things. It suggests that we care about reaching the end  a peak. It suggests that we care about the fight  about the challenge. It suggests that there's all kinds of other things that motivate us to work or behave in all kinds of ways. And for me personally  I started thinking about this after a student came to visit me. This was one of my students from a few years earlier  and he came one day back to campus. And he told me the following story  He said that for more than two weeks  he was working on a PowerPoint presentation. He was working in a big bank  and this was in preparation for a merger and acquisition. And he was working very hard on this presentation    graphs  tables  information. He stayed late at night every day. And the day before it was due  he sent his PowerPoint presentation to his boss  and his boss wrote him back and said   Nice presentation  but the merger is canceled.  And the guy was deeply depressed. Now at the moment when he was working  he was actually quite happy. Every night he was enjoying his work  he was staying late  he was perfecting this PowerPoint presentation. But knowing that nobody would ever watch it made him quite depressed. So I started thinking about how do we experiment with this idea of the fruits of our labor. And to start with  we created a little experiment in which we gave people Legos  and we asked them to build with Legos. And for some people  we gave them Legos and we said   Hey  would you like to build this Bionicle for three dollars  We'll pay you three dollars for it.  And people said yes  and they built with these Legos. And when they finished  we took it  we put it under the table  and we said   Would you like to build another one  this time for   .     If they said yes  we gave them another one  and when they finished  we asked them   Do you want to build another one   for   .      .    and so on  until at some point people said   No more. It's not worth it for me.  This was what we called the meaningful condition. People built one Bionicle after another. After they finished every one of them  we put them under the table. And we told them that at the end of the experiment  we will take all these Bionicles  we will disassemble them  we will put them back in the boxes  and we will use it for the next participant. There was another condition. This other condition was inspired by David  my student. And this other condition we called the Sisyphic condition. And if you remember the story about Sisyphus  Sisyphus was punished by the gods to push the same rock up a hill  and when he almost got to the end  the rock would roll over  and he would have to start again. And you can think about this as the essence of doing futile work. You can imagine that if he pushed the rock on different hills  at least he would have some sense of progress. Also  if you look at prison movies  sometimes the way that the guards torture the prisoners is to get them to dig a hole  and when the prisoner is finished  they ask him to fill the hole back up and then dig again. There's something about this cyclical version of doing something over and over and over that seems to be particularly demotivating. So in the second condition of this experiment  that's exactly what we did. We asked people   Would you like to build one Bionicle for three dollars   And if they said yes  they built it. Then we asked them   Do you want to build another one for   .     And if they said yes  we gave them a new one  and as they were building it  we took apart the one that they just finished. And when they finished that  we said   Would you like to build another one  this time for    cents less   And if they said yes  we gave them the one that they built and we broke. So this was an endless cycle of them building  and us destroying in front of their eyes. Now what happens when you compare these two conditions  The first thing that happened was that people built many more Bionicles    eleven in the meaningful condition  versus seven in the Sisyphus condition. And by the way  we should point out that this was not big meaning. People were not curing cancer or building bridges. People were building Bionicles for a few cents. And not only that  everybody knew that the Bionicles would be destroyed quite soon. So there was not a real opportunity for big meaning. But even the small meaning made a difference. Now we had another version of this experiment. In this other version of the experiment  we didn't put people in this situation  we just described to them the situation  much as I am describing to you now  and we asked them to predict what the result would be. What happened  People predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude. People who were just given the description of the experiment said that in the meaningful condition  people would probably build one more Bionicle. So people understand that meaning is important  they just don't understand the magnitude of the importance  the extent to which it's important. There was one other piece of data we looked at. If you think about it  there are some people who love Legos  and some people who don't. And you would speculate that the people who love Legos would build more Legos  even for less money  because after all  they get more internal joy from it. And the people who love Legos less would build less Legos because the enjoyment that they derive from it is lower. And that's actually what we found in the meaningful condition. There was a very nice correlation between the love of Legos and the amount of Legos people built. What happened in the Sisyphic condition  In that condition  the correlation was zero    there was no relationship between the love of Legos  and how much people built  which suggests to me that with this manipulation of breaking things in front of people's eyes  we basically crushed any joy that they could get out of this activity. We basically eliminated it. Soon after I finished running this experiment  I went to talk to a big software company in Seattle. I can't tell you who they were  but they were a big company in Seattle. This was a group within the software company that was put in a different building  and they asked them to innovate  and create the next big product for this company. And the week before I showed up  the CEO of this big software company went to that group      engineers  and canceled the project. And I stood there in front of     of the most depressed people I've ever talked to. And I described to them some of these Lego experiments  and they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment. And I asked them  I said   How many of you now show up to work later than you used to   And everybody raised their hand. I said   How many of you now go home earlier than you used to   Everybody raised their hand. I asked them   How many of you now add not so kosher things to your expense reports   And they didn't raise their hands  but they took me out to dinner and showed me what they could do with expense reports. And then I asked them  I said   What could the CEO have done to make you not as depressed   And they came up with all kinds of ideas. They said the CEO could have asked them to present to the whole company about their journey over the last two years and what they decided to do. He could have asked them to think about which aspect of their technology could fit with other parts of the organization. He could have asked them to build some next generation prototypes  and see how they would work. But the thing is that any one of those would require some effort and motivation. And I think the CEO basically did not understand the importance of meaning. If the CEO  just like our participants  thought the essence of meaning is unimportant  then he  wouldn't  care. And he would say   At the moment I directed you in this way  and now that I'm directing you in this way  everything will be okay.  But if you understood how important meaning is  then you would figure out that it's actually important to spend some time  energy and effort in getting people to care more about what they're doing. The next experiment was slightly different. We took a sheet of paper with random letters  and we asked people to find pairs of letters that were identical next to each other. That was the task. People did the first sheet  then we asked if they wanted to do another for a little less money  the next sheet for a little bit less  and so on and so forth. And we had three conditions. In the first condition  people wrote their name on the sheet  found all the pairs of letters  gave it to the experimenter  the experimenter would look at it  scan it from top to bottom  say  Uh huh   and put it on the pile next to them. In the second condition  people did not write their name on it. The experimenter looked at it  took the sheet of paper  did not look at it  did not scan it  and simply put it on the pile of pages. So you take a piece  you just put it on the side. In the third condition  the experimenter got the sheet of paper  and put it directly into a shredder. What happened in those three conditions  In this plot I'm showing you at what pay rate people stopped. So low numbers mean that people worked harder. They worked for much longer. In the acknowledged condition  people worked all the way down to    cents. At    cents per page  they basically stopped these efforts. In the shredder condition  it was twice as much       cents per sheet. And this is basically the result we had before. You shred people's efforts  output    you get them not to be as happy with what they're doing. But I should point out  by the way  that in the shredder condition  people could have cheated. They could have done not so good work  because they realized people were just shredding it. So maybe the first sheet you'd do good work  but then you see nobody is really testing it  so you would do more and more and more. So in fact  in the shredder condition  people could have submitted more work and gotten more money  and put less effort into it. But what about the ignored condition  Would the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged or more like the shredder  or somewhere in the middle  It turns out it was almost like the shredder. Now there's good news and bad news here. The bad news is that ignoring the performance of people is almost as bad as shredding their effort in front of their eyes. Ignoring gets you a whole way out there. The good news is that by simply looking at something that somebody has done  scanning it and saying  Uh huh   that seems to be quite sufficient to dramatically improve people's motivations. So the good news is that adding motivation doesn't seem to be so difficult. The bad news is that eliminating motivations seems to be incredibly easy  and if we don't think about it carefully  we might overdo it. So this is all in terms of negative motivation  or eliminating negative motivation. The next part I want to show you is something about positive motivation. So there is a store in the U.S. called IKEA. And IKEA is a store with kind of okay furniture that takes a long time to assemble. I don't know about you  but every time I assemble one of those  it takes me much longer  it's much more effortful  it's much more confusing  I put things in the wrong way    I can't say I enjoy those pieces. I can't say I enjoy the process. But when I finish it  I seem to like those IKEA pieces of furniture more than I like other ones. And there's an old story about cake mixes. So when they started cake mixes in the '  s  they would take this powder and they would put it in a box  and they would ask housewives to basically pour it in  stir some water in it  mix it  put it in the oven  and    voila    you had cake. But it turns out they were very unpopular. People did not want them  and they thought about all kinds of reasons for that. Maybe the taste was not good  No  the taste was great. What they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved. It was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests and say   Here is my cake.  No  it was somebody else's cake  as if you bought it in the store. It didn't really feel like your own. So what did they do  They took the eggs and the milk out of the powder. Now you had to break the eggs and add them  you had to measure the milk and add it  mixing it. Now it was your cake. Now everything was fine. Now  I think a little bit like the IKEA effect  by getting people to work harder  they actually got them to love what they're doing to a higher degree. So how do we look at this question experimentally  We asked people to build some origami. We gave them instructions on how to create origami  and we gave them a sheet of paper. And these were all novices  and they built something that was really quite ugly    nothing like a frog or a crane. But then we told them   Look  this origami really belongs to us. You worked for us  but I'll tell you what  we'll sell it to you. How much do you want to pay for it   And we measured how much they were willing to pay for it. And we had two types of people  We had the people who built it  and the people who did not build it  and just looked at it as external observers. And what we found was that the builders thought that these were beautiful pieces of origami    and they were willing to pay five times more for them than the people who just evaluated them externally. Now you could say    if you were a builder  do you think  you'd say    Oh  I love this origami  but I know that nobody else would love it   Or  I love this origami  and everybody else will love it as well   Which one of those two is correct  Turns out the builders not only loved the origami more  they thought that everybody would see the world in their view. They thought everybody else would love it more as well. In the next version  we tried to do the IKEA effect. We tried to make it more difficult. So for some people  we gave the same task. For some people  we made it harder by hiding the instructions. At the top of the sheet  we had little diagrams of how you fold origami. For some people  we just eliminated that. So now this was tougher. What happened  Well in an objective way  the origami now was uglier  it was more difficult. Now when we looked at the easy origami  we saw the same thing    builders loved it more  evaluators loved it less. When you looked at the hard instructions  the effect was larger. Why  Because now the builders loved it even more. They put all this extra effort into it. And evaluators  They loved it even less. Because in reality  it was even uglier than the first version. Of course  this tells you something about how we evaluate things. Now think about kids. Imagine I asked you   How much would you sell your kids for   Your memories and associations and so on. Most people would say for a lot  a lot of money. On good days. But imagine this was slightly different. Imagine if you did not have your kids. And one day you went to the park and you met some kids. They were just like your kids  and you played with them for a few hours  and when you were about to leave  the parents said   Hey  by the way  just before you leave  if you're interested  they're for sale.  How much would you pay for them now  Most people say not that much. And this is because our kids are so valuable  not just because of who they are  but because of us  because they are so connected to us  and because of the time and connection. By the way  if you think IKEA instructions are not good  what about the instructions that come with kids  those are really tough. By the way  these are my kids  which  of course  are wonderful and so on. Which comes to tell you one more thing  which is  much like our builders  when they look at the creature of their creation  we don't see that other people don't see things our way. Let me say one last comment. If you think about Adam Smith versus Karl Marx  Adam Smith had a very important notion of efficiency. He gave an example of a pin factory. He said pins have    different steps  and if one person does all    steps  production is very low. But if you get one person to do step one  and one person to do step two and step three and so on  production can increase tremendously. And indeed  this is a great example  and the reason for the Industrial Revolution and efficiency. Karl Marx  on the other hand  said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important in how people think about the connection to what they are doing. And if you do all    steps  you care about the pin. But if you do one step every time  maybe you don't care as much. I think that in the Industrial Revolution  Adam Smith was more correct than Karl Marx. But the reality is that we've switched  and now we're in the knowledge economy. You can ask yourself  what happens in a knowledge economy  Is efficiency still more important than meaning  I think the answer is no. I think that as we move to situations in which people have to decide on their own about how much effort  attention  caring  how connected they feel to it  are they thinking about labor on the way to work  and in the shower and so on  all of a sudden Marx has more things to say to us. So when we think about labor  we usually think about motivation and payment as the same thing  but the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it    meaning  creation  challenges  ownership  identity  pride  etc. The good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them    how do we create our own meaning  pride  motivation  and how do we do it in our workplace  and for the employees    I think we could get people to be both more productive and happier. Thank you very much. I want to share some personal friends and stories with you that I've actually never talked about in public before to help illustrate the idea and the need and the hope for us to reinvent our health care system around the world. Twenty four years ago  I had    a sophomore in college  I had a series of fainting spells. No alcohol was involved. And I ended up in student health  and they ran some labwork and came back right away  and said   Kidney problems.  And before I knew it  I was involved and thrown into this six months of tests and trials and tribulations with six doctors across two hospitals in this clash of medical titans to figure out which one of them was right about what was wrong with me. And I'm sitting in a waiting room some time later for an ultrasound  and all six of these doctors actually show up in the room at once  and I'm like   Uh oh  this is bad news.  And their diagnosis was this  They said   You have two rare kidney diseases that are going to actually destroy your kidneys eventually  you have cancer like cells in your immune system that we need to start treatment right away  and you'll never be eligible for a kidney transplant  and you're not likely to live more than two or three years.  Now  with the gravity of this doomsday diagnosis  it just sucked me in immediately  as if I began preparing myself as a patient to die according to the schedule that they had just given to me  until I met a patient named Verna in a waiting room  who became a dear friend  and she grabbed me one day and took me off to the medical library and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these diseases  and said   Eric  these people who get this are normally in their '  s and '  s. They don't know anything about you. Wake up. Take control of your health and get on with your life.  And I did. Now  these people making these proclamations to me were not bad people. In fact  these professionals were miracle workers  but they're working in a flawed  expensive system that's set up the wrong way. It's dependent on hospitals and clinics for our every care need. It's dependent on specialists who just look at parts of us. It's dependent on guesswork of diagnoses and drug cocktails  and so something either works or you die. And it's dependent on passive patients who just take it and don't ask any questions. Now the problem with this model is that it's unsustainable globally. It's unaffordable globally. We need to invent what I call a personal health system. So what does this personal health system look like  and what new technologies and roles is it going to entail  Now  I'm going to start by actually sharing with you a new friend of mine  Libby  somebody I've become quite attached to over the last six months. This is Libby  or actually  this is an ultrasound image of Libby. This is the kidney transplant I was never supposed to have. Now  this is an image that we shot a couple of weeks ago for today  and you'll notice  on the edge of this image  there's some dark spots there  which was really concerning to me. So we're going to actually do a live exam to sort of see how Libby's doing. This is not a wardrobe malfunction. I have to take my belt off here. Don't you in the front row worry or anything. I'm going to use a device from a company called Mobisante. This is a portable ultrasound. It can plug into a smartphone. It can plug into a tablet. Mobisante is up in Redmond  Washington  and they kindly trained me to actually do this on myself. They're not approved to do this. Patients are not approved to do this. This is a concept demo  so I want to make that clear. All right  I gotta gel up. Now the people in the front row are very nervous.  Laughter  And I want to actually introduce you to Dr. Batiuk  who's another friend of mine. He's up in Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland  Oregon. So let me just make sure. Hey  Dr. Batiuk. Can you hear me okay  And actually  can you see Libby  Thomas Batuik  Hi there  Eric. You look busy. How are you  Eric Dishman  I'm good. I'm just taking my clothes off in front of a few hundred people. It's wonderful. So I just wanted to see  is this the image you need to get  And I know you want to look and see if those spots are still there. TB  Okay. Well let's scan around a little bit here  give me a lay of the land. ED  All right.TB  Okay. Turn it a little bit inside  a little bit toward the middle for me. Okay  that's good. How about up a little bit  Okay  freeze that image. That's a good one for me. ED  All right. Now last week  when I did this  you had me measure that spot to the right. Should I do that again  TB  Yeah  let's do that. ED  All right. This is kind of hard to do with one hand on your belly and one hand on measuring  but I've got it  I think  and I'll save that image and send it to you. So tell me a little bit about what this dark spot means. It's not something I was very happy about. TB  Many people after a kidney transplant will develop a little fluid collection around the kidney. Most of the time it doesn't create any kind of mischief  but it does warrant looking at  so I'm happy we've got an opportunity to look at it today  make sure that it's not growing  it's not creating any problems. Based on the other images we have  I'm really happy how it looks today. ED  All right. Well  I guess we'll double check it when I come in. I've got my six month biopsy in a couple of weeks  and I'm going to let you do that in the clinic  because I don't think I can do that one on myself. TB  Good choice.ED  All right  thanks  Dr. Batiuk. All right. So what you're sort of seeing here is an example of disruptive technologies  of mobile  social and analytic technologies. These are the foundations of what's going to make personal health possible. Now there's really three pillars of this personal health I want to talk to you about now  and it's care anywhere  care networking and care customization. And you just saw a little bit of the first two with my interaction with Dr. Batiuk. So let's start with care anywhere. Humans invented the idea of hospitals and clinics in the     s. It is time to update our thinking. We have got to untether clinicians and patients from the notion of traveling to a special bricks and mortar place for all of our care  because these places are often the wrong tool  and the most expensive tool  for the job. And these are sometimes unsafe places to send our sickest patients  especially in an era of superbugs and hospital acquired infections. And many countries are going to go brickless from the start because they're never going to be able to afford the mega medicalplexes that a lot of the rest of the world has built. Now I personally learned that hospitals can be a very dangerous place at a young age. This was me in third grade. I broke my elbow very seriously  had to have surgery  worried that they were going to actually lose the arm. Recovering from the surgery in the hospital  I get bedsores. Those bedsores become infected  and they give me an antibiotic which I end up being allergic to  and now my whole body breaks out  and now all of those become infected. The longer I stayed in the hospital  the sicker I became  and the more expensive it became  and this happens to millions of people around the world every year. The future of personal health that I'm talking about says care must occur at home as the default model  not in a hospital or clinic. You have to earn your way into those places by being sick enough to use that tool for the job. Now the smartphones that we're already carrying can clearly have diagnostic devices like ultrasounds plugged into them  and a whole array of others  today  and as sensing is built into these  we'll be able to do vital signs monitor and behavioral monitoring like we've never had before. Many of us will have implantables that will actually look real time at what's going on with our blood chemistry and in our proteins right now. Now the software is also getting smarter  right  Think about a coach  an agent online  that's going to help me do safe self care. That same interaction that we just did with the ultrasound will likely have real time image processing  and the device will say   Up  down  left  right  ah  Eric  that's the perfect spot to send that image off to your doctor.  Now  if we've got all these networked devices that are helping us to do care anywhere  it stands to reason that we also need a team to be able to interact with all of that stuff  and that leads to the second pillar I want to talk about  care networking. We have got to go beyond this paradigm of isolated specialists doing parts care to multidisciplinary teams doing person care. Uncoordinated care today is expensive at best  and it is deadly at worst. Eighty percent of medical errors are actually caused by communication and coordination problems amongst medical team members. I had my own heart scare years ago in graduate school  when we're under treatment for the kidney  and suddenly  they're like   Oh  we think you have a heart problem.  And I have these palpitations that are showing up. They put me through five weeks of tests    very expensive  very scary    before the nurse finally notices the piece of the paper  my meds list that I've been carrying to every single appointment  and says   Oh my gosh.  Three different specialists had prescribed three different versions of the same drug to me. I did not have a heart problem. I had an overdose problem. I had a care coordination problem. And this happens to millions of people every year. I want to use technology that we're all working on and making happen to make health care a coordinated team sport. Now this is the most frightening thing to me. Out of all the care I've had in hospitals and clinics around the world  the first time I've ever had a true team based care experience was at Legacy Good Sam these last six months for me to go get this. And this is a picture of my graduation team from Legacy. There's a couple of the folks here. You'll recognize Dr. Batiuk. We just talked to him. Here's Jenny  one of the nurses  Allison  who helped manage the transplant list  and a dozen other people who aren't pictured  a pharmacist  a psychologist  a nutritionist  even a financial counselor  Lisa  who helped us deal with all the insurance hassles. I wept the day I graduated. I should have been happy  because I was so well that I could go back to my normal doctors  but I wept because I was so actually connected to this team. And here's the most important part. The other people in this picture are me and my wife  Ashley. Legacy trained us on how to do care for me at home so that they could offload the hospitals and clinics. That's the only way that the model works. My team is actually working in China on one of these self care models for a project we called Age Friendly Cities. We're trying to help build a social network that can help track and train the care of seniors caring for themselves as well as the care provided by their family members or volunteer community health workers  as well as have an exchange network online  where  for example  I can donate three hours of care a day to your mom  if somebody else can help me with transportation to meals  and we exchange all of that online. The most important point I want to make to you about this is the sacred and somewhat over romanticized doctor patient one on one is a relic of the past. The future of health care is smart teams  and you'd better be on that team for yourself. Now  the last thing that I want to talk to you about is care customization  because if you've got care anywhere and you've got care networking  those are going to go a long way towards improving our health care system  but there's still too much guesswork. Randomized clinical trials were actually invented in      to help invent the drugs that cured tuberculosis  and those are important things  don't get me wrong. These population studies that we've done have created tons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives  but the problem is that health care is treating us as averages  not unique individuals  because at the end of the day  the patient is not the same thing as the population who are studied. That's what's leading to the guesswork. The technologies that are coming  high performance computing  analytics  big data that everyone's talking about  will allow us to build predictive models for each of us as individual patients. And the magic here is  experiment on my avatar in software  not my body in suffering. Now  I've had two examples I want to quickly share with you of this kind of care customization on my own journey. The first was quite simple. I finally realized some years ago that all my medical teams were optimizing my treatment for longevity. It's like a badge of honor to see how long they can get the patient to live. I was optimizing my life for quality of life  and quality of life for me means time in snow. So on my chart  I forced them to put   Patient goal  low doses of drugs over longer periods of time  side effects friendly to skiing.  And I think that's why I achieved longevity. I think that time in snow therapy was as important as the pharmaceuticals that I had. Now the second example of customization    and by the way  you can't customize care if you don't know your own goals  so health care can't know those until you know your own health care goals. But the second example I want to give you is  I happened to be an early guinea pig  and I got very lucky to have my whole genome sequenced. Now it took about two weeks of processing on Intel's highest end servers to make this happen  and another six months of human and computing labor to make sense of all of that data. And at the end of all of that  they said   Yes  those diagnoses of that clash of medical titans all of those years ago were wrong  and we have a better path forward.  The future that Intel's working on now is to figure out how to make that computing for personalized medicine go from months and weeks to even hours  and make this kind of tool available  not just in the mainframes of tier one research hospitals around the world  but in the mainstream    every patient  every clinic with access to whole genome sequencing. And I tell you  this kind of care customization for everything from your goals to your genetics will be the most game changing transformation that we witness in health care during our lifetime. So these three pillars of personal health  care anywhere  care networking  care customization  are happening in pieces now  but this vision will completely fail if we don't step up as caregivers and as patients to take on new roles. It's what my friend Verna said  Wake up and take control of your health. Because at the end of the day these technologies are simply about people caring for other people and ourselves in some powerful new ways. And it's in that spirit that I want to introduce you to one last friend  very quickly. Tracey Gamley stepped up to give me the impossible kidney that I was never supposed to have. So Tracey  just tell us a little bit quickly about what the donor experience was like with you. Tracey Gamley  For me  it was really easy. I only had one night in the hospital. The surgery was done laparoscopically  so I have just five very small scars on my abdomen  and I had four weeks away from work and went back to doing everything I'd done before without any changes. ED  Well  I probably will never get a chance to say this to you in such a large audience ever again. So  thank you  feel likes a really trite word  but thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my life. This TED stage and all of the TED stages are often about celebrating innovation and celebrating new technologies  and I've done that here today  and I've seen amazing things coming from TED speakers  I mean  my gosh  artificial kidneys  even printable kidneys  that are coming. But until such time that these amazing technologies are available to all of us  and even when they are  it's up to us to care for  and even save  one another. I hope you will go out and make personal health happen for yourselves and for everyone. Thanks so much. I'd like you to come back with me for a moment to the   th century  specifically to June         . The British Association for the Advancement of Science is holding its third meeting at the University of Cambridge. It's the first night of the meeting  and a confrontation is about to take place that will change science forever. An elderly  white haired man stands up. The members of the Association are shocked to realize that it's the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge  who hadn't even left his house in years until that day. They're even more shocked by what he says.  You must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers.  Coleridge felt that true philosophers like himself pondered the cosmos from their armchairs. They were not mucking around in the fossil pits or conducting messy experiments with electrical piles like the members of the British Association. The crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly. A young Cambridge scholar named William Whewell stood up and quieted the audience. He politely agreed that an appropriate name for the members of the association did not exist.  If 'philosophers' is taken to be too wide and lofty a term   he said   then  by analogy with 'artist ' we may form 'scientist.'  This was the first time the word scientist was uttered in public  only     years ago. I first found out about this confrontation when I was in graduate school  and it kind of blew me away. I mean  how could the word scientist not have existed until       What were scientists called before  What had changed to make a new name necessary precisely at that moment  Prior to this meeting  those who studied the natural world were talented amateurs. Think of the country clergyman or squire collecting his beetles or fossils  like Charles Darwin  for example  or  the hired help of a nobleman  like Joseph Priestley  who was the literary companion to the Marquis of Lansdowne when he discovered oxygen. After this  they were scientists  professionals with a particular scientific method  goals  societies and funding. Much of this revolution can be traced to four men who met at Cambridge University in       Charles Babbage  John Herschel  Richard Jones and William Whewell. These were brilliant  driven men who accomplished amazing things. Charles Babbage  I think known to most TEDsters  invented the first mechanical calculator and the first prototype of a modern computer. John Herschel mapped the stars of the southern hemisphere  and  in his spare time  co invented photography. I'm sure we could all be that productive without Facebook or Twitter to take up our time. Richard Jones became an important economist who later influenced Karl Marx. And Whewell not only coined the term scientist  as well as the words anode  cathode and ion  but spearheaded international big science with his global research on the tides. In the Cambridge winter of      and       the four met for what they called philosophical breakfasts. They talked about science and the need for a new scientific revolution. They felt science had stagnated since the days of the scientific revolution that had happened in the   th century. It was time for a new revolution  which they pledged to bring about  and what's so amazing about these guys is  not only did they have these grandiose undergraduate dreams  but they actually carried them out  even beyond their wildest dreams. And I'm going to tell you today about four major changes to science these men made. About     years before  Francis Bacon and then  later  Isaac Newton  had proposed an inductive scientific method. Now that's a method that starts from observations and experiments and moves to generalizations about nature called natural laws  which are always subject to revision or rejection should new evidence arise. However  in       David Ricardo muddied the waters by arguing that the science of economics should use a different  deductive method. The problem was that an influential group at Oxford began arguing that because it worked so well in economics  this deductive method ought to be applied to the natural sciences too. The members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed. They wrote books and articles promoting inductive method in all the sciences that were widely read by natural philosophers  university students and members of the public. Reading one of Herschel's books was such a watershed moment for Charles Darwin that he would later say   Scarcely anything in my life made so deep an impression on me. It made me wish to add my might to the accumulated store of natural knowledge.  It also shaped Darwin's scientific method  as well as that used by his peers.  Science for the public good  Previously  it was believed that scientific knowledge ought to be used for the good of the king or queen  or for one's own personal gain. For example  ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports. Harbormasters would gather this knowledge and sell it to the ship captains. The philosophical breakfast club changed that  working together. Whewell's worldwide study of the tides resulted in public tide tables and tidal maps that freely provided the harbormasters' knowledge to all ship captains. Herschel helped by making tidal observations off the coast of South Africa  and  as he complained to Whewell  he was knocked off the docks during a violent high tide for his trouble. The four men really helped each other in every way. They also relentlessly lobbied the British government for the money to build Babbage's engines because they believed these engines would have a huge practical impact on society. In the days before pocket calculators  the numbers that most professionals needed    bankers  insurance agents  ship captains  engineers   were to be found in lookup books like this  filled with tables of figures. These tables were calculated using a fixed procedure over and over by part time workers known as    and this is amazing    computers  but these calculations were really difficult. I mean  this nautical almanac published the lunar differences for every month of the year. Each month required       calculations  so these tables were filled with mistakes. Babbage's difference engine was the first mechanical calculator devised to accurately compute any of these tables. Two models of his engine were built in the last    years by a team from the Science Museum of London using his own plans. This is the one now at the Computer History Museum in California  and it calculates accurately. It actually works. Later  Babbage's analytical engine was the first mechanical computer in the modern sense. It had a separate memory and central processor. It was capable of iteration  conditional branching and parallel processing  and it was programmable using punched cards  an idea Babbage took from Jacquard's loom. Tragically  Babbage's engines never were built in his day because most people thought that non human computers would have no usefulness for the public.  New scientific institutions  Founded in Bacon's time  the Royal Society of London was the foremost scientific society in England and even in the rest of the world. By the   th century  it had become a kind of gentleman's club populated mainly by antiquarians  literary men and the nobility. The members of the philosophical breakfast club helped form a number of new scientific societies  including the British Association. These new societies required that members be active researchers publishing their results. They reinstated the tradition of the Q A after scientific papers were read  which had been discontinued by the Royal Society as being ungentlemanly. And for the first time  they gave women a foot in the door of science. Members were encouraged to bring their wives  daughters and sisters to the meetings of the British Association  and while the women were expected to attend only the public lectures and the social events like this one  they began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well. The British Association would later be the first of the major national science organizations in the world to admit women as full members.  External funding for science  Up to the   th century  natural philosophers were expected to pay for their own equipment and supplies. Occasionally  there were prizes  such as that given to John Harrison in the   th century  for solving the so called longitude problem  but prizes were only given after the fact  when they were given at all. On the advice of the philosophical breakfast club  the British Association began to use the extra money generated by its meetings to give grants for research in astronomy  the tides  fossil fish  shipbuilding  and many other areas. These grants not only allowed less wealthy men to conduct research  but they also encouraged thinking outside the box  rather than just trying to solve one pre set question. Eventually  the Royal Society and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit  and this has become    fortunately it's become    a major part of the scientific landscape today. So the philosophical breakfast club helped invent the modern scientist. That's the heroic part of their story. There's a flip side as well. They did not foresee at least one consequence of their revolution. They would have been deeply dismayed by today's disjunction between science and the rest of culture. It's shocking to realize that only    percent of American adults have even a very basic level of science literacy  and this was tested by asking simple questions like   Did humans and dinosaurs inhabit the Earth at the same time   and  What proportion of the Earth is covered in water   Once scientists became members of a professional group  they were slowly walled off from the rest of us. This is the unintended consequence of the revolution that started with our four friends. Charles Darwin said   I sometimes think that general and popular treatises are almost as important for the progress of science as original work.  In fact   Origin of Species  was written for a general and popular audience  and was widely read when it first appeared. Darwin knew what we seem to have forgotten  that science is not only for scientists. Thank you. Let's talk dirty. A few years ago  oddly enough  I needed the bathroom  and I found one  a public bathroom  and I went into the stall  and I prepared to do what I'd done most of my life  use the toilet  flush the toilet  forget about the toilet. And for some reason that day  instead  I asked myself a question  and it was  where does this stuff go  And with that question  I found myself plunged into the world of sanitation    there's more coming     Laughter    sanitation  toilets and poop  and I have yet to emerge. And that's because it's such an enraging  yet engaging place to be. To go back to that toilet  it wasn't a particularly fancy toilet  it wasn't as nice as this one from the World Toilet Organization. That's the other WTO.  Laughter  But it had a lockable door  it had privacy  it had water  it had soap so I could wash my hands  and I did because I'm a woman  and we do that. But that day  when I asked that question  I learned something  and that was that I'd grown up thinking that a toilet like that was my right  when in fact it's a privilege.  .  billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet. They don't have a bucket or a box. Forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet. And they have to do what this little boy is doing by the side of the Mumbai Airport expressway  which is called open defecation  or poo pooing in the open. And he does that every day  and every day  probably  that guy in the picture walks on by  because he sees that little boy  but he doesn't see him. But he should  because the problem with all that poop lying around is that poop carries passengers. Fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit. All those things  the eggs  the cysts  the bacteria  the viruses  all those can travel in one gram of human feces. How  Well  that little boy will not have washed his hands. He's barefoot. He'll run back into his house  and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet. In what I call the flushed and plumbed world that most of us in this room are lucky to live in  the most common symptoms associated with those diseases  diarrhea  is now a bit of a joke. It's the runs  the Hershey squirts  the squits. Where I come from  we call it Delhi belly  as a legacy of empire. But if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a leading photo image agency  this is the picture that you come up with. Still not sure about the bikini. And here's another image of diarrhea. This is Marie Saylee  nine months old. You can't see her  because she's buried under that green grass in a little village in Liberia  because she died in three days from diarrhea    the Hershey squirts  the runs  a joke. And that's her dad. But she wasn't alone that day  because       other children died of diarrhea  and they do every day. Diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide  and you've probably been asked to care about things like HIV AIDS or T.B. or measles  but diarrhea kills more children than all those three things put together. It's a very potent weapon of mass destruction. And the cost to the world is immense      billion dollars lost every year on the losses to poor sanitation. These are cholera beds in Haiti. You'll have heard of cholera  but we don't hear about diarrhea. It gets a fraction of the attention and funding given to any of those other diseases. But we know how to fix this. We know  because in the mid   th century  wonderful Victorian engineers installed systems of sewers and wastewater treatment and the flush toilet  and disease dropped dramatically. Child mortality dropped by the most it had ever dropped in history. The flush toilet was voted the best medical advance of the last     years by the readers of the British Medical Journal  and they were choosing over the Pill  anesthesia  and surgery. It's a wonderful waste disposal device. But I think that it's so good   it doesn't smell  we can put it in our house  we can lock it behind a door   and I think we've locked it out of conversation too. We don't have a neutral word for it. Poop's not particularly adequate. Shit offends people. Feces is too medical. Because I can't explain otherwise  when I look at the figures  what's going on. We know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation  but if you look at the budgets of countries  developing and developed  you'll think there's something wrong with the math  because you'll expect absurdities like Pakistan spending    times more on its military than it does on water and sanitation  even though         children die of diarrhea in Pakistan every year. But then you look at that already minuscule water and sanitation budget  and    to    percent of it will go on clean water supply  which is great  we all need water. No one's going to refuse clean water. But the humble latrine  or flush toilet  reduces disease by twice as much as just putting in clean water. Think about it. That little boy who's running back into his house  he may have a nice  clean fresh water supply  but he's got dirty hands that he's going to contaminate his water supply with. And I think that the real waste of human waste is that we are wasting it as a resource and as an incredible trigger for development  because these are a few things that toilets and poop itself can do for us. So a toilet can put a girl back in school. Twenty five percent of girls in India drop out of school because they have no adequate sanitation. They've been used to sitting through lessons for years and years holding it in. We've all done that  but they do it every day  and when they hit puberty and they start menstruating  it just gets too much. And I understand that. Who can blame them  So if you met an educationalist and said   I can improve education attendance rates by    percent with just one simple thing   you'd make a lot of friends in education. That's not the only thing it can do for you. Poop can cook your dinner. It's got nutrients in it. We ingest nutrients. We excrete nutrients as well. We don't keep them all. In Rwanda  they are now getting    percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the contents of prisoners' bowels. So these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in Butare. They're genocidal inmates  most of them  and they're stirring the contents of their own latrines  because if you put poop in a sealed environment  in a tank  pretty much like a stomach  then  pretty much like a stomach  it gives off gas  and you can cook with it. And you might think it's just good karma to see these guys stirring shit  but it's also good economic sense  because they're saving a million dollars a year. They're cutting down on deforestation  and they've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible  infinite and free at the point of production. It's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives. Here's a woman who's about to get a dose of the brown stuff in those syringes  which is what you think it is  except not quite  because it's actually donated. There is now a new career path called stool donor. It's like the new sperm donor. Because she has been suffering from a superbug called C. diff  and it's resistant to antibiotics in many cases. She's been suffering for years. She gets a dose of healthy human feces  and the cure rate for this procedure is    percent. It's astonishing  but hardly anyone is still doing it. Maybe it's the ick factor. That's okay  because there's a team of research scientists in Canada who have now created a stool sample  a fake stool sample which is called RePOOPulate. So you'd be thinking by now  okay  the solution's simple  we give everyone a toilet. And this is where it gets really interesting  because it's not that simple  because we are not simple. So the really interesting  exciting work    this is the engaging bit    in sanitation is that we need to understand human psychology. We need to understand software as well as just giving someone hardware. They've found in many developing countries that governments have gone in and given out free latrines and gone back a few years later and found that they've got lots of new goat sheds or temples or spare rooms with their owners happily walking past them and going over to the open defecating ground. So the idea is to manipulate human emotion. It's been done for decades. The soap companies did it in the early   th century. They tried selling soap as healthy. No one bought it. They tried selling it as sexy. Everyone bought it. In India now there's a campaign which persuades young brides not to marry into families that don't have a toilet. It's called  No Loo  No I Do.  And in case you think that poster's just propaganda  here's Priyanka     years old. I met her last October in India  and she grew up in a conservative environment. She grew up in a rural village in a poor area of India  and she was engaged at     and then at    or so  she moved into her in law's house. And she was horrified to get there and find that they didn't have a toilet. She'd grown up with a latrine. It was no big deal  but it was a latrine. And the first night she was there  she was told that at   o'clock in the morning    her mother in law got her up  told her to go outside and go and do it in the dark in the open. And she was scared. She was scared of drunks hanging around. She was scared of snakes. She was scared of rape. After three days  she did an unthinkable thing. She left. And if you know anything about rural India  you'll know that's an unspeakably courageous thing to do. But not just that. She got her toilet  and now she goes around all the other villages in India persuading other women to do the same thing. It's what I call social contagion  and it's really powerful and really exciting. Another version of this  another village in India near where Priyanka lives is this village  called Lakara  and about a year ago  it had no toilets whatsoever. Kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera. Some visitors came  using various behavioral change tricks like putting out a plate of food and a plate of shit and watching the flies go one to the other. Somehow  people who'd been thinking that what they were doing was not disgusting at all suddenly thought   Oops.  Not only that  but they were ingesting their neighbors' shit. That's what really made them change their behavior. So this woman  this boy's mother installed this latrine in a few hours. Her entire life  she'd been using the banana field behind  but she installed the latrine in a few hours. It cost nothing. It's going to save that boy's life. So when I get despondent about the state of sanitation  even though these are pretty exciting times because we've got the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation reinventing the toilet  which is great  we've got Matt Damon going on bathroom strike  which is great for humanity  very bad for his colon. But there are things to worry about. It's the most off track Millennium Development Goal. It's about    or so years off track. We're not going to meet targets  providing people with sanitation at this rate. So when I get sad about sanitation  I think of Japan  because Japan    years ago was a nation of people who used pit latrines and wiped with sticks  and now it's a nation of what are called Woshurettos  washlet toilets. They have in built bidet nozzles for a lovely  hands free cleaning experience  and they have various other features like a heated seat and an automatic lid raising device which is known as the  marriage saver.  But most importantly  what they have done in Japan  which I find so inspirational  is they've brought the toilet out from behind the locked door. They've made it conversational. People go out and upgrade their toilet. They talk about it. They've sanitized it. I hope that we can do that. It's not a difficult thing to do. All we really need to do is look at this issue as the urgent  shameful issue that it is. And don't think that it's just in the poor world that things are wrong. Our sewers are crumbling. Things are going wrong here too. The solution to all of this is pretty easy. I'm going to make your lives easy this afternoon and just ask you to do one thing  and that's to go out  protest  speak about the unspeakable  and talk shit. Thank you. So let's start with some good news  and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases  Let's start with leukemia  acute lymphoblastic leukemia  ALL  the most common cancer of children. When I was a student  the mortality rate was about    percent. Today  some        years later  we're talking about a mortality rate that's reduced by    percent. Six thousand children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured. If you want the really big numbers  look at these numbers for heart disease. Heart disease used to be the biggest killer  particularly for men in their   s. Today  we've seen a    percent reduction in mortality from heart disease    remarkably   .  million deaths averted every year. AIDS  incredibly  has just been named  in the past month  a chronic disease  meaning that a    year old who becomes infected with HIV is expected not to live weeks  months  or a couple of years  as we said only a decade ago  but is thought to live decades  probably to die in his '  s or '  s from other causes altogether. These are just remarkable  remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers. And one in particular that you probably wouldn't know about  stroke  which has been  along with heart disease  one of the biggest killers in this country  is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergency room within three hours of the onset  some    percent of them will be able to leave the hospital without any disability whatsoever. Remarkable stories  good news stories  all of which boil down to understanding something about the diseases that has allowed us to detect early and intervene early. Early detection  early intervention  that's the story for these successes. Unfortunately  the news is not all good. Let's talk about one other story which has to do with suicide. Now this is  of course  not a disease  per se. It's a condition  or it's a situation that leads to mortality. What you may not realize is just how prevalent it is. There are        suicides each year in the United States. That means one about every    minutes. Third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of    and   . It's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatalities in this country. Now  when we talk about suicide  there is also a medical contribution here  because    percent of suicides are related to a mental illness  depression  bipolar disorder  schizophrenia  anorexia  borderline personality. There's a long list of disorders that contribute  and as I mentioned before  often early in life. But it's not just the mortality from these disorders. It's also morbidity. If you look at disability  as measured by the World Health Organization with something they call the Disability Adjusted Life Years  it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist  except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes  and as you can see  virtually    percent of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders  neuropsychiatric syndromes. You're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense. I mean  cancer seems far more serious. Heart disease seems far more serious. But you can see actually they are further down this list  and that's because we're talking here about disability. What drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression  Why are they number one here  Well  there are probably three reasons. One is that they're highly prevalent. About one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime. A second  of course  is that  for some people  these become truly disabling  and it's about four to five percent  perhaps one in   . But what really drives these numbers  this high morbidity  and to some extent the high mortality  is the fact that these start very early in life. Fifty percent will have onset by age        percent by age     a picture that is very different than what one would see if you're talking about cancer or heart disease  diabetes  hypertension    most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality. These are  indeed  the chronic disorders of young people. Now  I started by telling you that there were some good news stories. This is obviously not one of them. This is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult  and in a sense this is a kind of confession for me. My job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders. I work for the federal government. Actually  I work for you. You pay my salary. And maybe at this point  when you know what I do  or maybe what I've failed to do  you'll think that I probably ought to be fired  and I could certainly understand that. But what I want to suggest  and the reason I'm here is to tell you that I think we're about to be in a very different world as we think about these illnesses. What I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders  diseases of the mind. That's actually becoming a rather unpopular term these days  and people feel that  for whatever reason  it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior. Fair enough. They are disorders of behavior  and they are disorders of the mind. But what I want to suggest to you is that both of those terms  which have been in play for a century or more  are actually now impediments to progress  that what we need conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders. Now  for some of you  you're going to say   Oh my goodness  here we go again. We're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we're going to hear about drugs or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules  or maybe into some sort of very flat  unidimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia. When we talk about the brain  it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic. It depends  of course  on what scale or what scope you want to think about  but this is an organ of surreal complexity  and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it  whether you're thinking about the     billion neurons that are in the cortex or the     trillion synapses that make up all the connections. We have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports our own minds. It's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough to understand itself. In a sense  it actually makes you feel that when you're in the safe zone of studying behavior or cognition  something you can observe  that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex  mysterious organ that we're beginning to try to understand. Now  already in the case of the brain disorders that I've been talking to you about  depression  obsessive compulsive disorder  post traumatic stress disorder  while we don't have an in depth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses  we have been able to already identify some of the connectional differences  or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders. We call this the human connectome  and you can think about the connectome sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain. You'll hear more about this in a few minutes. The important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders  the one in five of us who struggle in some way  you find that there's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired  but there are some predictable patterns  and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders. It's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease where you have a bombed out part of your cortex. Here we're talking about traffic jams  or sometimes detours  or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions. You could  if you want  compare this to  on the one hand  a myocardial infarction  a heart attack  where you have dead tissue in the heart  versus an arrhythmia  where the organ simply isn't functioning because of the communication problems within it. Either one would kill you  in only one of them will you find a major lesion. As we think about this  probably it's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder  and that would be schizophrenia  because I think that's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters. These are scans from Judy Rapoport and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia  and you can see already in the top there's areas that are red or orange  yellow  are places where there's less gray matter  and as they followed them over five years  comparing them to age match controls  you can see that  particularly in areas like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus  there's a profound loss of gray matter. And it's important  if you try to model this  you can think about normal development as a loss of cortical mass  loss of cortical gray matter  and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that mark  and at some point  when you overshoot  you cross a threshold  and it's that threshold where we say  this is a person who has this disease  because they have the behavioral symptoms of hallucinations and delusions. That's something we can observe. But look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold. They've crossed a brain threshold much earlier  that perhaps not at age    or     but even by age    or    you can begin to see the trajectory for development is quite different at the level of the brain  not at the level of behavior. Why does this matter  Well first because  for brain disorders  behavior is the last thing to change. We know that for Alzheimer's  for Parkinson's  for Huntington's. There are changes in the brain a decade or more before you see the first signs of a behavioral change. The tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier  long before the symptoms emerge. But most important  go back to where we started. The good news stories in medicine are early detection  early intervention. If we waited until the heart attack  we would be sacrificing  .  million lives every year in this country to heart disease. That is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders  brain circuit disorders  has a behavioral disorder. We wait until the behavior becomes manifest. That's not early detection. That's not early intervention. Now to be clear  we're not quite ready to do this. We don't have all the facts. We don't actually even know what the tools will be  nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior emerges as different. But this tells us how we need to think about it  and where we need to go. Are we going to be there soon  I think that this is something that will happen over the course of the next few years  but I'd like to finish with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen by somebody who's thought a lot about changes in concepts and changes in technology.  We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next   .     Bill Gates. Thanks very much. One year ago  I rented a car in Jerusalem to go find a man I'd never met but who had changed my life. I didn't have a phone number to call to say I was coming. I didn't have an exact address  but I knew his name  Abed  I knew that he lived in a town of         Kfar Kara  and I knew that     years before  just outside this holy city  he broke my neck. And so  on an overcast morning in January  I headed north off in a silver Chevy to find a man and some peace. The road dropped and I exited Jerusalem. I then rounded the very bend where his blue truck  heavy with four tons of floor tiles  had borne down with great speed onto the back left corner of the minibus where I sat. I was then    years old. I'd grown five inches and done some        pushups in eight months  and the night before the crash  I delighted in my new body  playing basketball with friends into the wee hours of a May morning. I palmed the ball in my large right hand  and when that hand reached the rim  I felt invincible. I was off in the bus to get the pizza I'd won on the court. I didn't see Abed coming. From my seat  I was looking up at a stone town on a hilltop  bright in the noontime sun  when from behind there was a great bang  as loud and violent as a bomb. My head snapped back over my red seat. My eardrum blew. My shoes flew off. I flew too  my head bobbing on broken bones  and when I landed  I was a quadriplegic. Over the coming months  I learned to breathe on my own  then to sit and to stand and to walk  but my body was now divided vertically. I was a hemiplegic  and back home in New York  I used a wheelchair for four years  all through college. College ended and I returned to Jerusalem for a year. There I rose from my chair for good  I leaned on my cane  and I looked back  finding all from my fellow passengers in the bus to photographs of the crash  and when I saw this photograph  I didn't see a bloody and unmoving body. I saw the healthy bulk of a left deltoid  and I mourned that it was lost  mourned all I had not yet done  but was now impossible. It was then I read the testimony that Abed gave the morning after the crash  of driving down the right lane of a highway toward Jerusalem. Reading his words  I welled with anger. It was the first time I'd felt anger toward this man  and it came from magical thinking. On this xeroxed piece of paper  the crash had not yet happened. Abed could still turn his wheel left so that I would see him whoosh by out my window and I would remain whole.  Be careful  Abed  look out. Slow down.  But Abed did not slow  and on that xeroxed piece of paper  my neck again broke  and again  I was left without anger. I decided to find Abed  and when I finally did  he responded to my Hebrew hello which such nonchalance  it seemed he'd been awaiting my phone call. And maybe he had. I didn't mention to Abed his prior driving record       violations by the age of     the last  his not shifting his truck into a low gear on that May day   and I didn't mention my prior record    the quadriplegia and the catheters  the insecurity and the loss   and when Abed went on about how hurt he was in the crash  I didn't say that I knew from the police report that he'd escaped serious injury. I said I wanted to meet. Abed said that I should call back in a few weeks  and when I did  and a recording told me that his number was disconnected  I let Abed and the crash go. Many years passed. I walked with my cane and my ankle brace and a backpack on trips in six continents. I pitched overhand in a weekly softball game that I started in Central Park  and home in New York  I became a journalist and an author  typing hundreds of thousands of words with one finger. A friend pointed out to me that all of my big stories mirrored my own  each centering on a life that had changed in an instant  owing  if not to a crash  then to an inheritance  a swing of the bat  a click of the shutter  an arrest. Each of us had a before and an after. I'd been working through my lot after all. Still  Abed was far from my mind  when last year  I returned to Israel to write of the crash  and the book I then wrote   Half Life   was nearly complete when I recognized that I still wanted to meet Abed  and finally I understood why  to hear this man say two words   I'm sorry.  People apologize for less. And so I got a cop to confirm that Abed still lived somewhere in his same town  and I was now driving to it with a potted yellow rose in the back seat  when suddenly flowers seemed a ridiculous offering. But what to get the man who broke your fucking neck  I pulled into the town of Abu Ghosh  and bought a brick of Turkish delight  pistachios glued in rosewater. Better. Back on Highway    I envisioned what awaited. Abed would hug me. Abed would spit at me. Abed would say   I'm sorry.  I then began to wonder  as I had many times before  how my life would have been different had this man not injured me  had my genes been fed a different helping of experience. Who was I  Was I who I had been before the crash  before this road divided my life like the spine of an open book  Was I what had been done to me  Were all of us the results of things done to us  done for us  the infidelity of a parent or spouse  money inherited  Were we instead our bodies  their inborn endowments and deficits  It seemed that we could be nothing more than genes and experience  but how to tease out the one from the other  As Yeats put that same universal question   O body swayed to music  o brightening glance  how can we know the dancer from the dance   I'd been driving for an hour when I looked in my rearview mirror and saw my own brightening glance. The light my eyes had carried for as long as they had been blue. The predispositions and impulses that had propelled me as a toddler to try and slip over a boat into a Chicago lake  that had propelled me as a teen to jump into wild Cape Cod Bay after a hurricane. But I also saw in my reflection that  had Abed not injured me  I would now  in all likelihood  be a doctor and a husband and a father. I would be less mindful of time and of death  and  oh  I would not be disabled  would not suffer the thousand slings and arrows of my fortune. The frequent furl of five fingers  the chips in my teeth come from biting at all the many things a solitary hand cannot open. The dancer and the dance were hopelessly entwined. It was approaching    when I exited right toward Afula  and passed a large quarry and was soon in Kfar Kara. I felt a pang of nerves. But Chopin was on the radio  seven beautiful mazurkas  and I pulled into a lot by a gas station to listen and to calm. I'd been told that in an Arab town  one need only mention the name of a local and it will be recognized. And I was mentioning Abed and myself  noting deliberately that I was here in peace  to the people in this town  when I met Mohamed outside a post office at noon. He listened to me. You know  it was most often when speaking to people that I wondered where I ended and my disability began  for many people told me what they told no one else. Many cried. And one day  after a woman I met on the street did the same and I later asked her why  she told me that  best she could tell  her tears had had something to do with my being happy and strong  but vulnerable too. I listened to her words. I suppose they were true. I was me  but I was now me despite a limp  and that  I suppose  was what now made me  me. Anyway  Mohamed told me what perhaps he would not have told another stranger. He led me to a house of cream stucco  then drove off. And as I sat contemplating what to say  a woman approached in a black shawl and black robe. I stepped from my car and said  Shalom   and identified myself  and she told me that her husband Abed would be home from work in four hours. Her Hebrew was not good  and she later confessed that she thought that I had come to install the Internet. I drove off and returned at       thankful to the minaret up the road that helped me find my way back. And as I approached the front door  Abed saw me  my jeans and flannel and cane  and I saw Abed  an average looking man of average size. He wore black and white  slippers over socks  pilling sweatpants  a piebald sweater  a striped ski cap pulled down to his forehead. He'd been expecting me. Mohamed had phoned. And so at once  we shook hands  and smiled  and I gave him my gift  and he told me I was a guest in his home  and we sat beside one another on a fabric couch. It was then that Abed resumed at once the tale of woe he had begun over the phone    years before. He'd just had surgery on his eyes  he said. He had problems with his side and his legs too  and  oh  he'd lost his teeth in the crash. Did I wish to see him remove them  Abed then rose and turned on the TV so that I wouldn't be alone when he left the room  and returned with polaroids of the crash and his old driver's license.  I was handsome   he said. We looked down at his laminated mug. Abed had been less handsome than substantial  with thick black hair and a full face and a wide neck. It was this youth who on May           had broken two necks including mine  and bruised one brain and taken one life. Twenty one years later  he was now thinner than his wife  his skin slack on his face  and looking at Abed looking at his young self  I remembered looking at that photograph of my young self after the crash  and recognized his longing.  The crash changed both of our lives   I said. Abed then showed me a picture of his mashed truck  and said that the crash was the fault of a bus driver in the left lane who did not let him pass. I did not want to recap the crash with Abed. I'd hoped for something simpler  to exchange a Turkish dessert for two words and be on my way. And so I didn't point out that in his own testimony the morning after the crash  Abed did not even mention the bus driver. No  I was quiet. I was quiet because I had not come for truth. I had come for remorse. And so I now went looking for remorse and threw truth under the bus.  I understand   I said   that the crash was not your fault  but does it make you sad that others suffered   Abed spoke three quick words.  Yes  I suffered.  Abed then told me why he'd suffered. He'd lived an unholy life before the crash  and so God had ordained the crash  but now  he said  he was religious  and God was pleased. It was then that God intervened  news on the TV of a car wreck that hours before had killed three people up north. We looked up at the wreckage.  Strange   I said.  Strange   he agreed. I had the thought that there  on Route      there were perpetrators and victims  dyads bound by a crash. Some  as had Abed  would forget the date. Some  as had I  would remember. The report finished and Abed spoke.  It is a pity   he said   that the police in this country are not tough enough on bad drivers.  I was baffled. Abed had said something remarkable. Did it point up the degree to which he'd absolved himself of the crash  Was it evidence of guilt  an assertion that he should have been put away longer  He'd served six months in prison  lost his truck license for a decade. I forgot my discretion.  Um  Abed   I said   I thought you had a few driving issues before the crash.   Well   he said   I once went    in a   .  And so    violations    driving through a red light  driving at excessive speed  driving on the wrong side of a barrier  and finally  riding his brakes down that hill    reduced to one. And it was then I understood that no matter how stark the reality  the human being fits it into a narrative that is palatable. The goat becomes the hero. The perpetrator becomes the victim. It was then I understood that Abed would never apologize. Abed and I sat with our coffee. We'd spent    minutes together  and he was now known to me. He was not a particularly bad man or a particularly good man. He was a limited man who'd found it within himself to be kind to me. With a nod to Jewish custom  he told me that I should live to be     years old. But it was hard for me to relate to one who had so completely washed his hands of his own calamitous doing  to one whose life was so unexamined that he said he thought two people had died in the crash. There was much I wished to say to Abed. I wished to tell him that  were he to acknowledge my disability  it would be okay  for people are wrong to marvel at those like me who smile as we limp. People don't know that they have lived through worse  that problems of the heart hit with a force greater than a runaway truck  that problems of the mind are greater still  more injurious  than a hundred broken necks. I wished to tell him that what makes most of us who we are most of all is not our minds and not our bodies and not what happens to us  but how we respond to what happens to us.  This   wrote the psychiatrist Viktor Frankl   is the last of the human freedoms  to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances.  I wished to tell him that not only paralyzers and paralyzees must evolve  reconcile to reality  but we all must    the aging and the anxious and the divorced and the balding and the bankrupt and everyone. I wished to tell him that one does not have to say that a bad thing is good  that a crash is from God and so a crash is good  a broken neck is good. One can say that a bad thing sucks  but that this natural world still has many glories. I wished to tell him that  in the end  our mandate is clear  We have to rise above bad fortune. We have to be in the good and enjoy the good  study and work and adventure and friendship    oh  friendship    and community and love. But most of all  I wished to tell him what Herman Melville wrote  that  truly to enjoy bodily warmth  some small part of you must be cold  for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast.  Yes  contrast. If you are mindful of what you do not have  you may be truly mindful of what you do have  and if the gods are kind  you may truly enjoy what you have. That is the one singular gift you may receive if you suffer in any existential way. You know death  and so may wake each morning pulsing with ready life. Some part of you is cold  and so another part may truly enjoy what it is to be warm  or even to be cold. When one morning  years after the crash  I stepped onto stone and the underside of my left foot felt the flash of cold  nerves at last awake  it was exhilarating  a gust of snow. But I didn't say these things to Abed. I told him only that he had killed one man  not two. I told him the name of that man. And then I said   Goodbye.  Thank you. Thanks a lot. One of the things I want to establish right from the start is that not all neurosurgeons wear cowboy boots. I just wanted you to know that. So I am indeed a neurosurgeon  and I follow a long tradition of neurosurgery  and what I'm going to tell you about today is adjusting the dials in the circuits in the brain  being able to go anywhere in the brain and turning areas of the brain up or down to help our patients. So as I said  neurosurgery comes from a long tradition. It's been around for about       years. In Mesoamerica  there used to be neurosurgery  and there were these neurosurgeons that used to treat patients. And they were trying to    they knew that the brain was involved in neurological and psychiatric disease. They didn't know exactly what they were doing. Not much has changed  by the way.  Laughter  But they thought that  if you had a neurologic or psychiatric disease  it must be because you are possessed by an evil spirit. So if you are possessed by an evil spirit causing neurologic or psychiatric problems  then the way to treat this is  of course  to make a hole in your skull and let the evil spirit escape. So this was the thinking back then  and these individuals made these holes. Sometimes the patients were a little bit reluctant to go through this because  you can tell that the holes are made partially and then  I think  there was some trepanation  and then they left very quickly and it was only a partial hole  and we know they survived these procedures. But this was common. There were some sites where one percent of all the skulls have these holes  and so you can see that neurologic and psychiatric disease is quite common  and it was also quite common about       years ago. Now  in the course of time  we've come to realize that different parts of the brain do different things. So there are areas of the brain that are dedicated to controlling your movement or your vision or your memory or your appetite  and so on. And when things work well  then the nervous system works well  and everything functions. But once in a while  things don't go so well  and there's trouble in these circuits  and there are some rogue neurons that are misfiring and causing trouble  or sometimes they're underactive and they're not quite working as they should. Now  the manifestation of this depends on where in the brain these neurons are. So when these neurons are in the motor circuit  you get dysfunction in the movement system  and you get things like Parkinson's disease. When the malfunction is in a circuit that regulates your mood  you get things like depression  and when it is in a circuit that controls your memory and cognitive function  then you get things like Alzheimer's disease. So what we've been able to do is to pinpoint where these disturbances are in the brain  and we've been able to intervene within these circuits in the brain to either turn them up or turn them down. So this is very much like choosing the correct station on the radio dial. Once you choose the right station  whether it be jazz or opera  in our case whether it be movement or mood  we can put the dial there  and then we can use a second button to adjust the volume  to turn it up or turn it down. So what I'm going to tell you about is using the circuitry of the brain to implant electrodes and turning areas of the brain up and down to see if we can help our patients. And this is accomplished using this kind of device  and this is called deep brain stimulation. So what we're doing is placing these electrodes throughout the brain. Again  we are making holes in the skull about the size of a dime  putting an electrode in  and then this electrode is completely underneath the skin down to a pacemaker in the chest  and with a remote control very much like a television remote control  we can adjust how much electricity we deliver to these areas of the brain. We can turn it up or down  on or off. Now  about a hundred thousand patients in the world have received deep brain stimulation  and I'm going to show you some examples of using deep brain stimulation to treat disorders of movement  disorders of mood and disorders of cognition. So this looks something like this when it's in the brain. You see the electrode going through the skull into the brain and resting there  and we can place this really anywhere in the brain. I tell my friends that no neuron is safe from a neurosurgeon  because we can really reach just about anywhere in the brain quite safely now. Now the first example I'm going to show you is a patient with Parkinson's disease  and this lady has Parkinson's disease  and she has these electrodes in her brain  and I'm going to show you what she's like when the electrodes are turned off and she has her Parkinson's symptoms  and then we're going to turn it on. So this looks something like this. The electrodes are turned off now  and you can see that she has tremor. We're now going to turn it on. It's on. Just turned it on. And this works like that  instantly. And the difference between shaking in this way and not    The difference between shaking in this way and not is related to the misbehavior of        neurons in her subthalamic nucleus. So we now know how to find these troublemakers and tell them   Gentlemen  that's enough. We want you to stop doing that.  And we do that with electricity. So we use electricity to dictate how they fire  and we try to block their misbehavior using electricity. So in this case  we are suppressing the activity of abnormal neurons. We started using this technique in other problems  and I'm going to tell you about a fascinating problem that we encountered  a case of dystonia. So dystonia is a disorder affecting children. It's a genetic disorder  and it involves a twisting motion  and these children get progressively more and more twisting until they can't breathe  until they get sores  urinary infections  and then they die. So back in       I was asked to see this young boy  perfectly normal. He has this genetic form of dystonia. There are eight children in the family. Five of them have dystonia. So here he is. This boy is nine years old  perfectly normal until the age six  and then he started twisting his body  first the right foot  then the left foot  then the right arm  then the left arm  then the trunk  and then by the time he arrived  within the course of one or two years of the disease onset  he could no longer walk  he could no longer stand. He was crippled  and indeed the natural progression as this gets worse is for them to become progressively twisted  progressively disabled  and many of these children do not survive. So he is one of five kids. The only way he could get around was crawling on his belly like this. He did not respond to any drugs. We did not know what to do with this boy. We did not know what operation to do  where to go in the brain  but on the basis of our results in Parkinson's disease  we reasoned  why don't we try to suppress the same area in the brain that we suppressed in Parkinson's disease  and let's see what happens  So here he was. We operated on him hoping that he would get better. We did not know. So here he is now  back in Israel where he lives  three months after the procedure  and here he is. On the basis of this result  this is now a procedure that's done throughout the world  and there have been hundreds of children that have been helped with this kind of surgery. This boy is now in university and leads quite a normal life. This has been one of the most satisfying cases that I have ever done in my entire career  to restore movement and walking to this kind of child. We realized that perhaps we could use this technology not only in circuits that control your movement but also circuits that control other things  and the next thing that we took on was circuits that control your mood. And we decided to take on depression  and the reason we took on depression is because it's so prevalent  and as you know  there are many treatments for depression  with medication and psychotherapy  even electroconvulsive therapy  but there are millions of people  and there are still    or    percent of patients with depression that do not respond  and it is these patients that we want to help. And let's see if we can use this technique to help these patients with depression. So the first thing we did was  we compared  what's different in the brain of someone with depression and someone who is normal  and what we did was PET scans to look at the blood flow of the brain  and what we noticed is that in patients with depression compared to normals  areas of the brain are shut down  and those are the areas in blue. So here you really have the blues  and the areas in blue are areas that are involved in motivation  in drive and decision making  and indeed  if you're severely depressed as these patients were  those are impaired. You lack motivation and drive. The other thing we discovered was an area that was overactive  area     seen there in red  and area    is the sadness center of the brain. If I make any of you sad  for example  I make you remember the last time you saw your parent before they died or a friend before they died  this area of the brain lights up. It is the sadness center of the brain. And so patients with depression have hyperactivity. The area of the brain for sadness is on red hot. The thermostat is set at     degrees  and the other areas of the brain  involved in drive and motivation  are shut down. So we wondered  can we place electrodes in this area of sadness and see if we can turn down the thermostat  can we turn down the activity  and what will be the consequence of that  So we went ahead and implanted electrodes in patients with depression. This is work done with my colleague Helen Mayberg from Emory. And we placed electrodes in area     and in the top scan you see before the operation  area     the sadness area is red hot  and the frontal lobes are shut down in blue  and then  after three months of continuous stimulation     hours a day  or six months of continuous stimulation  we have a complete reversal of this. We're able to drive down area     down to a more normal level  and we're able to turn back online the frontal lobes of the brain  and indeed we're seeing very striking results in these patients with severe depression. So now we are in clinical trials  and are in Phase III clinical trials  and this may become a new procedure  if it's safe and we find that it's effective  to treat patients with severe depression. I've shown you that we can use deep brain stimulation to treat the motor system in cases of Parkinson's disease and dystonia. I've shown you that we can use it to treat a mood circuit in cases of depression. Can we use deep brain stimulation to make you smarter  Anybody interested in that  Of course we can  right  So what we've decided to do is we're going to try to turbocharge the memory circuits in the brain. We're going to place electrodes within the circuits that regulate your memory and cognitive function to see if we can turn up their activity. Now we're not going to do this in normal people. We're going to do this in people that have cognitive deficits  and we've chosen to treat patients with Alzheimer's disease who have cognitive and memory deficits. As you know  this is the main symptom of early onset Alzheimer's disease. So we've placed electrodes within this circuit in an area of the brain called the fornix  which is the highway in and out of this memory circuit  with the idea to see if we can turn on this memory circuit  and whether that can  in turn  help these patients with Alzheimer's disease. Now it turns out that in Alzheimer's disease  there's a huge deficit in glucose utilization in the brain. The brain is a bit of a hog when it comes to using glucose. It uses    percent of all your    even though it only weighs two percent    it uses    times more glucose than it should based on its weight. Twenty percent of all the glucose in your body is used by the brain  and as you go from being normal to having mild cognitive impairment  which is a precursor for Alzheimer's  all the way to Alzheimer's disease  then there are areas of the brain that stop using glucose. They shut down. They turn off. And indeed  what we see is that these areas in red around the outside ribbon of the brain are progressively getting more and more blue until they shut down completely. This is analogous to having a power failure in an area of the brain  a regional power failure. So the lights are out in parts of the brain in patients with Alzheimer's disease  and the question is  are the lights out forever  or can we turn the lights back on  Can we get those areas of the brain to use glucose once again  So this is what we did. We implanted electrodes in the fornix of patients with Alzheimer's disease  we turned it on  and we looked at what happens to glucose use in the brain. And indeed  at the top  you'll see before the surgery  the areas in blue are the areas that use less glucose than normal  predominantly the parietal and temporal lobes. These areas of the brain are shut down. The lights are out in these areas of the brain. We then put in the DBS electrodes and we wait for a month or a year  and the areas in red represent the areas where we increase glucose utilization. And indeed  we are able to get these areas of the brain that were not using glucose to use glucose once again. So the message here is that  in Alzheimer's disease  the lights are out  but there is someone home  and we're able to turn the power back on to these areas of the brain  and as we do so  we expect that their functions will return. So this is now in clinical trials. We are going to operate on    patients with early Alzheimer's disease to see whether this is safe and effective  whether we can improve their neurologic function. So the message I want to leave you with today is that  indeed  there are several circuits in the brain that are malfunctioning across various disease states  whether we're talking about Parkinson's disease  depression  schizophrenia  Alzheimer's. We are now learning to understand what are the circuits  what are the areas of the brain that are responsible for the clinical signs and the symptoms of those diseases. We can now reach those circuits. We can introduce electrodes within those circuits. We can graduate the activity of those circuits. We can turn them down if they are overactive  if they're causing trouble  trouble that is felt throughout the brain  or we can turn them up if they are underperforming  and in so doing  we think that we may be able to help the overall function of the brain. The implications of this  of course  is that we may be able to modify the symptoms of the disease  but I haven't told you but there's also some evidence that we might be able to help the repair of damaged areas of the brain using electricity  and this is something for the future  to see if  indeed  we not only change the activity but also some of the reparative functions of the brain can be harvested. So I envision that we're going to see a great expansion of indications of this technique. We're going to see electrodes being placed for many disorders of the brain. One of the most exciting things about this is that  indeed  it involves multidisciplinary work. It involves the work of engineers  of imaging scientists  of basic scientists  of neurologists  psychiatrists  neurosurgeons  and certainly at the interface of these multiple disciplines that there's the excitement. And I think that we will see that we will be able to chase more of these evil spirits out from the brain as time goes on  and the consequence of that  of course  will be that we will be able to help many more patients. Thank you very much. When I was    years old  I had low self esteem. I felt I was not talented at anything. One day  I bought a yo yo. When I tried my first trick  it looked like this. I couldn't even do the simplest trick  but it was very natural for me  because I was not dextrous  and hated all sports. But after one week of practicing  my throws became more like this. A bit better. I thought  the yo yo is something for me to be good at  for the first time in my life. I found my passion. I was spending all my time practicing. It took me hours and hours a day to build my skills up to the next level. And then  four years later  when I was    years old  I was standing onstage at the World Yo Yo Contest. And I won. I was so excited.  Yes  I did it  I became a hero. I may get many sponsors  a lot of money  tons of interviews  and be on TV   I thought.  Laughter  But after coming back to Japan  totally nothing changed in my life. I realized society didn't value my passion. So I went back to my college and became a typical Japanese worker as a systems engineer. I felt my passion  heart and soul  had left my body. I felt I was not alive anymore. So I started to consider what I should do  and I thought  I wanted to make my performance better  and to show onstage how spectacular the yo yo could be to change the public's image of the yo yo. So I quit my company and started a career as a professional performer. I started to learn classic ballet  jazz dance  acrobatics and other things to make my performance better. As a result of these efforts  and the help of many others  it happened. I won the World Yo Yo Contest again in the artistic performance division. I passed an audition for Cirque du Soleil. Today  I am standing on the TED stage with the yo yo in front of you. What I learned from the yo yo is  if I make enough effort with huge passion  there is no impossible. Could you let me share my passion with you through my performance  We always hear that texting is a scourge. The idea is that texting spells the decline and fall of any kind of serious literacy  or at least writing ability  among young people in the United States and now the whole world today. The fact of the matter is that it just isn't true  and it's easy to think that it is true  but in order to see it in another way  in order to see that actually texting is a miraculous thing  not just energetic  but a miraculous thing  a kind of emergent complexity that we're seeing happening right now  we have to pull the camera back for a bit and look at what language really is  in which case  one thing that we see is that texting is not writing at all. What do I mean by that  Basically  if we think about language  language has existed for perhaps         years  at least        years  and what it arose as is speech. People talked. That's what we're probably genetically specified for. That's how we use language most. Writing is something that came along much later  and as we saw in the last talk  there's a little bit of controversy as to exactly when that happened  but according to traditional estimates  if humanity had existed for    hours  then writing only came along at about       p.m. That's how much of a latterly thing writing is. So first there's speech  and then writing comes along as a kind of artifice. Now don't get me wrong  writing has certain advantages. When you write  because it's a conscious process  because you can look backwards  you can do things with language that are much less likely if you're just talking. For example  imagine a passage from Edward Gibbon's  The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire    The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours  till the graduate retreat of the Persians was changed into a disorderly flight  of which the shameful example was given by the principal leaders and the Surenas himself.  That's beautiful  but let's face it  nobody talks that way. Or at least  they shouldn't if they're interested in reproducing. That    is not the way any human being speaks casually. Casual speech is something quite different. Linguists have actually shown that when we're speaking casually in an unmonitored way  we tend to speak in word packets of maybe seven to    words. You'll notice this if you ever have occasion to record yourself or a group of people talking. That's what speech is like. Speech is much looser. It's much more telegraphic. It's much less reflective    very different from writing. So we naturally tend to think  because we see language written so often  that that's what language is  but actually what language is  is speech. They are two things. Now of course  as history has gone by  it's been natural for there to be a certain amount of bleed between speech and writing. So  for example  in a distant era now  it was common when one gave a speech to basically talk like writing. So I mean the kind of speech that you see someone giving in an old movie where they clear their throat  and they go   Ahem  ladies and gentlemen   and then they speak in a certain way which has nothing to do with casual speech. It's formal. It uses long sentences like this Gibbon one. It's basically talking like you write  and so  for example  we're thinking so much these days about Lincoln because of the movie. The Gettysburg Address was not the main meal of that event. For two hours before that  Edward Everett spoke on a topic that  frankly  cannot engage us today and barely did then. The point of it was to listen to him speaking like writing. Ordinary people stood and listened to that for two hours. It was perfectly natural. That's what people did then  speaking like writing. Well  if you can speak like writing  then logically it follows that you might want to also sometimes write like you speak. The problem was just that in the material  mechanical sense  that was harder back in the day for the simple reason that materials don't lend themselves to it. It's almost impossible to do that with your hand except in shorthand  and then communication is limited. On a manual typewriter it was very difficult  and even when we had electric typewriters  or then computer keyboards  the fact is that even if you can type easily enough to keep up with the pace of speech  more or less  you have to have somebody who can receive your message quickly. Once you have things in your pocket that can receive that message  then you have the conditions that allow that we can write like we speak. And that's where texting comes in. And so  texting is very loose in its structure. No one thinks about capital letters or punctuation when one texts  but then again  do you think about those things when you talk  No  and so therefore why would you when you were texting  What texting is  despite the fact that it involves the brute mechanics of something that we call writing  is fingered speech. That's what texting is. Now we can write the way we talk. And it's a very interesting thing  but nevertheless easy to think that still it represents some sort of decline. We see this general bagginess of the structure  the lack of concern with rules and the way that we're used to learning on the blackboard  and so we think that something has gone wrong. It's a very natural sense. But the fact of the matter is that what is going on is a kind of emergent complexity. That's what we're seeing in this fingered speech. And in order to understand it  what we want to see is the way  in this new kind of language  there is new structure coming up. And so  for example  there is in texting a convention  which is LOL. Now LOL  we generally think of as meaning  laughing out loud.  And of course  theoretically  it does  and if you look at older texts  then people used it to actually indicate laughing out loud. But if you text now  or if you are someone who is aware of the substrate of texting the way it's become  you'll notice that LOL does not mean laughing out loud anymore. It's evolved into something that is much subtler. This is an actual text that was done by a non male person of about    years old not too long ago.  I love the font you're using  btw.  Julie   lol thanks gmail is being slow right now  Now if you think about it  that's not funny. No one's laughing.  Laughter  And yet  there it is  so you assume there's been some kind of hiccup. Then Susan says  lol  I know   again more guffawing than we're used to when you're talking about these inconveniences. So Julie says   I just sent you an email.  Susan   lol  I see it.  Very funny people  if that's what LOL means. This Julie says   So what's up   Susan   lol  I have to write a    page paper.  She's not amused. Let's think about it. LOL is being used in a very particular way. It's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation. We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles. Any spoken language that's used by real people has them. If you happen to speak Japanese  think about that little word  ne  that you use at the end of a lot of sentences. If you listen to the way black youth today speak  think about the use of the word  yo.  Whole dissertations could be written about it  and probably are being written about it. A pragmatic particle  that's what LOL has gradually become. It's a way of using the language between actual people. Another example is  slash.  Now  we can use slash in the way that we're used to  along the lines of   We're going to have a party slash networking session.  That's kind of like what we're at. Slash is used in a very different way in texting among young people today. It's used to change the scene. So for example  this Sally person says   So I need to find people to chill with  and Jake says   Haha     you could write a dissertation about  Haha  too  but we don't have time for that    Haha so you're going by yourself  Why   Sally   For this summer program at NYU.  Jake   Haha. Slash I'm watching this video with suns players trying to shoot with one eye.  The slash is interesting. I don't really even know what Jake is talking about after that  but you notice that he's changing the topic. Now that seems kind of mundane  but think about how in real life  if we're having a conversation and we want to change the topic  there are ways of doing it gracefully. You don't just zip right into it. You'll pat your thighs and look wistfully off into the distance  or you'll say something like   Hmm  makes you think     when it really didn't  but what you're really    what you're really trying to do is change the topic. You can't do that while you're texting  and so ways are developing of doing it within this medium. All spoken languages have what a linguist calls a new information marker    or two  or three. Texting has developed one from this slash. So we have a whole battery of new constructions that are developing  and yet it's easy to think  well  something is still wrong. There's a lack of structure of some sort. It's not as sophisticated as the language of The Wall Street Journal. Well  the fact of the matter is  look at this person in       and this is when texting doesn't exist   I Love Lucy  is still on the air.  Many do not know the alphabet or multiplication table  cannot write grammatically      We've heard that sort of thing before  not just in     .       Connecticut schoolteacher.     . This is the time when we all assume that everything somehow in terms of writing was perfect because the people on  Downton Abbey  are articulate  or something like that. So   From every college in the country goes up the cry  'Our freshmen can't spell  can't punctuate.'  And so on. You can go even further back than this. It's the President of Harvard. It's     . There's no electricity. People have three names.  Bad spelling  incorrectness as well as inelegance of expression in writing.  And he's talking about people who are otherwise well prepared for college studies. You can go even further back.       some long lost superintendent of schools is upset because of what he has for a long time  noted with regret the almost entire neglect of the original  blah blah blah blah blah. Or you can go all the way back to    A.D.     Laughter     and there's this poor man who doesn't like the way people are speaking Latin. As it happens  he was writing about what had become French. And so  there are always    Laughter   Applause    there are always people worrying about these things and the planet somehow seems to keep spinning. And so  the way I'm thinking of texting these days is that what we're seeing is a whole new way of writing that young people are developing  which they're using alongside their ordinary writing skills  and that means that they're able to do two things. Increasing evidence is that being bilingual is cognitively beneficial. That's also true of being bidialectal. That's certainly true of being bidialectal in terms of your writing. And so texting actually is evidence of a balancing act that young people are using today  not consciously  of course  but it's an expansion of their linguistic repertoire. It's very simple. If somebody from      looked at what was on a dormitory message board in       the slang would have changed a little bit since the era of  Love Story   but they would understand what was on that message board. Take that person from         not that long ago  this is  Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure     those people. Take those people and they read a very typical text written by a    year old today. Often they would have no idea what half of it meant because a whole new language has developed among our young people doing something as mundane as what it looks like to us when they're batting around on their little devices. So in closing  if I could go into the future  if I could go into       the first thing I would ask is whether David Simon had done a sequel to  The Wire.  I would want to know. And   I really would ask that   and then I'd want to know actually what was going on on  Downton Abbey.  That'd be the second thing. And then the third thing would be  please show me a sheaf of texts written by    year old girls  because I would want to know where this language had developed since our times  and ideally I would then send them back to you and me now so we could examine this linguistic miracle happening right under our noses. Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  That's how we traveled in the year     . That's an open buggy. It doesn't have heating. It doesn't have air conditioning. That horse is pulling it along at one percent of the speed of sound  and the rutted dirt road turns into a quagmire of mud anytime it rains. That's a Boeing    . Only    years later  it travels at    percent of the speed of sound  and we don't travel any faster today because commercial supersonic air travel turned out to be a bust. So I started wondering and pondering  could it be that the best years of American economic growth are behind us  And that leads to the suggestion  maybe economic growth is almost over. Some of the reasons for this are not really very controversial. There are four headwinds that are just hitting the American economy in the face. They're demographics  education  debt and inequality. They're powerful enough to cut growth in half. So we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline. And here's my theme  Because of the headwinds  if innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been in the last     years  growth is cut in half. If innovation is less powerful  invents less great  wonderful things  then growth is going to be even lower than half of history. Now here's eight centuries of economic growth. The vertical axis is just percent per year of growth  zero percent a year  one percent a year  two percent a year. The white line is for the U.K.  and then the U.S. takes over as the leading nation in the year       when the line switches to red. You'll notice that  for the first four centuries  there's hardly any growth at all  just  .  percent. Then growth gets better and better. It maxes out in the     s  '  s and '  s  and then it starts slowing down  and here's a cautionary note. That last downward notch in the red line is not actual data. That is a forecast that I made six years ago that growth would slow down to  .  percent. But you know what the actual facts are  You know what the growth in per person income has been in the United States in the last six years  Negative. This led to a fantasy. What if I try to fit a curved line to this historical record  I can make the curved line end anywhere I wanted  but I decided I would end it at  .   just like the U.K. growth for the first four centuries. Now the history that we've achieved is that we've grown at  .  percent per year over the whole period       to       and remember it's been a little bit negative since     . But if growth slows down  instead of doubling our standard of living every generation  Americans in the future can't expect to be twice as well off as their parents  or even a quarter  more well off than  their parents. Now we're going to change and look at the level of per capita income. The vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today's prices. You'll notice that in       over on the left  we were at about       dollars. Today we're at about        dollars of total output per member of the population. Now what if we could achieve that historic two percent growth for the next    years  Well  it's a matter of arithmetic. Two percent growth quadruples your standard of living in    years. That means we'd go from        to        . Well  we're not going to do that  and the reason is the headwinds. The first headwind is demographics. It's a truism that your standard of living rises faster than productivity  rises faster than output per hour  if hours per person increased. And we got that gift back in the '  s and '  s when women entered the labor force. But now it's turned around. Now hours per person are shrinking  first because of the retirement of the baby boomers  and second because there's been a very significant dropping out of the labor force of prime age adult males who are in the bottom half of the educational distribution. The next headwind is education. We've got problems all over our educational system despite Race to the Top. In college  we've got cost inflation in higher education that dwarfs cost inflation in medical care. We have in higher education a trillion dollars of student debt  and our college completion rate is    points     percentage points below Canada. We have a lot of debt. Our economy grew from      to      on the back of consumers massively overborrowing. Consumers paying off that debt is one of the main reasons why our economic recovery is so sluggish today. And everybody of course knows that the federal government debt is growing as a share of GDP at a very rapid rate  and the only way that's going to stop is some combination of faster growth in taxes or slower growth in entitlements  also called transfer payments. And that gets us down from the  .   where we've reached for education  down to  . . And then we have inequality. Over the    years before the financial crisis  the growth rate of the bottom    percent of the income distribution was half a point slower than the averages we've been talking about before. All the rest went to the top one percent. So that brings us down to  . . And that  .  is the big challenge. Are we going to grow at  .   If so  that's going to require that our inventions are as important as the ones that happened over the last     years. So let's see what some of those inventions were. If you wanted to read in      at night  you needed to have an oil or a gas lamp. They created pollution  they created odors  they were hard to control  the light was dim  and they were a fire hazard. By       electric light was everywhere. We had the vertical city  the invention of the elevator. Central Manhattan became possible. And then  in addition to that  at the same time  hand tools were replaced by massive electric tools and hand powered electric tools  all achieved by electricity. Electricity was also very helpful in liberating women. Women  back in the late   th century  spent two days a week doing the laundry. They did it on a scrub board. Then they had to hang the clothes out to dry. Then they had to bring them in. The whole thing took two days out of the seven day week. And then we had the electric washing machine. And by       they were everywhere. But the women still had to shop every day  but no they didn't  because electricity brought us the electric refrigerator. Back in the late   th century  the only source of heat in most homes was a big fireplace in the kitchen that was used for cooking and heating. The bedrooms were cold. They were unheated. But by       certainly by       we had central heating everywhere. What about the internal combustion engine  which was invented in       In America  before the motor vehicle  transportation depended entirely on the urban horse  which dropped  without restraint     to    pounds of manure on the streets every day together with a gallon of urine. That comes out at five to    tons daily per square mile in cities. Those horses also ate up fully one quarter of American agricultural land. That's the percentage of American agricultural land it took to feed the horses. Of course  when the motor vehicle was invented  and it became almost ubiquitous by       that agricultural land could be used for human consumption or for export. And here's an interesting ratio  Starting from zero in       only    years later  the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households in the United States reached    percent in just    years. Back before the turn of the century  women had another problem. All the water for cooking  cleaning and bathing had to be carried in buckets and pails in from the outside. It's a historical fact that in       the average North Carolina housewife walked     miles a year carrying    tons of water. But by       cities around the country had put in underground water pipes. They had put in underground sewer pipes  and as a result  one of the great scourges of the late   th century  waterborne diseases like cholera  began to disappear. And an amazing fact for techno optimists is that in the first half of the   th century  the rate of improvement of life expectancy was three times faster than it was in the second half of the   th century. So it's a truism that things can't be more than     percent of themselves. And I'll just give you a few examples. We went from one percent to    percent of the speed of sound. Electrification  central heat  ownership of motor cars  they all went from zero to     percent. Urban environments make people more productive than on the farm. We went from    percent urban to    percent by the early postwar years. What about the electronic revolution  Here's an early computer. It's amazing. The mainframe computer was invented in     . By      we had telephone bills  bank statements were being produced by computers. The earliest cell phones  the earliest personal computers were invented in the     s. The     s brought us Bill Gates  DOS  ATM machines to replace bank tellers  bar code scanning to cut down on labor in the retail sector. Fast forward through the '  s  we had the dotcom revolution and a temporary rise in productivity growth. But I'm now going to give you an experiment. You have to choose either option A or option B. Option A is you get to keep everything invented up till    years ago. So you get Google  you get Amazon  you get Wikipedia  and you get running water and indoor toilets. Or you get everything invented to yesterday  including Facebook and your iPhone  but you have to give up  go out to the outhouse  and carry in the water. Hurricane Sandy caused a lot of people to lose the   th century  maybe for a couple of days  in some cases for more than a week  electricity  running water  heating  gasoline for their cars  and a charge for their iPhones. The problem we face is that all these great inventions  we have to match them in the future  and my prediction that we're not going to match them brings us down from the original two percent growth down to  .   the fanciful curve that I drew you at the beginning. So here we are back to the horse and buggy. I'd like to award an Oscar to the inventors of the   th century  the people from Alexander Graham Bell to Thomas Edison to the Wright Brothers  I'd like to call them all up here  and they're going to call back to you. Your challenge is  can you match what we achieved  Thank you. Growth is not dead. Let's start the story     years ago  when American factories began to electrify their operations  igniting the Second Industrial Revolution. The amazing thing is that productivity did not increase in those factories for    years. Thirty years. That's long enough for a generation of managers to retire. You see  the first wave of managers simply replaced their steam engines with electric motors  but they didn't redesign the factories to take advantage of electricity's flexibility. It fell to the next generation to invent new work processes  and then productivity soared  often doubling or even tripling in those factories. Electricity is an example of a general purpose technology  like the steam engine before it. General purpose technologies drive most economic growth  because they unleash cascades of complementary innovations  like lightbulbs and  yes  factory redesign. Is there a general purpose technology of our era  Sure. It's the computer. But technology alone is not enough. Technology is not destiny. We shape our destiny  and just as the earlier generations of managers needed to redesign their factories  we're going to need to reinvent our organizations and even our whole economic system. We're not doing as well at that job as we should be. As we'll see in a moment  productivity is actually doing all right  but it has become decoupled from jobs  and the income of the typical worker is stagnating. These troubles are sometimes misdiagnosed as the end of innovation  but they are actually the growing pains of what Andrew McAfee and I call the new machine age. Let's look at some data. So here's GDP per person in America. There's some bumps along the way  but the big story is you could practically fit a ruler to it. This is a log scale  so what looks like steady growth is actually an acceleration in real terms. And here's productivity. You can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid '  s  but it matches up pretty well with the Second Industrial Revolution  when factories were learning how to electrify their operations. After a lag  productivity accelerated again. So maybe  history doesn't repeat itself  but sometimes it rhymes.  Today  productivity is at an all time high  and despite the Great Recession  it grew faster in the     s than it did in the     s  the roaring     s  and that was faster than the '  s or '  s. It's growing faster than it did during the Second Industrial Revolution. And that's just the United States. The global news is even better. Worldwide incomes have grown at a faster rate in the past decade than ever in history. If anything  all these numbers actually understate our progress  because the new machine age is more about knowledge creation than just physical production. It's mind not matter  brain not brawn  ideas not things. That creates a problem for standard metrics  because we're getting more and more stuff for free  like Wikipedia  Google  Skype  and if they post it on the web  even this TED Talk. Now getting stuff for free is a good thing  right  Sure  of course it is. But that's not how economists measure GDP. Zero price means zero weight in the GDP statistics. According to the numbers  the music industry is half the size that it was    years ago  but I'm listening to more and better music than ever. You know  I bet you are too. In total  my research estimates that the GDP numbers miss over     billion dollars per year in free goods and services on the Internet. Now let's look to the future. There are some super smart people who are arguing that we've reached the end of growth  but to understand the future of growth  we need to make predictions about the underlying drivers of growth. I'm optimistic  because the new machine age is digital  exponential and combinatorial. When goods are digital  they can be replicated with perfect quality at nearly zero cost  and they can be delivered almost instantaneously. Welcome to the economics of abundance. But there's a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world. Measurement is the lifeblood of science and progress. In the age of big data  we can measure the world in ways we never could before. Secondly  the new machine age is exponential. Computers get better faster than anything else ever. A child's Playstation today is more powerful than a military supercomputer from     . But our brains are wired for a linear world. As a result  exponential trends take us by surprise. I used to teach my students that there are some things  you know  computers just aren't good at  like driving a car through traffic. That's right  here's Andy and me grinning like madmen because we just rode down Route     in  yes  a driverless car. Thirdly  the new machine age is combinatorial. The stagnationist view is that ideas get used up  like low hanging fruit  but the reality is that each innovation creates building blocks for even more innovations. Here's an example. In just a matter of a few weeks  an undergraduate student of mine built an app that ultimately reached  .  million users. He was able to do that so easily because he built it on top of Facebook  and Facebook was built on top of the web  and that was built on top of the Internet  and so on and so forth. Now individually  digital  exponential and combinatorial would each be game changers. Put them together  and we're seeing a wave of astonishing breakthroughs  like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah or leap tall buildings in a single bound. You know  robots are even revolutionizing cat transportation. But perhaps the most important invention  the most important invention is machine learning. Consider one project  IBM's Watson. These little dots here  those are all the champions on the quiz show  Jeopardy.  At first  Watson wasn't very good  but it improved at a rate faster than any human could  and shortly after Dave Ferrucci showed this chart to my class at MIT  Watson beat the world  Jeopardy  champion. At age seven  Watson is still kind of in its childhood. Recently  its teachers let it surf the Internet unsupervised. The next day  it started answering questions with profanities. Damn.  Laughter  But you know  Watson is growing up fast. It's being tested for jobs in call centers  and it's getting them. It's applying for legal  banking and medical jobs  and getting some of them. Isn't it ironic that at the very moment we are building intelligent machines  perhaps the most important invention in human history  some people are arguing that innovation is stagnating  Like the first two industrial revolutions  the full implications of the new machine age are going to take at least a century to fully play out  but they are staggering. So does that mean we have nothing to worry about  No. Technology is not destiny. Productivity is at an all time high  but fewer people now have jobs. We have created more wealth in the past decade than ever  but for a majority of Americans  their income has fallen. This is the great decoupling of productivity from employment  of wealth from work. You know  it's not surprising that millions of people have become disillusioned by the great decoupling  but like too many others  they misunderstand its basic causes. Technology is racing ahead  but it's leaving more and more people behind. Today  we can take a routine job  codify it in a set of machine readable instructions  and then replicate it a million times. You know  I recently overheard a conversation that epitomizes these new economics. This guy says   Nah  I don't use H R Block anymore. TurboTax does everything that my tax preparer did  but it's faster  cheaper and more accurate.  How can a skilled worker compete with a     piece of software  She can't. Today  millions of Americans do have faster  cheaper  more accurate tax preparation  and the founders of Intuit have done very well for themselves. But    percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs. That is a microcosm of what's happening  not just in software and services  but in media and music  in finance and manufacturing  in retailing and trade    in short  in every industry. People are racing against the machine  and many of them are losing that race. What can we do to create shared prosperity  The answer is not to try to slow down technology. Instead of racing against the machine  we need to learn to race with the machine. That is our grand challenge. The new machine age can be dated to a day    years ago when Garry Kasparov  the world chess champion  played Deep Blue  a supercomputer. The machine won that day  and today  a chess program running on a cell phone can beat a human grandmaster. It got so bad that  when he was asked what strategy he would use against a computer  Jan Donner  the Dutch grandmaster  replied   I'd bring a hammer.  But today a computer is no longer the world chess champion. Neither is a human  because Kasparov organized a freestyle tournament where teams of humans and computers could work together  and the winning team had no grandmaster  and it had no supercomputer. What they had was better teamwork  and they showed that a team of humans and computers  working together  could beat any computer or any human working alone. Racing with the machine beats racing against the machine. Technology is not destiny. We shape our destiny. Thank you. Let's face it  Driving is dangerous. It's one of the things that we don't like to think about  but the fact that religious icons and good luck charms show up on dashboards around the world betrays the fact that we know this to be true. Car accidents are the leading cause of death in people ages    to    in the United States    leading cause of death    and    percent of these accidents have nothing to do with drugs or alcohol. So what happens  No one can say for sure  but I remember my first accident. I was a young driver out on the highway  and the car in front of me  I saw the brake lights go on. I'm like   Okay  all right  this guy is slowing down  I'll slow down too.  I step on the brake. But no  this guy isn't slowing down. This guy is stopping  dead stop  dead stop on the highway. It was just going       to zero  I slammed on the brakes. I felt the ABS kick in  and the car is still going  and it's not going to stop  and I know it's not going to stop  and the air bag deploys  the car is totaled  and fortunately  no one was hurt. But I had no idea that car was stopping  and I think we can do a lot better than that. I think we can transform the driving experience by letting our cars talk to each other. I just want you to think a little bit about what the experience of driving is like now. Get into your car. Close the door. You're in a glass bubble. You can't really directly sense the world around you. You're in this extended body. You're tasked with navigating it down partially seen roadways  in and amongst other metal giants  at super human speeds. Okay  And all you have to guide you are your two eyes. Okay  so that's all you have  eyes that weren't really designed for this task  but then people ask you to do things like  you want to make a lane change  what's the first thing they ask you do  Take your eyes off the road. That's right. Stop looking where you're going  turn  check your blind spot  and drive down the road without looking where you're going. You and everyone else. This is the safe way to drive. Why do we do this  Because we have to  we have to make a choice  do I look here or do I look here  What's more important  And usually we do a fantastic job picking and choosing what we attend to on the road. But occasionally we miss something. Occasionally we sense something wrong or too late. In countless accidents  the driver says   I didn't see it coming.  And I believe that. I believe that. We can only watch so much. But the technology exists now that can help us improve that. In the future  with cars exchanging data with each other  we will be able to see not just three cars ahead and three cars behind  to the right and left  all at the same time  bird's eye view  we will actually be able to see into those cars. We will be able to see the velocity of the car in front of us  to see how fast that guy's going or stopping. If that guy's going down to zero  I'll know. And with computation and algorithms and predictive models  we will be able to see the future. You may think that's impossible. How can you predict the future  That's really hard. Actually  no. With cars  it's not impossible. Cars are three dimensional objects that have a fixed position and velocity. They travel down roads. Often they travel on pre published routes. It's really not that hard to make reasonable predictions about where a car's going to be in the near future. Even if  when you're in your car and some motorcyclist comes    bshoom        miles an hour down  lane splitting    I know you've had this experience    that guy didn't  just come out of nowhere.  That guy's been on the road probably for the last half hour. Right  I mean  somebody's seen him. Ten         miles back  someone's seen that guy  and as soon as one car sees that guy and puts him on the map  he's on the map    position  velocity  good estimate he'll continue going    miles an hour. You'll know  because your car will know  because that other car will have whispered something in his ear  like   By the way  five minutes  motorcyclist  watch out.  You can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave. I mean  they're Newtonian objects. That's very nice about them. So how do we get there  We can start with something as simple as sharing our position data between cars  just sharing GPS. If I have a GPS and a camera in my car  I have a pretty precise idea of where I am and how fast I'm going. With computer vision  I can estimate where the cars around me are  sort of  and where they're going. And same with the other cars. They can have a precise idea of where they are  and sort of a vague idea of where the other cars are. What happens if two cars share that data  if they talk to each other  I can tell you exactly what happens. Both models improve. Everybody wins. Professor Bob Wang and his team have done computer simulations of what happens when fuzzy estimates combine  even in light traffic  when cars just share GPS data  and we've moved this research out of the computer simulation and into robot test beds that have the actual sensors that are in cars now on these robots  stereo cameras  GPS  and the two dimensional laser range finders that are common in backup systems. We also attach a discrete short range communication radio  and the robots talk to each other. When these robots come at each other  they track each other's position precisely  and they can avoid each other. We're now adding more and more robots into the mix  and we encountered some problems. One of the problems  when you get too much chatter  it's hard to process all the packets  so you have to prioritize  and that's where the predictive model helps you. If your robot cars are all tracking the predicted trajectories  you don't pay as much attention to those packets. You prioritize the one guy who seems to be going a little off course. That guy could be a problem. And you can predict the new trajectory. So you don't only know that he's going off course  you know how. And you know which drivers you need to alert to get out of the way. And we wanted to do    how can we best alert everyone  How can these cars whisper   You need to get out of the way   Well  it depends on two things  one  the ability of the car  and second the ability of the driver. If one guy has a really great car  but they're on their phone or  you know  doing something  they're not probably in the best position to react in an emergency. So we started a separate line of research doing driver state modeling. And now  using a series of three cameras  we can detect if a driver is looking forward  looking away  looking down  on the phone  or having a cup of coffee. We can predict the accident and we can predict who  which cars  are in the best position to move out of the way to calculate the safest route for everyone. Fundamentally  these technologies exist today. I think the biggest problem that we face is our own willingness to share our data. I think it's a very disconcerting notion  this idea that our cars will be watching us  talking about us to other cars  that we'll be going down the road in a sea of gossip. But I believe it can be done in a way that protects our privacy  just like right now  when I look at your car from the outside  I don't really know about you. If I look at your license plate number  I don't really know who you are. I believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs. And I think it's going to be a great thing. I want you to consider for a moment if you really don't want the distracted teenager behind you to know that you're braking  that you're coming to a dead stop. By sharing our data willingly  we can do what's best for everyone. So let your car gossip about you. It's going to make the roads a lot safer. Thank you. I've noticed something interesting about society and culture. Everything risky requires a license. So  learning to drive  owning a gun  getting married. There's a certain    That's true in everything risky  except technology. For some reason  there's no standard syllabus  there's no basic course. They just sort of give you your computer and then kick you out of the nest. You're supposed to learn this stuff    how  Just by osmosis. Nobody ever sits down and tells you   This is how it works.  So today I'm going to tell you ten things that you thought everybody knew  but it turns out they don't. First of all  on the web  if you want to scroll down  don't pick up the mouse and use the scroll bar. That's a terrible waste of time. Do that only if you're paid by the hour. Instead  hit the space bar. The space bar scrolls down one page. Hold down the Shift key to scroll back up again. So  space bar to scroll down one page  works in every browser  in every kind of computer. Also on the web  when you're filling in one of these forms like your addresses  I assume you know that you can hit the Tab key to jump from box to box to box. But what about the pop up menu where you put in your state  Don't open the pop up menu. That's a terrible waste of calories. Type the first letter of your state over and over and over. So if you want Connecticut  go  C  C  C. If you want Texas  go T  T  and you jump right to that thing without even opening the pop up menu. Also on the web  when the text is too small  what you do is hold down the Control key and hit plus  plus  plus. You make the text larger with each tap. Works on every computer  every web browser  or minus  minus  to get smaller again. If you're on the Mac  it might be Command instead. When you're typing on your Blackberry  Android  iPhone  don't bother switching layouts to the punctuation layout to hit the period and then a space  then try to capitalize the next letter. Just hit the space bar twice. The phone puts the period  the space  and the capital for you. Go space  space. It is totally amazing. Also when it comes to cell phones  on all phones  if you want to redial somebody that you've dialed before  all you have to do is hit the call button  and it puts the last phone number into the box for you  and at that point you can hit call again to actually dial it. No need to go to the recent calls list if you're trying to call somebody just hit the call button again. Something that drives me crazy  When I call you and leave a message on your voice mail  I hear you saying   Leave a message   and then I get these    seconds of freaking instructions  like we haven't had answering machines for    years  I'm not bitter. So it turns out there's a keyboard shortcut that lets you jump directly to the beep like this. Phone  At the tone  please... David Pogue  Unfortunately  the carriers didn't adopt the same keystroke  so it's different by carrier  so it devolves upon you to learn the keystroke for the person you're calling. I didn't say these were going to be perfect. So most of you think of Google as something that lets you look up a web page  but it is also a dictionary. Type the word  define  and the word you want to know. You don't even have to click anything. There's the definition as you type. It's also a complete FAA database. Type the name of the airline and the flight. It shows you where the flight is  the gate  the terminal  how long until it lands. You don't need an app. It's also unit and currency conversion. Again  you don't have to click one of the results. Just type it into the box  and there's your answer. While we're talking about text    When you want to highlight    this is just an example    When you want to highlight a word  please don't waste your life dragging across it with the mouse like a newbie. Double click the word. Watch          I go double click  it neatly selects just that word. Also  don't delete what you've highlighted. You can just type over it. This is in every program. Also  you can go double click  drag  to highlight in one word increments as you drag. Much more precise. Again  don't bother deleting. Just type over it. Shutter lag is the time between your pressing the shutter button and the moment the camera actually snaps. It's extremely frustrating on any camera under       . So  that's because the camera needs time to calculate the focus and exposure  but if you pre focus with a half press  leave your finger down    no shutter lag  You get it every time. I've just turned your     camera into a        camera with that trick. And finally  it often happens that you're giving a talk  and for some reason  the audience is looking at the slide instead of at you  So when that happens    this works in Keynote  PowerPoint  it works in every program    all you do is hit the letter B key  B for blackout  to black out the slide  make everybody look at you  and then when you're ready to go on  you hit B again  and if you're really on a roll  you can hit the W key for  whiteout   and you white out the slide  and then you can hit W again to un blank it. So I know I went super fast. If you missed anything  I'll be happy to send you the list of these tips. In the meantime  congratulations. You all get your California Technology License. Have a great day. What you're doing  right now  at this very moment  is killing you. More than cars or the Internet or even that little mobile device we keep talking about  the technology you're using the most almost every day is this  your tush. Nowadays people are sitting  .  hours a day  which is more than we're sleeping  at  .  hours. Sitting is so incredibly prevalent  we don't even question how much we're doing it  and because everyone else is doing it  it doesn't even occur to us that it's not okay. In that way  sitting has become the smoking of our generation. Of course there's health consequences to this  scary ones  besides the waist. Things like breast cancer and colon cancer are directly tied to our lack of physical  activity   Ten percent in fact  on both of those. Six percent for heart disease  seven percent for type   diabetes  which is what my father died of. Now  any of those stats should convince each of us to get off our duff more  but if you're anything like me  it won't. What did get me moving was a social interaction. Someone invited me to a meeting  but couldn't manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting  and said   I have to walk my dogs tomorrow. Could you come then   It seemed kind of odd to do  and actually  that first meeting  I remember thinking   I have to be the one to ask the next question   because I knew I was going to huff and puff during this conversation. And yet  I've taken that idea and made it my own. So instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent lit conference room meetings  I ask people to go on a walking meeting  to the tune of    to    miles a week. It's changed my life. But before that  what actually happened was  I used to think about it as  you could take care of your health  or you could take care of obligations  and one always came at the cost of the other. So now  several hundred of these walking meetings later  I've learned a few things. First  there's this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out of the box thinking. Whether it's nature or the exercise itself  it certainly works. And second  and probably the more reflective one  is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they're really not that way. And if we're going to solve problems and look at the world really differently  whether it's in governance or business or environmental issues  job creation  maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems as having both things be true. Because it was when that happened with this walk and talk idea that things became doable and sustainable and viable. So I started this talk talking about the tush  so I'll end with the bottom line  which is  walk and talk. Walk the talk. You'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking  and in the way that you do  you'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas. Thank you. Well  I have a big announcement to make today  and I'm really excited about this. And this may be a little bit of a surprise to many of you who know my research and what I've done well. I've really tried to solve some big problems  counterterrorism  nuclear terrorism  and health care and diagnosing and treating cancer  but I started thinking about all these problems  and I realized that the really biggest problem we face  what all these other problems come down to  is energy  is electricity  the flow of electrons. And I decided that I was going to set out to try to solve this problem. And this probably is not what you're expecting. You're probably expecting me to come up here and talk about fusion  because that's what I've done most of my life. But this is actually a talk about  okay    but this is actually a talk about fission. It's about perfecting something old  and bringing something old into the   st century. Let's talk a little bit about how nuclear fission works. In a nuclear power plant  you have a big pot of water that's under high pressure  and you have some fuel rods  and these fuel rods are encased in zirconium  and they're little pellets of uranium dioxide fuel  and a fission reaction is controlled and maintained at a proper level  and that reaction heats up water  the water turns to steam  steam turns the turbine  and you produce electricity from it. This is the same way we've been producing electricity  the steam turbine idea  for     years  and nuclear was a really big advancement in a way to heat the water  but you still boil water and that turns to steam and turns the turbine. And I thought  you know  is this the best way to do it  Is fission kind of played out  or is there something left to innovate here  And I realized that I had hit upon something that I think has this huge potential to change the world. And this is what it is. This is a small modular reactor. So it's not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here. This is between    and     megawatts. But that's a ton of power. That's between  say at an average use  that's maybe        to         homes could run off that. Now the really interesting thing about these reactors is they're built in a factory. So they're modular reactors that are built essentially on an assembly line  and they're trucked anywhere in the world  you plop them down  and they produce electricity. This region right here is the reactor. And this is buried below ground  which is really important. For someone who's done a lot of counterterrorism work  I can't extol to you how great having something buried below the ground is for proliferation and security concerns. And inside this reactor is a molten salt  so anybody who's a fan of thorium  they're going to be really excited about this  because these reactors happen to be really good at breeding and burning the thorium fuel cycle  uranium    . But I'm not really concerned about the fuel. You can run these off    they're really hungry  they really like down blended weapons pits  so that's highly enriched uranium and weapons grade plutonium that's been down blended. It's made into a grade where it's not usable for a nuclear weapon  but they love this stuff. And we have a lot of it sitting around  because this is a big problem. You know  in the Cold War  we built up this huge arsenal of nuclear weapons  and that was great  and we don't need them anymore  and what are we doing with all the waste  essentially  What are we doing with all the pits of those nuclear weapons  Well  we're securing them  and it would be great if we could burn them  eat them up  and this reactor loves this stuff. So it's a molten salt reactor. It has a core  and it has a heat exchanger from the hot salt  the radioactive salt  to a cold salt which isn't radioactive. It's still thermally hot but it's not radioactive. And then that's a heat exchanger to what makes this design really  really interesting  and that's a heat exchanger to a gas. So going back to what I was saying before about all power being produced    well  other than photovoltaic    being produced by this boiling of steam and turning a turbine  that's actually not that efficient  and in fact  in a nuclear power plant like this  it's only roughly    to    percent efficient. That's how much thermal energy the reactor's putting out to how much electricity it's producing. And the reason the efficiencies are so low is these reactors operate at pretty low temperature. They operate anywhere from  you know  maybe     to     degrees Celsius. And these reactors run at     to     degrees Celsius  which means the higher the temperature you go to  thermodynamics tells you that you will have higher efficiencies. And this reactor doesn't use water. It uses gas  so supercritical CO  or helium  and that goes into a turbine  and this is called the Brayton cycle. This is the thermodynamic cycle that produces electricity  and this makes this almost    percent efficient  between    and    percent efficiency. And I'm really excited about this  because it's a very compact core. Molten salt reactors are very compact by nature  but what's also great is you get a lot more electricity out for how much uranium you're fissioning  not to mention the fact that these burn up. Their burn up is much higher. So for a given amount of fuel you put in the reactor  a lot more of it's being used. And the problem with a traditional nuclear power plant like this is  you've got these rods that are clad in zirconium  and inside them are uranium dioxide fuel pellets. Well  uranium dioxide's a ceramic  and ceramic doesn't like releasing what's inside of it. So you have what's called the xenon pit  and so some of these fission products love neutrons. They love the neutrons that are going on and helping this reaction take place. And they eat them up  which means that  combined with the fact that the cladding doesn't last very long  you can only run one of these reactors for roughly  say     months without refueling it. So these reactors run for    years without refueling  which is  in my opinion  very  very amazing  because it means it's a sealed system. No refueling means you can seal them up and they're not going to be a proliferation risk  and they're not going to have either nuclear material or radiological material proliferated from their cores. But let's go back to safety  because everybody after Fukushima had to reassess the safety of nuclear  and one of the things when I set out to design a power reactor was it had to be passively and intrinsically safe  and I'm really excited about this reactor for essentially two reasons. One  it doesn't operate at high pressure. So traditional reactors like a pressurized water reactor or boiling water reactor  they're very  very hot water at very high pressures  and this means  essentially  in the event of an accident  if you had any kind of breach of this stainless steel pressure vessel  the coolant would leave the core. These reactors operate at essentially atmospheric pressure  so there's no inclination for the fission products to leave the reactor in the event of an accident. Also  they operate at high temperatures  and the fuel is molten  so they can't melt down  but in the event that the reactor ever went out of tolerances  or you lost off site power in the case of something like Fukushima  there's a dump tank. Because your fuel is liquid  and it's combined with your coolant  you could actually just drain the core into what's called a sub critical setting  basically a tank underneath the reactor that has some neutrons absorbers. And this is really important  because the reaction stops. In this kind of reactor  you can't do that. The fuel  like I said  is ceramic inside zirconium fuel rods  and in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactors  Fukushima and Three Mile Island    looking back at Three Mile Island  we didn't really see this for a while   but these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods  what happens is  when they see high pressure water  steam  in an oxidizing environment  they'll actually produce hydrogen  and that hydrogen has this explosive capability to release fission products. So the core of this reactor  since it's not under pressure and it doesn't have this chemical reactivity  means that there's no inclination for the fission products to leave this reactor. So even in the event of an accident  yeah  the reactor may be toast  which is  you know  sorry for the power company  but we're not going to contaminate large quantities of land. So I really think that in the  say     years it's going to take us to get fusion and make fusion a reality  this could be the source of energy that provides carbon free electricity. Carbon free electricity. And it's an amazing technology because not only does it combat climate change  but it's an innovation. It's a way to bring power to the developing world  because it's produced in a factory and it's cheap. You can put them anywhere in the world you want to. And maybe something else. As a kid  I was obsessed with space. Well  I was obsessed with nuclear science too  to a point  but before that I was obsessed with space  and I was really excited about  you know  being an astronaut and designing rockets  which was something that was always exciting to me. But I think I get to come back to this  because imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket that produces    to     megawatts. That is the rocket designer's dream. That's someone who is designing a habitat on another planet's dream. Not only do you have    to     megawatts to power whatever you want to provide propulsion to get you there  but you have power once you get there. You know  rocket designers who use solar panels or fuel cells  I mean a few watts or kilowatts    wow  that's a lot of power. I mean  now we're talking about     megawatts. That's a ton of power. That could power a Martian community. That could power a rocket there. And so I hope that maybe I'll have an opportunity to kind of explore my rocketry passion at the same time that I explore my nuclear passion. And people say   Oh  well  you've launched this thing  and it's radioactive  into space  and what about accidents   But we launch plutonium batteries all the time. Everybody was really excited about Curiosity  and that had this big plutonium battery on board that has plutonium      which actually has a higher specific activity than the low enriched uranium fuel of these molten salt reactors  which means that the effects would be negligible  because you launch it cold  and when it gets into space is where you actually activate this reactor. So I'm really excited. I think that I've designed this reactor here that can be an innovative source of energy  provide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications  and I'm really prepared to do this. I graduated high school in May  and    I graduated high school in May  and I decided that I was going to start up a company to commercialize these technologies that I've developed  these revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers and these systems to produce medical isotopes  but I want to do this  and I've slowly been building up a team of some of the most incredible people I've ever had the chance to work with  and I'm really prepared to make this a reality. And I think  I think  that looking at the technology  this will be cheaper than or the same price as natural gas  and you don't have to refuel it for    years  which is an advantage for the developing world. And I'll just say one more maybe philosophical thing to end with  which is weird for a scientist. But I think there's something really poetic about using nuclear power to propel us to the stars  because the stars are giant fusion reactors. They're giant nuclear cauldrons in the sky. The energy that I'm able to talk to you today  while it was converted to chemical energy in my food  originally came from a nuclear reaction  and so there's something poetic about  in my opinion  perfecting nuclear fission and using it as a future source of innovative energy. So thank you guys.
