Like many of you  I'm one of the lucky people. I was born to a family where education was pervasive. I'm a third generation PhD  a daughter of two academics. In my childhood  I played around in my father's university lab. So it was taken for granted that I attend some of the best universities  which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity. Unfortunately  most of the people in the world are not so lucky. In some parts of the world  for example  South Africa  education is just not readily accessible. In South Africa  the educational system was constructed in the days of apartheid for the white minority. And as a consequence  today there is just not enough spots for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education. That scarcity led to a crisis in January of this year at the University of Johannesburg. There were a handful of positions left open from the standard admissions process  and the night before they were supposed to open that for registration  thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long  hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions. When the gates opened  there was a stampede  and    people were injured and one woman died. She was a mother who gave her life trying to get her son a chance at a better life. But even in parts of the world like the United States where education is available  it might not be within reach. There has been much discussed in the last few years about the rising cost of health care. What might not be quite as obvious to people is that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition has been increasing at almost twice the rate  for a total of     percent since     . This makes education unaffordable for many people. Finally  even for those who do manage to get the higher education  the doors of opportunity might not open. Only a little over half of recent college graduates in the United States who get a higher education actually are working in jobs that require that education. This  of course  is not true for the students who graduate from the top institutions  but for many others  they do not get the value for their time and their effort. Tom Friedman  in his recent New York Times article  captured  in the way that no one else could  the spirit behind our effort. He said the big breakthroughs are what happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary. I've talked about what's desperately necessary. Let's talk about what's suddenly possible. What's suddenly possible was demonstrated by three big Stanford classes  each of which had an enrollment of         people or more. So to understand this  let's look at one of those classes  the Machine Learning class offered by my colleague and cofounder Andrew Ng. Andrew teaches one of the bigger Stanford classes. It's a Machine Learning class  and it has     people enrolled every time it's offered. When Andrew taught the Machine Learning class to the general public  it had         people registered. So to put that number in perspective  for Andrew to reach that same size audience by teaching a Stanford class  he would have to do that for     years. Of course  he'd get really bored. So  having seen the impact of this  Andrew and I decided that we needed to really try and scale this up  to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could. So we formed Coursera  whose goal is to take the best courses from the best instructors at the best universities and provide it to everyone around the world for free. We currently have    courses on the platform from four universities across a range of disciplines  and let me show you a little bit of an overview of what that looks like. Ezekiel Emanuel  Fifty million people are uninsured. Scott Page  Models help us design more effective institutions and policies. We get unbelievable segregation. Scott Klemmer  So Bush imagined that in the future  you'd wear a camera right in the center of your head. Mitchell Duneier  Mills wants the student of sociology to develop the quality of mind ... RG  Hanging cable takes on the form of a hyperbolic cosine. Nick Parlante  For each pixel in the image  set the red to zero. Paul Offit  ... Vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus. Dan Jurafsky  Does Lufthansa serve breakfast and San Jose  Well  that sounds funny. Daphne Koller  So this is which coin you pick  and this is the two tosses. Andrew Ng  So in large scale machine learning  we'd like to come up with computational ... DK  It turns out  maybe not surprisingly  that students like getting the best content from the best universities for free. Since we opened the website in February  we now have         students from     countries. We have  .  million enrollments    million quizzes in the    classes that have launched so far have been submitted  and    million videos have been viewed. But it's not just about the numbers  it's also about the people. Whether it's Akash  who comes from a small town in India and would never have access in this case to a Stanford quality course and would never be able to afford it. Or Jenny  who is a single mother of two and wants to hone her skills so that she can go back and complete her master's degree. Or Ryan  who can't go to school  because his immune deficient daughter can't be risked to have germs come into the house  so he couldn't leave the house. I'm really glad to say    recently  we've been in correspondence with Ryan    that this story had a happy ending. Baby Shannon    you can see her on the left    is doing much better now  and Ryan got a job by taking some of our courses. So what made these courses so different  After all  online course content has been available for a while. What made it different was that this was real course experience. It started on a given day  and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis and do homework assignments. And these would be real homework assignments for a real grade  with a real deadline. You can see the deadlines and the usage graph. These are the spikes showing that procrastination is global phenomenon. At the end of the course  the students got a certificate. They could present that certificate to a prospective employer and get a better job  and we know many students who did. Some students took their certificate and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled for actual college credit. So these students were really getting something meaningful for their investment of time and effort. Let's talk a little bit about some of the components that go into these courses. The first component is that when you move away from the constraints of a physical classroom and design content explicitly for an online format  you can break away from  for example  the monolithic one hour lecture. You can break up the material  for example  into these short  modular units of eight to    minutes  each of which represents a coherent concept. Students can traverse this material in different ways  depending on their background  their skills or their interests. So  for example  some students might benefit from a little bit of preparatory material that other students might already have. Other students might be interested in a particular enrichment topic that they want to pursue individually. So this format allows us to break away from the one size fits all model of education  and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum. Of course  we all know as educators that students don't learn by sitting and passively watching videos. Perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort is that we need to have students who practice with the material in order to really understand it. There's been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this. This one that appeared in Science last year  for example  demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice  where students are just supposed to repeat what they already learned gives considerably improved results on various achievement tests down the line than many other educational interventions. We've tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform  as well as other forms of practice in many ways. For example  even our videos are not just videos. Every few minutes  the video pauses and the students get asked a question. status quo bias  base rate bias. They're all well documented. So they're all well documented deviations from rational behavior. DK  So here the video pauses  and the student types in the answer into the box and submits. Obviously they weren't paying attention. So they get to try again  and this time they got it right. There's an optional explanation if they want. And now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture. This is a kind of simple question that I as an instructor might ask in class  but when I ask that kind of a question in class     percent of the students are still scribbling the last thing I said     percent are zoned out on Facebook  and then there's the smarty pants in the front row who blurts out the answer before anyone else has had a chance to think about it  and I as the instructor am terribly gratified that somebody actually knew the answer. And so the lecture moves on before  really  most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked. Here  every single student has to engage with the material. And of course these simple retrieval questions are not the end of the story. One needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions  and one also needs to provide the students with feedback on those questions. Now  how do you grade the work of         students if you do not have        TAs  The answer is  you need to use technology to do it for you. Now  fortunately  technology has come a long way  and we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework. In addition to multiple choice and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video  we can also grade math  mathematical expressions as well as mathematical derivations. We can grade models  whether it's financial models in a business class or physical models in a science or engineering class and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments. Let me show you one that's actually pretty simple but fairly visual. This is from Stanford's Computer Science     class  and the students are supposed to color correct that blurry red image. They're typing their program into the browser  and you can see they didn't get it quite right  Lady Liberty is still seasick. And so  the student tries again  and now they got it right  and they're told that  and they can move on to the next assignment. This ability to interact actively with the material and be told when you're right or wrong is really essential to student learning. Now  of course we cannot yet grade the range of work that one needs for all courses. Specifically  what's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work that is so essential in such disciplines as the humanities  the social sciences  business and others. So we tried to convince  for example  some of our humanities faculty that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy. That didn't go over really well. So we had to come up with a different solution. And the solution we ended up using is peer grading. It turns out that previous studies show  like this one by Saddler and Good  that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing reproducible grades. It was tried only in small classes  but there it showed  for example  that these student assigned grades on the y axis are actually very well correlated with the teacher assigned grade on the x axis. What's even more surprising is that self grades  where the students grade their own work critically    so long as you incentivize them properly so they can't give themselves a perfect score    are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades. And so this is an effective strategy that can be used for grading at scale  and is also a useful learning strategy for the students  because they actually learn from the experience. So we now have the largest peer grading pipeline ever devised  where tens of thousands of students are grading each other's work  and quite successfully  I have to say. But this is not just about students sitting alone in their living room working through problems. Around each one of our courses  a community of students had formed  a global community of people around a shared intellectual endeavor. What you see here is a self generated map from students in our Princeton Sociology     course  where they have put themselves on a world map  and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort. Students collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways. First of all  there was a question and answer forum  where students would pose questions  and other students would answer those questions. And the really amazing thing is  because there were so many students  it means that even if a student posed a question at   o'clock in the morning  somewhere around the world  there would be somebody who was awake and working on the same problem. And so  in many of our courses  the median response time for a question on the question and answer forum was    minutes. Which is not a level of service I have ever offered to my Stanford students. And you can see from the student testimonials that students actually find that because of this large online community  they got to interact with each other in many ways that were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom. Students also self assembled  without any kind of intervention from us  into small study groups. Some of these were physical study groups along geographical constraints and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets. This is the San Francisco study group  but there were ones all over the world. Others were virtual study groups  sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines  and on the bottom left there  you see our multicultural universal study group where people explicitly wanted to connect with people from other cultures. There are some tremendous opportunities to be had from this kind of framework. The first is that it has the potential of giving us a completely unprecedented look into understanding human learning. Because the data that we can collect here is unique. You can collect every click  every homework submission  every forum post from tens of thousands of students. So you can turn the study of human learning from the hypothesis driven mode to the data driven mode  a transformation that  for example  has revolutionized biology. You can use these data to understand fundamental questions like  what are good learning strategies that are effective versus ones that are not  And in the context of particular courses  you can ask questions like  what are some of the misconceptions that are more common and how do we help students fix them  So here's an example of that  also from Andrew's Machine Learning class. This is a distribution of wrong answers to one of Andrew's assignments. The answers happen to be pairs of numbers  so you can draw them on this two dimensional plot. Each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer. The big cross at the top left is where       students gave the exact same wrong answer. Now  if two students in a class of     give the same wrong answer  you would never notice. But when       students give the same wrong answer  it's kind of hard to miss. So Andrew and his students went in  looked at some of those assignments  understood the root cause of the misconception  and then they produced a targeted error message that would be provided to every student whose answer fell into that bucket  which means that students who made that same mistake would now get personalized feedback telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively. So this personalization is something that one can then build by having the virtue of large numbers. Personalization is perhaps one of the biggest opportunities here as well  because it provides us with the potential of solving a    year old problem. Educational researcher Benjamin Bloom  in       posed what's called the   sigma problem  which he observed by studying three populations. The first is the population that studied in a lecture based classroom. The second is a population of students that studied using a standard lecture based classroom  but with a mastery based approach  so the students couldn't move on to the next topic before demonstrating mastery of the previous one. And finally  there was a population of students that were taught in a one on one instruction using a tutor. The mastery based population was a full standard deviation  or sigma  in achievement scores better than the standard lecture based class  and the individual tutoring gives you   sigma improvement in performance. To understand what that means  let's look at the lecture based classroom  and let's pick the median performance as a threshold. So in a lecture based class  half the students are above that level and half are below. In the individual tutoring instruction     percent of the students are going to be above that threshold. Imagine if we could teach so that    percent of our students would be above average. Hence  the   sigma problem. Because we cannot afford  as a society  to provide every student with an individual human tutor. But maybe we can afford to provide each student with a computer or a smartphone. So the question is  how can we use technology to push from the left side of the graph  from the blue curve  to the right side with the green curve  Mastery is easy to achieve using a computer  because a computer doesn't get tired of showing you the same video five times. And it doesn't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times  we've seen that in many of the examples that I've shown you. And even personalization is something that we're starting to see the beginnings of  whether it's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum or some of the personalized feedback that we've shown you. So the goal here is to try and push  and see how far we can get towards the green curve. So  if this is so great  are universities now obsolete  Well  Mark Twain certainly thought so. He said that   College is a place where a professor's lecture notes go straight to the students' lecture notes  without passing through the brains of either.  I beg to differ with Mark Twain  though. I think what he was complaining about is not universities but rather the lecture based format that so many universities spend so much time on. So let's go back even further  to Plutarch  who said that   The mind is not a vessel that needs filling  but wood that needs igniting.  And maybe we should spend less time at universities filling our students' minds with content by lecturing at them  and more time igniting their creativity  their imagination and their problem solving skills by actually talking with them. So how do we do that  We do that by doing active learning in the classroom. So there's been many studies  including this one  that show that if you use active learning  interacting with your students in the classroom  performance improves on every single metric    on attendance  on engagement and on learning as measured by a standardized test. You can see  for example  that the achievement score almost doubles in this particular experiment. So maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities. So to summarize  if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free  what would that do  Three things. First it would establish education as a fundamental human right  where anyone around the world with the ability and the motivation could get the skills that they need to make a better life for themselves  their families and their communities. Second  it would enable lifelong learning. It's a shame that for so many people  learning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college. By having this amazing content be available  we would be able to learn something new every time we wanted  whether it's just to expand our minds or it's to change our lives. And finally  this would enable a wave of innovation  because amazing talent can be found anywhere. Maybe the next Albert Einstein or the next Steve Jobs is living somewhere in a remote village in Africa. And if we could offer that person an education  they would be able to come up with the next big idea and make the world a better place for all of us. Thank you very much. Before March        I was a photographic retoucher based in New York City. We're pale  gray creatures. We hide in dark  windowless rooms  and generally avoid sunlight. We make skinny models skinnier  perfect skin more perfect  and the impossible possible  and we get criticized in the press all the time  but some of us are actually talented artists with years of experience and a real appreciation for images and photography. On March           I watched from home  as the rest of the world did  as the tragic events unfolded in Japan. Soon after  an organization I volunteer with  All Hands Volunteers  were on the ground  within days  working as part of the response efforts. I  along with hundreds of other volunteers  knew we couldn't just sit at home  so I decided to join them for three weeks. On May the   th  I made my way to the town of  funato. It's a small fishing town in Iwate Prefecture  about        people  one of the first that was hit by the wave. The waters here have been recorded at reaching over    meters in height  and traveled over two miles inland. As you can imagine  the town had been devastated. We pulled debris from canals and ditches. We cleaned schools. We de mudded and gutted homes ready for renovation and rehabilitation. We cleared tons and tons of stinking  rotting fish carcasses from the local fish processing plant. We got dirty  and we loved it. For weeks  all the volunteers and locals alike had been finding similar things. They'd been finding photos and photo albums and cameras and SD cards. And everyone was doing the same. They were collecting them up  and handing them in to various places around the different towns for safekeeping. Now  it wasn't until this point that I realized that these photos were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had felt. As they had run from the wave  and for their lives  absolutely everything they had  everything had to be left behind. At the end of my first week there  I found myself helping out in an evacuation center in the town. I was helping clean the onsen  the communal onsen  the huge giant bathtubs. This happened to also be a place in the town where the evacuation center was collecting the photos. This is where people were handing them in  and I was honored that day that they actually trusted me to help them start hand cleaning them. Now  it was emotional and it was inspiring  and I've always heard about thinking outside the box  but it wasn't until I had actually gotten outside of my box that something happened. As I looked through the photos  there were some were over a hundred years old  some still in the envelope from the processing lab  I couldn't help but think as a retoucher that I could fix that tear and mend that scratch  and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same. So that evening  I just reached out on Facebook and asked a few of them  and by morning the response had been so overwhelming and so positive  I knew we had to give it a go. So we started retouching photos. This was the very first. Not terribly damaged  but where the water had caused that discoloration on the girl's face had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy. Otherwise  that little girl isn't going to look like that little girl anymore  and surely that's as tragic as having the photo damaged. Over time  more photos came in  thankfully  and more retouchers were needed  and so I reached out again on Facebook and LinkedIn  and within five days     people wanted to help from    different countries. Within two weeks  I had     people wanting to join in. Within Japan  by July  we'd branched out to the neighboring town of Rikuzentakata  further north to a town called Yamada. Once a week  we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up  where people were reclaiming their photos. The older ladies sometimes hadn't seen a scanner before  but within    minutes of them finding their lost photo  they could give it to us  have it scanned  uploaded to a cloud server  it would be downloaded by a gaijin  a stranger  somewhere on the other side of the globe  and it'd start being fixed. The time it took  however  to get it back is a completely different story  and it depended obviously on the damage involved. It could take an hour. It could take weeks. It could take months. The kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand drawn  or pieced together  picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water hadn't damaged. It was very time consuming. Now  all these photos had been damaged by water  submerged in salt water  covered in bacteria  in sewage  sometimes even in oil  all of which over time is going to continue to damage them  so hand cleaning them was a huge part of the project. We couldn't retouch the photo unless it was cleaned  dry and reclaimed. Now  we were lucky with our hand cleaning. We had an amazing local woman who guided us. It's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos. As my team leader Wynne once said  it's like doing a tattoo on someone. You don't get a chance to mess it up. The lady who brought us these photos was lucky  as far as the photos go. She had started hand cleaning them herself and stopped when she realized she was doing more damage. She also had duplicates. Areas like her husband and her face  which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fix  we could just put them together in one good photo  and remake the whole photo. When she collected the photos from us  she shared a bit of her story with us. Her photos were found by her husband's colleagues at a local fire department in the debris a long way from where the home had once stood  and they'd recognized him. The day of the tsunami  he'd actually been in charge of making sure the tsunami gates were closed. He had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded. Her two little boys  not so little anymore  but her two boys were both at school  separate schools. One of them got caught up in the water. It took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survived. The day I gave her the photos also happened to be her youngest son's   th birthday. For her  despite all of this  those photos were the perfect gift back to him  something he could look at again  something he remembered from before that wasn't still scarred from that day in March when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destroyed. After six months in Japan        volunteers had passed through All Hands  hundreds of whom had helped us hand clean over         photographs  the large majority    Applause    a large majority of which did actually find their home again  importantly. Over five hundred volunteers around the globe helped us get    families hundreds of photographs back  fully restored and retouched. During this time  we hadn't really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials  most of which was printer inks. We take photos constantly. A photo is a reminder of someone or something  a place  a relationship  a loved one. They're our memory keepers and our histories  the last thing we would grab and the first thing you'd go back to look for. That's all this project was about  about restoring those little bits of humanity  giving someone that connection back. When a photo like this can be returned to someone like this  it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it. The project's also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers. For some of them  it's given them a connection to something bigger  giving something back  using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin. I would like to conclude by reading an email I got from one of them  Cindy  the day I finally got back from Japan after six months.  As I worked  I couldn't help but think about the individuals and the stories represented in the images. One in particular  a photo of women of all ages  from grandmother to little girl  gathered around a baby  struck a chord  because a similar photo from my family  my grandmother and mother  myself  and newborn daughter  hangs on our wall. Across the globe  throughout the ages  our basic needs are just the same  aren't they   Thank you.  Applause  I thought if I skipped it might help my nerves  but I'm actually having a paradoxical reaction to that  so that was a bad idea.  Laughter  Anyway  I was really delighted to receive the invitation to present to you some of my music and some of my work as a composer  presumably because it appeals to my well known and abundant narcissism.  Laughter  And I'm not kidding  I just think we should just say that and move forward.  Laughter  So  but the thing is  a dilemma quickly arose  and that is that I'm really bored with music  and I'm really bored with the role of the composer  and so I decided to put that idea  boredom  as the focus of my presentation to you today. And I'm going to share my music with you  but I hope that I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story  tells a story about how I used boredom as a catalyst for creativity and invention  and how boredom actually forced me to change the fundamental question that I was asking in my discipline  and how boredom also  in a sense  pushed me towards taking on roles beyond the sort of most traditional  narrow definition of a composer. What I'd like to do today is to start with an excerpt of a piece of music at the piano. Okay  I wrote that.  Laughter  No  it's not    Applause  Oh  why thank you. No  no  I didn't write that. In fact  that was a piece by Beethoven  and so I was not functioning as a composer. Just now I was functioning in the role of the interpreter  and there I am  interpreter. So  an interpreter of what  Of a piece of music  right  But we can ask the question   But is it music   And I say this rhetorically  because of course by just about any standard we would have to concede that this is  of course  a piece of music  but I put this here now because  just to set it in your brains for the moment  because we're going to return to this question. It's going to be a kind of a refrain as we go through the presentation. So here we have this piece of music by Beethoven  and my problem with it is  it's boring. I mean  you   I'm just like  a hush  huh    It's like     Laughter  It's Beethoven  how can you say that  No  well  I don't know  it's very familiar to me. I had to practice it as a kid  and I'm really sick of it. So     Laughter  I would  so what I might like to try to do is to change it  to transform it in some ways  to personalize it  so I might take the opening  like this idea    and then I might substitute     Music  and then I might improvise on that melody that goes forward from there     Music  So that might be the kind of thing    Why thank you. That would be the kind of thing that I would do  and it's not necessarily better than the Beethoven. In fact  I think it's not better than it. The thing is     Laughter     it's more interesting to me. It's less boring for me. I'm really leaning into me  because I  because I have to think about what decisions I'm going to make on the fly as that Beethoven text is running in time through my head and I'm trying to figure out what kinds of transformations I'm going to make to it. So this is an engaging enterprise for me  and I've really leaned into that first person pronoun thing there  and now my face appears twice  so I think we can agree that this is a fundamentally solipsistic enterprise.  Laughter  But it's an engaging one  and it's interesting to me for a while  but then I get bored with it  and by it  I actually mean  the piano  because it becomes  it's this familiar instrument  it's timbral range is actually pretty compressed  at least when you play on the keyboard  and if you're not doing things like listening to it after you've lit it on fire or something like that  you know. It gets a little bit boring  and so pretty soon I go through other instruments  they become familiar  and eventually I find myself designing and constructing my own instrument  and I brought one with me today  and I thought I would play a little bit on it for you so you can hear what it sounds like. You gotta have doorstops  that's important.  Laughter  I've got combs. They're the only combs that I own.  Music  They're all mounted on my instruments.  Laughter  I can actually do all sorts of things. I can play with a violin bow. I don't have to use the chopsticks. So we have this sound.  Music  And with a bank of live electronics  I can change the sounds radically.  Music  Like that  and like this.  Music  And so forth. So this gives you a little bit of an idea of the sound world of this instrument  which I think is quite interesting and it puts me in the role of the inventor  and the nice thing about   This instrument is called the Mouseketeer ...  Laughter  and the cool thing about it is I'm the world's greatest Mouseketeer player.  Laughter  Okay   Applause  So in that regard  this is one of the things  this is one of the privileges of being  and here's another role  the inventor  and by the way  when I told you that I'm the world's greatest  if you're keeping score  we've had narcissism and solipsism and now a healthy dose of egocentricism. I know some of you are just  you know  bingo  Or  I don't know.  Laughter  Anyway  so this is also a really enjoyable role. I should concede also that I'm the world's worst Mouseketeer player  and it was this distinction that I was most worried about when I was on that prior side of the tenure divide. I'm glad I'm past that. We're not going to go into that. I'm crying on the inside. There are still scars. Anyway  but I guess my point is that all of these enterprises are engaging to me in their multiplicity  but as I've presented them to you today  they're actually solitary enterprises  and so pretty soon I want to commune with other people  and so I'm delighted that in fact I get to compose works for them. I get to write  sometimes for soloists and I get to work with one person  sometimes full orchestras  and I work with a lot of people  and this is probably the capacity  the role creatively for which I'm probably best known professionally. Now  some of my scores as a composer look like this  and others look like this  and some look like this  and I make all of these by hand  and it's really tedious. It takes a long  long time to make these scores  and right now I'm working on a piece that's     pages in length  and it's just a big chunk of my life  and I'm just pulling out hair. I have a lot of it  and that's a good thing I suppose.  Laughter  So this gets really boring and really tiresome for me  so after a while the process of notating is not only boring  but I actually want the notation to be more interesting  and so that's pushed me to do other projects like this one. This is an excerpt from a score called  The Metaphysics of Notation.  The full score is    feet wide. It's a bunch of crazy pictographic notation. Let's zoom in on one section of it right here. You can see it's rather detailed. I do all of this with drafting templates  with straight edges  with French curves  and by freehand  and the    feet was actually split into    six foot wide panels that were installed around the Cantor Arts Center Museum lobby balcony  and it appeared for one year in the museum  and during that year  it was experienced as visual art most of the week  except  as you can see in these pictures  on Fridays  from noon til one  and only during that time  various performers came and interpreted these strange and undefined pictographic glyphs.  Laughter  Now this was a really exciting experience for me. It was gratifying musically  but I think the more important thing is it was exciting because I got to take on another role  especially given that it appeared in a museum  and that is as visual artist.  Laughter  We're going to fill up the whole thing  don't worry.  Laughter  I am multitudes.  Laughter  So one of the things is that  I mean  some people would say  like   Oh  you're being a dilettante   and maybe that's true. I can understand how  I mean  because I don't have a pedigree in visual art and I don't have any training  but it's just something that I wanted to do as an extension of my composition  as an extension of a kind of creative impulse. I can understand the question  though.  But is it music   I mean  there's not any traditional notation. I can also understand that sort of implicit criticism in this piece   S tog   which I made when I was living in Copenhagen. I took the Copenhagen subway map and I renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations  and the players  who are synchronized with stopwatches  follow the timetables  which are listed in minutes past the hour. So this is a case of actually adapting something  or maybe stealing something  and then turning it into a musical notation. Another adaptation would be this piece. I took the idea of the wristwatch  and I turned it into a musical score. I made my own faces  and had a company fabricate them  and the players follow these scores. They follow the second hands  and as they pass over the various symbols  the players respond musically. Here's another example from another piece  and then its realization. So in these two capacities  I've been scavenger  in the sense of taking  like  the subway map  right  or thief maybe  and I've also been designer  in the case of making the wristwatches. And once again  this is  for me  interesting. Another role that I like to take on is that of the performance artist. Some of my pieces have these kind of weird theatric elements  and I often perform them. I want to show you a clip from a piece called  Echolalia.  This is actually being performed by Brian McWhorter  who is an extraordinary performer. Let's watch a little bit of this  and please notice the instrumentation. Okay  I hear you were laughing nervously because you too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp  the intonation was a little questionable.  Laughter  Let's watch just another clip. You can see the mayhem continues  and there's  you know  there were no clarinets and trumpets and flutes and violins. Here's a piece that has an even more unusual  more peculiar instrumentation. This is  Tl n   for three conductors and no players.  Laughter  This was based on the experience of actually watching two people having a virulent argument in sign language  which produced no decibels to speak of  but affectively  psychologically  was a very loud experience. So  yeah  I get it  with  like  the weird appliances and then the total absence of conventional instruments and this glut of conductors  people might  you know  wonder  yeah   Is this music   But let's move on to a piece where clearly I'm behaving myself  and that is my  Concerto for Orchestra.  You're going to notice a lot of conventional instruments in this clip.  Music  This  in fact  is not the title of this piece. I was a bit mischievous. In fact  to make it more interesting  I put a space right in here  and this is the actual title of the piece. Let's continue with that same excerpt. It's better with a florist  right   Laughter   Music  Or at least it's less boring. Let's watch a couple more clips. So with all these theatric elements  this pushes me in another role  and that would be  possibly  the dramaturge. I was playing nice. I had to write the orchestra bits  right  Okay  But then there was this other stuff  right  There was the florist  and I can understand that  once again  we're putting pressure on the ontology of music as we know it conventionally  but let's look at one last piece today I'm going to share with you. This is going to be a piece called  Aphasia   and it's for hand gestures synchronized to sound  and this invites yet another role  and final one I'll share with you  which is that of the choreographer. And the score for the piece looks like this  and it instructs me  the performer  to make various hand gestures at very specific times synchronized with an audio tape  and that audio tape is made up exclusively of vocal samples. I recorded an awesome singer  and I took the sound of his voice in my computer  and I warped it in countless ways to come up with the soundtrack that you're about to hear. And I'll perform just an excerpt of  Aphasia  for you here. Okay  So that gives you a little taste of that piece.  Applause  Yeah  okay  that's kind of weird stuff. Is it music  Here's how I want to conclude. I've decided  ultimately  that this is the wrong question  that this is not the important question. The important question is   Is it interesting   And I follow this question  not worrying about  Is it music      not worrying about the definition of the thing that I'm making. I allow my creativity to push me in directions that are simply interesting to me  and I don't worry about the likeness of the result to some notion  some paradigm  of what music composition is supposed to be  and that has actually urged me  in a sense  to take on a whole bunch of different roles  and so what I want you to think about is  to what extent might you change the fundamental question in your discipline  and  okay  I'm going to put one extra little footnote in here  because  like  I realized I mentioned some psychological defects earlier  and we also  along the way  had a fair amount of obsessive behavior  and there was some delusional behavior and things like that  and here I think we could say that this is an argument for self loathing and a kind of schizophrenia  at least in the popular use of the term  and I really mean dissociative identity disorder  okay.  Laughter  Anyway  despite those perils  I would urge you to think about the possibility that you might take on roles in your own work  whether they are neighboring or far flung from your professional definition. And with that  I thank you very much.  Applause  In half a century of trying to help prevent wars  there's one question that never leaves me  How do we deal with extreme violence without using force in return  When you're faced with brutality  whether it's a child facing a bully on a playground or domestic violence    or  on the streets of Syria today  facing tanks and shrapnel  what's the most effective thing to do  Fight back  Give in  Use more force  This question   How do I deal with a bully without becoming a thug in return   has been with me ever since I was a child. I remember I was about     glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents' living room as Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest  and kids not much older than me were throwing themselves at the tanks and getting mown down. And I rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase. And my mother came up and said   What on Earth are you doing   And I said   I'm going to Budapest.  And she said   What on Earth for   And I said   Kids are getting killed there. There's something terrible happening.  And she said   Don't be so silly.  And I started to cry. And she got it  she said   Okay  I see it's serious. You're much too young to help. You need training. I'll help you. But just unpack your suitcase.  And so I got some training and went and worked in Africa during most of my   s. But I realized that what I really needed to know I couldn't get from training courses. I wanted to understand how violence  how oppression  works. And what I've discovered since is this  Bullies use violence in three ways. They use political violence to intimidate  physical violence to terrorize and mental or emotional violence to undermine. And only very rarely in very few cases does it work to use more violence. Nelson Mandela went to jail believing in violence  and    years later he and his colleagues had slowly and carefully honed the skills  the incredible skills  that they needed to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known into a democracy. And they did it in a total devotion to non violence. They realized that using force against force doesn't work. So what does work  Over time I've collected about a half dozen methods that do work    of course there are many more    that do work and that are effective. And the first is that the change that has to take place has to take place here  inside me. It's my response  my attitude  to oppression that I've got control over  and that I can do something about. And what I need to develop is self knowledge to do that. That means I need to know how I tick  when I collapse  where my formidable points are  where my weaker points are. When do I give in  What will I stand up for  And meditation or self inspection is one of the ways    again it's not the only one    it's one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power. And my heroine here    like Satish's    is Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma. She was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of Rangoon. They came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns. And she realized straight away that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers were more scared than the student protesters behind her. But she told the students to sit down. And she walked forward with such calm and such clarity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun  put her hand on it and lower it. And no one got killed. So that's what the mastery of fear can do    not only faced with machine guns  but if you meet a knife fight in the street. But we have to practice. So what about our fear  I have a little mantra. My fear grows fat on the energy I feed it. And if it grows very big it probably happens. So we all know the three o'clock in the morning syndrome  when something you've been worrying about wakes you up    I see a lot of people    and for an hour you toss and turn  it gets worse and worse  and by four o'clock you're pinned to the pillow by a monster this big. The only thing to do is to get up  make a cup of tea and sit down with the fear like a child beside you. You're the adult. The fear is the child. And you talk to the fear and you ask it what it wants  what it needs. How can this be made better  How can the child feel stronger  And you make a plan. And you say   Okay  now we're going back to sleep. Half past seven  we're getting up and that's what we're going to do.  I had one of these   a.m. episodes on Sunday    paralyzed with fear at coming to talk to you. So I did the thing. I got up  made the cup of tea  sat down with it  did it all and I'm here    still partly paralyzed  but I'm here. So that's fear. What about anger  Wherever there is injustice there's anger. But anger is like gasoline  and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match  you've got an inferno. But anger as an engine    in an engine    is powerful. If we can put our anger inside an engine  it can drive us forward  it can get us through the dreadful moments and it can give us real inner power. And I learned this in my work with nuclear weapon policy makers. Because at the beginning I was so outraged at the dangers they were exposing us to that I just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong. Totally ineffective. In order to develop a dialogue for change we have to deal with our anger. It's okay to be angry with the thing    the nuclear weapons in this case    but it is hopeless to be angry with the people. They are human beings just like us. And they're doing what they think is best. And that's the basis on which we have to talk with them. So that's the third one  anger. And it brings me to the crux of what's going on  or what I perceive as going on  in the world today  which is that last century was top down power. It was still governments telling people what to do. This century there's a shift. It's bottom up or grassroots power. It's like mushrooms coming through concrete. It's people joining up with people  as Bundy just said  miles away to bring about change. And Peace Direct spotted quite early on that local people in areas of very hot conflict know what to do. They know best what to do. So Peace Direct gets behind them to do that. And the kind of thing they're doing is demobilizing militias  rebuilding economies  resettling refugees  even liberating child soldiers. And they have to risk their lives almost every day to do this. And what they've realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less humane  but it's less effective than using methods that connect people with people  that rebuild. And I think that the U.S. military is finally beginning to get this. Up to now their counter terrorism policy has been to kill insurgents at almost any cost  and if civilians get in the way  that's written as  collateral damage.  And this is so infuriating and humiliating for the population of Afghanistan  that it makes the recruitment for al Qaeda very easy  when people are so disgusted by  for example  the burning of the Koran. So the training of the troops has to change. And I think there are signs that it is beginning to change. The British military have always been much better at this. But there is one magnificent example for them to take their cue from  and that's a brilliant U.S. lieutenant colonel called Chris Hughes. And he was leading his men down the streets of Najaf    in Iraq actually    and suddenly people were pouring out of the houses on either side of the road  screaming  yelling  furiously angry  and surrounded these very young troops who were completely terrified  didn't know what was going on  couldn't speak Arabic. And Chris Hughes strode into the middle of the throng with his weapon above his head  pointing at the ground  and he said   Kneel.  And these huge soldiers with their backpacks and their body armor  wobbled to the ground. And complete silence fell. And after about two minutes  everybody moved aside and went home. Now that to me is wisdom in action. In the moment  that's what he did. And it's happening everywhere now. You don't believe me  Have you asked yourselves why and how so many dictatorships have collapsed over the last    years  Dictatorships in Czechoslovakia  East Germany  Estonia  Latvia  Lithuania  Mali  Madagascar  Poland  the Philippines  Serbia  Slovenia  I could go on  and now Tunisia and Egypt. And this hasn't just happened. A lot of it is due to a book written by an    year old man in Boston  Gene Sharp. He wrote a book called  From Dictatorship to Democracy  with    methodologies for non violent resistance. And it's been translated into    languages. It's flown around the world. And it's being used by young people and older people everywhere  because it works and it's effective. So this is what gives me hope    not just hope  this is what makes me feel very positive right now. Because finally human beings are getting it. We're getting practical  doable methodologies to answer my question  How do we deal with a bully without becoming a thug  We're using the kind of skills that I've outlined  inner power    the development of inner power    through self knowledge  recognizing and working with our fear  using anger as a fuel  cooperating with others  banding together with others  courage  and most importantly  commitment to active non violence. Now I don't just believe in non violence. I don't have to believe in it. I see evidence everywhere of how it works. And I see that we  ordinary people  can do what Aung San Suu Kyi and Ghandi and Mandela did. We can bring to an end the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known. And we can organize to overcome oppression by opening our hearts as well as strengthening this incredible resolve. And this open heartedness is exactly what I've experienced in the entire organization of this gathering since I got here yesterday. Thank you. In Oxford in the     s  there was a fantastic doctor  who was very unusual  named Alice Stewart. And Alice was unusual partly because  of course  she was a woman  which was pretty rare in the     s. And she was brilliant  she was one of the  at the time  the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Physicians. She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married  after she had kids  and even after she got divorced and was a single parent  she continued her medical work. And she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science  the emerging field of epidemiology  the study of patterns in disease. But like every scientist  she appreciated that to make her mark  what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it. The hard problem that Alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers. Most disease is correlated with poverty  but in the case of childhood cancers  the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from affluent families. So  what  she wanted to know  could explain this anomaly  Now  Alice had trouble getting funding for her research. In the end  she got just       pounds from the Lady Tata Memorial prize. And that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data. Now  she had no idea what to look for. This really was a needle in a haystack sort of search  so she asked everything she could think of. Had the children eaten boiled sweets  Had they consumed colored drinks  Did they eat fish and chips  Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing  What time of life had they started school  And when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back  one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of. By a rate of two to one  the children who had died had had mothers who had been X rayed when pregnant. Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom. Conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point  a threshold. It flew in the face of conventional wisdom  which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology of that age  which was the X ray machine. And it flew in the face of doctors' idea of themselves  which was as people who helped patients  they didn't harm them. Nevertheless  Alice Stewart rushed to publish her preliminary findings in The Lancet in     . People got very excited  there was talk of the Nobel Prize  and Alice really was in a big hurry to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find before they disappeared. In fact  she need not have hurried. It was fully    years before the British and medical    British and American medical establishments abandoned the practice of X raying pregnant women. The data was out there  it was open  it was freely available  but nobody wanted to know. A child a week was dying  but nothing changed. Openness alone can't drive change. So for    years Alice Stewart had a very big fight on her hands. So  how did she know that she was right  Well  she had a fantastic model for thinking. She worked with a statistician named George Kneale  and George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn't. So  Alice was very outgoing and sociable  and George was a recluse. Alice was very warm  very empathetic with her patients. George frankly preferred numbers to people. But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship. He said   My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong.  He actively sought disconfirmation. Different ways of looking at her models  at her statistics  different ways of crunching the data in order to disprove her. He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories. Because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong  that George could give Alice the confidence she needed to know that she was right. It's a fantastic model of collaboration    thinking partners who aren't echo chambers. I wonder how many of us have  or dare to have  such collaborators. Alice and George were very good at conflict. They saw it as thinking. So what does that kind of constructive conflict require  Well  first of all  it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves. That means we have to resist the neurobiological drive  which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves  and it means we have to seek out people with different backgrounds  different disciplines  different ways of thinking and different experience  and find ways to engage with them. That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy. And the more I've thought about this  the more I think  really  that that's a kind of love. Because you simply won't commit that kind of energy and time if you don't really care. And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds. Alice's daughter told me that every time Alice went head to head with a fellow scientist  they made her think and think and think again.  My mother   she said   My mother didn't enjoy a fight  but she was really good at them.  So it's one thing to do that in a one to one relationship. But it strikes me that the biggest problems we face  many of the biggest disasters that we've experienced  mostly haven't come from individuals  they've come from organizations  some of them bigger than countries  many of them capable of affecting hundreds  thousands  even millions of lives. So how do organizations think  Well  for the most part  they don't. And that isn't because they don't want to  it's really because they can't. And they can't because the people inside of them are too afraid of conflict. In surveys of European and American executives  fully    percent of them acknowledged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise. Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke  afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage  and felt that they were bound to lose. Eighty five percent is a really big number. It means that organizations mostly can't do what George and Alice so triumphantly did. They can't think together. And it means that people like many of us  who have run organizations  and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can  mostly fail to get the best out of them. So how do we develop the skills that we need  Because it does take skill and practice  too. If we aren't going to be afraid of conflict  we have to see it as thinking  and then we have to get really good at it. So  recently  I worked with an executive named Joe  and Joe worked for a medical device company. And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on. He thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created margins of error that could really hurt people. He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help. But when he looked around his organization  nobody else seemed to be at all worried. So  he didn't really want to say anything. After all  maybe they knew something he didn't. Maybe he'd look stupid. But he kept worrying about it  and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved. In the end  Joe and I found a way for him to raise his concerns. And what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation. It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doubts. So now Joe had allies. They could think together. And yes  there was a lot of conflict and debate and argument  but that allowed everyone around the table to be creative  to solve the problem  and to change the device. Joe was what a lot of people might think of as a whistle blower  except that like almost all whistle blowers  he wasn't a crank at all  he was passionately devoted to the organization and the higher purposes that that organization served. But he had been so afraid of conflict  until finally he became more afraid of the silence. And when he dared to speak  he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined. And his colleagues don't think of him as a crank. They think of him as a leader. So  how do we have these conversations more easily and more often  Well  the University of Delft requires that its PhD students have to submit five statements that they're prepared to defend. It doesn't really matter what the statements are about  what matters is that the candidates are willing and able to stand up to authority. I think it's a fantastic system  but I think leaving it to PhD candidates is far too few people  and way too late in life. I think we need to be teaching these skills to kids and adults at every stage of their development  if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society. The fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we've witnessed rarely come from information that is secret or hidden. It comes from information that is freely available and out there  but that we are willfully blind to  because we can't handle  don't want to handle  the conflict that it provokes. But when we dare to break that silence  or when we dare to see  and we create conflict  we enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking. Open information is fantastic  open networks are essential. But the truth won't set us free until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent and the moral courage to use it. Openness isn't the end. It's the beginning. So  well  I do applied math  and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math  is that we are like management consultants. No one knows what the hell we do. So I am going to give you some    attempt today to try and explain to you what I do. So  dancing is one of the most human of activities. We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you will see later on. Now  ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill  and probably a level of initial suitability that may well have a genetic component to it. Now  sadly  neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability  as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling  who was a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time. So great progress and treatment has been made over the years. However  there are  .  million people worldwide who have the disease  and they have to live with incurable weakness  tremor  rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease  so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late. We need to be able to measure progression objectively  and ultimately  the only way we're going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure. But frustratingly  with Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders  there are no biomarkers  so there's no simple blood test that you can do  and the best that we have is like this    minute neurologist test. You have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very  very costly  and that means that  outside the clinical trials  it's just never done. It's never done. But what if patients could do this test at home  Now  that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic  and what if patients could do that test themselves  right  No expensive staff time required. Takes about       by the way  in the neurologist's clinic to do it. So what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this  because  you see  in one sense  at least  we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling. So here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds. Now  this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds  and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers  because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds  and we all actually have the genes for it. FoxP   for example. And like ballet  it takes an extraordinary level of training. I mean  just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak. From the sound  we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibrates  and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson's  so too are the vocal organs. So on the bottom trace  you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor. We see all the same symptoms. We see vocal tremor  weakness and rigidity. The speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy after a while  and that's one of the example symptoms of it. So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle  in some cases  but with any digital microphone  and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning  which is very advanced by now  we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone. So these voice based tests  how do they stack up against expert clinical tests  We'll  they're both non invasive. The neurologist's test is non invasive. They both use existing infrastructure. You don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it. And they're both accurate. Okay  but in addition  voice based tests are non expert. That means they can be self administered. They're high speed  take about    seconds at most. They're ultra low cost  and we all know what happens. When something becomes ultra low cost  it becomes massively scalable. So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now. We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients. No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup. We can do high frequency monitoring to get objective data. We can perform low cost mass recruitment for clinical trials  and we can make population scale screening feasible for the first time. We have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it's too late. So  taking the first steps towards this today  we're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative. With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe  we're aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals. We have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet. Anyone healthy or with Parkinson's can call in  cheaply  and leave recordings  a few cents each  and I'm really happy to announce that we've already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours. Thank you.  Applause  Tom Rielly  So Max  by taking all these samples of  let's say         people  you'll be able to tell who's healthy and who's not  What are you going to get out of those samples  Max Little  Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that  during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not  you see. TR  Right. ML  You see  some people may not do it. They may not get through it. But we'll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances  and it's getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors  and looking for the actual markers of the disease. TR  So you're    percent accurate right now  ML  It's much better than that. Actually  my student Thanasis  I have to plug him  because he's done some fantastic work  and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well  which enables this project  and we're getting    percent accuracy. TR  Ninety nine. Well  that's an improvement. So what that means is that people will be able to   ML   Laughs  TR  People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test  and people with Parkinson's could call in  record their voice  and then their doctor can check up on their progress  see where they're doing in this course of the disease. ML  Absolutely. TR  Thanks so much. Max Little  everybody. ML  Thanks  Tom.  Applause  The will to live life differently can start in some of the most unusual places. This is where I come from  Todmorden. It's a market town in the north of England         people  between Leeds and Manchester  fairly normal market town. It used to look like this  and now it's more like this  with fruit and veg and herbs sprouting up all over the place. We call it propaganda gardening.  Laughter  Corner row railway  station car park  front of a health center  people's front gardens  and even in front of the police station.  Laughter  We've got edible canal towpaths  and we've got sprouting cemeteries. The soil is extremely good.  Laughter  We've even invented a new form of tourism. It's called vegetable tourism  and believe it or not  people come from all over the world to poke around in our raised beds  even when there's not much growing.  Laughter  But it starts a conversation.  Laughter  And  you know  we're not doing it because we're bored.  Laughter  We're doing it because we want to start a revolution. We tried to answer this simple question  Can you find a unifying language that cuts across age and income and culture that will help people themselves find a new way of living  see spaces around them differently  think about the resources they use differently  interact differently  Can we find that language  And then  can we replicate those actions  And the answer would appear to be yes  and the language would appear to be food. So  three and a half years ago  a few of us sat around a kitchen table and we just invented the whole thing.  Laughter  We came up with a really simple game plan that we put to a public meeting. We did not consult. We did not write a report. Enough of all that.  Laughter  And we said to that public meeting in Todmorden  look  let's imagine that our town is focused around three plates  a community plate  the way we live our everyday lives  a learning plate  what we teach our kids in school and what new skills we share amongst ourselves  and business  what we do with the pound in our pocket and which businesses we choose to support. Now  let's imagine those plates agitated with community actions around food. If we start one of those community plates spinning  that's really great  that really starts to empower people  but if we can then spin that community plate with the learning plate  and then spin it with the business plate  we've got a real show there  we've got some action theater. We're starting to build resilience ourselves. We're starting to reinvent community ourselves  and we've done it all without a flipping strategy document. And here's the thing as well. We've not asked anybody's permission to do this  we're just doing it.  Laughter  And we are certainly not waiting for that check to drop through the letterbox before we start  and most importantly of all  we are not daunted by the sophisticated arguments that say   These small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow's problems   because I have seen the power of small actions  and it is awesome. So  back to the public meeting.  Laughter  We put that proposition to the meeting  two seconds  and then the room exploded. I have never  ever experienced anything like that in my life. And it's been the same in every single room  in every town that we've ever told our story. People are ready and respond to the story of food. They want positive actions they can engage in  and in their bones  they know it's time to take personal responsibility and invest in more kindness to each other and to the environment. And since we had that meeting three and a half years ago  it's been a heck of a roller coaster. We started with a seed swap  really simple stuff  and then we took an area of land  a strip on the side of our main road  which was a dog toilet  basically  and we turned it into a really lovely herb garden. We took the corner of the car park in the station that you saw  and we made vegetable beds for everybody to share and pick from themselves. We went to the doctors. We've just had a   million pound health center built in Todmorden  and for some reason that I cannot comprehend  it has been surrounded by prickly plants.  Laughter  So we went to the doctors  said   Would you mind us taking them up   They said   Absolutely fine  provided you get planning permission and you do it in Latin and you do it in triplicate   so we did    Laughter    and now there are fruit trees and bushes and herbs and vegetables around that doctor's surgery. And there's been lots of other examples  like the corn that was in front of the police station  and the old people's home that we've planted it with food that they can pick and grow. But it isn't just about growing  because we all are part of this jigsaw. It's about taking those artistic people in your community and doing some fabulous designs in those raised beds to explain to people what's growing there  because there's so many people that don't really recognize a vegetable unless it's in a bit of plastic with a bit of an instruction packet on the top.  Laughter  So we have some people who designed these things   If it looks like this  please don't pick it  but if it looks like this  help yourself.  This is about sharing and investing in kindness. And for those people that don't want to do either of those things  maybe they can cook  so we pick them seasonally and then we go on the street  or in the pub  or in the church  or wherever people are living their lives. This is about us going to the people and saying   We are all part of the local food jigsaw  we are all part of a solution.  And then  because we know we've got vegetable tourists and we love them to bits and they're absolutely fantastic  we thought  what could we do to give them an even better experience  So we invented  without asking  of course  the Incredible Edible Green Route. And this is a route of exhibition gardens  and edible towpaths  and bee friendly sites  and the story of pollinators  and it's a route that we designed that takes people through the whole of our town  past our cafes and our small shops  through our market  not just to and fro from the supermarket  and we're hoping that  in changing people's footfall around our town  we're also changing their behavior. And then there's the second plate  the learning plate. Well  we're in partnership with a high school. We've created a company. We are designing and building an aquaponics unit in some land that was spare at the back of the high school  like you do  and now we're going to be growing fish and vegetables in an orchard with bees  and the kids are helping us build that  and the kids are on the board  and because the community was really keen on working with the high school  the high school is now teaching agriculture  and because it's teaching agriculture  we started to think  how could we then get those kids that never had a qualification before in their lives but are really excited about growing  how can we give them some more experience  So we got some land that was donated by a local garden center. It was really quite muddy  but in a truly incredible way  totally voluntary led  we have turned that into a market garden training center  and that is polytunnels and raised beds and all the things you need to get the soil under your fingers and think maybe there's a job in this for me in the future. And because we were doing that  some local academics said   You know  we could help design a commercial horticulture course for you. There's not one that we know of.  So they're doing that  and we're going to launch it later this year  and it's all an experiment  and it's all voluntary. And then there's the third plate  because if you walk through an edible landscape  and if you're learning new skills  and if you start to get interested in what's growing seasonally  you might just want to spend more of your own money in support of local producers  not just veg  but meat and cheese and beer and whatever else it might be. But then  we're just a community group  you know. We're just all volunteers. What could we actually do  So we did some really simple things. We fundraised  we got some blackboards  we put  Incredible Edible  on the top  we gave it every market trader that was selling locally  and they scribbled on what they were selling in any one week. Really popular. People congregated around it. Sales were up. And then  we had a chat with the farmers  and we said   We're really serious about this   but they didn't actually believe us  so we thought  okay  what should we do  I know. If we can create a campaign around one product and show them there is local loyalty to that product  maybe they'll change their mind and see we're serious. So we launched a campaign    because it just amuses me    called Every Egg Matters.  Laughter  And what we did was we put people on our egg map. It's a stylized map of Togmorden. Anybody that's selling their excess eggs at the garden gate  perfectly legally  to their neighbors  we've stuck on there. We started with four  and we've now got    on  and the result of that was that people were then going into shops asking for a local Todmorden egg  and the result of that was  some farmers upped the amount of flocks they got of free range birds  and then they went on to meat birds  and although these are really  really small steps  that increasing local economic confidence is starting to play out in a number of ways  and we now have farmers doing cheese and they've upped their flocks and rare breed pigs  they're doing pasties and pies and things that they would have never done before. We've got increasing market stalls selling local food  and in a survey that local students did for us     percent of all food traders in that town said that their bottom line had increased because of what we were actually doing. And we're just volunteers and it's only an experiment. Now  none of this is rocket science. It certainly is not clever  and it's not original. But it is joined up  and it is inclusive. This is not a movement for those people that are going to sort themselves out anyway. This is a movement for everyone. We have a motto  If you eat  you're in.  Laughter  Across age  across income  across culture. It's been really quite a roller coaster experience  but going back to that first question that we asked  is it replicable  Yeah. It most certainly is replicable. More than    towns in England now are spinning the Incredible Edible plate. Whichever way they want to do it  of their own volition  they're trying to make their own lives differently  and worldwide  we've got communities across America and Japan    it's incredible  isn't it  I mean  America and Japan and New Zealand. People after the earthquake in New Zealand visited us in order to incorporate some of this public spiritedness around local growing into the heart of Christchurch. And none of this takes more money and none of this demands a bureaucracy  but it does demand that you think things differently and you are prepared to bend budgets and work programs in order to create that supportive framework that communities can bounce off. And there's some great ideas already in our patch. Our local authority has decided to make everywhere Incredible Edible  and in support of that have decided to do two things. First  they're going to create an asset register of spare land that they've got  put it in a food bank so that communities can use that wherever they live  and they're going to underpin that with a license. And then they've said to every single one of their workforce  if you can  help those communities grow  and help them to maintain their spaces. Suddenly  we're seeing actions on the ground from local government. We're seeing this mainstreamed. We are responding creatively at last to what Rio demanded of us  and there's lots more you could do. I mean  just to list a few. One  please stop putting prickly plants around public buildings. It's a waste of space. edible landscapes so that our children start to walk past their food day in  day out  on our high streets  in our parks  wherever that might be. Inspire local planners to put the food sites at the heart of the town and the city plan  not relegate them to the edges of the settlements that nobody can see. Encourage all our schools to take this seriously. This isn't a second class exercise. If we want to inspire the farmers of tomorrow  then please let us say to every school  create a sense of purpose around the importance to the environment  local food and soils. Put that at the heart of your school culture  and you will create a different generation. There are so many things you can do  but ultimately this is about something really simple. Through an organic process  through an increasing recognition of the power of small actions  we are starting  at last  to believe in ourselves again  and to believe in our capacity  each and every one of us  to build a different and a kinder future  and in my book  that's incredible. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  We're going to begin in     . Bob Dylan is    years old  and his career is just reaching its pinnacle. He's been christened the voice of a generation  and he's churning out classic songs at a seemingly impossible rate  but there's a small minority of dissenters  and they claim that Bob Dylan is stealing other people's songs.     . Brian Burton  aka Danger Mouse  takes the Beatles'  White Album   combines it with Jay Z's  The Black Album  to create  The Grey Album.   The Grey Album  becomes an immediate sensation online  and the Beatles' record company sends out countless cease and desist letters for  unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property.  Now   The Grey Album  is a remix. It is new media created from old media. It was made using these three techniques  copy  transform and combine. It's how you remix. You take existing songs  you chop them up  you transform the pieces  you combine them back together again  and you've got a new song  but that new song is clearly comprised of old songs. But I think these aren't just the components of remixing. I think these are the basic elements of all creativity. I think everything is a remix  and I think this is a better way to conceive of creativity. All right  let's head back to       and let's hear where some of Dylan's early songs came from. We'll do some side by side comparisons here. All right  this first song you're going to hear is  Nottamun Town.  It's a traditional folk tune. After that  you'll hear Dylan's  Masters of War.  Jean Ritchie    In Nottamun Town  not a soul would look out      not a soul would look up  not a soul would look down.   Bob Dylan    Come you masters of war      you that build the big guns  you that build the death planes      You that build all the bombs.   Kirby Ferguson  Okay  so that's the same basic melody and overall structure. This next one is  The Patriot Game   by Dominic Behan. Alongside that  you're going to hear  With God on Our Side   by Dylan. Dominic Behan    Come all ye young rebels      and list while I sing      for the love of one's land is a terrible thing.   BD    Oh my name it is nothin'      my age it means less      the country I come from is called the Midwest.   KF  Okay  so in this case  Dylan admits he must have heard  The Patriot Game   he forgot about it  then when the song kind of bubbled back up in his brain  he just thought it was his song. Last one  this is  Who's Going To Buy You Ribbons   another traditional folk tune. Alongside that is  Don't Think Twice  It's All Right.  This one's more about the lyric. Paul Clayton    It ain't no use to sit and sigh now      darlin'  and it ain't no use to sit and cry now.   BD    It ain t no use to sit and wonder why  babe      if you don't know by now      and it ain't no use to sit and wonder why  babe      it'll never do somehow.   KF  Okay  now  there's a lot of these. It's been estimated that two thirds of the melodies Dylan used in his early songs were borrowed. This is pretty typical among folk singers. Here's the advice of Dylan's idol  Woody Guthrie.  The worlds are the important thing. Don't worry about tunes. Take a tune  sing high when they sing low  sing fast when they sing slow  and you've got a new tune.  And that's  that's what Guthrie did right here  and I'm sure you all recognize the results. We know this tune  right  We know it  Actually you don't. That is  When the World's on Fire   a very old melody  in this case performed by the Carter Family. Guthrie adapted it into  This Land Is Your Land.  So  Bob Dylan  like all folk singers  he copied melodies  he transformed them  he combined them with new lyrics which were frequently their own concoction of previous stuff. Now  American copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others. Instead  these laws and laws around the world use the rather awkward analogy of property. Now  creative works may indeed be kind of like property  but it's property that we're all building on  and creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared. Henry Ford once said   I invented nothing new. I simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work. Progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable.      . The iPhone makes it debut. Apple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early  but its time was approaching because its core technology had been evolving for decades. That's multi touch  controlling a device by touching its display. Here is Steve Jobs introducing multi touch and making a rather foreboding joke. Steve Jobs  And we have invented a new technology called multi touch. You can do multi fingered gestures on it  and boy have we patented it.  Laughter  KF  Yes. And yet  here is multi touch in action. This is at TED  actually  about a year earlier. This is Jeff Han  and  I mean  that's multi touch. It's the same animal  at least. Let's hear what Jeff Han has to say about this newfangled technology. Jeff Han  Multi touch sensing isn't anything    isn't completely new. I mean  people like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '  s. The technology  you know  isn't the most exciting thing here right now other than probably its newfound accessibility. KF  So he's pretty frank about it not being new. So it's not multi touch as a whole that's patented. It's the small parts of it that are  and it's in these small details where we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent  to promote the progress of useful arts. Here is the first ever slide to unlock. That is all there is to it. Apple has patented this. It's a    page software patent  but I will summarize what it covers. Spoiler alert  Unlocking your phone by sliding an icon with your finger.  Laughter  I'm only exaggerating a little bit. It's a broad patent. Now  can someone own this idea  Now  back in the '  s  there were no software patents  and it was Xerox that pioneered the graphical user interface. What if they had patented pop up menus  scrollbars  the desktop with icons that look like folders and sheets of paper  Would a young and inexperienced Apple have survived the legal assault from a much larger and more mature company like Xerox  Now  this idea that everything is a remix might sound like common sense until you're the one getting remixed. For example ... SJ  I mean  Picasso had a saying. He said   Good artists copy. Great artists steal.  And we have  you know  always been shameless about stealing great ideas. KF  Okay  so that's in '  . Here's in     .  I'm going to destroy Android because it's a stolen product.   I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this.   Laughter  Okay  so in other words  great artists steal  but not from me. Now  behavioral economists might refer to this sort of thing as loss aversion We have a strong predisposition towards protecting what we feel is ours. We have no such aversion towards copying what other people have  because we do that nonstop. So here's the sort of equation we're looking at. We've got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property  plus massive rewards or settlements in infringement cases  plus huge legal fees to protect yourself in court  plus cognitive biases against perceived loss. And the sum looks like this. That is the last four years of lawsuits in the realm of smartphones. Is this promoting the progress of useful arts      . Bob Dylan is    years old  and his time in the cultural spotlight is long since past. He records a song called  Blind Willie McTell   named after the blues singer  and the song is a voyage through the past  through a much darker time  but a simpler one  a time when musicians like Willie McTell had few illusions about what they did.  I jump 'em from other writers but I arrange 'em my own way.  I think this is mostly what we do. Our creativity comes from without  not from within. We are not self made. We are dependent on one another  and admitting this to ourselves isn't an embrace of mediocrity and derivativeness. It's a liberation from our misconceptions  and it's an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves and to simply begin. Thank you so much. It was an honor to be here. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  One of my favorite words in the whole of the Oxford English Dictionary is  snollygoster.  Just because it sounds so good. And what snollygoster means is  a dishonest politician.  Although there was a   th century newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said   A snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office regardless of party  platform or principle  and who  when he wins  gets there by the sheer force of monumental talknophical assumnancy.  Now I have no idea what  talknophical  is. Something to do with words  I assume. But it's very important that words are at the center of politics  and all politicians know they have to try and control language. It wasn't until  for example       that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report the exact words that were said in the debating chamber. And this was actually all down to the bravery of a guy with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby  who took on Parliament. And he was thrown into the Tower of London and imprisoned  but he was brave enough  he was brave enough to take them on  and in the end he had such popular support in London that he won. And it was only a few years later that we have the first recorded use of the phrase  as bold as brass.  Most people think that's down to the metal. It's not. It's down to a campaigner for the freedom of the press. But to really show you how words and politics interact  I want to take you back to the United States of America  just after they'd achieved independence. And they had to face the question of what to call George Washington  their leader. They didn't know. What do you call the leader of a republican country  And this was debated in Congress for ages and ages. And there were all sorts of suggestions on the table  which might have made it. I mean  some people wanted him to be called Chief Magistrate Washington  and other people  His Highness George Washington  and other people  Protector of the Liberties of the People of the United States of America Washington. Not that catchy. Some people just wanted to call him King. They thought it was tried and tested. And they weren't even being monarchical there  they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term. And  you know  it could have worked. And everybody got insanely bored  actually  because this debate went on for three weeks. I read a diary of this poor senator  who just keeps coming back   Still on this subject.  And the reason for the delay and the boredom was that the House of Representatives were against the Senate. The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to get drunk on power. They didn't want to call him King in case that gave him ideas  or his successor ideas. So they wanted to give him the humblest  meagerest  most pathetic title that they could think of. And that title was  President.  President. They didn't invent the title. I mean  it existed before  but it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting. It was like the foreman of the jury. And it didn't have much more grandeur than the term  foreman  or  overseer.  There were occasional presidents of little colonial councils and bits of government  but it was really a nothing title. And that's why the Senate objected to it. They said  that's ridiculous  you can't call him President. This guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries. And who's going to take him seriously if he's got a silly little title like President of the United States of America  And after three weeks of debate  in the end the Senate did not cave in. Instead  they agreed to use the title  President  for now  but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn't agree with it from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civilized nations  whether under republican or monarchical forms of government  whose custom it is to annex  through the office of the Chief Magistrate  titles of respectability    not bloody President    and that in the intercourse with foreign nations  the majesty of the people of the United States may not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity  i.e.  we don't want to look like bloody weirdos. Now you can learn three interesting things from this. First of all    and this is my favorite    is that so far as I've ever been able to find out  the Senate has never formally endorsed the title of President. Barack Obama  President Obama  is there on borrowed time  just waiting for the Senate to spring into action. Second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure    you can still be waiting     years later. But the third thing you can learn  and this is the really important one  this is the point I want to leave you on  is that the title  President of the United States of America  doesn't sound that humble at all these days  does it  Something to do with the slightly over       nuclear warheads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff. Reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur. And so the Senate won in the end. They got their title of respectability. And also  the Senate's other worry  the appearance of singularity    well  it was a singularity back then. But now  do you know how many nations have a president  A hundred and forty seven. All because they want to sound like the guy who's got the       nuclear warheads  etc. And so  in the end  the Senate won and the House of Representatives lost  because nobody's going to feel that humble when they're told that they are now the President of the United States of America. And that's the important lesson I think you can take away  and the one I want to leave you with. Politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality  but in fact  reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality. Thank you very much. I'm     feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana. The air is thick with heat and dust  and it's hard to breathe. I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness  but I can't see much else. I hear voices talking  but mostly the shaft is this cacophony of men coughing  and stone being broken with primitive tools. Like the others  I wear a flickering  cheap flashlight tied to my head with this elastic  tattered band  and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the three foot square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth. When my hand slips  I suddenly remember a miner I had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft. As I stand talking to you today  these men are still deep in that hole  risking their lives without payment or compensation  and often dying. I got to climb out of that hole  and I got to go home  but they likely never will  because they're trapped in slavery. For the last    years  I've been documenting indigenous cultures in more than    countries on six continents  and in      I had the great honor of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit. Amongst all the astonishing people I met there  I met a supporter of Free the Slaves  an NGO dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery. We started talking about slavery  and really  I started learning about slavery  for I had certainly known it existed in the world  but not to such a degree. After we finished talking  I felt so horrible and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this atrocity in my own lifetime  and I thought  if I don't know  how many other people don't know  It started burning a hole in my stomach  so within weeks  I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of Free the Slaves and offer them my help. Thus began my journey into modern day slavery. Oddly  I had been to many of these places before. Some I even considered like my second home. But this time  I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet. A conservative estimate tells us there are more than    million people enslaved in the world today. That's double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans Atlantic slave trade. A hundred and fifty years ago  an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an American worker. That equates to about         in today's money. Yet today  entire families can be enslaved for generations over a debt as small as    . Astonishingly  slavery generates profits of more than     billion worldwide each year. Many have been tricked by false promises of a good education  a better job  only to find that they're forced to work without pay under the threat of violence  and they cannot walk away. Today's slavery is about commerce  so the goods that enslaved people produce have value  but the people producing them are disposable. Slavery exists everywhere  nearly  in the world  and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world. In India and Nepal  I was introduced to the brick kilns. This strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egypt or Dante's Inferno. Enveloped in temperatures of     degrees  men  women  children  entire families in fact  were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust  while mechanically stacking bricks on their head  up to    at a time  and carrying them from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away. Deadened by monotony and exhaustion  they work silently  doing this task over and over for    or    hours a day. There were no breaks for food  no water breaks  and the severe dehydration made urinating pretty much inconsequential. So pervasive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working. Every    minutes  I'd have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it  and as I sat there  I thought  my camera is getting far better treatment than these people. Back in the kilns  I wanted to cry  but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said   Lisa  don't do that. Just don't do that here.  And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this  not just for me  but for them. I couldn't offer them any direct help. I couldn't give them money  nothing. I wasn't a citizen of that country. I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in. I'd have to rely on Free the Slaves to work within the system for their liberation  and I trusted that they would. As for me  I'd have to wait until I got home to really feel my heartbreak. In the Himalayas  I found children carrying stone for miles down mountainous terrain to trucks waiting at roads below. The big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them  and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth. It's difficult to witness something so overwhelming. How can we affect something so insidious  yet so pervasive  Some don't even know they're enslaved  people working        hours a day without any pay  because this has been the case all their lives. They have nothing to compare it to. When these villagers claimed their freedom  the slaveholders burned down all of their houses. I mean  these people had nothing  and they were so petrified  they wanted to give up  but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere  and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own  so that now they do the same back breaking work  but they do it for themselves  and they get paid for it  and they do it in freedom. Sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery  and because of this worldwide awareness  I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry. In Kathmandu  I was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves. They ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty  dimly fluorescent lit basement. This wasn't a brothel  per se. It was more like a restaurant. Cabin restaurants  as they're known in the trade  are venues for forced prostitution. Each has small  private rooms  where the slaves  women  along with young girls and boys  some as young as seven years old  are forced to entertain the clients  encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol. Each cubicle is dark and dingy  identified with a painted number on the wall  and partitioned by plywood and a curtain. The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers. Standing in the near darkness  I remember feeling this quick  hot fear  and in that instant  I could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell. I had only one way out  the stairs from where I'd come in. There were no back doors. There were no windows large enough to climb through. These people have no escape at all  and as we take in such a difficult subject  it's important to note that slavery  including sex trafficking  occurs in our own backyard as well. Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture  in restaurants  in domestic servitude  and the list can go on. Recently  the New York Times reported that between         and         American children are sold into sex slavery every year. It's all around us. We just don't see it. The textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor. I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade. This is a family portrait. The dyed black hands are the father  while the blue and red hands are his sons. They mix dye in these big barrels  and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows  but the dye is toxic. My interpreter told me their stories.  We have no freedom   they said.  We hope still  though  that we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our dyeing.  It's estimated that more than       children are enslaved on Lake Volta  the largest man made lake in the world. When we first arrived  I went to have a quick look. I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat  two older brothers  some younger kids  makes sense right  Wrong. They were all enslaved. Children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished  and they're forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake  even though they do not know how to swim. This young child is eight years old. He was trembling when our boat approached  frightened it would run over his tiny canoe. He was petrified he would be knocked in the water. The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta often catch the fishing nets  and weary  frightened children are thrown into the water to untether the lines. Many of them drown. For as long as he can recall  he's been forced to work on the lake. Terrified of his master  he will not run away  and since he's been treated with cruelty all his life  he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages. I met these boys at five in the morning  when they were hauling in the last of their nets  but they had been working since   a.m. in the cold  windy night. And it's important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they're full of fish. I want to introduce you to Kofi. Kofi was rescued from a fishing village. I met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves rehabilitates victims of slavery. Here he's seen taking a bath at the well  pouring big buckets of water over his head  and the wonderful news is  as you and I are sitting here talking today  Kofi has been reunited with his family  and what's even better  his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe. Kofi is the embodiment of possibility. Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life  Driving down a road in Ghana with partners of Free the Slaves  a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window. He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle. At the end of the road  he urged us out of the car  and told the driver to quickly leave. Then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath  and said   This is the path  this is the path. Go.  As we started down the path  we pushed aside the vines blocking the way  and after about an hour of walking in  found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains  so I hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest. After another two hours of hiking  the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing  and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field  and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring. Many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold  wading in water poisoned by mercury. Mercury is used in the extraction process. These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of Ghana. When they came out of the shaft  they were soaking wet from their own sweat. I remember looking into their tired  bloodshot eyes  for many of them had been underground for    hours. The shafts are up to     feet deep  and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area  where the stone will be pounded so that they can extract the gold. At first glance  the pounding site seems full of powerful men  but when we look closer  we see some less fortunate working on the fringes  and children too. All of them are victim to injury  illness and violence. In fact  it's very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here  racked with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years. This is Manuru. When his father died  his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines. When his uncle died  Manuru inherited his uncle's debt  which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines. When I met him  he had been working in the mines for    years  and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident  one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated. On top of that  Manuru has tuberculosis  yet he's still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft. Even still  he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like Free the Slaves  and it's this sort of determination  in the face of unimaginable odds  that fills me with complete awe. I want to shine a light on slavery. When I was working in the field  I brought lots of candles with me  and with the help of my interpreter  I imparted to the people I was photographing that I wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight  so when it was safe for them  and safe for me  I made these images. They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world. I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness to them  and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives. I truly believe  if we can see one another as fellow human beings  then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery. These images are not of issues. They are of people  real people  like you and me  all deserving of the same rights  dignity and respect in their lives. There is not a day that goes by that I don't think of these many beautiful  mistreated people I've had the tremendous honor of meeting. I hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them  people like you  and I hope that force will ignite a fire  and that fire will shine a light on slavery  for without that light  the beast of bondage can continue to live in the shadows. Thank you very much. I'm afraid I'm one of those speakers you hope you're not going to meet at TED. First  I don't have a mobile  so I'm on the safe side. Secondly  a political theorist who's going to talk about the crisis of democracy is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about. And plus  I'm not going to give you any answers. I'm much more trying to add to some of the questions we're talking about. And one of the things that I want to question is this very popular hope these days that transparency and openness can restore the trust in democratic institutions. There is one more reason for you to be suspicious about me. You people  the Church of TED  are a very optimistic community. Basically you believe in complexity  but not in ambiguity. As you have been told  I'm Bulgarian. And according to the surveys  we are marked the most pessimistic people in the world. The Economist magazine recently wrote an article covering one of the recent studies on happiness  and the title was  The Happy  the Unhappy and the Bulgarians.  So now when you know what to expect  let's give you the story. And this is a rainy election day in a small country    that can be my country  but could be also your country. And because of the rain until four o'clock in the afternoon  nobody went to the polling stations. But then the rain stopped  people went to vote. And when the votes had been counted  three fourths of the people have voted with a blank ballot. The government and the opposition  they have been simply paralyzed. Because you know what to do about the protests. You know who to arrest  who to negotiate with. But what to do about people who are voting with a blank ballot  So the government decided to have the elections once again. And this time even a greater number     percent of the people  voted with blank ballots. Basically they went to the ballot boxes to tell that they have nobody to vote for. This is the opening of a beautiful novel by Jose Saramago called  Seeing.  But in my view it very well captures part of the problem that we have with democracy in Europe these days. On one level nobody's questioning that democracy is the best form of government. Democracy is the only game in town. The problem is that many people start to believe that it is not a game worth playing. For the last    years  political scientists have observed that there is a constant decline in electoral turnout  and the people who are least interested to vote are the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting. I mean the unemployed  the under privileged. And this is a major issue. Because especially now with the economic crisis  you can see that the trust in politics  that the trust in democratic institutions  was really destroyed. According to the latest survey being done by the European Commission     percent of the citizens of Europe believe that there is a growing gap between the opinion of the policy makers and the opinion of the public. Only    percent of Italians and    percent of Greeks believe that their vote matters. Basically people start to understand that they can change governments  but they cannot change policies. And the question which I want to ask is the following  How did it happen that we are living in societies which are much freer than ever before    we have more rights  we can travel easier  we have access to more information    at the same time that trust in our democratic institutions basically has collapsed  So basically I want to ask  What went right and what went wrong in these    years when we talk about democracy  And I'll start with what went right. And the first thing that went right was  of course  these five revolutions which  in my view  very much changed the way we're living and deepened our democratic experience. And the first was the cultural and social revolution of      and     s  which put the individual at the center of politics. It was the human rights moment. Basically this was also a major outbreak  a culture of dissent  a culture of basically non conformism  which was not known before. So I do believe that even things like that are very much the children of '      nevertheless that most of us had been even not born then. But after that you have the market revolution of the     s. And nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it  the truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message   The government does not know better.  And you have more choice driven societies. And of course  you have         the end of Communism  the end of the Cold War. And it was the birth of the global world. And you have the Internet. And this is not the audience to which I'm going to preach to what extent the Internet empowered people. It has changed the way we are communicating and basically we are viewing politics. The very idea of political community totally has changed. And I'm going to name one more revolution  and this is the revolution in brain sciences  which totally changed the way we understand how people are making decisions. So this is what went right. But if we're going to see what went wrong  we're going to end up with the same five revolutions. Because first you have the     s and     s  cultural and social revolution  which in a certain way destroyed the idea of a collective purpose. The very idea  all these collective nouns that we have been taught about    nation  class  family. We start to like divorcing  if we're married at all. All this was very much under attack. And it is so difficult to engage people in politics when they believe that what really matters is where they personally stand. And you have the market revolution of the     s and the huge increase of inequality in societies. Remember  until the     s  the spread of democracy has always been accompanied by the decline of inequality. The more democratic our societies have been  the more equal they have been becoming. Now we have the reverse tendency. The spread of democracy now is very much accompanied by the increase in inequality. And I find this very much disturbing when we're talking about what's going on right and wrong with democracy these days. And if you go to         something that basically you don't expect that anybody's going to criticize    but many are going to tell you   Listen  it was the end of the Cold War that tore the social contract between the elites and the people in Western Europe.  When the Soviet Union was still there  the rich and the powerful  they needed the people  because they feared them. Now the elites basically have been liberated. They're very mobile. You cannot tax them. And basically they don't fear the people. So as a result of it  you have this very strange situation in which the elites basically got out of the control of the voters. So this is not by accident that the voters are not interested to vote anymore. And when we talk about the Internet  yes  it's true  the Internet connected all of us  but we also know that the Internet created these echo chambers and political ghettos in which for all your life you can stay with the political community you belong to. And it's becoming more and more difficult to understand the people who are not like you. I know that many people here have been splendidly speaking about the digital world and the possibility for cooperation  but  have you  seen what the digital world has done to American politics these days  This is also partly a result of the Internet revolution. This is the other side of the things that we like. And when you go to the brain sciences  what political consultants learned from the brain scientists is don't talk to me about ideas anymore  don't talk to me about policy programs. What really matters is basically to manipulate the emotions of the people. And you have this very strongly to the extent that  even if you see when we talk about revolutions these days  these revolutions are not named anymore around ideologies or ideas. Before  revolutions used to have ideological names. They could be communist  they could be liberal  they could be fascist or Islamic. Now the revolutions are called under the medium which is most used. You have Facebook revolutions  Twitter revolutions. The content doesn't matter anymore  the problem is the media. I'm saying this because one of my major points is what went right is also what went wrong. And when we're now trying to see how we can change the situation  when basically we're trying to see what can be done about democracy  we should keep this ambiguity in mind. Because probably some of the things that we love most are going to be also the things that can hurt us most. These days it's very popular to believe that this push for transparency  this kind of a combination between active citizens  new technologies and much more transparency friendly legislation can restore trust in politics. You believe that when you have these new technologies and people who are ready to use this  it can make it much more difficult for the governments to lie  it's going to be more difficult for them to steal and probably even going to be more difficult for them to kill. This is probably true. But I do believe that we should be also very clear that now when we put the transparency at the center of politics where the message is   It's transparency  stupid.  Transparency is not about restoring trust in institutions. Transparency is politics' management of mistrust. We are assuming that our societies are going to be based on mistrust. And by the way  mistrust was always very important for democracy. This is why you have checks and balances. This is why basically you have all this creative mistrust between the representatives and those whom they represent. But when politics is only management of mistrust  then    I'm very glad that        has been mentioned    now we're going to have        in reverse. It's not going to be the Big Brother watching you  it's going to be we being the Big Brother watching the political class. But is this the idea of a free society  For example  can you imagine that decent  civic  talented people are going to run for office if they really do believe that politics is also about managing mistrust  Are you not afraid with all these technologies that are going to track down any statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues  are you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politicians to repeat their positions  even the very wrong positions  because consistency is going to be more important than common sense  And the Americans who are in the room  are you not afraid that your presidents are going to govern on the basis of what they said in the primary elections  I find this extremely important  because democracy is about people changing their views based on rational arguments and discussions. And we can lose this with the very noble idea to keep people accountable for showing the people that we're not going to tolerate politicians the opportunism in politics. So for me this is extremely important. And I do believe that when we're discussing politics these days  probably it makes sense to look also at this type of a story. But also don't forget  any unveiling is also veiling.  Regardless of  how transparent our governments want to be  they're going to be selectively transparent. In a small country that could be my country  but could be also your country  they took a decision    it is a real case story    that all of the governmental decisions  discussions of the council of ministers  were going to be published on the Internet    hours after the council discussions took place. And the public was extremely all for it. So I had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister  why he made this decision. He said   Listen  this is the best way to keep the mouths of my ministers closed. Because it's going to be very difficult for them to dissent knowing that    hours after this is going to be on the public space  and this is in a certain way going to be a political crisis.  So when we talk about transparency  when we talk about openness  I really do believe that what we should keep in mind is that what went right is what went wrong. And this is Goethe  who is neither Bulgarian nor a political scientist  some centuries ago he said   There is a big shadow where there is much light.  Thank you very much. ... pulling trees from the ground  shattering windows  taking the roofs off of homes ... Caitria O'Neill  That was me in front of our house in Monson  Massachusetts last June. After an EF  tornado ripped straight through our town and took parts of our roof off  I decided to stay in Massachusetts  instead of pursuing the master's program I had moved my boxes home that afternoon for. Morgan O'Neill  So  on June    we weren't disaster experts  but on June    we started faking it. This experience changed our lives  and now we're trying to change the experience. CO  So  tornadoes don't happen in Massachusetts  and I was cleverly standing in the front yard when one came over the hill. After a lamppost flew by  my family and I sprinted into the basement. Trees were thrown against the house  the windows exploded. When we finally got out the back door  transformers were burning in the street. MO  I was here in Boston. I'm a PhD student at MIT  and I happen to study atmospheric science. Actually  it gets weirder    I was in the museum of science at the time the tornado hit  playing with the tornado display    so I missed her call. I get a call from Caitria  hear the news  and start tracking the radar online to call the family back when another supercell was forming in their area. I drove home late that night with batteries and ice. We live across the street from a historic church that had lost its very iconic steeple in the storm. It had become a community gathering place overnight. The town hall and the police department had also suffered direct hits  and so people wanting to help or needing information went to the church. CO  We walked to the church because we heard they had hot meals  but when we arrived  we found problems. There were a couple large  sweaty men with chainsaws standing in the center of the church  but nobody knew where to send them because no one knew the extent of the damage yet. As we watched  they became frustrated and left to go find somebody to help on their own. MO  So we started organizing. Why  It had to be done. We found Pastor Bob and offered to give the response some infrastructure. And then  armed with just two laptops and one air card  we built a recovery machine. CO  That was a tornado  and everyone's heading to the church to drop things off and volunteer. MO  Everyone's donating clothing. We should inventory the donations piling up here. CO  And we need a hotline. Can you make a Google Voice number  MO  Sure. And we need to tell people what not to bring. I'll make a Facebook account. Can you print flyers  CO  Yeah  but we don't even know what houses are accepting help. We need to canvas and send out volunteers. MO  We need to tell people what not to bring. Hey  there's a news truck. I'll tell them. CO  You got my number off the news  We don't need more freezers  Together  Someone get me Post its  CO  And then the rest of the community figured out that we had answers. MO  I can donate three water heaters  but someone needs to come pick them up. CO  My car is in my living room  MO  My boyscout troop would like to rebuild    mailboxes. CO  My puppy is missing and insurance doesn't cover chimneys. MO  My church group of    would like housing and meals for a week while we repair properties. CO  You sent me to that place on Washington Street yesterday  and now I'm covered in poison ivy. So this is what filled our days. We had to learn how to answer questions quickly and to solve problems in a minute or less  otherwise  something more urgent would come up  and it wouldn't get done. MO  We didn't get our authority from the board of selectmen or the emergency management director or the United Way. We just started answering questions and making decisions because someone    anyone    had to. And why not me  I'm a campaign organizer. I'm good at Facebook. And there's two of me. CO  The point is  if there's a flood or a fire or a hurricane  you  or somebody like you  are going to step up and start organizing things. The other point is that it is hard. MO  Lying on the ground after another    hour day  Caitria and I would empty our pockets and try to place dozens of scraps of paper into context    all bits of information that had to be remembered and matched in order to help someone. After another day and a shower at the shelter  we realized it shouldn't be this hard. CO  In a country like ours where we breathe Wi Fi  leveraging technology for a faster recovery should be a no brainer. Systems like the ones that we were creating on the fly could exist ahead of time. And if some community member is in this organizing position in every area after every disaster  these tools should exist. MO  So  we decided to build them  a recovery in a box  something that could be deployed after every disaster by any local organizer. CO  I decided to stay in the country  give up the master's in Moscow and to work full time to make this happen. In the course of the past year  we've become experts in the field of community powered disaster recovery. And there are three main problems that we've observed with the way things work currently. MO  The tools. Large aid organizations are exceptional at bringing massive resources to bear after a disaster  but they often fulfill very specific missions  and then they leave. This leaves local residents to deal with the thousands of spontaneous volunteers  thousands of donations  and all with no training and no tools. So they use Post its or Excel or Facebook. But none of these tools allow you to value high priority information amidst all of the photos and well wishes. CO  The timing. Disaster relief is essentially a backwards political campaign. In a political campaign  you start with no interest and no capacity to turn that into action. You build both gradually  until a moment of peak mobilization at the time of the election. In a disaster  however  you start with all of the interest and none of the capacity. And you've only got about seven days to capture    percent of all of the Web searches that will ever be made to help your area. Then some sporting event happens  and you've got only the resources that you've collected thus far to meet the next five years of recovery needs. This is the slide for Katrina. This is the curve for Joplin. And this is the curve for the Dallas tornadoes in April  where we deployed software. There's a gap here. Affected households have to wait for the insurance adjuster to visit before they can start accepting help on their properties. And you've only got about four days of interest in Dallas. MO  Data. Data is inherently unsexy  but it can jump start an area's recovery. FEMA and the state will pay    percent of the cost of a federally declared disaster  leaving the town to pay the last    percent of the bill. Now that expense can be huge  but if the town can mobilize X amount of volunteers for Y hours  the dollar value of that labor used goes toward the town's contribution. But who knows that  Now try to imagine the sinking feeling you get when you've just sent out       volunteers and you can't prove it. CO  These are three problems with a common solution. If we can get the right tools at the right time to the people who will inevitably step up and start putting their communities back together  we can create new standards in disaster recovery. MO  We needed canvasing tools  donations databasing  needs reporting  remote volunteer access  all in an easy to use website. CO  And we needed help. Alvin  our software engineer and co founder  has built these tools. Chris and Bill have volunteered their time to use operations and partnerships. And we've been flying into disaster areas since this past January  setting up software  training residents and licensing the software to areas that are preparing for disasters. MO  One of our first launches was after the Dallas tornadoes this past April. We flew into a town that had a static  outdated website and a frenetic Facebook feed  trying to structure the response  and we launched our platform. All of the interest came in the first four days  but by the time they lost the news cycle  that's when the needs came in  yet they had this massive resource of what people were able to give and they've been able to meet the needs of their residents. CO  So it's working  but it could be better. Emergency preparedness is a big deal in disaster recovery because it makes towns safer and more resilient. Imagine if we could have these systems ready to go in a place before a disaster. So that's what we're working on. We're working on getting the software to places so people expect it  so people know how to use it and so it can be filled ahead of time with that micro information that drives recovery. MO  It's not rocket science. These tools are obvious and people want them. In our hometown  we trained a half dozen residents to run these Web tools on their own  because Caitria and I live here  in Boston. They took to it immediately  and now they are forces of nature. There are over three volunteer groups working almost every day  and have been since June   of last year  to make sure these residents get what they need and get back in their homes. They have hotlines and spreadsheets and data. CO  And that makes a difference. June   this year marked the one year anniversary of the Monson tornado  and our community's never been more connected or more empowered. We've been able to see the same transformation in Texas and in Alabama. Because it doesn't take Harvard or MIT to fly in and fix problems after a disaster  it takes a local. No matter how good an aid organization is at what they do  they eventually have to go home. But if you give locals the tools  if you show them what they can do to recover  they become experts. MO  All right. Let's go. The story starts  I was at a friend's house  and she had on her shelf a copy of the DSM manual  which is the manual of mental disorders. It lists every known mental disorder. And it used to be  back in the '  s  a very slim pamphlet. And then it got bigger and bigger and bigger  and now it's     pages long. And it lists currently     mental disorders. So I was leafing through it  wondering if I had any mental disorders  and it turns out I've got   . I've got generalized anxiety disorder  which is a given. I've got nightmare disorder  which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure  and all my dreams involve people chasing me down the street going   You're a failure   I've got parent child relational problems  which I blame my parents for. I'm kidding. I'm not kidding. I'm kidding. And I've got malingering. And I think it's actually quite rare to have both malingering and generalized anxiety disorder  because malingering tends to make me feel very anxious. Anyway  I was looking through this book  wondering if I was much crazier than I thought I was  or maybe it's not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder if you're not a trained professional  or maybe the psychiatry profession has a kind of strange desire to label what's essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder. I didn't know which of these was true  but I thought it was kind of interesting  and I thought maybe I should meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view  which is how I ended up having lunch with the Scientologists. It was a man called Brian  who runs a crack team of Scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies. They're called the CCHR. And I said to him   Can you prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudo science that can't be trusted   And he said   Yes  we can prove it to you.  And I said   How   And he said   We're going to introduce you to Tony.  And I said   Who's Tony   And he said   Tony's in Broadmoor.  Now  Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital. It used to be known as the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane. It's where they send the serial killers  and the people who can't help themselves. And I said to Brian   Well  what did Tony do   And he said   Hardly anything. He beat someone up or something  and he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence. But he faked it too well  and now he's stuck in Broadmoor and nobody will believe he's sane. Do you want us to try and get you into Broadmoor to meet Tony   So I said   Yes  please.  So I got the train to Broadmoor. I began to yawn uncontrollably around Kempton Park  which apparently is what dogs also do when anxious  they yawn uncontrollably. And we got to Broadmoor. And I got taken through gate after gate after gate after gate into the wellness center  which is where you get to meet the patients. It looks like a giant Hampton Inn. It's all peach and pine and calming colors. And the only bold colors are the reds of the panic buttons. And the patients started drifting in. And they were quite overweight and wearing sweatpants  and quite docile looking. And Brian the Scientologist whispered to me   They're medicated   which  to the Scientologists  is like the worst evil in the world  but I'm thinking it's probably a good idea. And then Brian said   Here's Tony.  And a man was walking in. And he wasn't overweight  he was in very good physical shape. And he wasn't wearing sweatpants  he was wearing a pinstripe suit. And he had his arm outstretched like someone out of The Apprentice. He looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me that he was very sane. And he sat down. And I said   So is it true that you faked your way in here   And he said   Yep. Yep. Absolutely. I beat someone up when I was   . And I was in prison awaiting trial  and my cellmate said to me  'You know what you have to do  Fake madness. Tell them you're mad  you'll get sent to some cushy hospital. Nurses will bring you pizzas  you'll have your own PlayStation.'  I said   Well  how did you do it   He said   Well  I asked to see the prison psychiatrist. And I'd just seen a film called 'Crash ' in which people get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls. So I said to the psychiatrist  'I get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls.'  And I said   What else   He said   Oh  yeah. I told the psychiatrist that I wanted to watch women as they died  because it would make me feel more normal.  I said   Where'd you get that from   He said   Oh  from a biography of Ted Bundy that they had at the prison library.  Anyway  he faked madness too well  he said. And they didn't send him to some cushy hospital. They sent him to Broadmoor. And the minute he got there  said he took one look at the place  asked to see the psychiatrist  said   There's been a terrible misunderstanding. I'm not mentally ill.  I said   How long have you been here for   He said   Well  if I'd just done my time in prison for the original crime  I'd have got five years. I've been in Broadmoor for    years.  Tony said that it's a lot harder to convince people you're sane than it is to convince them you're crazy. He said   I thought the best way to seem normal would be to talk to people normally about normal things like football or what's on TV. I subscribe to New Scientist  and recently they had an article about how the U.S. Army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives. So I said to a nurse  'Did you know that the U.S. Army is training bumblebees to sniff out explosives ' When I read my medical notes  I saw they'd written  'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.'  He said   You know  they're always looking out for nonverbal clues to my mental state. But how do you sit in a sane way  How do you cross your legs in a sane way  It's just impossible.  When Tony said that to me  I thought to myself   Am I sitting like a journalist  Am I crossing my legs like a journalist   He said   You know  I've got the Stockwell Strangler on one side of me  and I've got the 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips' rapist on the other side of me. So I tend to stay in my room a lot because I find them quite frightening. And they take that as a sign of madness. They say it proves that I'm aloof and grandiose.  So  only in Broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness. Anyway  he seemed completely normal to me  but what did I know  And when I got home I emailed his clinician  Anthony Maden. I said   What's the story   And he said   Yep. We accept that Tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence  because his hallucinations    that had seemed quite cliche to begin with    just vanished the minute he got to Broadmoor. However  we have assessed him  and we've determined that what he is is a psychopath.  And in fact  faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath. It's on the checklist  cunning  manipulative. So  faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain has gone wrong. And I spoke to other experts  and they said the pinstripe suit    classic psychopath    speaks to items one and two on the checklist  glibness  superficial charm and grandiose sense of self worth. And I said   Well  but why didn't he hang out with the other patients   Classic psychopath    it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy. So all the things that had seemed most normal about Tony was evidence  according to his clinician  that he was mad in this new way. He was a psychopath. And his clinician said to me   If you want to know more about psychopaths  you can go on a psychopath spotting course run by Robert Hare  who invented the psychopath checklist.  So I did. I went on a psychopath spotting course  and I am now a certified    and I have to say  extremely adept    psychopath spotter. So  here's the statistics  One in a hundred regular people is a psychopath. So there's       people in his room. Fifteen of you are psychopaths. Although that figure rises to four percent of CEOs and business leaders  so I think there's a very good chance there's about    or    psychopaths in this room. It could be carnage by the end of the night. Hare said the reason why is because capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior    the lack of empathy  the glibness  cunning  manipulative. In fact  capitalism  perhaps at its most remorseless  is a physical manifestation of psychopathy. It's like a form of psychopathy that's come down to affect us all. Hare said   You know what  Forget about some guy at Broadmoor who may or may not have faked madness. Who cares  That's not a big story. The big story   he said   is corporate psychopathy. You want to go and interview yourself some corporate psychopaths.  So I gave it a try. I wrote to the Enron people. I said   Could I come and interview you in prison  to find out it you're psychopaths   And they didn't reply. So I changed tack. I emailed  Chainsaw Al  Dunlap  the asset stripper from the     s. He would come into failing businesses and close down    percent of the workforce  just turn American towns into ghost towns. And I emailed him and I said   I believe you may have a very special brain anomaly that makes you ... special  and interested in the predatory spirit  and fearless. Can I come and interview you about your special brain anomaly   And he said   Come on over   So I went to Al Dunlap's grand Florida mansion. It was filled with sculptures of predatory animals. There were lions and tigers    he was taking me through the garden    there were falcons and eagles  he was saying   Over there you've got sharks and     he was saying this in a less effeminate way     You've got more sharks and you've got tigers.  It was like Narnia. And then we went into his kitchen. Now  Al Dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies  he'd close down    percent of the workforce. And he'd quite often fire people with a joke. Like  for instance  one famous story about him  somebody came up to him and said   I've just bought myself a new car.  And he said   Well  you may have a new car  but I'll tell you what you don't have    a job.  So in his kitchen    he was in there with his wife  Judy  and his bodyguard  Sean    and I said   You know how I said in my email that you might have a special brain anomaly that makes you special   He said   Yeah  it's an amazing theory  it's like Star Trek. You're going where no man has gone before.  And I said   Well      Clears throat  Some psychologists might say that this makes you      Mumbles  And he said   What   And I said   A psychopath.  And I said   I've got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket. Can I go through them with you   And he looked intrigued despite himself  and he said   Okay  go on.  And I said   Okay. Grandiose sense of self worth.  Which I have to say  would have been hard for him to deny  because he was standing under a giant oil painting of himself. He said   Well  you've got to believe in you   And I said   Manipulative.  He said   That's leadership.  And I said   Shallow affect  an inability to experience a range of emotions.  He said   Who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions   So he was going down the psychopath checklist  basically turning it into  Who Moved My Cheese   But I did notice something happening to me the day I was with Al Dunlap. Whenever he said anything to me that was kind of normal    like he said  no  to juvenile delinquency  he said he got accepted into West Point  and they don't let delinquents in West Point. He said  no  to many short term marital relationships. He's only ever been married twice. Admittedly  his first wife cited in her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife and said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like  but people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages in the heat of an argument  and his second marriage has lasted    years. So whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of non psychopathic  I thought to myself  well I'm not going to put that in my book. And then I realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had kind of turned me a little bit psychopathic. Because I was desperate to shove him in a box marked  Psychopath.  I was desperate to define him by his maddest edges. And I realized  my God    this is what I've been doing for    years. It's what all journalists do. We travel across the world with our notepads in our hands  and we wait for the gems. And the gems are always the outermost aspects of our interviewee's personality. And we stitch them together like medieval monks  and we leave the normal stuff on the floor. And you know  this is a country that over diagnoses certain mental disorders hugely. Childhood bipolar    children as young as four are being labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums  which scores them high on the bipolar checklist. When I got back to London  Tony phoned me. He said   Why haven't you been returning my calls   I said   Well  they say that you're a psychopath.  And he said   I'm not a psychopath.  He said   You know what  One of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse  but another item on the checklist is cunning  manipulative. So when you say you feel remorse for your crime  they say  'Typical of the psychopath to cunningly say he feels remorse when he doesn't.' It's like witchcraft  they turn everything upside down.  He said   I've got a tribunal coming up. Will you come to it   So I said okay. So I went to his tribunal. And after    years in Broadmoor  they let him go. They decided that he shouldn't be held indefinitely because he scores high on a checklist that might mean that he would have a greater than average chance of recidivism. So they let him go. And outside in the corridor he said to me   You know what  Jon  Everyone's a bit psychopathic.  He said   You are  I am. Well  obviously I am.  I said   What are you going to do now   He said   I'm going to go to Belgium. There's a woman there that I fancy. But she's married  so I'm going to have to get her split up from her husband.  Anyway  that was two years ago  and that's where my book ended. And for the last    months  everything was fine. Nothing bad happened. He was living with a girl outside London. He was  according to Brian the Scientologist  making up for lost time  which I know sounds ominous  but isn't necessarily ominous. Unfortunately  after    months  he did go back to jail for a month. He got into a  fracas  in a bar  he called it. Ended up going to jail for a month  which I know is bad  but at least a month implies that whatever the fracas was  it wasn't too bad. And then he phoned me. And you know what  I think it's right that Tony is out. Because you shouldn't define people by their maddest edges. And what Tony is  is he's a semi psychopath. He's a gray area in a world that doesn't like gray areas. But the gray areas are where you find the complexity. It's where you find the humanity  and it's where you find the truth. And Tony said to me   Jon  could I buy you a drink in a bar  I just want to thank you for everything you've done for me.  And I didn't go. What would you have done  Thank you. I've got a great idea that's going to change the world. It's fantastic  it's going to blow your mind. It's my beautiful baby. Here's the thing  everybody loves a beautiful baby. I mean  I was a beautiful baby. Here's me and my dad a couple days after I was born. So in the world of product design  the beautiful baby's like the concept car. It's the knockout. You see it and you go   Oh  my God. I'd buy that in a second   So why is it that this year's new cars look pretty much exactly like last year's new cars  What went wrong between the design studio and the factory  Today  I don't want to talk about beautiful babies  I want to talk about the awkward adolescence of design    those sort of dorky teenage years where you're trying to figure out how the world works. I'm going to start with an example from some work that we did on newborn health. So here's a problem  four million babies around the world  mostly in developing countries  die every year before their first birthday  even before their first month of life. It turns out half of those kids  or about  .  million newborns around the world  would make it if you could just keep them warm for the first three days  maybe the first week. So this is a newborn intensive care unit in Kathmandu  Nepal. All of these kids in blankets belong in incubators    something like this. This is a donated Japanese Atom incubator that we found in a NICU in Kathmandu. This is what we want. Probably what happened is a hospital in Japan upgraded their equipment and donated their old stuff to Nepal. The problem is  without technicians  without spare parts  donations like this very quickly turn into junk. So this seemed like a problem that we could do something about. Keeping a baby warm for a week    that's not rocket science. So we got started. We partnered with a leading medical research institution here in Boston. We conducted months of user research overseas  trying to think like designers  human centered design     Let's figure out what people want.  We killed thousands of Post it notes. We made dozens of prototypes to get to this. So this is the NeoNurture infant incubator  and this has a lot of smarts built into it  and we felt great. So the idea here is  unlike the concept car  we want to marry something beautiful with something that actually works. And our idea is that this design would inspire manufacturers and other people of influence to take this model and run with it. Here's the bad news  the only baby ever actually put inside the NeoNurture incubator was this kid during a Time magazine photo shoot. So recognition is fantastic. We want design to get out for people to see it. It won lots of awards. But it felt like a booby prize. We wanted to make beautiful things that are going to make the world a better place  and I don't think this kid was even in it long enough to get warm. So it turns out that design  for inspiration doesn't really ... I guess what I would say is  for us  for what I want to do  it's either too slow or it just doesn't work  it's ineffective. So  really  I want to design for outcomes. I don't want to make beautiful stuff  I want to make the world a better place. So when we were designing NeoNurture  we paid a lot of attention to the people who are going to use this thing  for example  poor families  rural doctors  overloaded nurses  even repair technicians. We thought we had all our bases covered  we'd done everything right. Well  it turns out there's this whole constellation of people who have to be involved in a product for it to be successful  manufacturing  financing  distribution  regulation. Michael Free at PATH says you have to figure out who will  choose  use and pay the dues  for a product like this. And I have to ask the question that VCs always ask   Sir  what is your business  and who is your customer   Who is our customer  Well  here's an example. This is a Bangladeshi hospital director outside his facility. It turns out he doesn't buy any of his equipment. Those decisions are made by the Ministry of Health or by foreign donors  and it just kind of shows up. Similarly  here's a multinational medical device manufacturer. It turns out they've got to fish where the fish are. So it turns out that in emerging markets    where the fish are    are the emerging middle class of these countries    diseases of affluence  heart disease  infertility. So it turns out that design for outcomes in one aspect really means thinking about design for manufacture and distribution. OK  that was an important lesson. Second  we took that lesson and tried to push it into our next project. So we started by finding a manufacturer  an organization called MTTS in Vietnam  that manufactures newborn care technologies for Southeast Asia. Our other partner is East Meets West  an American foundation that distributes that technology to poor hospitals around that region. So we started with them  saying   Well  what do you want  What's a problem you want to solve   And they said   Let's work on newborn jaundice.  So this is another one of these mind boggling global problems. Jaundice affects two thirds of newborns around the world. Of those newborns  one in    roughly  if it's not treated  the jaundice gets so severe that it leads to either a life long disability  or the kids could even die. There's one way to treat jaundice  and that's what's called an exchange transfusion. So as you can imagine  that's expensive and a little bit dangerous. There is another cure. It's very technological  it's very complex  a little daunting. You've got to shine blue light on the kid. Bright blue light on as much of the skin as you can cover. How is this a hard problem  I went to MIT. OK  we'll figure that out. So here's an example. This is an overhead phototherapy device that's designed for American hospitals  and here's how it's supposed to be used. It's over the baby  illuminating a single patient. Take it out of an American hospital  send it overseas to a crowded facility in Asia  here's how it's actually used. The effectiveness of phototherapy is a function of light intensity. These dark blue squares show you where it's effective phototherapy. Here's what it looks like under actual use. So those kids on the edges aren't actually receiving effective phototherapy. But without training  without some kind of light meter  how would you know  We see other examples of problems like this. Here's a neonatal intensive care unit  where moms come in to visit their babies. And keep in mind that Mom maybe just had a C section  so that's already kind of a bummer. Mom's visiting her kid. She sees her baby naked  lying under some blue lights  looking kind of vulnerable. It's not uncommon for Mom to put a blanket over the baby. From a phototherapy standpoint  maybe not the best behavior. In fact  that sounds kind of dumb. Except  what we've learned is that there's no such thing as a dumb user    there are only dumb products. We have to think like existentialists  it's not the painting we would have painted  it's the painting that we actually painted. It's the use    designed for actual use. How are people actually going to use this  So  similarly  when we think about our partner MTTS  they've made some amazing technologies for treating newborn illnesses. So here's an overhead warmer and a CPAP. They're inexpensive  really rugged. They've treated        kids in Vietnam with this technology. But here's the problem  Every doctor in the world  every hospital administrator  has seen TV    curse those  ER  reruns  Turns out they all know what a medical device is supposed to look like. They want Buck Rogers  they don't want effective. It sounds crazy  it sounds dumb  but there are actually hospitals who would rather have no equipment than something that looks cheap and crummy. So again  if we want people to trust a device  it has to look trustworthy. So thinking about outcomes  it turns out appearances matter. We took all that information together. We tried  this time  to get it right. And here's what we developed. This is the Firefly phototherapy device  except this time  we didn't stop at the concept car. From the very beginning  we started by talking to manufacturers. Our goal is to make a state of the art product that our partner MTTS can actually manufacture. Our goal is to study how they work  the resources they have access to  so that they can make this product. So that's the design for manufacture question. When we think about actual use  you'll notice that Firefly has a single bassinet. It only fits a single baby  and the idea here is it's obvious how you ought to use this device. If you try to put more than one kid in  you're stacking them on top of each other. So the idea here is you want to make it hard to use wrong. In other words  you want to make the right way to use it the easiest way to use it. Another example    again  silly Mom. Silly Mom thinks her baby looks cold  wants to put a blanket over the baby. That's why we have lights above and below the baby in Firefly  so if Mom does put a blanket over the baby  it's still receiving effective phototherapy from below. Last story here  I've got a friend in India who told me that you haven't really tested a piece of electronic technology for distribution in Asia  until you've trained a cockroach to climb in and pee on every single little component on the inside. You think it's funny. I had a laptop in the Peace Corps  and the screen had all these dead pixels on it. And one day I looked in    they were all dead ants that had gotten into my laptop and perished. Those poor ants. So with Firefly  what we did is    the problem is electronics get hot  and you have to put in vents or fans to keep them cool    in most products. We decided we can't put a  Do not enter  sign next to the vent. We actually got rid of all that stuff. So Firefly's totally sealed. These are the kinds of lessons    as awkward as it was to be a pretty goofy teenager  much worse to be a frustrated designer. So I was thinking   What I really want to do is change the world. I have to pay attention to manufacturing and distribution. I have to pay attention to how people are actually going to use a device. I actually have to pay attention. There's no excuse for failure. I have to think like an existentialist. I have to accept that there are no dumb users  only dumb products.  We have to ask ourselves hard questions. Are we designing for the world that we want  Are we designing for the world that we have  Are we designing for the world that's coming  whether we're ready or not  I got into this business designing products. I've since learned that if you really want to make a difference in the world  you have to design outcomes. And that's design that matters. Thank you. I worked on a film called  Apollo      and when I worked on this film  I discovered something about how our brains work  and how our brains work is that  when we're sort of infused with either enthusiasm or awe or fondness or whatever  it changes and alters our perception of things. It changes what we see. It changes what we remember. And as an experiment  because I dauntingly create a task for myself of recreating a Saturn V launch for this particular movie  because I put it out there  I felt a little nervous about it  so I need to do an experiment and bring a group of people like this in a projection room and play this stock footage  and when I played this stock footage  I simply wanted to find out what people remembered  what was memorable about it  What should I actually try to replicate  What should I try to emulate to some degree  So this is the footage that I was showing everybody. And what I discovered is  because of the nature of the footage and the fact that we're doing this film  there was an emotion that was built into it and our collective memories of what this launch meant to us and all these various things. When I showed it  and I asked  immediately after the screening was over  what they thought of it  what was your memorable shots  they changed them. They were    had camera moves on them. They had all kinds of things. Shots were combined  and I was just really curious  I mean  what the hell were you looking at just a few minutes ago and how come  how'd you come up with this sort of description  And what I discovered is  what I should do is not actually replicate what they saw  is replicate what they remembered. So this is our footage of the launch  based on  basically  taking notes  asking people what they thought  and then the combination of all the different shots and all the different things put together created their sort of collective consciousness of what they remembered it looked like  but not what it really looked like. So this is what we created for  Apollo   .  So literally what you're seeing now is the confluence of a bunch of different people  a bunch of different memories  including my own  of taking a little bit of liberty with the subject matter. I basically shot everything with short lenses  which means that you're very close to the action  but framed it very similarly to the long lens shots which gives you a sense of distance  so I was basically was setting up something that would remind you of something you haven't really quite seen before.  Music  And then I'm going to show you exactly what it is that you were reacting to when you were reacting to it. Tom Hanks  Hello  Houston  this is Odyssey. It's good to see you again.  Cheers   Music  Rob Legato  I pretend they're clapping for me. So now I'm in a parking lot. Basically it's a tin can  and I'm basically recreating the launch with fire extinguishers  fire  I have wax that I threw in front of the lens to look like ice  and so basically if you believed any of the stuff that I just showed you  what you were reacting to  what you're emoting to  is something that's a total falsehood  and I found that really kind of fascinating. And in this particular case  this is the climax of the movie  and  you know  the weight of achieving it was simply take a model  throw it out of a helicopter  and shoot it. And that's simply what I did. That's me shooting  and I'm a fairly mediocre operator  so I got that nice sense of verisimilitude  of a kind of  you know  following the rocket all the way down  and giving that little sort of edge  I was desperately trying to keep it in frame. So then I come up to the next thing. We had a NASA consultant who was actually an astronaut  who was actually on some of the missions  of Apollo     and he was there to basically double check my science. And  I guess somebody thought they needed to do that. I don't know why  but they thought they did. So we were  he's a hero  he's an astronaut  and we're all sort of excited  and  you know  I gave myself the liberty of saying  you know  some of the shots I did didn't really suck that bad. And so maybe  you know  we were feeling kind of a little good about it  so I brought him in here  and he needed to really check and see what we were doing  and basically give us our A plus report card  and so I showed him some shots we were working on  and waiting for the reaction that you hope for  which is what I got.  Music   Launch noises  So I showed him these two shots  and then he basically told me what he thought. Okay.  Laughter  It's what you dream about. So what I got from him is  he turned to me and said   You would never  ever design a rocket like that. You would never have a rocket go up while the gantry arms are going out. Can you imagine the tragedy that could possibly happen with that  You would never  ever design a rocket like that.  And he was looking at me. It's like  Yeah  I don't know if you noticed  but I'm the guy out in the parking lot recreating one of America's finest moments with fire extinguishers. And I'm not going to argue with you. You're an astronaut  a hero  and I'm from New Jersey  so    I'm just going to show you some footage. I'm just going to show you some footage  and tell me what you think. And then I did kind of get the reaction I was hoping for. So I showed him this  and this is actual footage that he was on. This is Apollo   . This was his mission. So I showed him this  and the reaction I got was interesting. So  and what happened was  I mean  what I sort of intuned in that is that he remembered it differently. He remembered that was a perfectly safe sort of gantry system  perfectly safe rocket launch  because he's sitting in a rocket that has  like  a hundred thousand pounds of thrust  built by the lowest bidder. He was hoping it was going to work out okay. So he twisted his memory around. Now  Ron Howard ran into Buzz Aldrin  who was not on the movie  so he had no idea that we were faking any of this footage  and he just responded as he would respond  and I'll run this. Ron Howard  Buzz Aldrin came up to me and said   Hey  that launch footage  I saw some shots I'd never seen before. Did you guys  what vault did you find that stuff in   And I said   Well  no vault  Buzz  we generated all that from scratch.  And he said   Huh  that's pretty good. Can we use it   RL  I think he's a great American. So   Titanic  was  if you don't know the story  doesn't end well. Jim Cameron actually photographed the real Titanic. So he basically set up  or basically shattered the suspension of disbelief  because what he photographed was the real thing  a Mir sub going down  or actually two Mir subs going down to the real wreck  and he created this very haunting footage. It's really beautiful  and it conjures up all these various different emotions  but he couldn't photograph everything  and to tell the story  I had to fill in the gaps  which is now rather daunting  because now I have to recreate back to back what really happened and I had  I'm the only one who could really blow it at that point. So this is the footage he photographed  and it was pretty moving and pretty awe inspiring. So I'm going to just let it run  so you kind of absorb this sort of thing  and I'll describe my sort of reactions when I was looking at it for the very first time. I got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically see it come back to life. I automatically wanted to see this ship  this magnificent ship  basically in all its glory  and conversely  I wanted to see it not in all its glory  basically go back to what it looks like. So I conjured up an effect that I'm later going to show you what I tried to do  which is kind of the heart of the movie  for me  and so that's why I wanted to do the movie  that's why I wanted to create the sort of things I created. And I'll show you  you know  another thing that I found interesting is what we really were emoting to when you take a look at it. So here's the behind the scenes  a couple of little shots here. So  when you saw my footage  you were seeing this  basically  a bunch of guys flipping a ship upside down  and the little Mir subs are actually about the size of small footballs  and shot in smoke. Jim went three miles went down  and I went about three miles away from the studio and photographed this in a garage. And so  but what you're emoting to  or what you're looking at  had the same feeling  the same haunting quality  that Jim's footage had  so I found it so fascinating that our brains sort of  once you believe something's real  you transfer everything that you feel about it  this quality you have  and it's totally artificial. It's totally make believe  yet it's not to you  and I found that that was a very interesting thing to explore and use  and it caused me to create the next effect that I'll show you  which is this sort of magic transition  and all I was really attempting to do is basically have the audience cue the effect  so it became a seamless experience for them  that I wasn't showing you my sort of interpretation  I was showing you what you wanted to see. And the very next shot  right after this    So you can see what I was doing. So basically  if there's two subs in the same shot  I shot it  because where's the camera coming from  And when Jim shot it  it was only one sub  because he was photographing from the other  and I don't remember if I did this or Jim did this. I'll give it to Jim  because he could use the pat on the back. Okay. So now the Titanic transition. So this is what I was referring to where I wanted to basically magically transplant from one state of the Titanic to the other. So I'll just play the shot once.  Music  And what I was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you. Gloria Stuart  That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight. RL  So  what I did is basically I had another screening room experience where I was basically tracking where I was looking  or where we were looking  and of course you're looking at the two people on the bow of the ship  and then at some point  I'm changing the periphery of the shot  I'm changing  it's becoming the rusted wreck  and then I would run it every day  and then I would find exactly the moment that I stopped looking at them and start noticing the rest of it  and the moment my eye shifted  we just marked it to the frame. The moment my eye shifted  I immediately started to change them  so now somehow you missed where it started and where it stopped. And so I'll just show it one more time. naturally do for us  which is  as soon as you shift your attention  something changes  and then I left the little scarf going  because it really wanted to be a ghostly shot  really wanted to feel like they were still on the wreck  essentially. That's where they were buried forever. Or something like that. I just made that up. It was  incidentally  the last time I ever saw daylight. It was a long film to work on.  Laughter  Now   Hugo  was another interesting movie  because the movie itself is about film illusions. It's about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence of vision that creates a motion picture  and one of the things I had to do is  we   Sasha Baron Cohen is a very clever  very smart guy  comedian  wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of the Buster Keaton sort of slapstick things  and he wanted his leg brace to get caught on a moving train. Very dangerous  very impossible to do  and particularly on our stage  because there literally is no way to actually move this train  because it fits so snugly into our set. So let me show you the scene  and then I basically used the trick that was identified by Sergei Eisenstein  which is  if you have a camera that's moving with a moving object  what is not moving appears to be moving  and what is moving appears to be stopped  so what you're actually seeing now is the train is not moving at all  and what is actually moving is the floor. So this is the shot. That's a little video of what you're looking at there  which is our little test  so that's actually what you're seeing  and I thought it was sort of an interesting thing  because it was  part of the homage of the movie itself is coming up with this sort of genius trick which I can't take credit for. I'd love to but I can't  because it was invented like in      or something like that  is I told Marty  and it's kind of one of those mind things that it's really hard to really get until you actually see it work  and I said  you know  what I was going to do  and he said   So  let me see if I can get this straight. The thing with the wheels  That doesn't move.   And the thing without the wheels  that moves.  Precisely.  Laughter  Brings me to the next  and final    Marty's not going to see this  is he   Laughter  This isn't viewed outside of     Laughter  The next illustration is something that  there's like all one shot theory. It's a very elegant way of telling a story  especially if you're following somebody on a journey  and that journey basically tells something about their personality in a very concise way  and what we wanted to do based on the shot in  Goodfellas   which is one of the great shots ever  a Martin Scorsese film  of basically following Henry Hill through what it feels like to be a gangster walk going through the Copacabana and being treated in a special way. He was the master of his universe  and we wanted Hugo to feel the same way  so we created this shot. That's Hugo.  Music  And we felt that if we could basically move the camera with him  we would feel what it feels like to be this boy who is basically the master of his universe  and his universe is  you know  behind the scenes in the bowels of this particular train station that only he can actually navigate through and do it this way  and we had to make it feel that this is his normal  everyday sort of life  so the idea of doing it as one shot was very important  and of course  in shooting in  D  which is basically it's a huge camera that's hanging off of a giant stick  so to recreate a steadycam shot was the task  and make it feel kind of like what the reaction you got when you saw the  Goodfellas  shot. So what you're now going to see is how we actually did it. It's actually five separate sets shot at five different times with two different boys. The one on the left is where the shot ends  and the shot on the right is where it takes over  and now we switch boys  so it went from Asa Butterfield  who's the star of the show  to his stand in.  Music  I wouldn't say his stunt double. There's a crazy rig that we built for this.  Music  And so this is  and now this is set number three we're into  and then we're going to go into  basically the very last moment of the shot is actually the steadycam shot. Everything else was shot on cranes and various things like that  and it literally was done over five different sets  two different boys  different times  and it all had to feel like it was all one shot  and what was sort of great for me was it was probably the best reviewed shot I've ever worked on  and  you know  I was kind of proud of it when I was done  which is  you should never really be proud of stuff  I guess. So I was kind of proud of it  and I went to a friend of mine  and said   You know  this is  you know  kind of the best reviewed shot I've ever worked on. What do you think was the reason   And he said   Because no one knows you had anything to do with it.  So  all I can say is  thank you  and that's my presentation for you.  Applause
