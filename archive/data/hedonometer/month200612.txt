I love trees  and I'm very lucky  because we live near a wonderful arboretum  and Sundays  usually  I'd go there with my wife and now  with my four year old  and we'd climb in the trees  we'd play hide and seek. The second school I was at had big trees too  had a fantastic tulip tree  I think it was the biggest in the country  and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it  around the playing fields. One day I was grabbed by some of my classmates  and taken in the bushes    I was stripped  I was attacked  I was abused  and this came out of the blue. Now  the reason I say that  because  afterwards  I was thinking    well  I went back into the school    I felt dirty  I felt betrayed  I felt ashamed  but mainly    mainly  I felt powerless. And    years later I was sitting in an airplane  next to a lady called Veronica  who came from Chile  and we were on a human rights tour  and she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured  and  from my very privileged position  this was the only reference point that I had. And it was an amazing learning experience because  for me  human rights have been something in which I had  you know  a part time interest  but  mainly  it was something that happened to other people over there. But I got a phone call from Bono in      and  as you know  he's a great singer  but he's a magnificent hustler  and    a very hard guy to say no to  and he was saying  you know  just after I'd done the Biko song  we're going to do a tour for Amnesty  you have to be on it  and really that was the first time that I'd been out and started meeting people who'd watched their family being shot in front of them  who'd had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean  and suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world  and I couldn't really walk away in quite the same way as before. So I got involved with this tour  which was for Amnesty  and then in '   I took over Bono's job trying to learn how to hustle. I didn't do it as well  but we managed to get Youssou N'Dour  Sting  Tracy Chapman  and Bruce Springsteen to go 'round the world for Amnesty  and it was an amazing experience. And  once again  I got an extraordinary education  and it was the first time  really  that I'd met a lot of these people in the different countries  and these human rights stories became very physical  and  again  I couldn't really walk away quite so comfortably. But the thing that really amazed me  that I had no idea  was that you could suffer in this way and then have your whole experience  your story  denied  buried and forgotten. And it seemed that whenever there was a camera around  or a video or film camera  it was a great deal harder to do    for those in power to bury the story. And Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours and there was a decision then    well  we made a proposal  for a couple of years  about trying to set up a division that was going to give cameras to human rights activists. It didn't really get anywhere  and then the Rodney King incident happened  and people thought  OK  if you have a camera in the right place at the right time  or  perhaps  the wrong time  depending who you are  then you can actually start doing something  and campaigning  and being heard  and telling people about what's going on. So  WITNESS was started in '   and it's since given cameras out in over    countries. And we campaign with activist groups and help them tell their story and  in fact  I will show you in a moment one of the most recent campaigns  and I'm afraid it's a story from Uganda  and  although we had a wonderful story from Uganda yesterday  this one isn't quite so good. In the north of Uganda  there are something like  .  million internally displaced people  people who are not refugees in another country  but because of the civil war  which has been going on for about    years  they have nowhere to live. And        kids have been taken away to become child soldiers  and the International Criminal Court is going after five of the leaders of the    now  what's it called  I forget the name of the of the army    it's Lord's Resistance Army  I believe    but the government  also  doesn't have a clean sheet  so if we could run the first video. Woman  Life in the camp is never simple. Even today life is difficult. We stay because of the fear that what pushed us into the camp ... still exists back home. Text   Between Two Fires  Torture and Displacement in Northern Uganda  Man  When we were at home  it was Kony's  rebel  soldiers disturbing us. At first  we were safe in the camp. But later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot. Jennifer  A soldier walked onto the road  asking where we'd been. Evelyn and I hid behind my mother. Evelyn  He ordered us to sit down  so we sat down. The other soldier also came. Jennifer  The man came and started undressing me. The other one carried Evelyn aside. The one who was defiling me then left me and went to rape Evelyn. And the one who was raping Evelyn came and defiled me also. Man  The soldiers with clubs this long beat us to get a confession. They kept telling us   Tell the truth   as they beat us. Woman  They insisted that I was lying. At that moment  they fired and shot off my fingers. I fell. They ran to join the others ... leaving me for dead. Text  Uganda ratified the Convention Against Torture in     . Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain of suffering  whether physical or mental  is intentionally inflicted by a person acting in an official capacity to obtain information or a confession  to punish  coerce or intimidate. Peter Gabriel  So torture is not something that always happens on other soil. In my country  it was    we had been looking at pictures of British soldiers beating up young Iraqis  we've got Abu Ghraib  we've got Guantanamo Bay. I had a driver on my way to Newark Airport  and he told me a story that  in the middle of the night    a.m.  he'd been taken out of his home in Queens    taken to a place in the Midwest  that he was interrogated and tortured and returned to the street four weeks later  because he had the same    he was Middle Eastern  and he had the same name as one of the      pilots  and that may or may not be true    I didn't think he was a liar  though. And  I think  if we look around the world  as well as the polar ice caps melting  human rights  which have been fought for  for many hundreds of years in some cases  are  also  eroding very fast  and that is something that we need to take a look at and  maybe  start campaigning for. I mean  here  too  one of our partners was at Van Jones and the Books Not Bars project    they have managed  with their footage in California to change the youth correction systems employed  and it's much    much    I think  more humane methods are being looked at  how you should lock up young kids  and that's questionable to start off. And as the story of Mr. Morales  just down the road  excuse me  Mr. Gabriel  would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit  No  not at all  no problem  take your time. But this  surely  whoever that man is  whatever he's done  this is cruel and unusual punishment. Anyway  WITNESS has been trying to arm the brave people who often put their lives at risk around the world  with cameras  and I'd like to show you just a little more of that. Thank you. Text  You can say a jury is corrupt. You can say a person is lying. You can say you don't trust newspapers. But you can't say what you just saw never happened. Help WITNESS give cameras to the world. Shoot a video  expose injustice  reveal the truth  show us what's wrong with the world  and maybe we can help make it right. WITNESS. All the video you have just seen was recorded by human rights groups working with WITNESS. PG  WITNESS was born of technological innovation    in a sense the small  portable  DV cam was really what allowed it to come into being. And we've also been trying to get computers out to the world  so that groups can communicate much more effectively  campaign much more effectively  but now we have the wonderful possibility  which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it  because that is cheap  it's ubiquitous  and it's moving fast all around the world    and it's very exciting for us. And so  the dream is that we could have a world in which anyone who has anything bad happen to them of this sort has a chance of getting their story uploaded  being seen  being watched  that they really know that they can be heard  that there would be a giant website  maybe  a little like Google Earth  and you could fly over and find out the realities of what's going  for the world's inhabitants. In a way what this technology is allowing is  really  that a lot of the problems of the world can have a human face  that we can actually see who's dying of AIDS or who's being beaten up  for the first time  and we can hear their stories in a way that the blogger culture    if we can move that into these sort of fields  I think we can really transform the world in all sorts of ways. There could be a new movement growing up  rising from the ground  reaching for the light  and growing strong  just like a tree. Thank you. With all the legitimate concerns about AIDS and avian flu    and we'll hear about that from the brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today    I want to talk about the other pandemic  which is cardiovascular disease  diabetes  hypertension    all of which are completely preventable for at least    percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle. And what's happening is that there's a globalization of illness occurring  that people are starting to eat like us  and live like us  and die like us. And in one generation  for example  Asia's gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest. And in Africa  cardiovascular disease equals the HIV and AIDS deaths in most countries. So there's a critical window of opportunity we have to make an important difference that can affect the lives of literally millions of people  and practice preventive medicine on a global scale. Heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people    not only in this country  but also worldwide    than everything else combined  and yet it's completely preventable for almost everybody. It's not only preventable  it's actually reversible. And for the last almost    years  we've been able to show that by simply changing diet and lifestyle  using these very high tech  expensive  state of the art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low tech and low cost interventions can be like    quantitative arteriography  before and after a year  and cardiac PET scans. We showed a few months ago    we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle  and    percent regression in the tumor growth  or inhibition of the tumor growth  compared to only nine percent in the control group. And in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here  the prostate tumor activity is shown in red    you can see it diminishing after a year. Now there is an epidemic of obesity  two thirds of adults and    percent of kids. What's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased    percent in the past    years  and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do. That's pitiful  and it's preventable. Now these are not election returns  these are the people    the number of the people who are obese by state  beginning in '    '    '      these are from the CDC website    '    '    '    '      you get a new category    '    '    '    '    '    '    '    '                  it gets worse. We're kind of devolving.  Laughter  Now what can we do about this  Well  you know  the diet that we've found that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an Asian diet. But the people in Asia are starting to eat like we are  which is why they're starting to get sick like we are. So I've been working with a lot of the big food companies. They can make it fun and sexy and hip and crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods  like    I chair the advisory boards to McDonald's  and PepsiCo  and ConAgra  and Safeway  and soon Del Monte  and they're finding that it's good business. The salads that you see at McDonald's came from the work    they're going to have an Asian salad. At Pepsi  two thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods. And so if we can do that  then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for preventing avian flu. Thank you. I wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress tell a very well known interviewer on television   I'm really getting into the Internet lately. I just wish it were more organized.  So ... If I controlled the Internet  you could auction your broken heart on eBay. Take the money  go to Amazon  buy a phonebook for a country you've never been to    call folks at random until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language. If I were in charge of the Internet  you could Mapquest your lover's mood swings. Hang left at cranky  right at preoccupied  U turn on silent treatment  all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin'. You could navigate and understand every emotional intersection. Some days  I'm as shallow as a baking pan  but I still stretch miles in all directions. If I owned the Internet  Napster  Monster and Friendster.com would be one big website. That way you could listen to cool music while you pretend to look for a job and you're really just chattin' with your pals. Heck  if I ran the Web  you could email dead people. They would not email you back but you'd get an automated reply. Their name in your inbox it's all you wanted anyway. And a message saying   Hey  it's me. I miss you. Listen  you'll see being dead is dandy. Now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy.  If I designed the Internet  childhood.com would be a loop of a boy in an orchard  with a ski pole for a sword  trashcan lid for a shield  shouting   I am the emperor of oranges. I am the emperor of oranges. I am the emperor of oranges.  Now follow me  OK  Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit bath instructions. One  two  three. That links with hotdiggitydog.com. That is my grandfather. They take you to gruff ex cop on his fourth marriage.dad. He forms an attachment to kind of ditzy but still sends ginger snaps for Christmas.mom  who downloads the boy in the orchard  the emperor of oranges  who grows up to be me    the guy who usually goes too far. So if I were emperor of the Internet  I guess I'd still be mortal  huh  But at that point  I would probably already have the lowest possible mortgage and the most enlarged possible penis so I would outlaw spam on my first day in office. I wouldn't need it. I'd be like some kind of Internet genius  and me  I'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that    pop     I'd go wireless. Huh  Maybe Google would hire this. I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus until the World Wide Web is as wise  as wild and as organized as I think a modern day miracle oracle can get  but  ooh eee  you want to bet just how whack and un PC your Mac or PC is going to be when I'm rocking hot shit hot shot god.net  I guess it's just like life. It is not a question of if you can    it's  do ya  We can interfere with the interface. We can make  You've got Hallelujah  the national anthem of cyberspace every lucky time we log on. You don't say a prayer. You don't write a psalm. You don't chant an  om.  You send one blessed email to whomever you're thinking of at dah da la dat da dah da la dat.com. Thank you  TED. This is really a two hour presentation I give to high school students  cut down to three minutes. And it all started one day on a plane  on my way to TED  seven years ago. And in the seat next to me was a high school student  a teenager  and she came from a really poor family. And she wanted to make something of her life  and she asked me a simple little question. She said   What leads to success   And I felt really badly  because I couldn't give her a good answer. So I get off the plane  and I come to TED. And I think  jeez  I'm in the middle of a room of successful people  So why don't I ask them what helped them succeed  and pass it on to kids  So here we are  seven years      interviews later  and I'm going to tell you what really leads to success and makes TEDsters tick. And the first thing is passion. Freeman Thomas says   I'm driven by my passion.  TEDsters do it for love  they don't do it for money. Carol Coletta says   I would pay someone to do what I do.  And the interesting thing is  if you do it for love  the money comes anyway. Work  Rupert Murdoch said to me   It's all hard work. Nothing comes easily. But I have a lot of fun.  Did he say fun  Rupert  Yes  TEDsters do have fun working. And they work hard. I figured  they're not workaholics. They're workafrolics. Good  Alex Garden says   To be successful  put your nose down in something and get damn good at it.  There's no magic  it's practice  practice  practice. And it's focus. Norman Jewison said to me   I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing.  And push  David Gallo says   Push yourself. Physically  mentally  you've got to push  push  push.  You've got to push through shyness and self doubt. Goldie Hawn says   I always had self doubts. I wasn't good enough  I wasn't smart enough. I didn't think I'd make it.  Now it's not always easy to push yourself  and that's why they invented mothers. Frank Gehry said to me   My mother pushed me.  Serve  Sherwin Nuland says   It was a privilege to serve as a doctor.  A lot of kids want to be millionaires. The first thing I say is   OK  well you can't serve yourself  you've got to serve others something of value. Because that's the way people really get rich.  Ideas  TEDster Bill Gates says   I had an idea  founding the first micro computer software company.  I'd say it was a pretty good idea. And there's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas    it's just doing some very simple things. And I give lots of evidence. Persist  Joe Kraus says   Persistence is the number one reason for our success.  You've got to persist through failure. You've got to persist through crap  Which of course means  Criticism  Rejection  Assholes and Pressure.  So  the answer to this question is simple  Pay       bucks and come to TED. Or failing that  do the eight things    and trust me  these are the big eight things that lead to success. Thank you TEDsters for all your interviews
