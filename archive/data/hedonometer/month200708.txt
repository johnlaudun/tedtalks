Like many of you here  I am trying to contribute towards a renaissance in Africa. The question of transformation in Africa really is a question of leadership. Africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders. And it is my contention that the manner in which we educate our leaders is fundamental to progress on this continent. I want to tell you some stories that explain my view. We all heard about the importance of stories yesterday. An American friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in Ghana  and in a period of three months she came to a conclusion about the state of leadership in Africa that had taken me over a decade to reach. Twice she was involved in surgeries where they lost power at the hospital. The emergency generators did not start. There was not a flashlight  not a lantern  not a candle    pitch black. The patient's cut open  twice. The first time it was a C section. Thankfully  baby was out    mother and child survived. The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia. Anesthetic wears off. The patient feels pain. He's crying. He's screaming. He's praying. Pitch black. Not a candle  not a flashlight. And that hospital could have afforded flashlights. They could have afforded to purchase these things  but they didn't. And it happened twice. Another time  she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die because they refused to give her oxygen that they had. And so three months later  just before she returned to the United States  nurses in Accra go on strike. And her recommendation is take this opportunity to fire everyone  start all over again. Start all over again. Now what does this have to do with leadership  You see  the folks at the ministry of health  the hospital administrators  the doctors  the nurses    they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education after secondary school. They are the elite. They are our leaders. Their decisions  their actions matter. And when they fail  a nation literally suffers. So when I speak of leadership  I'm not talking about just political leaders. We've heard a lot about that. I'm talking about the elite. Those who've been trained  whose job it is to be the guardians of their society. The lawyers  the judges  the policemen  the doctors  the engineers  the civil servants    those are the leaders. And we need to train them right. Now  my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in Ghana occurred when I was    years old. We had just had a military coup  and soldiers were pervasive in our society. They were a pervasive presence. And one day I go to the airport to meet my father  and as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building  I'm stopped by two soldiers wielding AK    assault weapons. And they asked me to join a crowd of people that were running up and down this embankment. Why  Because the path I had taken was considered out of bounds. No sign to this effect. Now  I was   . I was very worried about what my peers at school might think if they saw me running up and down this hill. I was especially concerned of what the girls might think. And so I started to argue with these men. It was a little reckless  but you know  I was   . I got lucky. A Ghana Airways pilot falls into the same predicament. Because of his uniform they speak to him differently  and they explain to him that they're just following orders. So he takes their radio  talks to their boss  and gets us all released. What lessons would you take from an experience like this  Several  for me. Leadership matters. Those men are following the orders of a superior officer. I learned something about courage. It was important not to look at those guns. And I also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls. So a few years after this event  I leave Ghana on a scholarship to go to Swarthmore College for my education. It was a breath of fresh air. You know  the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information and repeat back to them as I was used to back in Ghana. They wanted us to think critically. They wanted us to be analytical. They wanted us to be concerned about social issues. In my economics classes I got high marks for my understanding of basic economics. But I learned something more profound than that  which is that the leaders    the managers of Ghana's economy    were making breathtakingly bad decisions that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse. And so here was this lesson again    leadership matters. It matters a great deal. But I didn't really fully understand what had happened to me at Swarthmore. I had an inkling  but I didn't fully realize it until I went out into the workplace and I went to work at Microsoft Corporation. And I was part of this team    this thinking  learning team whose job it was to design and implement new software that created value in the world. And it was brilliant to be part of this team. It was brilliant. And I realized just what had happened to me at Swarthmore  this transformation    the ability to confront problems  complex problems  and to design solutions to those problems. The ability to create is the most empowering thing that can happen to an individual. And I was part of that. Now  while I was at Microsoft  the annual revenues of that company grew larger than the GDP of the Republic of Ghana. And by the way  it's continued to. The gap has widened since I left. Now  I've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred. I mean  it's the people there who are so hardworking  persistent  creative  empowered. But there were also some external factors  free markets  the rule of law  infrastructure. These things were provided by institutions run by the people that I call leaders. And those leaders did not emerge spontaneously. Somebody trained them to do the work that they do. Now  while I was at Microsoft  this funny thing happened. I became a parent. And for the first time  Africa mattered more to me than ever before. Because I realized that the state of the African continent would matter to my children and their children. That the state of the world    the state of the world depends on what's happening to Africa  as far as my kids would be concerned. And at this time  when I was going through what I call my  pre mid life crisis   Africa was a mess. Somalia had disintegrated into anarchy. Rwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war. And it seemed to me that that was the wrong direction  and I needed to be back helping. I couldn't just stay in Seattle and raise my kids in an upper middle class neighborhood and feel good about it. This was not the world that I'd want my children to grow up in. So I decided to get engaged  and the first thing that I did was to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of people and really try to understand what the real issues were. And three things kept coming up for every problem  corruption  weak institutions and the people who run them    the leaders. Now  I was a little scared because when you see those three problems  they seem really hard to deal with. And they might say   Look  don't even try.  But  for me  I asked the question   Well  where are these leaders coming from  What is it about Ghana that produces leaders that are unethical or unable to solve problems   So I went to look at what was happening in our educational system. And it was the same    learning by rote    from primary school through graduate school. Very little emphasis on ethics  and the typical graduate from a university in Ghana has a stronger sense of entitlement than a sense of responsibility. This is wrong. So I decided to engage this particular problem. Because it seems to me that every society  every society  must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders. And Ghana was not paying enough attention. And this is true across sub Saharan Africa  actually. So this is what I'm doing now. I'm trying to bring the experience that I had at Swarthmore to Africa. I wish there was a liberal arts college in every African country. I think it would make a huge difference. And what Ashesi University is trying to do is to train a new generation of ethical  entrepreneurial leaders. We're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity  who have the ability to confront the complex problems  ask the right questions  and come up with workable solutions. I'll admit that there are times when it seems like  Mission  Impossible   but we must believe that these kids are smart. That if we involve them in their education  if we have them discuss the real issues that they confront    that our whole society confronts    and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world  that magic will happen. Now  a month into this project  we'd just started classes. And a month into it  I come to the office  and I have this email from one of our students. And it said  very simply   I am thinking now.  And he signs off   Thank you.  It's such a simple statement. But I was moved almost to tears because I understood what was happening to this young man. And it is an awesome thing to be a part of empowering someone in this way. I am thinking now. This year we challenged our students to craft an honor code themselves. There's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now over whether they should have an honor code  and if so  what it should look like. One of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart. Can we create a perfect society  Her understanding that a student crafted honor code constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible. Now  we cannot achieve perfection  but if we reach for it  then we can achieve excellence. I don't know ultimately what they will do. I don't know whether they will decide to have this honor code. But the conversation they're having now    about what their good society should look like  what their excellent society should look like  is a really good thing. Am I out of time  OK. Now  I just wanted to leave that slide up because it's important that we think about it. I'm very excited about the fact that every student at Ashesi University does community service before they graduate. That for many of them  it has been a life altering experience. These young future leaders are beginning to understand the real business of leadership  the real privilege of leadership  which is after all to serve humanity. I am even more thrilled by the fact that least year our student body elected a woman to be the head of Student Government. It's the first time in the history of Ghana that a woman has been elected head of Student Government at any university. It says a lot about her. It says a lot about the culture that's forming on campus. It says a lot about her peers who elected her. She won with    percent of the vote. And it gives me a lot of hope. It turns out that corporate West Africa also appreciates what's happening with our students. We've graduated two classes of students to date. And every single one of them has been placed. And we're getting great reports back from corporate Ghana  corporate West Africa  and the things that they're most impressed about is work ethic. You know  that passion for what they're doing. The persistence  their ability to deal with ambiguity  their ability to tackle problems that they haven't seen before. This is good because over the past five years  there have been times when I've felt this is  Mission  Impossible.  And it's just wonderful to see these glimmers of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right. I think that the current and future leaders of Africa have an incredible opportunity to drive a major renaissance on the continent. It's an incredible opportunity. There aren't very many more opportunities like this in the world. I believe that Africa has reached an inflection point with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent. We have reached a moment from which can emerge a great society within one generation. It will depend on inspired leadership. And it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders will make all the difference. Thank you  and God bless. I just heard the best joke about Bond Emeruwa. I was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago  and a Nigerian journalist comes    and this will only make sense if you've ever watched a James Bond movie    and a Nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes   Aha  we meet again  Mr. Bond   It was great. So  I've got a little sheet of paper here  mostly because I'm Nigerian and if you leave me alone  I'll talk for like two hours. I just want to say good afternoon  good evening. It's been an incredible few days. It's downhill from now on. I wanted to thank Emeka and Chris. But also  most importantly  all the invisible people behind TED that you just see flitting around the whole place that have made sort of this space for such a diverse and robust conversation. It's really amazing. I've been in the audience. I'm a writer  and I've been watching people with the slide shows and scientists and bankers  and I've been feeling a bit like a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah. Like  what have I got to say about all this  And I was watching Jane  Goodall  yesterday  and I thought it was really great  and I was watching those incredible slides of the chimpanzees  and I thought   Wow. What if a chimpanzee could talk  you know  What would it say   My first thought was   Well  you know  there's George Bush.  But then I thought   Why be rude to chimpanzees   I guess there goes my green card. There's been a lot of talk about narrative in Africa. And what's become increasingly clear to me is that we're talking about news stories about Africa  we're not really talking about African narratives. And it's important to make a distinction  because if the news is anything to go by     percent of Americans can't    either can't afford health insurance or have the most inadequate health insurance  and have a president who  despite the protest of millions of his citizens    even his own Congress    continues to prosecute a senseless war. So if news is anything to go by  the U.S. is right there with Zimbabwe  right  Which it isn't really  is it  And talking about war  my girlfriend has this great t shirt that says   Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity.  It's amazing  isn't it  The truth is  everything we know about America  everything Americans come to know about being American  isn't from the news. I live there. We don't go home at the end of the day and think   Well  I really know who I am now because the Wall Street Journal says that the Stock Exchange closed at this many points.  What we know about how to be who we are comes from stories. It comes from the novels  the movies  the fashion magazines. It comes from popular culture. In other words  it's the agents of our imagination who really shape who we are. And this is important to remember  because in Africa the complicated questions we want to ask about what all of this means has been asked from the rock paintings of the San people  through the Sundiata epics of Mali  to modern contemporary literature. If you want to know about Africa  read our literature    and not just  Things Fall Apart   because that would be like saying   I've read 'Gone with the Wind' and so I know everything about America.  That's very important. There's a poem by Jack Gilbert called  The Forgotten Dialect of the Heart.  He says   When the Sumerian tablets were first translated  they were thought to be business records. But what if they were poems and psalms  My love is like twelve Ethiopian goats standing still in the morning light. Shiploads of thuja are what my body wants to say to your body. Giraffes are this desire in the dark.  This is important. It's important because misreading is really the chance for complication and opportunity. The first Igbo Bible was translated from English in about the     s by Bishop Crowther  who was a Yoruba. And it's important to know Igbo is a tonal language  and so they'll say the word  igwe  and  igwe   same spelling  one means  sky  or  heaven   and one means  bicycle  or  iron.  So  God is in heaven surrounded by His angels  was translated as     Igbo . And for some reason  in Cameroon  when they tried to translate the Bible into Cameroonian patois  they chose the Igbo version. And I'm not going to give you the patois translation  I'm going to make it standard English. Basically  it ends up as  God is on a bicycle with his angels.  This is good  because language complicates things. You know  we often think that language mirrors the world in which we live  and I find that's not true. The language actually makes the world in which we live. Language is not    I mean  things don't have any mutable value by themselves  we ascribe them a value. And language can't be understood in its abstraction. It can only be understood in the context of story  and everything  all of this is story. And it's important to remember that  because if we don't  then we become ahistorical. We've had a lot of    a parade of amazing ideas here. But these are not new to Africa. Nigeria got its independence in     . The first time the possibility for independence was discussed was in       following the Aba women's market riots. In       in the middle of the Biafran Nigerian Civil War  Dr. Njoku Obi invented the Cholera vaccine. So  you know  the thing is to remember that because otherwise     years from now  we'll be back here trying to tell this story again. So  what it says to me then is that it's not really    the problem isn't really the stories that are being told or which stories are being told  the problem really is the terms of humanity that we're willing to bring to complicate every story  and that's really what it's all about. Let me tell you a Nigerian joke. Well  it's just a joke  anyway. So there's Tom  Dick and Harry and they're working construction. And Tom opens up his lunch box and there's rice in it  and he goes on this rant about   Twenty years  my wife has been packing rice for lunch. If she does it again tomorrow  I'm going to throw myself off this building and kill myself.  And Dick and Harry repeat this. The next day  Tom opens his lunchbox  there's rice  so he throws himself off and kills himself  and Tom  Dick and Harry follow. And now the inquest    you know  Tom's wife and Dick's wife are distraught. They wished they'd not packed rice. But Harry's wife is confused  because she said   You know  Harry had been packing his own lunch for    years.  This seemingly innocent joke  when I heard it as a child in Nigeria  was told about Igbo  Yoruba and Hausa  with the Hausa being Harry. So what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about Harry becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred. My father was educated in Cork  in the University of Cork  in the '  s. In fact  every time I read in Ireland  people get me all mistaken and they say   Oh  this is Chris O'Barney from Cork.  But he was also in Oxford in the '  s  and yet growing up as a child in Nigeria  my father used to say to me   You must never eat or drink in a Yoruba person's house because they will poison you.  It makes sense now when I think about it  because if you'd known my father  you would've wanted to poison him too. So I was born in       at the beginning of the Biafran Nigerian Civil War  and the war ended after three years. And I was growing up in school and the federal government didn't want us taught about the history of the war  because they thought it probably would make us generate a new generation of rebels. So I had a very inventive teacher  a Pakistani Muslim  who wanted to teach us about this. So what he did was to teach us Jewish Holocaust history  and so huddled around books with photographs of people in Auschwitz  I learned the melancholic history of my people through the melancholic history of another people. I mean  picture this    really picture this. A Pakistani Muslim teaching Jewish Holocaust history to young Igbo children. Story is powerful. Story is fluid and it belongs to nobody. And it should come as no surprise that my first novel at    was about Neo Nazis taking over Nigeria to institute the Fourth Reich. It makes perfect sense. And they were to blow up strategic targets and take over the country  and they were foiled by a Nigerian James Bond called Coyote Williams  and a Jewish Nazi hunter. And it happened over four continents. And when the book came out  I was heralded as Africa's answer to Frederick Forsyth  which is a dubious honor at best. But also  the book was launched in time for me to be accused of constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt. So at     I was bonded off to prison in Nigeria. I grew up very privileged  and it's important to talk about privilege  because we don't talk about it here. A lot of us are very privileged. I grew up    servants  cars  televisions  all that stuff. My story of Nigeria growing up was very different from the story I encountered in prison  and I had no language for it. I was completely terrified  completely broken  and kept trying to find a new language  a new way to make sense of all of this. Six months after that  with no explanation  they let me go. Now for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know that it was because it was costing them too much to feed me. But I mean  I grew up with this incredible privilege  and not just me    millions of Nigerians grew up with books and libraries. In fact  we were talking last night about how all of the steamy novels of Harold Robbins had done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in Africa than any sex education programs ever had. All of those are gone. We are squandering the most valuable resource we have on this continent  the valuable resource of the imagination. In the film   Sometimes in April  by Raoul Peck  Idris Elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised  and he's being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend    fellow Rwandan Army officer  albeit a Tutsi    played by Fraser James. And Fraser's on his knees  arms tied behind his back  and he's crying. He's sniveling. It's a pitiful sight. And as we watch it  we are ashamed. And we want to say to Idris   Chop him up. Shut him up.  And as Idris moves  Fraser screams   Stop  Please stop   Idris pauses  then he moves again  and Fraser says   Please  Please stop   And it's not the look of horror and terror on Fraser's face that stops Idris or us  it's the look in Fraser's eyes. It's one that says   Don't do this. And I'm not saying this to save myself  although this would be nice. I'm doing it to save you  because if you do this  you will be lost.  To be so afraid that you're standing in the face of a death you can't escape and that you're soiling yourself and crying  but to say in that moment  as Fraser says to Idris   Tell my girlfriend I love her.  In that moment  Fraser says   I am lost already  but not you ... not you.  This is a redemption we can all aspire to. African narratives in the West  they proliferate. I really don't care anymore. I'm more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves    how as a writer  I find that African writers have always been the curators of our humanity on this continent. The question is  how do I balance narratives that are wonderful with narratives of wounds and self loathing  And this is the difficulty that I face. I am trying to move beyond political rhetoric to a place of ethical questioning. I am asking us to balance the idea of our complete vulnerability with the complete notion of transformation of what is possible. As a young middle class Nigerian activist  I launched myself along with a whole generation of us into the campaign to stop the government. And I asked millions of people  without questioning my right to do so  to go up against the government. And I watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed. I justified it  and I said   This is the cost of revolution. Have I not myself been imprisoned  Have I not myself been beaten   It wasn't until later  when I was imprisoned again  that I understood the real meaning of torture  and how easy your humanity can be taken from you  for the time I was engaged in war  righteous  righteous war. Excuse me. Sometimes I can stand before the world    and when I say this  transformation is a difficult and slow process    sometimes I can stand before the world and say   My name is Chris Abani. I have been human six days  but only sometimes.  But this is a good thing. It's never going to be easy. There are no answers. As I was telling Rachel from Google Earth  that I had challenged my students in America    I said   You don't know anything about Africa  you're all idiots.  And so they said   Tell me about Africa  Professor Abani.  So I went to Google Earth and learned about Africa. And the truth be told  this is it  isn't it  There are no essential Africans  and most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else about the continent we come from  and yet we want to make profound statements about it. And I think if we can just admit that we're all trying to approximate the truth of our own communities  it will make for a much more nuanced and a much more interesting conversation. I want to believe that we can be agnostic about this  that we can rise above all of this. When I was     I read James Baldwin's  Another Country   and that book broke me. Not because I was encountering homosexual sex and love for the first time  but because the way James wrote about it made it impossible for me to attach otherness to it.  Here   Jimmy said.  Here is love  all of it.  The fact that it happens in  Another Country  takes you quite by surprise. My friend Ronald Gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world  those who can count  and those who can't. He also says that the cause of all our trouble is the belief in an essential  pure identity  religious  ethnic  historical  ideological. I want to leave you with a poem by Yusef Komunyakaa that speaks to transformation. It's called  Ode to the Drum   and I'll try and read it the way Yusef would be proud to hear it read.  Gazelle  I killed you for your skin's exquisite touch  for how easy it is to be nailed to a board weathered raw as white butcher paper. Last night I heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet. You know it wasn't anger that made me stop my heart till the hammer fell. Weeks ago  you broke me as a woman once shattered me into a song beneath her weight  before you slouched into that grassy hush. And now I'm tightening lashes  shaped in hide as if around a ribcage  shaped like five bowstrings. Ghosts cannot slip back inside the body's drum. You've been seasoned by wind  dusk and sunlight. Pressure can make everything whole again. Brass nails tacked into the ebony wood  your face has been carved five times. I have to drive trouble in the hills. Trouble in the valley  and trouble by the river too. There is no palm wine  fish  salt  or calabash. Kadoom. Kadoom. Kadoom. Ka doooom. Now I have beaten a song back into you. Rise and walk away like a panther.  Thank you. I really am honored to be here  and as Chris said  it's been over    years since I started working in Africa. My first introduction was at the Abidjan airport on a sweaty  Ivory Coast morning. I had just left Wall Street  cut my hair to look like Margaret Mead  given away most everything that I owned  and arrived with all the essentials    some poetry  a few clothes  and  of course  a guitar    because I was going to save the world  and I thought I would just start with the African continent. But literally within days of arriving I was told  in no uncertain terms  by a number of West African women  that Africans didn't want saving  thank you very much  least of all not by me. I was too young  unmarried  I had no children  didn't really know Africa  and besides  my French was pitiful. And so  it was an incredibly painful time in my life  and yet it really started to give me the humility to start listening. I think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well  so I moved to Kenya and worked in Uganda  and I met a group of Rwandan women  who asked me  in       to move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there. And I did  and we ended up naming it Duterimbere  meaning  to go forward with enthusiasm.  And while we were doing it  I realized that there weren't a lot of businesses that were viable and started by women  and so maybe I should try to run a business  too. And so I started looking around  and I heard about a bakery that was run by    prostitutes. And  being a little intrigued  I went to go meet this group  and what I found was    unwed mothers who were trying to survive. And it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language  and how what we call people so often distances us from them  and makes them little. I also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business  that  in fact  it was a classic charity run by a well intentioned person  who essentially spent     dollars a month to keep these    women busy making little crafts and baked goods  and living on    cents a day  still in poverty. So  I made a deal with the women. I said   Look  we get rid of the charity side  and we run this as a business and I'll help you.  They nervously agreed. I nervously started  and  of course  things are always harder than you think they're going to be. First of all  I thought  well  we need a sales team  and we clearly aren't the A Team here  so let's    I did all this training. And the epitome was when I literally marched into the streets of Nyamirambo  which is the popular quarter of Kigali  with a bucket  and I sold all these little doughnuts to people  and I came back  and I was like   You see   And the women said   You know  Jacqueline  who in Nyamirambo is not going to buy doughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall American woman   And like    So then I went the whole American way  with competitions  team and individual. Completely failed  but over time  the women learnt to sell on their own way. And they started listening to the marketplace  and they came back with ideas for cassava chips  and banana chips  and sorghum bread  and before you knew it  we had cornered the Kigali market  and the women were earning three to four times the national average. And with that confidence surge  I thought   Well  it's time to create a real bakery  so let's paint it.  And the women said   That's a really great idea.  And I said   Well  what color do you want to paint it   And they said   Well  you choose.  And I said   No  no  I'm learning to listen. You choose. It's your bakery  your street  your country    not mine.  But they wouldn't give me an answer. So  one week  two weeks  three weeks went by  and finally I said   Well  how about blue   And they said   Blue  blue  we love blue. Let's do it blue.  So  I went to the store  I brought Gaudence  the recalcitrant one of all  and we brought all this paint and fabric to make curtains  and on painting day  we all gathered in Nyamirambo  and the idea was we would paint it white with blue as trim  like a little French bakery. But that was clearly not as satisfying as painting a wall of blue like a morning sky. So  blue  blue  everything became blue. The walls were blue  the windows were blue  the sidewalk out front was painted blue. And Aretha Franklin was shouting  R E S P E C T   the women's hips were swaying and little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes  but it was their day. And at the end of it  we stood across the street and we looked at what we had done  and I said   It is so beautiful.  And the women said   It really is.  And I said   And I think the color is perfect   and they all nodded their head  except for Gaudence  and I said   What   And she said   Nothing.  And I said   What   And she said   Well  it is pretty  but  you know  our color  really  it is green.  And       I learned then that listening isn't just about patience  but that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long  it's really hard to say what you mean. And  mostly because people never really ask you  and when they do  you don't really think they want to know the truth. And so then I learned that listening is not only about waiting  but it's also learning how better to ask questions. And so  I lived in Kigali for about two and a half years  doing these two things  and it was an extraordinary time in my life. And it taught me three lessons that I think are so important for us today  and certainly in the work that I do. The first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth. As Eleni has said  when people gain income  they gain choice  and that is fundamental to dignity. But as human beings  we also want to see each other  and we want to be heard by each other  and we should never forget that. The second is that traditional charity and aid are never going to solve the problems of poverty. I think Andrew pretty well covered that  so I will move to the third point  which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty. Yes  we ran this as a business  but someone needed to pay the philanthropic support that came into the training  and the management support  the strategic advice and  maybe most important of all  the access to new contacts  networks and new markets. And so  on a micro level  there's a real role for this combination of investment and philanthropy. And on a macro level    some of the speakers have inferred that even health should be privatized. But  having had a father with heart disease  and realizing that what our family could afford was not what he should have gotten  and having a good friend step in to help  I really believe that all people deserve access to health at prices they can afford. I think the market can help us figure that out  but there's got to be a charitable component  or I don't think we're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in. And so  it was really those lessons that made me decide to build Acumen Fund about six years ago. It's a nonprofit  venture capital fund for the poor  a few oxymorons in one sentence. It essentially raises charitable funds from individuals  foundations and corporations  and then we turn around and we invest equity and loans in both for profit and nonprofit entities that deliver affordable health  housing  energy  clean water to low income people in South Asia and Africa  so that they can make their own choices. We've invested about    million dollars in    different enterprises  and have  in so doing  created nearly        jobs  and delivered tens of millions of services to people who otherwise would not be able to afford them. I want to tell you two stories. Both of them are in Africa. Both of them are about investing in entrepreneurs who are committed to service  and who really know the markets. Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise  and both of them  because they're manufacturers  create jobs directly  and create incomes indirectly  because they're in the malaria sector  and Africa loses about    billion dollars a year because of malaria. And so as people get healthier  they also get wealthier. The first one is called Advanced Bio Extracts Limited. It's a company built in Kenya about seven years ago by an incredible entrepreneur named Patrick Henfrey and his three colleagues. These are old hand farmers who've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs in Kenya over the last    years. Now  this plant is an Artemisia plant  it's the basic component for artemisinin  which is the best known treatment for malaria. It's indigenous to China and the Far East  but given that the prevalence of malaria is here in Africa  Patrick and his colleagues said   Let's bring it here  because it's a high value add product.  The farmers get three to four times the yields that they would with maize. And so  using patient capital    money that they could raise early on  that actually got below market returns and was willing to go the long haul and be combined with management assistance  strategic assistance    they've now created a company where they purchase from       farmers. So that's about        people affected. And I think some of you may have visited    these farmers are helped by KickStart and TechnoServe  who help them become more self sufficient. They buy it  they dry it and they bring it to this factory  which was purchased in part by  again  patient capital from Novartis  who has a real interest in getting the powder so that they can make Coartem. Acumen's been working with ABE for the past year  year and a half  both on looking at a new business plan  and what does expansion look like  helping with management support and helping to do term sheets and raise capital. And I really understood what patient capital meant emotionally in the last month or so. Because the company was literally    days away from proving that the product they produced was at the world quality level needed to make Coartem  when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history. And we called all of the social investors we know. Now  some of these same social investors are really interested in Africa and understand the importance of agriculture  and they even helped the farmers. And even when we explained that if ABE goes away  all those       jobs go away too  we sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social. And it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused. So Acumen made not one  but two bridge loans  and the good news is they did indeed meet world quality classification and are now in the final stages of closing a    million dollar round  to move it to the next level  and I think that this will be one of the more important companies in East Africa. This is Samuel. He's a farmer. He was actually living in the Kibera slums when his father called him and told him about Artemisia and the value add potential. So he moved back to the farm  and  long story short  they now have seven acres under cultivation. Samuel's kids are in private school  and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into Artemisia production    dignity being more important than wealth. The next one  many of you know. I talked about it a little at Oxford two years ago  and some of you visited A to Z manufacturing  which is one of the great  real companies in East Africa. It's another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise. And this is really a story about a public private solution that has really worked. It started in Japan. Sumitomo had developed a technology essentially to impregnate a polyethylene based fiber with organic insecticide  so you could create a bed net  a malaria bed net  that would last five years and not need to be re dipped. It could alter the vector  but like Artemisia  it had been produced only in East Asia. And as part of its social responsibility  Sumitomo said   Why don't we experiment with whether we can produce it in Africa  for Africans   UNICEF came forward and said   We'll buy most of the nets  and then we'll give them away  as part of the global fund's and the U.N.'s commitment to pregnant women and children  for free.  Acumen came in with the patient capital  and we also helped to identify the entrepreneur that we would all partner with here in Africa  and Exxon provided the initial resin. Well  in looking around for entrepreneurs  there was none better that we could find on earth than Anuj Shah  in A to Z manufacturing company. It's a    year old company  it understands manufacturing. It's gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania  and continued to flourish. It had about       employees when we first found it. And so  Anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in Africa to produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment to work with malaria. And  long story short  again  they've been so successful. In our first year  the first net went off the line in October of     . We thought the hitting it out of the box number was         nets a year. This year  they are now producing eight million nets a year  and they employ       people     percent of whom are women  mostly unskilled. They're in a joint venture with Sumitomo. And so  from an enterprise perspective for Africa  and from a public health perspective  these are real successes. But it's only half the story if we're really looking at solving problems of poverty  because it's not long term sustainable. It's a company with one big customer. And if avian flu hits  or for any other reason the world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority  everybody loses. And so  Anuj and Acumen have been talking about testing the private sector  because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that  look  in a country like Tanzania     percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day. It costs  at manufacturing point  six dollars to produce these  and it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it  so the market price in a free market would be about    dollars per net. Most people can't afford that  so let's give it away free. And we said   Well  there's another option. Let's use the market as the best listening device we have  and understand at what price people would pay for this  so they get the dignity of choice. We can start building local distribution  and actually  it can cost the public sector much less.  And so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z  a loan as well as a grant  so that A to Z could play with pricing and listen to the marketplace  and found a number of things. One  that people will pay different prices  but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net and make a decision to buy it. And when you listen to them  they'll also have a lot to say about what they like and what they don't like. And that some of the channels we thought would work didn't work. But because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed because of the patient capital  we've now found that it costs about a dollar in the private sector to distribute  and a dollar to buy the net. So then  from a policy perspective  when you start with the market  we have a choice. We can continue going along at    dollars a net  and the customer pays zero  or we could at least experiment with some of it  to charge one dollar a net  costing the public sector another six dollars a net  give the people the dignity of choice  and have a distribution system that might  over time  start sustaining itself. We've got to start having conversations like this  and I don't think there's any better way to start than using the market  but also to bring other people to the table around it. Whenever I go to visit A to Z  I think of my grandmother  Stella. She was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines. She grew up on a farm in Austria  very poor  didn't have very much education. She moved to the United States  where she met my grandfather  who was a cement hauler  and they had nine children. Three of them died as babies. My grandmother had tuberculosis  and she worked in a sewing machine shop  making shirts for about    cents an hour. She  like so many of the women I see at A to Z  worked hard every day  understood what suffering was  had a deep faith in God  loved her children and would never have accepted a handout. But because she had the opportunity of the marketplace  and she lived in a society that provided the safety of having access to affordable health and education  her children and their children were able to live lives of real purpose and follow real dreams. I look around at my siblings and my cousins    and as I said  there are a lot of us    and I see teachers and musicians  hedge fund managers  designers. One sister who makes other people's wishes come true. And my wish  when I see those women  I meet those farmers  and I think about all the people across this continent who are working hard every day  is that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility  and that they also can believe and get access to services  so that their children  too  can live those lives of great purpose. It shouldn't be that difficult. But what it takes is a commitment from all of us to essentially refuse trite assumptions  get out of our ideological boxes. It takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed to service as well as to success. It takes opening your arms  both  wide  and expecting very little love in return  but demanding accountability  and bringing the accountability to the table as well. And most of all  most of all  it requires that all of us have the courage and the patience  whether we are rich or poor  African or non African  local or diaspora  left or right  to really start listening to each other. Thank you. I d like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa    those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid. And  of course  I m dedicating it also to my grandmother  whom I think really played quite a lot of important roles  especially for me when I was an activist  and being harassed by the police. You will recall that in       June     the students of South Africa boycotted the language of Afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor  as they were sort of like really told that they must do everything in Afrikaans    biology  mathematics    and what about our languages  And the students wanted to speak to the government  and police answered with bullets. So every year  June     we will commemorate all those comrades or students who died. And I was very young then. I think I was    years  and I started asking questions  and that s when my political education started. And I joined  later on  the youth organization under the African National Congress. So as part of organizing this and whatever  this commemoration  the police will round us up as they call us leaders. And I used to run away from home  when I know that maybe the police might be coming around the ninth or   th of June or so. And my grandmother one time said   No  look  you re not going to run away. This is your place  you stay here.  And indeed  the police came    because they ll just arrest us and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like  after the   th or so. So it was on the   th of June  and they came  and they surrounded the house  and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house  and opened the kitchen door. And she said to them   Vusi's here  and you're not going to take him tonight. I'm tired of you having to come here  harassing us  while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes. He is here  and you're not going to take him. I've got a bowl full of boiling water    the first one who comes in here  gets it.  And they left.   Thula Mama  Thula Mama  Thula Mama  Thula Mama.     Through the mist of the tears in your eyes on my childhood memory      I know the truth in your smile      I know the truth in your smile      piercing through the gloom of my ignorance.     Oh  there is a mama lying down sleeping     you're very ill and your heart crying.     Wondering  wondering  wondering  wondering where is this world coming to.     Is it right the children have to fend for themselves  No  no  no  no  no. no.     Is it right heaping trouble on an old lady's head      So unlucky faceless people.     Thula Mama Mama  Thula Mama. Thula Mama Mama.     Thula Mama  Thula Mama  Thula Mama Mama  Thula Mama     Tomorrow it s going to be better.     Tomorrow it's going to be better to climb  Mama.     Thula Mama  Thula Mama.     Am I to break into the song like the blues man or troubadour.     And then from long distance in no blues club am I to sing      baby  baby  baby  baby  baby  baby  baby  baby  baby  baby  baby  baby.     Should I now stop singing of love      now that my memory s surrounded by blood      Sister  why oh why do we at times mistake a pimple for a cancer      So who are they who says  no more love poems now      I want to sing a song of love     for that woman who jumped the fences pregnant     and still gave birth to a healthy child.     Softly I walk into the sun rays of the smile     that will ignite my love song  my song of life      my song of love  my song of life  my song of love      my song of life  my song of love  my song of life.     Ooh  I ve not tried to run away from song      I hear a persistent voice  more powerful than the enemy bombs.     The song that washed our lives and the rains of our blood.     My song of love and my song of life  my song of love      my song of life  my song of love      my song of life  my song of love    I want everybody to sing with me        my song of life  my song of love  my song of life    everybody sing with me        my song of life  my song of love    I can t hear you        my song of love  my song of life    you can do better        my song of life  my song of love    keep singing  keep singing        my song of love  my song of life  yes  my song of love        you can do better than that        my song of life  yes  my song of love  my song of life  my song of love        keep singing  keep singing  keep singing    my song of love.     Oh yeah. My song of    a love song  my song of life. Sing. A love song  my song of life. Sing.     Love song  my song of life. Sing. Love song  my song of life. Sing.     Love song  my song of life. Sing. Love song  my song of life.     Love song  my song of life.   I've actually been waiting by the phone for a call from TED for years. And in fact  in       I was ready to talk about eBay  but no call. In       I was ready to do a talk about the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship. No call. In       I started Participant Productions and we had a really good first year  and no call. And finally  I get a call last year  and then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams. You've got a cruel sense of humor  TED. When I first moved to Hollywood from Silicon Valley  I had some misgivings. But I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood. And  in fact  some advantages to owning your own media company. And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley have a lot more in common than I would have dreamed. Hollywood has its sex symbols  and the Valley has its sex symbols. Hollywood has its rivalries  and the Valley has its rivalries. Hollywood gathers around power tables  and the Valley gathers around power tables. So it turned out there was a lot more in common than I would have dreamed. But I'm actually here today to tell a story. And part of it is a personal story. When Chris invited me to speak  he said  people think of you as a bit of an enigma  and they want to know what drives you a bit. And what really drives me is a vision of the future that I think we all share. It's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability. And when we heard a lot of the presentations over the last couple of days  Ed Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey  I think we all realized how far we have to go to get to this new version of humanity that I like to call  Humanity  . .  And it's also something that resides in each of us  to close what I think are the two big calamities in the world today. One is the gap in opportunity    this gap that President Clinton last night called uneven  unfair and unsustainable    and  out of that  comes poverty and illiteracy and disease and all these evils that we see around us. But perhaps the other  bigger gap is what we call the hope gap. And someone  at some point  came up with this very bad idea that an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world. And I think that's just a horrible thing. And so chapter one really begins today  with all of us  because within each of us is the power to equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps. And if the men and women of TED can't make a difference in the world  I don't know who can. And for me  a lot of this started when I was younger and my family used to go camping in upstate New York. And there really wasn't much to do there for the summer  except get beaten up by my sister or read books. And so I used to read authors like James Michener and James Clavell and Ayn Rand. And their stories made the world seem a very small and interconnected place. And it struck me that if I could write stories that were about this world as being small and interconnected  that maybe I could get people interested in the issues that affected us all  and maybe engage them to make a difference. I didn't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living  so I decided to go on a path to become financially independent  so I could write these stories as quickly as I could. I then had a bit of a wake up call when I was   . And my dad came home one day and announced that he had cancer  and it looked pretty bad. And what he said was  he wasn't so much afraid that he might die  but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life. And knock on wood  he's still alive today  many years later. But for a young man that made a real impression on me  that one never knows how much time one really has. So I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering. I started a couple of businesses that I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom. One of those businesses was a computer rental business called Micros on the Move  which is very well named  because people kept stealing the computers. So I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business  so I went to Stanford Business School and studied there. And while I was there  I made friends with a fellow named Pierre Omidyar  who is here today. And Pierre  I apologize for this. This is a photo from the old days. And just after I'd graduated  Pierre came to me with this idea to help people buy and sell things online with each other. And with the wisdom of my Stanford degree  I said   Pierre  what a stupid idea.  And needless to say  I was right. But right after that  Pierre    in '    Pierre and I left our full time jobs to build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story  you know. The company went public two years later and is today one of the best known companies in the world. Hundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries  and so on. But for me  personally  it was a real change. I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto and living off their leftovers  to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources. And I wanted to figure out how I could take the blessing of these resources and share it with the world. And around that time  I met John Gardner  who is a remarkable man. He was the architect of the Great Society programs under Lyndon Johnson in the     s. And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do  or anyone could do  to make a difference in the long term issues facing humanity. And John said   Bet on good people doing good things. Bet on good people doing good things.  And that really resonated with me. I started a foundation to bet on these good people doing good things. These leading  innovative  nonprofit folks  who are using business skills in a very leveraged way to solve social problems. People today we call social entrepreneurs. And to put a face on it  people like Muhammad Yunus  who started the Grameen Bank  has lifted     million people plus out of poverty around the world  won the Nobel Peace Prize. But there's also a lot of people that you don't know. Folks like Ann Cotton  who started a group called CAMFED in Africa  because she felt girls' education was lagging. And she started it about    years ago  and today  she educates over a quarter million African girls. And somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale  who started the world's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company  and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis  also known as black fever. And by       she hopes to eliminate this disease  which is really a scourge in the developing world. And so this is one way to bet on good people doing good things. And a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change that I find really is powerful. It's what we call   Invest  connect and celebrate.  And invest  if you see good people doing good things  invest in them. Invest in their organizations  or in business. Invest in these folks. Connecting them together through conferences    like a TED    brings so many powerful connections  or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship that my foundation does at Oxford every year. And celebrate them  tell their stories  because not only are there good people doing good work  but their stories can help close these gaps of hope. And it was this last part of the mission  the celebrate part  that really got me back to thinking when I was a kid and wanted to tell stories to get people involved in the issues that affect us all. And a light bulb went off  which was  first  that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself  I could find writers. And then the next light bulb was  better than just writing  what about film and TV  to get out to people in a big way  And I thought about the films that inspired me  films like  Gandhi  and  Schindler's List.  And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today. And there really wasn't a specific company that was focused on the public interest. So  in       I started to make my way around Los Angeles to talk about the idea of a pro social media company and I was met with a lot of encouragement. One of the lines of encouragement that I heard over and over was   The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you  who think you're going to come to this town and make movies.  And then of course  there was the other adage.  The surest way to become a millionaire is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business.  Undeterred  in January of       I started Participant Productions with the vision to be a global media company focused on the public interest. And our mission is to produce entertainment that creates and inspires social change. And we don't just want people to see our movies and say  that was fun  and forget about it. We want them to actually get involved in the issues. In       we launched our first slate of films   Murder Ball    North Country    Syriana  and  Good Night and Good Luck.  And much to my surprise  they were noticed. We ended up with    Oscar nominations for these films. And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy. Perhaps more importantly  tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs and the activism programs that we created to go around the movies. And we had an online component of that  our community sect called Participate.net. But with our social sector partners  like the ACLU and PBS and the Sierra Club and the NRDC  once people saw the film  there was actually something they could do to make a difference. One of these films in particular  called  North Country   was actually kind of a box office disaster. But it was a film that starred Charlize Theron and it was about women's rights  women's empowerment  domestic violence and so on. And we released the film at the same time that the Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act. And with screenings on the Hill  and discussions  and with our social sector partners  like the National Organization of Women  the film was widely credited with influencing the successful renewal of the act. And that to me  spoke volumes  because it's    the film started about a true life story about a woman who was harassed  sued her employer  led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act  and the Violence Against Women Act and others. And then the movie about this person doing these things  then led to this greater renewal. And so again  it goes back to betting on good people doing good things. Speaking of which  our fellow TEDster  Al    I first saw Al do his slide show presentation on global warming in May of     . At that point  I thought I knew something about global warming. I thought it was a    to    year problem. And after we saw his slide show  it became clear that it was much more urgent. And so right afterwards  I met backstage with Al  and with Lawrence Bender  who was there  and Laurie David  and Davis Guggenheim  who was running documentaries for Participant at the time. And with Al's blessing  we decided on the spot to turn it into a film  because we felt that we could get the message out there far more quickly than having Al go around the world  speaking to audiences of     or     at a time. And you know  there's another adage in Hollywood  that nobody knows nothing about anything. And I really thought this was going to be a straight to PBS charitable initiative. And so it was a great shock to all of us when the film really captured the public interest  and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland  and most of Scandinavia. We've sent        DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S. and it's really changed the debate on global warming. It was also a pretty good year for this guy. We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming. And for Participant  this is just the start. Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world. And we have    films in production right now  and dozens others in development. I'll quickly talk about a few coming up. One is  Charlie Wilson's War   with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts. And it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson  and how he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan. And we're also doing a movie called  The Kite Runner   based on the book  The Kite Runner   also about Afghanistan. And we think once people see these films  they'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world and the Middle East in general. We premiered a film called  The Chicago     at Sundance this year. It's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in       Abby Hoffman and crew  and  again  a story about a small group of individuals who did make change in the world. And a documentary that we're doing on Jimmy Carter and his Mid East peace efforts over the years. And in particular  we've been following him on his recent book tour  which  as many of you know  has been very non controversial       which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie. In closing  I'd like to say that everybody has the opportunity to make change in their own way. And all the people in this room have done so through their business lives  or their philanthropic work  or their other interests. And one thing that I've learned is that there's never one right way to make change. One can do it as a tech person  or as a finance person  or a nonprofit person  or as an entertainment person  but every one of us is all of those things and more. And I believe if we do these things  we can close the opportunity gaps  we can close the hope gaps. And I can imagine  if we do this  the headlines in    years might read something like these   New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero    U.S. Imports its Last Barrel of Oil         Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate    Years of Peaceful Coexistence.  And I like this one   Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro.  And finally  an eBay listing for one well traveled slide show  now obsolete  museum piece. Please contact Al Gore. And I believe that  working together  we can make all of these things happen. And I want to thank you all for having me here today. It's been a real honor. Thank you. Oh  thank you. I got a visit almost exactly a year ago  a little over a year ago  from a very senior person at the Department of Defense. Came to see me and said         of the kids that we've sent out have come back missing at least one full arm. Whole arm. Shoulder disarticulation. And we're doing the same thing we did for    more or less  that we've done since the Civil War  a stick and a hook. And they deserve more than that.  And literally  this guy sat in my office in New Hampshire and said   I want you to give me something that we can put on these kids that'll pick up a raisin or a grape off a table  they'll be able to put it in their mouth without destroying either one  and they'll be able to know the difference without looking at it.  You know  had efferent  afferent  and haptic response. He finishes explaining that  and I'm waiting for the big     pound paper proposal  and he said   That's what I want from you.  I said   Look  you're nuts. That technology's just not available right now. And it can't be done. Not in an envelope of a human arm  with    degrees of freedom  from your shoulder to your fingertips.  He said   About two dozen of these       kids have come back bilateral. You think it's bad to lose one arm  That's an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone.  I got a day job  and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like  let's supply water to the world  and power to the world  and educate all the kids  which  Chris  I will not talk about. I don't need another mission. I keep thinking about these kids with no arms. He says to me   We've done some work around the country. We've got some pretty amazing neurology and other people.  I said   I'll take a field trip  I'll go see what you got.  Over the next month I visited lots of places  some out here  around the country  found the best of the best. I went down to Washington. I saw these guys  and said   I did what you asked me. I looked at what's out there. I still think you're nuts. But not as nuts as I thought.  I put a team together  a little over    months ago  got up to    some odd people. We said  we're going to build a device that does what he wants. We have    out of the    degrees of freedom  you don't need the ones in the last two fingers. We put this thing together. A couple of weeks ago we took it down to Walter Reed  which is unfortunately more in the news these days. We showed it to a bunch of guys. One guy who described himself as being lucky  because he lost his left arm  and he's a righty. He sat at a table with seven or eight of these other guys. Said he was lucky  because he had his good arm  and then he pushed himself back from the table. He had no legs. These kids have attitudes that you just can't believe. So I'm going to show you now  without the skin on it  a    second piece  and then I'm done. But understand what you're looking at we made small enough to fit on a   th percentile female  so that we could put it in any of these people. It's going to go inside something that we use in CAT scans and MRIs of whatever is their good arm  to make silicon rubber  then coat it  and paint it in  D    exact mirror image of their other limb. So  you won't see all the really cool stuff that's in this series elastic set of    actuators  each one which has its own capability to sense temperature and pressure. It also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on  so the more they put themselves under load  the more it attaches. They take the load off  and it becomes  again  compliant. I'm going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demonstrated in Washington. Can we look at this thing  Watch the fingers grab. The thumb comes up. Wrist. This weighs  .  pounds. Going to scratch his nose. It's got    active degrees of freedom. Now he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger. Now he's going to put that down  pick up a piece of paper  rotate all the degrees of freedom in his hand and wrist  and read it. Now  have any of y'all ever looked up this word  You know  in a dictionary   Laughter  Yeah  that's what I thought. How about this word  Here  I'll show it to you. Lexicography  the practice of compiling dictionaries. Notice    we're very specific    that word  compile.  The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite  out of a lump of rock. It's made up of lots of little bits. It's little discrete    that's spelled D I S C R E T E    bits. And those bits are words. Now one of the perks of being a lexicographer    besides getting to come to TED    is that you get to say really fun words  like lexicographical. Lexicographical has this great pattern  it's called a double dactyl. And just by saying double dactyl  I've sent the geek needle all the way into the red.  Laughter   Applause  But  lexicographical  is the same pattern as  higgledy piggledy.  Right  It's a fun word to say  and I get to say it a lot. Now  one of the non perks of being a lexicographer is that people don't usually have a kind of warm  fuzzy  snuggly image of the dictionary. Right  Nobody hugs their dictionaries. But what people really often think about the dictionary is  they think more like this. Just to let you know  I do not have a lexicographical whistle. But people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left hand turn into the dictionary  and keep the bad words out. But the thing is  I don't want to be a traffic cop. For one thing  I just do not do uniforms. And for another  deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy. And it's not very fun. And when parts of your job are not easy or fun  you kind of look for an excuse not to do them. So if I had to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work  I would much rather be a fisherman. I want to throw my big net into the deep  blue ocean of English and see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom. But why do people want me to direct traffic  when I would much rather go fishing  Well  I blame the Queen. Why do I blame the Queen  Well  first of all  I blame the Queen because it's funny. But secondly  I blame the Queen because dictionaries have really not changed. Our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign. The only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the F word  which has happened in American dictionaries since     . So  there's this guy  right  Victorian era. James Murray  first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary. I do not have that hat. I wish I had that hat. So he's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today. When a guy who looks like that  in that hat  is the face of modernity  you have a problem. And so  James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today. There'd be virtually no learning curve. And of course  a few of us are saying  okay  computers  Computers  What about computers  The thing about computers is  I love computers. I mean  I'm a huge geek  I love computers. I would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me. But computers don't do much else other than speed up the process of compiling dictionaries. They don't change the end result. Because what a dictionary is  is it's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion. It's steampunk. What we have is an electric velocipede. You know  we have Victorian design with an engine on it. That's all  The design has not changed. And OK  what about online dictionaries  right  Online dictionaries must be different. This is the Oxford English Dictionary Online  one of the best online dictionaries. This is my favorite word  by the way. Erinaceous  pertaining to the hedgehog family  of the nature of a hedgehog. Very useful word. So  look at that. Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen. This is flat. Look how many links there are in the actual entry  two  Right  Those little buttons  I had them all expanded except for the date chart. So there's not very much going on here. There's not a lot of clickiness. And in fact  online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print  except for searchability. And when you improve searchability  you actually take away the one advantage of print  which is serendipity. Serendipity is when you find things you weren't looking for  because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult. So     Laughter   Applause     now  when you think about this  what we have here is a ham butt problem. Does everyone know the ham butt problem  Woman's making a ham for a big  family dinner. She goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away  and she looks at this piece of ham and she's like   This is a perfectly good piece of ham. Why am I throwing this away   She thought   Well  my mom always did this.  So she calls up mom  and she says   Mom  why'd you cut the butt off the ham  when you're making a ham   She says   I don't know  my mom always did it   So they call grandma  and grandma says   My pan was too small    Laughter  So  it's not that we have good words and bad words. We have a pan that's too small  You know  that ham butt is delicious  There's no reason to throw it away. The bad words    see  when people think about a place and they don't find a place on the map  they think   This map sucks   When they find a nightspot or a bar  and it's not in the guidebook  they're like   Ooh  this place must be cool  It's not in the guidebook.  When they find a word that's not in the dictionary  they think   This must be a bad word.  Why  It's more likely to be a bad dictionary. Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan  So  you can't get a smaller ham. The English language is as big as it is. So  if you have a ham butt problem  and you're thinking about the ham butt problem  the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive  paper is the enemy of words. How can this be  I mean  I love books. I really love books. Some of my best friends are books. But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary. Now they're going to think  Oh  boy. People are going to take away my beautiful  paper dictionaries   No. There will still be paper dictionaries. When we had cars    when cars became the dominant mode of transportation  we didn't round up all the horses and shoot them. You know  there're still going to be paper dictionaries  but it's not going to be the dominant dictionary. The book shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in. And it's not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in. So  think about it this way  if you've got an artificial constraint  artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview. What if biologists could only study animals that made people go   Aww.  Right  What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals  and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study  We'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna  and not very much about much else. And I think this is a problem. I think we should study all the words  because when you think about words  you can make beautiful expressions from very humble parts. Lexicography is really more about material science. We are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression  your speeches and your writing. And then  often people say to me   Well  OK  how do I know that this word is real   They think   OK  if we think words are the tools that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts  how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers  How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball peen hammer   They're just the right tools for the job. And so people say to me   How do I know if a word is real   You know  anybody who's read a children's book knows that love makes things real. If you love a word  use it. That makes it real. Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction. It doesn't make a word any more real than any other way. If you love a word  it becomes real. So if we're not worrying about directing traffic  if we've transcended paper  if we are worrying less about control and more about description  then we can think of the English language as being this beautiful mobile. And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes  is touched  any time you touch a word  you use it in a new context  you give it a new connotation  you verb it  you make the mobile move. You didn't break it. It's just in a new position  and that new position can be just as beautiful. Now  if you're no longer a traffic cop    the problem with being a traffic cop is there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection  or the cars get confused. Right  But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic  but maybe to count the cars that go by  then more eyeballs are better. You can ask for help  If you ask for help  you get more done. And we really need help. Library of Congress     million books  of which half are in English. If only one out of every    of those books had a word that's not in the dictionary in it  that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries. And I find an un dictionaried word    a word like  un dictionaried   for example    in almost every book I read. What about newspapers  Newspaper archive goes back to         .  million newspaper pages. If only one in     of those pages had an un dictionaried word on it  it would be an entire other OED. That's         more words. So that's a lot. And I'm not even talking about magazines. I'm not talking about blogs    and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week than I do Newsweek or Time. There's a lot going on there. And I'm not even talking about polysemy  which is the greedy habit some words have of taking more than one meaning for themselves. So if you think of the word  set   a set can be a badger's burrow  a set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff  and there's one numbered definition in the OED. The OED has    different numbered definitions for set. Tiny  little word     numbered definitions. One of them is just labeled  miscellaneous technical senses.  Do you know what that says to me  That says to me  it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub.  Laughter  That's a lexicographical cop out  to say   miscellaneous technical senses.  So  we have all these words  and we really need help  And the thing is  we could ask for help    asking for help's not that hard. I mean  lexicography is not rocket science. See  I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers  and this is more of a visual explanation. If we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language  these bright spots are what we know about  and the dark spots are where we are in the dark. If that was the map of all the words in American English  we don't know very much. And we don't even know the shape of the language. If this was the dictionary    if this was the map of American English    look  we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida  but there's no California  We're missing California from American English. We just don't know enough  and we don't even know that we're missing California. We don't even see that there's a gap on the map. So again  lexicography is not rocket science. But even if it were  rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days. You know  It can't be that hard to find some words  So  enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help  and they're doing a good job of it. For instance  there's eBird  where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings. And then  ornithologists can go and help track populations  migrations  etc. And there's this guy  Mike Oates. Mike Oates lives in the U.K. He's a director of an electroplating company. He's found more than     comets. He's found so many comets  they named a comet after him. It's kind of out past Mars. It's a hike. I don't think he's getting his picture taken there anytime soon. But he found     comets without a telescope. He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite  and that's how he found them. If we can find comets without a telescope  shouldn't we be able to find words  Now  y'all know where I'm going with this. Because I'm going to the Internet  which is where everybody goes. And the Internet is great for collecting words  because the Internet's full of collectors. And this is a little known technological fact about the Internet  but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm. And words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography. Isn't that great  So there are a lot of really good word collecting sites out there right now  but the problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough. They show the word  but they don't show any context. Where did it come from  Who said it  What newspaper was it in  What book  Because a word is like an archaeological artifact. If you don't know the provenance or the source of the artifact  it's not science  it's a pretty thing to look at. So a word without its source is like a cut flower. You know  it's pretty to look at for a while  but then it dies. It dies too fast. So  this whole time I've been saying   The dictionary  the dictionary  the dictionary  the dictionary.  Not  a dictionary   or  dictionaries.  And that's because  well  people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language. They use it synecdochically. And one of the problems of knowing a word like  synecdochically  is that you really want an excuse to say  synecdochically.  This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where I could say  synecdochically  to all of you. So I'm really sorry. But when you use a part of something    like the dictionary is a part of the language  or a flag stands for the United States  it's a symbol of the country    then you're using it synecdochically. But the thing is  we could make the dictionary the whole language. If we get a bigger pan  then we can put all the words in. We can put in all the meanings. Doesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives  And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language    we can make it be the whole language. You see  what I'm really hoping for is that my son  who turns seven this month    I want him to barely remember that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in. This is what dictionaries used to look like. I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight track tape. It's a format that died because it wasn't useful enough. It wasn't really what people needed. And the thing is  if we can put in all the words  no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad  we can really describe the language like scientists. We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers. If we can do that  then I can spend all my time fishing  and I don't have to be a traffic cop anymore. Thank you very much for your kind attention.
