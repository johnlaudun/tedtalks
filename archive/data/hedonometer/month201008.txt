I grew up on a small farm in Missouri. We lived on less than a dollar a day for about    years. I got a scholarship  went to university  studied international agriculture  studied anthropology  and decided I was going to give back. I was going to work with small farmers. I was going to help alleviate poverty. I was going to work on international development  and then I took a turn and ended up here. Now  if you get a Ph.D.  and you decide not to teach  you don't always end up in a place like this. It's a choice. You might end up driving a taxicab. You could be in New York. What I found was  I started working with refugees and famine victims    small farmers  all  or nearly all    who had been dispossessed and displaced. Now  what I'd been trained to do was methodological research on such people. So I did it  I found out how many women had been raped en route to these camps. I found out how many people had been put in jail  how many family members had been killed. I assessed how long they were going to stay and how much it would take to feed them. And I got really good at predicting how many body bags you would need for the people who were going to die in these camps. Now this is God's work  but it's not my work. It's not the work I set out to do. So I was at a Grateful Dead benefit concert on the rainforests in     . I met a guy    the guy on the left. His name was Ben. He said   What can I do to save the rainforests   I said   Well  Ben  what do you do    I make ice cream.  So I said   Well  you've got to make a rainforest ice cream. And you've got to use nuts from the rainforests to show that forests are worth more as forests than they are as pasture.  He said   Okay.  Within a year  Rainforest Crunch was on the shelves. It was a great success. We did our first million dollars worth of trade by buying on    days and selling on   . That gets your adrenaline going. Then we had a four and a half million dollar line of credit because we were credit worthy at that point. We had    to     maybe    percent of the global Brazil nut market. We paid two to three times more than anybody else. Everybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of Brazil nuts because we would buy it otherwise. A great success.    companies signed up      products came out  generated     million in sales. It failed. Why did it fail  Because the people who were gathering Brazil nuts weren't the same people who were cutting the forests. And the people who made money from Brazil nuts were not the people who made money from cutting the forests. We were attacking the wrong driver. We needed to be working on beef. We needed to be working on lumber. We needed to be working on soy    things that we were not focused on. So let's go back to Sudan. I often talk to refugees   Why was it that the West didn't realize that famines are caused by policies and politics  not by weather   And this farmer said to me  one day  something that was very profound. He said   You can't wake a person who's pretending to sleep.  Okay. Fast forward. We live on a planet. There's just one of them. We've got to wake up to the fact that we don't have any more and that this is a finite planet. We know the limits of the resources we have. We may be able to use them differently. We may have some innovative  new ideas. But in general  this is what we've got. There's no more of it. There's a basic equation that we can't get away from. Population times consumption has got to have some kind of relationship to the planet  and right now  it's a simple  not equal.  Our work shows that we're living at about  .  planets. Since       we crossed the line of being in a sustainable relationship to the planet. Now we're at  . . If we were farmers  we'd be eating our seed. For bankers  we'd be living off the principal  not the interest. This is where we stand today. A lot of people like to point to some place else as the cause of the problem. It's always population growth. Population growth's important  but it's also about how much each person consumes. So when the average American consumes    times as much as the average African  we've got to think that consumption is an issue. It's not just about population  and it's not just about them  it's about us. But it's not just about people  it's about lifestyles. There's very good evidence    again  we don't necessarily have a peer reviewed methodology that's bulletproof yet    but there's very good evidence that the average cat in Europe has a larger environmental footprint in its lifetime than the average African. You think that's not an issue going forward  You think that's not a question as to how we should be using the Earth's resources  Let's go back and visit our equation. In       we had six billion people on the planet. They were consuming what they were consuming    let's say one unit of consumption each. We have six billion units of consumption. By       we're going to have nine billion people    all the scientists agree. They're all going to consume twice as much as they currently do    scientists  again  agree    because income is going to grow in developing countries five times what it is today    on global average  about   .  . So we're going to have    billion units of consumption. Who have you heard talking lately that's said we have to triple production of goods and services  But that's what the math says. We're not going to be able to do that. We can get productivity up. We can get efficiency up. But we've also got to get consumption down. We need to use less to make more. And then we need to use less again. And then we need to consume less. All of those things are part of that equation. But it basically raises a fundamental question  should consumers have a choice about sustainability  about sustainable products  Should you be able to buy a product that's sustainable sitting next to one that isn't  or should all the products on the shelf be sustainable  If they should all be sustainable on a finite planet  how do you make that happen  The average consumer takes  .  seconds in the U.S. Okay  so let's be generous. Let's say it's  .  seconds in Europe. How do you evaluate all the scientific data around a product  the data that's changing on a weekly  if not a daily  basis  How do you get informed  You don't. Here's a little question. From a greenhouse gas perspective  is lamb produced in the U.K. better than lamb produced in New Zealand  frozen and shipped to the U.K.  Is a bad feeder lot operation for beef better or worse than a bad grazing operation for beef  Do organic potatoes actually have fewer toxic chemicals used to produce them than conventional potatoes  In every single case  the answer is  it depends.  It depends on who produced it and how  in every single instance. And there are many others. How is a consumer going to walk through this minefield  They're not. They may have a lot of opinions about it  but they're not going to be terribly informed. Sustainability has got to be a pre competitive issue. It's got to be something we all care about. And we need collusion. We need groups to work together that never have. We need Cargill to work with Bunge. We need Coke to work with Pepsi. We need Oxford to work with Cambridge. We need Greenpeace to work with WWF. Everybody's got to work together    China and the U.S. We need to begin to manage this planet as if our life depended on it  because it does  it fundamentally does. But we can't do everything. Even if we get everybody working on it  we've got to be strategic. We need to focus on the where  the what and the who. So  the where  We've identified    places globally that we need to work. These are the places that are the richest in biodiversity and the most important from an ecosystem function point of view. We have to work in these places. We have to save these places if we want a chance in hell of preserving biodiversity as we know it. We looked at the threats to these places. These are the    commodities that fundamentally pose the biggest threats to these places because of deforestation  soil loss  water use  pesticide use  over fishing  etc. So we've got    places  we've got    priority commodities  who do we work with to change the way those commodities are produced  Are we going to work with  .  billion consumers  Let's see  that's about       languages      major languages    a lot of work there. I don't see anybody actually being able to do that very effectively. Are we going to work with  .  billion producers  Again  a daunting task. There must be a better way.     to     companies control    percent or more of the trade of each of the    commodities that we've identified as the most significant. If we work with those  if we change those companies and the way they do business  then the rest will happen automatically. So  we went through our    commodities. This is nine of them. We lined them up side by side  and we put the names of the companies that work on each of those. And if you go through the first    or    names of each of the commodities  what you begin to see is  gosh  there's Cargill here  there's Cargill there  there's Cargill everywhere. In fact  these names start coming up over and over again. So we did the analysis again a slightly different way. We said  if we take the top hundred companies  what percentage of all    commodities do they touch  buy or sell  And what we found is it's    percent. So     companies control    percent of the trade of all    of the most significant commodities on the planet. We can get our arms around a hundred companies. A hundred companies  we can work with. Why is    percent important  Because if these companies demand sustainable products  they'll pull    to    percent of production. Companies can push producers faster than consumers can. By companies asking for this  we can leverage production so much faster than by waiting for consumers to do it. After    years  the global organic movement has achieved  .  of one percent of global food. We can't wait that long. We don't have that kind of time. We need change that's going to accelerate. Even working with individual companies is not probably going to get us there. We need to begin to work with industries. So we've started roundtables where we bring together the entire value chain  from producers all the way to the retailers and brands. We bring in civil society  we bring in NGOs  we bring in researchers and scientists to have an informed discussion    sometimes a battle royale    to figure out what are the key impacts of these products  what is a global benchmark  what's an acceptable impact  and design standards around that. It's not all fun and games. In salmon aquaculture  we kicked off a roundtable almost six years ago. Eight entities came to the table. We eventually got  I think     percent of global production at the table and    percent of demand at the table. Three of the original eight entities were suing each other. And yet  next week  we launch globally verified  vetted and certified standards for salmon aquaculture. It can happen. So what brings the different entities to the table  It's risk and demand. For the big companies  it's reputational risk  but more importantly  they don't care what the price of commodities is. If they don't have commodities  they don't have a business. They care about availability  so the big risk for them is not having product at all. For the producers  if a buyer wants to buy something produced a certain way  that's what brings them to the table. So it's the demand that brings them to the table. The good news is we identified a hundred companies two years ago. In the last    months  we've signed agreements with    of those hundred companies to begin to work with them on their supply chain. And in the next    months  we will have signed up to work with another     and we think we'll get those signed as well. Now what we're doing is bringing the CEOs of these    companies together to help twist the arms of the final     to bring them to the table  because they don't like NGOs  they've never worked with NGOs  they're concerned about this  they're concerned about that  but we all need to be in this together. So we're pulling out all the stops. We're using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table. One company we're working with that's begun    in baby steps  perhaps    but has begun this journey on sustainability is Cargill. They've funded research that shows that we can double global palm oil production without cutting a single tree in the next    years  and do it all in Borneo alone by planting on land that's already degraded. The study shows that the highest net present value for palm oil is on land that's been degraded. They're also undertaking a study to look at all of their supplies of palm oil to see if they could be certified and what they would need to change in order to become third party certified under a credible certification program. Why is Cargill important  Because Cargill has    to    percent of global palm oil. If Cargill makes a decision  the entire palm oil industry moves  or at least    or    percent of it. That's not insignificant. More importantly  Cargill and one other company ship    percent of the palm oil that goes to China. We don't have to change the way a single Chinese company works if we get Cargill to only send sustainable palm oil to China. It's a pre competitive issue. All the palm oil going there is good. Buy it. Mars is also on a similar journey. Now most people understand that Mars is a chocolate company  but Mars has made sustainability pledges to buy only certified product for all of its seafood. It turns out Mars buys more seafood than Walmart because of pet food. But they're doing some really interesting things around chocolate  and it all comes from the fact that Mars wants to be in business in the future. And what they see is that they need to improve chocolate production. On any given plantation     percent of the trees produce    percent of the crop  so Mars is looking at the genome  they're sequencing the genome of the cocoa plant. They're doing it with IBM and the USDA  and they're putting it in the public domain because they want everybody to have access to this data  because they want everybody to help them make cocoa more productive and more sustainable. What they've realized is that if they can identify the traits on productivity and drought tolerance  they can produce     percent as much cocoa on    percent of the land. The rest of the land can be used for something else. It's more with less and less again. That's what the future has got to be  and putting it in the public domain is smart. They don't want to be an I.P. company  they want to be a chocolate company  but they want to be a chocolate company forever. Now  the price of food  many people complain about  but in fact  the price of food is going down  and that's odd because in fact  consumers are not paying for the true cost of food. If you take a look just at water  what we see is that  with four very common products  you look at how much a farmer produced to make those products  and then you look at how much water input was put into them  and then you look at what the farmer was paid. If you divide the amount of water into what the farmer was paid  the farmer didn't receive enough money to pay a decent price for water in any of those commodities. That is an externality by definition. This is the subsidy from nature. Coca Cola  they've worked a lot on water  but right now  they're entering into    year contracts with growers in Turkey to sell juice into Europe  and they're doing that because they want to have a product that's closer to the European market. But they're not just buying the juice  they're also buying the carbon in the trees to offset the shipment costs associated with carbon to get the product into Europe. There's carbon that's being bought with sugar  with coffee  with beef. This is called bundling. It's bringing those externalities back into the price of the commodity. We need to take what we've learned in private  voluntary standards of what the best producers in the world are doing and use that to inform government regulation  so we can shift the entire performance curve. We can't just focus on identifying the best  we've got to move the rest. The issue isn't what to think  it's how to think. These companies have begun to think differently. They're on a journey  there's no turning back. We're all on that same journey with them. We have to really begin to change the way we think about everything. Whatever was sustainable on a planet of six billion is not going to be sustainable on a planet with nine. Thank you. The global challenge that I want to talk to you about today rarely makes the front pages. It  however  is enormous in both scale and importance. Look  you all are very well traveled  this is TEDGlobal after all. But I do hope to take you to some places you've never been to before. So  let's start off in China. This photo was taken two weeks ago. Actually  one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders has just graduated from high school. But this is Tiananmen Square. Many of you have been there. It's not the real China. Let me take you to the real China. This is in the Dabian Mountains in the remote part of Hubei province in central China. Dai Manju is    years old at the time the story starts. She lives with her parents  her two brothers and her great aunt. They have a hut that has no electricity  no running water  no wristwatch  no bicycle. And they share this great splendor with a very large pig. Dai Manju was in sixth grade when her parents said   We're going to pull you out of school because the    dollar school fees are too much for us. You're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies. Why would we waste this money on you   This is what happens to girls in remote areas. Turns out that Dai Manju was the best pupil in her grade. She still made the two hour trek to the schoolhouse and tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors. We wrote about her in The New York Times. We got a flood of donations    mostly    dollar checks because New York Times readers are very generous in tiny amounts but then  we got a money transfer for            really nice guy. We turned the money over to that man there  the principal of the school. He was delighted. He thought   Oh  I can renovate the school. I can give scholarships to all the girls  you know  if they work hard and stay in school. So Dai Manju basically finished out middle school. She went to high school. She went to vocational school for accounting. She scouted for jobs down in Guangdong province in the south. She found a job  she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends. She sent money back to her family. They built a new house  this time with running water  electricity  a bicycle  no pig. What we saw was a natural experiment. It is rare to get an exogenous investment in girls' education. And over the years  as we followed Dai Manju  we were able to see that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle. She not only changed her own dynamic  she changed her household  she changed her family  her village. The village became a real standout. Of course  most of China was flourishing at the time  but they were able to get a road built to link them up to the rest of China. And that brings me to my first major of two tenets of  Half the Sky.  And that is that the central moral challenge of this century is gender inequity. In the   th century  it was slavery. In the   th century  it was totalitarianism. The cause of our time is the brutality that so many people face around the world because of their gender. So some of you may be thinking   Gosh  that's hyperbole. She's exaggerating.  Well  let me ask you this question. How many of you think there are more males or more females in the world  Let me take a poll. How many of you think there are more males in the world  Hands up  please. How many of you think    a few    how many of you there are more females in the world  Okay  most of you. Well  you know this latter group  you're wrong. There are  true enough  in Europe and the West  when women and men have equal access to food and health care  there are more women  we live longer. But in most of the rest of the world  that's not the case. In fact  demographers have shown that there are anywhere between    million and     million missing females in the current population. And  you know  it happens for several reasons. For instance  in the last half century  more girls were discriminated to death than all the people killed on all the battlefields in the   th century. Sometimes it's also because of the sonogram. Girls get aborted before they're even born when there are scarce resources. This girl here  for instance  is in a feeding center in Ethiopia. The entire center was filled with girls like her. What's remarkable is that her brothers  in the same family  were totally fine. In India  in the first year of life  from zero to one  boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast  and the breast shows no son preference. From one to five  girls die at a    percent higher mortality rate than boys  in all of India. The second tenet of  Half the Sky  is that  let's put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all  and just on a purely practical level  we think that one of the best ways to fight poverty and to fight terrorism is to educate girls and to bring women into the formal labor force. Poverty  for instance. There are three reasons why this is the case. For one  overpopulation is one of the persistent causes of poverty. And you know  when you educate a boy  his family tends to have fewer kids  but only slightly. When you educate a girl  she tends to have significantly fewer kids. The second reason is it has to do with spending. It's kind of like the dirty  little secret of poverty  which is that  not only do poor people take in very little income  but also  the income that they take in  they don't spend it very wisely  and unfortunately  most of that spending is done by men. So research has shown  if you look at people who live under two dollars a day    one metric of poverty    two percent of that take home pay goes to this basket here  in education.    percent goes to a basket that is a combination of alcohol  tobacco  sugary drinks    and prostitution and festivals. If you just take four percentage points and put it into this basket  you would have a transformative effect. The last reason has to do with women being part of the solution  not the problem. You need to use scarce resources. It's a waste of resources if you don't use someone like Dai Manju. Bill Gates put it very well when he was traveling through Saudi Arabia. He was speaking to an audience much like yourselves. However  two thirds of the way there was a barrier. On this side was men  and then the barrier  and this side was women. And someone from this side of the room got up and said   Mr. Gates  we have here as our goal in Saudi Arabia to be one of the top    countries when it comes to technology. Do you think we'll make it   So Bill Gates  as he was staring out at the audience  he said   If you're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country  there is no way you will get anywhere near the top   .  So here is Bill of Arabia. So what would some of the specific challenges look like  I would say  on the top of the agenda is sex trafficking. And I'll just say two things about this. The slavery at the peak of the slave trade in the     s  there were about        slaves transported from Africa to the New World. Now  modern slavery  according to State Department rough statistics  there are about               times the number    that are trafficked across international borders. And that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders  which is a substantial portion. And if you look at another factor  another contrast  a slave back then is worth about         in today's money. Today  you can buy a girl trafficked for a few hundred dollars  which means she's actually more disposable. But you know  there is progress being made in places like Cambodia and Thailand. We don't have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold or killed. The second item on the agenda is maternal mortality. You know  childbirth in this part of the world is a wonderful event. In Niger  one in seven women can expect to die during childbirth. Around the world  one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth. You know  it's not as though we don't have the technological solution  but these women have three strikes against them  they are poor  they are rural and they are female. You know  for every woman who does die  there are    who survive but end up with an injury. And the most devastating injury is obstetric fistula. It's a tearing during obstructed labor that leaves a woman incontinent. Let me tell you about Mahabuba. She lives in Ethiopia. She was married against her will at age   . She got pregnant  ran to the bush to have the baby  but you know  her body was very immature  and she ended up having obstructed labor. The baby died  and she ended up with a fistula. So that meant she was incontinent  she couldn't control her wastes. In a word  she stank. The villagers thought she was cursed  they didn't know what to do with her. So finally  they put her at the edge of the village in a hut. They ripped off the door so that the hyenas would get her at night. That night  there was a stick in the hut. She fought off the hyenas with that stick. And the next morning  she knew if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary  she would be saved. Because she had some damage to her nerves  she crawled all the way       miles    to that doorstep  half dead. The foreign missionary opened the door  knew exactly what had happened  took her to a nearby fistula hospital in Addis Ababa  and she was repaired with a     dollar operation. The doctors and nurses there noticed that she was not only a survivor  she was really clever  and they made her a nurse. So now  Mahabuba  she is saving the lives of hundreds  thousands  of women. She has become part of the solution  not the problem. She's moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle. I've talked about some of the challenges  let me talk about some of the solutions  and there are predictable solutions. I've hinted at them  education and also economic opportunity. So of course  when you educate a girl  she tends to get married later on in life  she tends to have kids later on in life  she tends to have fewer kids  and those kids that she does have  she educates them in a more enlightened fashion. With economic opportunity  it can be transformative. Let me tell you about Saima. She lives in a small village outside Lahore  Pakistan. And at the time  she was miserable. She was beaten every single day by her husband  who was unemployed. He was kind of a gambler type    and unemployable  therefore    and took his frustrations out on her. Well  when she had her second daughter  her mother in law told her son   I think you'd better get a second wife. Saima's not going to produce you a son.  This is when she had her second daughter. At the time  there was a microlending group in the village that gave her a    dollar loan. Saima took that money  and she started an embroidery business. The merchants liked her embroidery  it sold very well  and they kept asking for more. And when she couldn't produce enough  she hired other women in the village. Pretty soon she had    women in the village working for her embroidery business. And then  when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace  she needed someone to help her do the transport  so she hired her husband. So now they're in it together. He does the transportation and distribution  and she does the production and sourcing. And now they have a third daughter  and the daughters  all of them  are being tutored in education because Saima knows what's really important. Which brings me to the final element  which is education. Larry Summers  when he was chief economist at the World Bank  once said that   It may well be that the highest return on investment in the developing world is in girls' education.  Let me tell you about Beatrice Biira. Beatrice was living in Uganda near the Congo border  and like Dai Manju  she didn't go to school. Actually  she had never been to school  not to a lick  one day. Her parents  again  said   Why should we spend the money on her  She's going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth.  Well  it just so happens  at that time  there was a group in Connecticut called the Niantic Community Church Group in Connecticut. They made a donation to an organization based in Arkansas called Heifer International. Heifer sent two goats to Africa. One of them ended up with Beatrice's parents  and that goat had twins. The twins started producing milk. They sold the milk for cash. The cash started accumulating  and pretty soon the parents said   You know  we've got enough money. Let's send Beatrice to school.  So at nine years of age  Beatrice started in first grade    after all  she'd never been to a lick of school    with a six year old. No matter  she was just delighted to be in school. She rocketed to the top of her class. She stayed at the top of her class through elementary school  middle school  and then in high school  she scored brilliantly on the national examinations so that she became the first person in her village  ever  to come to the United States on scholarship. Two years ago  she graduated from Connecticut College. On the day of her graduation  she said   I am the luckiest girl alive because of a goat.  And that goat was     . So you see how transformative little bits of help can be. But I want to give you a reality check. Look  U.S. aid  helping people is not easy  and there have been books that have criticized U.S. aid. There's Bill Easterly's book. There's a book called  Dead Aid.  You know  the criticism is fair  it isn't easy. You know  people say how half of all water well projects  a year later  are failed. When I was in Zimbabwe  we were touring a place with the village chief    he wanted to raise money for a secondary school    and there was some construction a few yards away  and I said   What's that   He sort of mumbled. Turns out that it's a failed irrigation project. A few yards away was a failed chicken coop. One year  all the chickens died  and no one wanted to put the chickens in there. It's true  but we think that you don't through the baby out with the bathwater  you actually improve. You learn from your mistakes  and you continuously improve. We also think that individuals can make a difference  and they should  because individuals  together  we can all help create a movement. And a movement of men and women is what's needed to bring about social change  change that will address this great moral challenge. So then  I ask  what's in it for you  You're probably asking that. Why should you care  I will just leave you with two things. One is that research shows that once you have all of your material needs taken care of    which most of us  all of us  here in this room do    research shows that there are very few things in life that can actually elevate your level of happiness. One of those things is contributing to a cause larger than yourself. And the second thing  it's an anecdote that I'll leave you with. And that is the story of an aid worker in Darfur. Here was a woman who had worked in Darfur  seeing things that no human being should see. Throughout her time there  she was strong  she was steadfast. She never broke down. And then she came back to the United States and was on break  Christmas break. She was in her grandmother's backyard  and she saw something that made her break down in tears. What that was was a bird feeder. And she realized that she had the great fortune to be born in a country where we take security for granted  where we not only can feed  clothe and house ourselves  but also provide for wild birds so they don't go hungry in the winter. And she realized that with that great fortune comes great responsibility. And so  like her  you  me  we have all won the lottery of life. And so the question becomes  how do we discharge that responsibility  So  here's the cause. Join the movement. Feel happier and help save the world. Thank you very much. When I saw a piece of technology called Kinect    it was called Natal    I was inspired  and I thought for a moment  maybe it's possible to address that one problem of storytelling  to create a character which seemed alive  which noticed me  that could look me in the eyes and feel real  and sculpt a story about our relationship. And so a year ago  I showed this off at a computer show called E . And this was a piece of technology with someone called Claire interacting with this boy. And there was a huge row online about   Hey  this can't be real.  And so I waited till now to have an actual demo of the real tech. Now  this tech incorporates three big elements. The first is a Kinect camera  which will be out in November  some incredible AI that was hidden in the dusty vaults  collecting dust in Microsoft  plus our quite crude attempts at AI at a company called Lionhead  mixing all those things together just to get to this one simple idea  to create a real  living being in a computer. Now  I'll be honest with you and say that most of it is just a trick  but it's a trick that actually works. So why don't we go over and have a look at the demo now. This is Dimitri. Dimitri  just waggle your arm around. Now  you notice he's sitting. There are no controllers  no keyboards  or mice  or joysticks  or joypads. He is just going to use his hand  his body and his voice  just like humans interact with their hands  body and voice. So let's move forward. You're going to meet Milo for the first time. We had to give him a problem because when we first created Milo  we realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat  to be honest with you. He was quite a know it all  and he wanted to kind of make you laugh. So the problem we introduced to him was this  he's just moved house. He's moved from London to New England  over in America. His parents are too busy to listen to his problems  and that's when he starts almost conjuring you up. So here he is walking through the grass. And you're able to interact with his world. The cool thing is  what we're doing is we're changing the mind of Milo constantly. That means no two people's Milos can be the same. You're actually sculpting a human being here. So  he's discovering the garden. You're helping him discover the garden by just pointing out these snails. Very simple at the start. By the way  if you are a boy  it's snails  if you're a girl  it's butterflies because what we found was that girls hate snails. So remember  this is the first time you've met him  and we really want to draw you in and make you more curious. His face  by the way  is fully AI driven. We have complete control over his blush responses  the diameter of his nostrils to denote stress. We actually do something called body matching. If you're leaning forward  he will try and slightly change the neuro linguistic nature of his face  because we went out with this strong idea  how can we make you believe that something's real  Now we've used the hand. The other thing to use is your body. Why not just  instead of pushing left and right with a mouse or with a joypad  why not use your body just to lean on the chair    again  relaxed  You can lean back  but the camera will change its perspective depending on which way you're looking. So Dimitri's now going to use    he's used his hand  he's used his body. He's now going to use the other thing which is essential  and that's his voice. Now  the thing about voice is  our experience with voice recognition is pretty awful  isn't it  It never works. You order an airline ticket  you end up in Timbuktu. So we've tackled that problem  and we've come up with a solution  which we'll see in a second. Milo  I could just squish it. Peter Molyneux  What are you going to do  Dimitri  Female Voice  Squashing a snail may not seem important  but remember  even this choice will affect how Milo develops. Do you want Milo to squash it  When you see the microphone  say ...  PM  Squash.  ... yes to decide. Dimitri  Go on  Milo. Squash it. PM  No. That's the wrong thing to do. Now look at his response. He said   Go on  Milo. Squash it.  What we're using there is  we're using something  a piece of technology called Tellme. It's a company that Microsoft acquired some years ago. We've got a database of words which we recognize. We pick those words out. We also reference that with the tonation database that we build up of Dimitri's voice  or the user's voice. Now we need to have a bit more engagement  and again  what we can do is we can look at the body. And we'll do that in a second. Milo  I wonder how deep it is. Deep. PM  Okay. So what we're going to do now is teach Milo to skim stones. We're actually teaching him. It's very  very interesting that men  more than women  tend to be more competitive here. They're fine with teaching Milo for the first few throws  but then they want to beat Milo  where women  they're more nurturing about this. Okay  this is skimming stones. How do you skim stones  You stand up  and you skim the stone. It's that simple. Just recognizing your body  recognizing the body's motions  the tech  understanding that you've gone from sitting down to standing up. Again  all of this is done in the way us humans do things  and that's crucially important if we want Milo to appear real. Female Voice  See if you can inspire him to do any better. Try hitting the boat. Milo  Ahhh. So close. PM  That's Dimitri at his most competitive. Now beaten an    year old child. Well done. Milo  Okay. PM  So  Milo's being called back in by his parents  giving us time to be alone and to help him out. Basically    the bit that we missed at the start    his parents had asked him to clean up his room. And we're going to help him with this now. But this is going to be an introduction  and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use. We're trying to introduce you to what I believe is the most wonderful part  you being able to talk in your natural voice to Milo. Now  to do that  we needed a set up  like a magician's trick. And what we did was  we needed to give Milo this big problem. So as Dimitri starts tidying up  you can overhear a conversation that Milo's having with his parents. Milo's Mom  Oh  you've got gravy all over the floor.  Milo  I didn't mean to   Milo's Mom  That carpet is brand new. PM  So he's just spilled a plate of sausages on the floor  on the brand new carpet. We've all done it as parents  we've all done it as children. Now's a chance for Dimitri to kind of reassure and calm Milo down. It's all been too much for him. He's just moved house. He's got no friends. Now is the time when we open that portal and allow you to talk to Milo. Female Voice  Why don't you try saying something encouraging to cheer Milo up. Dimitri  Come on  Milo. You know what parents are like. They're always getting stressed. Milo  What do they want to come here for anyway  We don't know anyone. Dimitri  Well  you've got a new school to go to. You're going to meet loads of cool  new friends. Milo  I just really miss my old house  that's all. Dimitri  Well  this is a pretty awesome house  Milo. You've got a cool garden to play in and a pond. Milo  It was good skimming stones. This looks nice. You cleaned up my room. Thanks. PM  So after three quarters of an hour  he recognizes you. And I promise you  if you're sitting in front of this screen  that is a truly wonderful moment. And we're ready now to tell a story about his childhood and his life  and it goes on  and he has  you know  many adventures. Some of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side. Some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging    he's got to go to school. The cool thing is that we're doing as well  as you interact with him  you're able to put things into his world  he recognizes objects. His mind is based in a cloud. That means Milo's mind  as millions of people use it  will get smarter and cleverer. He'll recognize more objects and thus understand more words. But for me  this is a wonderful opportunity where technology  at last  can be connected with  where I am no longer restrained by the finger I hold in my hand    as far as a computer game's concerned    or by the blandness of not being noticed if you're watching a film or a book. And I love those revolutions  and I love the future that Milo brings. Thank you very much indeed. This talk is about righting writing wrongs. No  the sound's not faulty    righting writing wrongs. The Middle East is huge  and with all our problems  one thing's for sure  we love to laugh. I think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences. We need to take our responsibilities seriously  but not ourselves. Don't get me wrong  it's not like we don't have comedy in the Middle East. I grew up at a time when iconic actors from Kuwait  Syria  Egypt used laughter to unite the region  just as football can. Now is the time for us to laugh at ourselves  before others can laugh with us. This is the story of the rise and rise of stand up comedy in the Middle East    a stand up uprising  if you will. Working in London as TV maker and writer  I quickly realized that comedy connects audiences. Now  the best breeding ground for good comic writing is the stand up comedy circuit  where they just happen to say that you kill when you do well and you bomb when you do badly. An unfortunate connection for us maybe  but it reminds me that we'd like to thank one man for  over the past decade  working tirelessly to support comedians all around the world  specifically comedians with a Middle Eastern background. Like my good friends  Dean and Maysoon  at the bottom of the screen  who  two years after       started a festival to change the way Middle Easterners are perceived in the world. It's still going strong  with positive press to die for. Also  three guys working for years in Los Angeles  an Iranian  a Palestinian and an Egyptian  created the aptly named Axis of Evil comedy act. And wherever they went  they killed. Now  I didn't start this fire  but I did pour petrol on it. I moved to Dubai as the head of original content for a Western TV network. My job was to connect the brand with a Middle Eastern audience. Now  the American head of programming wanted new local Arabic comedy. In a thick Arabic accent  my brain went   Berfect.  Now  I had friends in the U.S. who had started a successful new tribe. And I had every intention of taking this tribe from being outliers in the Middle East and pushing them over the tipping point towards success. Now  as with any new idea  it wasn't easy. I had four phases to this plan. First  we'd need to buy content from the West and air it. Then I'd bring my friends  and we'd show local amateurs how it's done. We would film that and air it  and then I could work with the local amateurs and write new comedy. I excitedly presented this to the big boss  and his reaction was   Um  I don't get it.  So I retreated back to my cave and continued to support and produce comedy and let my friends use my couch as a regional operations hub. Now  fast forward two years  to early     . The earth rotated  as did our management  and as if by divine intervention  things came together to help this revolution take shape. Here's how the dots connected. First  the Axis guys recorded a Comedy Central special that aired in the States  and it was getting great hits on YouTube. Our new French CEO believed in the power of positive PR ... and ideas du bon marche. Let's just say  value for money.  I produced in Dubai a show for Ahmed Ahmed to showcase his new Axis special to a packed room. I invited our new CEO  and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels  his reaction was very simple   Let's make this happen. And one more thing  No  don't F it up.  So I quickly went to work with a great team around me. I happened to find a funny guy to present it in Arabic  who is originally Korean  a perfect fit for the Axis of Evil. This is all true. Now  while preparing for the tour  I had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive. I used the three Bs of stand up don'ts as I call them in the Middle East  blue content  keep it clean  beliefs  not religion  and the third B  bolitics. Stay away from bolitics in the Middle East. Oh course  you might think  what's left without bolitics  sex and religion  how can you make people laugh  I'd say  watch any successful well written  family friendly sitcom in the West for your answers. Now  were the Axis successful  In five countries  in just under a month  we had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live. We had millions see them on TV and on TV news. In Jordan  we had His Majesty the King come and see them. In fact  they were so successful that you could buy a pirated copy of their DVD  even before it was released in the Middle East. Anywhere you go. So everywhere we went  we auditioned amateurs. We filmed that process and aired a documentary. I called it  Three Guys and Wonho.  It really is his name. And all this TV and Internet exposure has led to a great many recruits to our cause. In Dubai this year  we've just had the first all women's  homegrown stand up show. And notice two of them are wearing headscarves  and yes  even they can laugh. Dubai  to me  is like a hand that supports anyone who wants to make things happen.    years ago  no one had heard of it. Look at it now. With an inspirational leader  I think this year  the opening of the tallest tower in the world is like adding a finger to that hand  that points at all those who spread fallacious stories about us. Now  in three short years  we've come a long way with stand up comedy shows happening even in Saudi Arabia. These comics are now going to the New York festival. And the Lebanese  brilliant Lebanese  Nemr Abou Nassar  we featured in our first tour  has just been performing in L.A.'s legendary comedy clubs. So clearly  from the inside  we are doing our best to change our image  and it's exploding. So  as for the outsiders looking in  watch the CNN report on the second Amman Comedy Festival. The reporter did a great job  and I thank her  but somebody forgot to send the positive PR email to the person operating the automatic news ticker that appears at the bottom. For example  when Dean talks  the ticker says   U.S.  Suspect gave 'actionable intel.  Well  if you're used to listening to comedians  then I'm not surprised. Sadly  this leads me to another three Bs that represents how the media in the West talks about us as bombers  billionaires and belly dancers. Enough. We're not all angry fanatics who want to kill the infidel. We have a positive story to tell and image to sell. In fact  one thing's for sure  in my experience  we love to laugh like hell. Here are three questions that I like to use to test the truthiness of our representation in any media story. One  Is the Middle East being shown in a current time and correct context  Two  Do the Middle Eastern characters laugh or smile without showing the whites of their eyes  Three  Is the Middle Eastern character being played by one  Clearly  there are wrongs that need to be righted. We've started in our region. My challenge to the rest of the world is please  start using positive Middle Eastern images in your stories. For inspiration  go to one of our festivals  go online  drop us a line. Let's change the narrative together and let's start righting writing wrongs. I'd like to end  before going back to the Middle East  with a quote from one of the greatest Sheikhs to put quill to parchment. As my father likes to call him   Asheikh Azubare   as my mother would say   Shakespeare.   And now we go in content to liberty and not to banishment.  Thank you. I was one of the founding members of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour. The other founding members included Ahmed Ahmed  who is an Egyptian American  who actually had the idea to go to the Middle East and try it out. Before we went out as a tour  he went out solo and did it first. Then there was Aron Kader  who was the Palestinian American. And then there was me  the Iranian American of the group. Now  being Iranian American presents its own set of problems  as you know. Those two countries aren't getting along these days. So it causes a lot of inner conflict  you know  like part of me likes me  part of me hates me. Part of me thinks I should have a nuclear program  the other part thinks I can't be trusted with one. These are dilemmas I have every day. But I was born in Iran  I'm now an American citizen  which means I have the American passport  which means I can travel. Because if you only have the Iranian passport  you're kind of limited to the countries you can go to with open arms  you know    Syria  Venezuela  North Korea. So anyone who's gotten their passport in America will tell you  when you get your passport  it still says what country you were born in. So I remember getting my American passport. I was like   Woohoo  I'm going to travel.  And I opened it up  it said   Born in Iran.  I'm like   Oh  come on  man.   I'm trying to go places.  But what's interesting is  I've never had trouble traveling in any other Western countries with my American passport  even though it says   Born in Iran.  No problems. Where I've had some problems is some of the Arab countries  because I guess some of the Arab countries aren't getting along with Iran either. And so I was in Kuwait recently  doing a comedy show with some other American comedians. They all went through  and then the border patrol saw my American passport.  Ah ha  American  great.  Then he opened it up.  Born in Iran  Wait.  And he started asking me questions. He said   What is your father's name   I said   Well  he's passed away  but his name was Khosro.  He goes   What is your grandfather's name   I said   He passed away a long time ago. His name was Jabbar.  He says   You wait. I'll be back   and he walked away. And I started freaking out  because I don't know what kind of crap my grandfather was into. Thought the guy was going to come back and be like   We've been looking for you for     years.   Your grandfather has a parking violation. It's way overdue. You owe us two billion dollars.  But as you can see  when I talk  I speak with an American accent  which you would think as an Iranian American actor  I should be able to play any part  good  bad  what have you. But a lot of times in Hollywood  when casting directors find out you're of Middle Eastern descent  they go   Oh  you're Iranian. Great. Can you say 'I will kill you in the name of Allah '   I could say that  but what if I were to say  'Hello. I'm your doctor '  They go   Great. And then you hijack the hospital.  Like I think you're missing the point here. Don't get me wrong  I don't mind playing bad guys. I want to play a bad guy. I want to rob a bank. I want to rob a bank in a film. I want to rob a bank in a film  but do it with a gun  with a gun  not with a bomb strapped around me  right. Because I imagine the director   Maz  I think your character would rob the bank with a bomb around him.   Why would I do that  If I want the money  why would I kill myself   Right.  Gimme all your money  or I'll blow myself up.   Well  then blow yourself up. Just do it outside  please.  But the fact is  there's good people everywhere. That's what I try and show in my stand up. There's good people everywhere. All it takes in one person to mess it up. Like a couple months ago in Times Square in New York  there was this Pakistani Muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb. Now  I happened to be in Times Square that night doing a comedy show. And a few months before that  there was a white American guy in Austin  Texas who flew his airplane into the IRS building  and I happened to be in Austin that day doing a stand up comedy show. Now I'll tell you  as a Middle Eastern male  when you show up around a lot of these activities  you start feeling guilty at one point. I was watching the news. I'm like   Am I involved in this crap    I didn't get the memo. What's going on   But what was interesting was  the Pakistani Muslim guy    see he gives a bad name to Muslims and Middle Easterners and Pakistanis from all over the world. And one thing that happened there was also the Pakistani Taliban took credit for that failed car bombing. My question is  why would you take credit for a failed car bombing   We just wanted to say we tried.   And furthermore  it is the thought that counts.   And in conclusion  win some  lose some.  But what happened was  when the white guy flew his plane into the building  I know all my Middle Eastern and Muslim friends in the States were watching TV  going   Please  don't be Middle Eastern. Don't be Hassan. Don't be Hussein.  And the name came out Jack. I'm like   Woooo  That's not one of us.  But I kept watching the news in case they came back  they were like   Before he did it  he converted to Islam.   Damn it  Why Jack  Why   But the fact is  I've been lucky to get a chance to perform all over the world  and I did a lot of shows in the Middle East. I just did a seven country solo tour. I was in Oman  and I was in Saudi Arabia. I was in Dubai. And it's great  there's good people everywhere. And you learn great things about these places. I encourage people always to go visit these places. For example  Dubai    cool place. They're obsessed with having the biggest  tallest  longest  as we all know. They have a mall there  the Dubai Mall. It is so big  they have taxis in the mall. I was walking. I heard  Beep  beep.  I'm like   What are you doing here   He goes   I'm going to the Zara store. It's three miles away. Out of my way. Out of my way. Out of my way.  And what's crazy    there's a recession going on  even in Dubai  but you wouldn't know by the prices. Like in the Dubai Mall  they sell frozen yogurt by the gram. It's like a drug deal. I was walking by. The guy goes   Psst. Habibi  my friend.   You want some frozen yogurt  Come here. Come here. Come here. I have one gram  five gram     gram. How many gram do you want   I bought five grams.    dollars.    dollars  I said   What's in this   He's like   Good stuff  man. Columbian. Top of the line. Top of the line.  The other thing you learn sometimes when you travel to these countries in the Middle East  sometimes in Latin American countries  South American countries    a lot of times when they build stuff  there's no rules and regulations. For example  I took my two year old son to the playground at the Dubai Mall. And I've taken my two year old son to playgrounds all over the United States. And when you put your two year old on a slide in the United States  they put something on the slide to slow the kid down as he comes down the slide. Not in the Middle East. I put my two year old on the slide  he went frrmrmm  He took off. I went down. I go   Where's my son    On the third floor  sir. On the third floor.   You take a taxi. You go to Zara. Make a left.   Try the yogurt. It's very good. Little expensive.  But one of the things I try to do with my stand up is to break stereotypes. And I've been guilty of stereotyping as well. I was in Dubai. And there's a lot of Indians who work in Dubai. And they don't get paid that well. And I got it in my head that all the Indians there must be workers. And I forgot there's obviously successful Indians in Dubai as well. I was doing a show  and they said   We're going to send a driver to pick you up.  So I went down to the lobby  and I saw this Indian guy. I go   He's got to be my driver.  Because he was standing there in like a cheap suit  thin mustache  staring at me. So I went over   Excuse me  sir  are you my driver   He goes   No  sir. I own the hotel.  I go   I'm sorry. Then why were you staring at me   He goes   I thought you were my driver.  I'll leave you guys with this  I try  with my stand up  to break stereotypes  present Middle Easterners in a positive light    Muslims in a positive light    and I hope that in the coming years  more film and television programs come out of Hollywood presenting us in a positive light. Who knows  maybe one day we'll even have our own James Bond  right.  My name is Bond  Jamal Bond.  Til then  I'll keep telling jokes. I hope you keep laughing. Have a good day. Thank you. My name's Seth Priebatsch. I'm the chief ninja of SCVNGR. I am a proud Princeton dropout. Also proud to have relocated here to Boston  where I actually grew up. Yeah  Boston. Easy wins. I should just go and name the counties that we've got around here. So  I'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world. And this is sort of a new concept  and it's really important. Because while the last decade was the decade of social and the decade of where the framework in which we connect with other people was built  this next decade will be the decade where the game framework is built  where the motivations that we use to actually influence behavior  and the framework in which that is constructed  is decided upon  and that's really important. And so I say that I want to build a game layer on top of the world  but that's not quite true because it's already under construction  it's already happening. And it looks like this right now. It looks like the Web did back in       right  It's not very good. It's cluttered. It's filled with lots of different things that  in short  aren't that fun. There are credit card schemes and airline mile programs and coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes that actually do use game dynamics and actually are building the game layer  they just suck. They're not very well designed  right  So  that's unfortunate. But luckily  as my favorite action hero  Bob the Builder  says   We can do better. We can build this better.  And the tools  the resources that we use to build a game layer are game dynamics themselves. And so  sort of  the crux of this presentation is going to go through four really important game dynamics  really interesting things  that  if you use consciously  you can use to influence behavior  both for good  for bad  for in between. Hopefully for good. But this is sort of the important stages in which that framework will get built  and so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now. Just before we jump into that  there's sort of a question of  why is this important  I'm sort of making this claim that there is a game layer on top of the world  and that it's very important that we build it properly. The reason that it's so important is that  the last decade  what we've seen has been building the social layer  has been this framework for connections  and construction on that layer is over  it's finished. There's still a lot to explore. There's still a lot of people who are trying to figure out social and how do we leverage this and how do we use this  but the framework itself is done  and it's called Facebook. And that's okay  right  A lot of people are very happy with Facebook. I like it quite a lot. They've created this thing called the Open Graph  and they own all of our connections. They own half a billion people. And so when you want to build on the social layer  the framework has been decided  it is the Open Graph API. And if you're happy with that  fantastic. If you're not  too bad. There's nothing you can do. But this next decade    and that's a real thing. I mean  we want to build frameworks in a way that makes it acceptable and makes it  you know  productive down the road. So  the social layer is all about these connections. The game layer is all about influence. It's not about adding a social fabric to the Web and connecting you to other people everywhere you are and everywhere you go. It's actually about using dynamics  using forces  to influence the behavior of where you are  what you do there  how you do it. That's really  really powerful  and it's going to be more important than the social layer. It's going to affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more invisibly. And so it's incredibly critical that at this moment  while it's just getting constructed  while the frameworks like Facebook  like the Open Graph  are being created for the game layer equivalent  that we think about it very consciously  and that we do it in a way that is open  that is available  and that can be leveraged for good. And so that's what I want to talk about for game dynamics  because construction has just begun  and the more consciously we can think about this  the better we'll be able to use it for anything that we want. So like I said  the way that you go through and build on the game layer is not with glass and steel and cement. And the resources that we use are not this two dimensional swath of land that we have. The resources are mindshare and the tools  the raw materials are these game dynamics. So with that  you know  a couple game dynamics to talk about. Four. Back at SCVNGR  we like to joke that with seven game dynamics  you can get anyone to do anything. And so today  I'm going to show you four  because I hope to have a competitive advantage at the end of this  still. So the first one  it's a very simple game dynamic. It's called the appointment dynamic. And this is a dynamic in which to succeed  players have to do something at a predefined time  generally at a predefined place. And these dynamics are a little scary sometimes  because you think  you know  other people can be using forces that will manipulate how I interact  what I do  where I do it  when I do it. This sort of loss of free will that occurs in games can be frightening  so with each dynamic  I'm going to give three examples  one that shows how this is already being used in the real world  so you can sort of rationalize it a little bit  one that shows it in what we consider a conventional game    I think everything is a game  but this is sort of more of a what you would think is a game played on a board or on a computer screen  and then one how this can be used for good  so we can see that these forces can really be very powerful. So the first one    the most famous appointment dynamic in the world    is something called happy hour. So I just recently dropped out of Princeton and actually ended up for the first time in a bar  and I saw these happy hour things all over the place  right. And this is simply an appointment dynamic. Come here at a certain time  get your drinks half off. To win  all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time. This game dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our behavior  it's influenced our entire culture. That's a really scary thought  that one game dynamic can change things so powerfully. It also exists in more conventional game forms. I'm sure you've all heard of Farmville by now. If you haven't  I recommend playing it. You won't do anything else with the rest of your day. Farmville has more active users than Twitter. It's incredibly powerful  and it has this dynamic where you have to return at a certain time to water your crops    fake crops    or they wilt. And this is so powerful that  when they tweak their stats  when they say your crops wilt after eight hours  or after six hours  or after    hours  it changes the lifecycle of    million some people during the day. They will return like clockwork at different times. So if they wanted the world to end  if they wanted productivity to stop  they could make this a    minute cycle  and no one could do anything else  right  That's a little scary. But this could also be used for good. This is a local company called Vitality  and they've created a product to help people take their medicine on time. That's an appointment. It's something that people don't do very well. And they have these GlowCaps  which  you know  flash and email you and do all sorts of cool things to remind you to take your medicine. This is one that isn't a game yet  but really should be. You should get points for doing this on time. You should lose points for not doing this on time. They should consciously recognize that they've built an appointment dynamic and leverage the games. And then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways. We're going to jump onto the next one  maybe. Yes. Influence and status. So this is one of the most famous game dynamics. It's used all over the place. It's used in your wallets  right now. We all want that credit card on the far left because it's black. And you see someone at CVS or    not CVS    at Christian Dior or something  and then ... I don't know. I don't have a black card  I've got a debit card. So they whip it out. And you see men  they have that black card. I want that because that means that they're cooler than I am  and I need that. And this is used in games as well.  Modern Warfare   one of the most successful selling games of all time. I'm only a level four  but I desperately want to be a level     because they've got that cool red badge thing  and that means that I am somehow better than everyone else. And that's very powerful to me. Status is really good motivator. It's also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings. School    and remember  I made it through one year  so I think I'm qualified to talk on school    is a game  it's just not a terribly well designed game  right. There are levels. There are C. There are B. There is A. There are statuses. I mean  what is valedictorian  but a status  If we called valedictorian a  white knight paladin level      I think people would probably work a lot harder. So school is a game  and there have been lots of experimentations on how we do this properly. But let's use it consciously. Like why have games that you can lose  Why go from an A to an F or a B to a C  That sucks. Why not level up  And at Princeton  they've actually experimented with this  where they have quizzes where you gain experience points  and you level up from B to an A. And it's very powerful. It can be used in interesting ways. The third one I want to talk about quickly is the progression dynamic  where you have to sort of make progress  you have to move through different steps in a very granular fashion. This is used all over the place  including LinkedIn  where I am an un whole individual. I am only    percent complete on LinkedIn  and that bothers me. And this is so deep seated in our psyche that when we're presented with a progress bar and presented with easy  granular steps to take to try and complete that progress bar  we will do it. We will find a way to move that blue line all the way to the right edge of the screen. This is used in conventional games as well. I mean  you see this is a paladin level     and that's a paladin level     and if you were going to fight  you know  orcs on the fields of Mordor against the Raz al Ghul  you'd probably want to be the bigger one  right. I would. And so people work very hard to level up.  World of Warcraft  is one of the most successful games of all time. The average player spends something like six  six and a half hours a day on it. Their most dedicated players  it's like a full time job. It's insane. And they have these systems where you can level up. And that's a very powerful thing. Progression is powerful. It can also be used in very compelling ways for good. One of the things that we work on at SCVNGR is how do you use games to drive traffic and drive business to local businesses  to sort of something that is very key to the economy. And here we have a game that people play. They go places  they do challenges  they earn points. And we've introduced a progression dynamic into it  where  by going to the same place over and over  by doing challenges  by engaging with the business  you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen  and you eventually unlock rewards. And this is powerful enough that we can see that it hooks people into these dynamics  pulls them back to the same local businesses  creates huge loyalty  creates engagement  and is able to drive meaningful revenue and fun and engagement to businesses. These progression dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world. The final one I want to talk about    and it's a great one to end on    is this concept of communal discovery  a dynamic in which everyone has to work together to achieve something. And communal discovery is powerful because it leverages the network that is society to solve problems. This is used in some sort of famous consumer web stories  like Digg  which I'm sure you've all heard of. Digg is a communal dynamic to try to find and source the best news  the most interesting stories. And they made this into a game  initially. They had a leader board  where  if you recommended the best stories  you would get points. And that really motivated people to find the best stories. But it became so powerful that there was actually a cabal  a group of people  the top seven on the leader board  who would work together to make sure they maintained that position. And they would recommend other people's stories  and the game became more powerful than the goal. And they actually had to end up shutting down the leader board because while it was effective  it was so powerful that it stopped sourcing the best stories and started having people work to maintain their leadership. So we have to use this one carefully. It's also used in things like McDonald's Monopoly  where the game is not the Monopoly game you're playing  but the sort of cottage industries that form to try and find Boardwalk  right. And now they're just looking for a little sticker that says  Boardwalk.  But it can also be used to find real things. This is the DARPA balloon challenge  where they hid a couple balloons all across the United States and said   Use networks. Try and find these balloons fastest  and the winner will get        .  And the winner was actually a group out of MIT  where they created sort of a pyramid scheme  a network  where the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got        and anyone else to push that recommendation up also got a cut of it. And in    hours  they were able to find all these balloons  all across the country  right. Really powerful dynamic. And so  I've got about    seconds left  so if I'm going to leave you with anything  last decade was the decade of social. This next decade is the decade of games. We use game dynamics to build on it. We build with mindshare. We can influence behavior. It is very powerful. It is very exciting. Let's all build it together  let's do it well and have fun playing. It feels like we're all suffering from information overload or data glut. And the good news is there might be an easy solution to that  and that's using our eyes more. So  visualizing information  so that we can see the patterns and connections that matter and then designing that information so it makes more sense  or it tells a story  or allows us to focus only on the information that's important. Failing that  visualized information can just look really cool. So  let's see. This is the  Billion Dollar o Gram  and this image arose out of frustration I had with the reporting of billion dollar amounts in the press. That is  they're meaningless without context      billion for this pipeline     billion for this war. It doesn't make any sense  so the only way to understand it is visually and relatively. So I scraped a load of reported figures from various news outlets and then scaled the boxes according to those amounts. And the colors here represent the motivation behind the money. So purple is  fighting   and red is  giving money away   and green is  profiteering.  And what you can see straight away is you start to have a different relationship to the numbers. You can literally see them. But more importantly  you start to see patterns and connections between numbers that would otherwise be scattered across multiple news reports. Let me point out some that I really like. This is OPEC's revenue  this green box here        billion a year. And this little pixel in the corner    three billion    that's their climate change fund. Americans  incredibly generous people    over     billion a year  donated to charity every year  compared with the amount of foreign aid given by the top    industrialized nations at     billion. Then of course  the Iraq War  predicted to cost just    billion back in     . And it mushroomed slightly. Afghanistan and Iraq mushroomed now to       billion. So now it's great because now we have this texture  and we can add numbers to it as well. So we could say  well  a new figure comes out ... let's see African debt. How much of this diagram do you think might be taken up by the debt that Africa owes to the West  Let's take a look. So there it is      billion is what Africa owes. And the recent financial crisis  how much of this diagram might that figure take up  What has that cost the world  Let's take a look at that. Dooosh    Which I think is the appropriate sound effect for that much money         billion. So  by visualizing this information  we turned it into a landscape that you can explore with your eyes  a kind of map really  a sort of information map. And when you're lost in information  an information map is kind of useful. So I want to show you another landscape now. We need to imagine what a landscape of the world's fears might look like. Let's take a look. This is Mountains Out of Molehills  a timeline of global media panic. So  I'll label this for you in a second. But the height here  I want to point out  is the intensity of certain fears as reported in the media. Let me point them out. So this  swine flu    pink. Bird flu. SARS    brownish here. Remember that one  The millennium bug  terrible disaster. These little green peaks are asteroid collisions. And in summer  here  killer wasps. So these are what our fears look like over time in our media. But what I love    and I'm a journalist    and what I love is finding hidden patterns  I love being a data detective. And there's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data that you can only see when you visualize it. Let me highlight it for you. See this line  this is a landscape for violent video games. As you can see  there's a kind of odd  regular pattern in the data  twin peaks every year. If we look closer  we see those peaks occur at the same month every year. Why  Well  November  Christmas video games come out  and there may well be an upsurge in the concern about their content. But April isn't a particularly massive month for video games. Why April  Well  in April      was the Columbine shooting  and since then  that fear has been remembered by the media and echoes through the group mind gradually through the year. You have retrospectives  anniversaries  court cases  even copy cat shootings  all pushing that fear into the agenda. And there's another pattern here as well. Can you spot it  See that gap there  There's a gap  and it affects all the other stories. Why is there a gap there  You see where it starts  September       when we had something very real to be scared about. So  I've been working as a data journalist for about a year  and I keep hearing a phrase all the time  which is this   Data is the new oil.  Data is the kind of ubiquitous resource that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights  and it's all around us  and it can be mined very easily. It's not a particularly great metaphor in these times  especially if you live around the Gulf of Mexico  but I would  perhaps  adapt this metaphor slightly  and I would say that data is the new soil. Because for me  it feels like a fertile  creative medium. Over the years  online  we've laid down a huge amount of information and data  and we irrigate it with networks and connectivity  and it's been worked and tilled by unpaid workers and governments. And  all right  I'm kind of milking the metaphor a little bit. But it's a really fertile medium  and it feels like visualizations  infographics  data visualizations  they feel like flowers blooming from this medium. But if you look at it directly  it's just a lot of numbers and disconnected facts. But if you start working with it and playing with it in a certain way  interesting things can appear and different patterns can be revealed. Let me show you this. Can you guess what this data set is  What rises twice a year  once in Easter and then two weeks before Christmas  has a mini peak every Monday  and then flattens out over the summer  I'll take answers. You might want to get some chocolate in. Any other guesses  Yeah  retail therapy might help. DM  Sick leave. Yeah  you'll definitely want to take some time off. Shall we see  So  the information guru Lee Byron and myself  we scraped        status Facebook updates for the phrase  break up  and  broken up  and this is the pattern we found    people clearing out for Spring Break  coming out of very bad weekends on a Monday  being single over the summer  and then the lowest day of the year  of course  Christmas Day. Who would do that  So there's a titanic amount of data out there now  unprecedented. But if you ask the right kind of question  or you work it in the right kind of way  interesting things can emerge. So information is beautiful. Data is beautiful. I wonder if I could make my life beautiful. And here's my visual C.V. I'm not quite sure I've succeeded. Pretty blocky  the colors aren't that great. But I wanted to convey something to you. I started as a programmer  and then I worked as a writer for many years  about    years  in print  online and then in advertising  and only recently have I started designing. And I've never been to design school. I've never studied art or anything. I just kind of learned through doing. And when I started designing  I discovered an odd thing about myself. I already knew how to design  but it wasn't like I was amazingly brilliant at it  but more like I was sensitive to the ideas of grids and space and alignment and typography. It's almost like being exposed to all this media over the years had instilled a kind of dormant design literacy in me. And I don't feel like I'm unique. I feel that everyday  all of us now are being blasted by information design. It's being poured into our eyes through the Web  and we're all visualizers now  we're all demanding a visual aspect to our information. There's something almost quite magical about visual information. It's effortless  it literally pours in. And if you're navigating a dense information jungle  coming across a beautiful graphic or a lovely data visualization  it's a relief  it's like coming across a clearing in the jungle. I was curious about this  so it led me to the work of a Danish physicist called Tor Norretranders  and he converted the bandwidth of the senses into computer terms. So here we go. This is your senses  pouring into your senses every second. Your sense of sight is the fastest. It has the same bandwidth as a computer network. Then you have touch  which is about the speed of a USB key. And then you have hearing and smell  which has the throughput of a hard disk. And then you have poor old taste  which is like barely the throughput of a pocket calculator. And that little square in the corner  a naught .  percent  that's the amount we're actually aware of. So a lot of your vision    the bulk of it is visual  and it's pouring in. It's unconscious. The eye is exquisitely sensitive to patterns in variations in color  shape and pattern. It loves them  and it calls them beautiful. It's the language of the eye. If you combine the language of the eye with the language of the mind  which is about words and numbers and concepts  you start speaking two languages simultaneously  each enhancing the other. So  you have the eye  and then you drop in the concepts. And that whole thing    it's two languages both working at the same time. So we can use this new kind of language  if you like  to alter our perspective or change our views. Let me ask you a simple question with a really simple answer  Who has the biggest military budget  It's got to be America  right  Massive.     billion in              rather. So massive  in fact  that it can contain all the other military budgets in the world inside itself. Gobble  gobble  gobble  gobble  gobble. Now  you can see Africa's total debt there and the U.K. budget deficit for reference. So that might well chime with your view that America is a sort of warmongering military machine  out to overpower the world with its huge industrial military complex. But is it true that America has the biggest military budget  Because America is an incredibly rich country. In fact  it's so massively rich that it can contain the four other top industrialized nations' economies inside itself  it's so vastly rich. So its military budget is bound to be enormous. So  to be fair and to alter our perspective  we have to bring in another data set  and that data set is GDP  or the country's earnings. Who has the biggest budget as a proportion of GDP  Let's have a look. That changes the picture considerably. Other countries pop into view that you  perhaps  weren't considering  and American drops into eighth. Now you can also do this with soldiers. Who has the most soldiers  It's got to be China. Of course   .  million. Again  chiming with your view that China has a militarized regime ready to  you know  mobilize its enormous forces. But of course  China has an enormous population. So if we do the same  we see a radically different picture. China drops to    th. It actually has a tiny army when you take other data into consideration. So  absolute figures  like the military budget  in a connected world  don't give you the whole picture. They're not as true as they could be. We need relative figures that are connected to other data so that we can see a fuller picture  and then that can lead to us changing our perspective. As Hans Rosling  the master  my master  said   Let the dataset change your mindset.  And if it can do that  maybe it can also change your behavior. Take a look at this one. I'm a bit of a health nut. I love taking supplements and being fit  but I can never understand what's going on in terms of evidence. There's always conflicting evidence. Should I take vitamin C  Should I be taking wheatgrass  This is a visualization of all the evidence for nutritional supplements. This kind of diagram is called a balloon race. So the higher up the image  the more evidence there is for each supplement. And the bubbles correspond to popularity as regards to Google hits. So you can immediately apprehend the relationship between efficacy and popularity  but you can also  if you grade the evidence  do a  worth it  line. So supplements above this line are worth investigating  but only for the conditions listed below  and then the supplements below the line are perhaps not worth investigating. Now this image constitutes a huge amount of work. We scraped like       studies from PubMed  the biomedical database  and we compiled them and graded them all. And it was incredibly frustrating for me because I had a book of     visualizations to do for my book  and I spent a month doing this  and I only filled two pages. But what it points to is that visualizing information like this is a form of knowledge compression. It's a way of squeezing an enormous amount of information and understanding into a small space. And once you've curated that data  and once you've cleaned that data  and once it's there  you can do cool stuff like this. So I converted this into an interactive app  so I can now generate this application online    this is the visualization online    and I can say   Yeah  brilliant.  So it spawns itself. And then I can say   Well  just show me the stuff that affects heart health.  So let's filter that out. So heart is filtered out  so I can see if I'm curious about that. I think   No  no. I don't want to take any synthetics  I just want to see plants and    just show me herbs and plants. I've got all the natural ingredients.  Now this app is spawning itself from the data. The data is all stored in a Google Doc  and it's literally generating itself from that data. So the data is now alive  this is a living image  and I can update it in a second. New evidence comes out. I just change a row on a spreadsheet. Doosh  Again  the image recreates itself. So it's cool. It's kind of living. But it can go beyond data  and it can go beyond numbers. I like to apply information visualization to ideas and concepts. This is a visualization of the political spectrum  an attempt for me to try and understand how it works and how the ideas percolate down from government into society and culture  into families  into individuals  into their beliefs and back around again in a cycle. What I love about this image is it's made up of concepts  it explores our worldviews and it helps us    it helps me anyway    to see what others think  to see where they're coming from. And it feels just incredibly cool to do that. What was most exciting for me designing this was that  when I was designing this image  I desperately wanted this side  the left side  to be better than the right side    being a journalist  a Left leaning person    but I couldn't  because I would have created a lopsided  biased diagram. So  in order to really create a full image  I had to honor the perspectives on the right hand side and at the same time  uncomfortably recognize how many of those qualities were actually in me  which was very  very annoying and uncomfortable. But not too uncomfortable  because there's something unthreatening about seeing a political perspective  versus being told or forced to listen to one. You're capable of holding conflicting viewpoints joyously when you can see them. It's even fun to engage with them because it's visual. So that's what's exciting to me  seeing how data can change my perspective and change my mind midstream    beautiful  lovely data. So  just to wrap up  I wanted to say that it feels to me that design is about solving problems and providing elegant solutions  and information design is about solving information problems. It feels like we have a lot of information problems in our society at the moment  from the overload and the saturation to the breakdown of trust and reliability and runaway skepticism and lack of transparency  or even just interestingness. I mean  I find information just too interesting. It has a magnetic quality that draws me in. So  visualizing information can give us a very quick solution to those kinds of problems. Even when the information is terrible  the visual can be quite beautiful. Often we can get clarity or the answer to a simple question very quickly  like this one  the recent Icelandic volcano. Which was emitting the most CO   Was it the planes or the volcano  the grounded planes or the volcano  So we can have a look. We look at the data and we see  Yep  the volcano emitted         tons  the grounded planes would have emitted         if they were in the sky. So essentially  we had our first carbon neutral volcano. And that is beautiful. Thank you. Come with me to the bottom of the world  Antarctica  the highest  driest  windiest  and yes  coldest region on Earth    more arid than the Sahara and  in parts  colder than Mars. The ice of Antarctica glows with a light so dazzling  it blinds the unprotected eye. Early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes to kill the pain of it. The weight of the ice is such that the entire continent sags below sea level  beneath its weight. Yet  the ice of Antarctica is a calendar of climate change. It records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ages. Nowhere on Earth offers us such a perfect record. And here  scientists are drilling into the past of our planet to find clues to the future of climate change. This past January  I traveled to a place called WAIS Divide  about     miles from the South Pole. It is the best place on the planet  many say  to study the history of climate change. There  about    scientists from the University of Wisconsin  the Desert Research Institute in Nevada and others have been working to answer a central question about global warming. What is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary temperatures  It's urgent work. We know that temperatures are rising. This past May was the warmest worldwide on record. And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too. What we don't know is the exact  precise  immediate impact of these changes on natural climate patterns    winds  ocean currents  precipitation rates  cloud formation  things that bear on the health and well being of billions of people. Their entire camp  every item of gear  was ferried     miles from McMurdo Station  the main U.S. supply base on the coast of Antarctica. WAIS Divide itself though  is a circle of tents in the snow. In blizzard winds  the crew sling ropes between the tents so that people can feel their way safely to the nearest ice house and to the nearest outhouse. It snows so heavily there  the installation was almost immediately buried. Indeed  the researchers picked this site because ice and snow accumulates here    times faster than anywhere else in Antarctica. They have to dig themselves out every day. It makes for an exotic and chilly commute. But under the surface is a hive of industrial activity centered around an eight million dollar drill assembly. Periodically  this drill  like a biopsy needle  plunges thousands of feet deep into the ice to extract a marrow of gases and isotopes for analysis. Ten times a day  they extract the    foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals laid down by snow  season after season for thousands of years. It's really a time machine. At the peak of activity earlier this year  the researchers lowered the drill an extra hundred feet deeper into the ice every day and another     years deeper into the past. Periodically  they remove a cylinder of ice  like gamekeepers popping a spent shotgun shell from the barrel of a drill. They inspect it  they check it for cracks  for drill damage  for spalls  for chips. More importantly  they prepare it for inspection and analysis by    independent laboratories in the United States and Europe  who will examine it for    different trace chemicals related to climate  some in parts per quadrillion. Yes  I said that with a Q  quadrillion. They cut the cylinders up into three foot sections for easier handling and shipment back to these labs  some       miles from the drill site. Each cylinder is a parfait of time. This ice formed as snow        years ago  when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint and considering the radical new technology of the alphabet. Bathed in polarized light and cut in cross section  this ancient ice reveals itself as a mosaic of colors  each one showing how conditions at depth in the ice have affected this material at depths where pressures can reach a ton per square inch. Every year  it begins with a snowflake  and by digging into fresh snow  we can see how this process is ongoing today. This wall of undisturbed snow  back lit by sunlight  shows the striations of winter and summer snow  layer upon layer. Each storm scours the atmosphere  washing out dust  soot  trace chemicals  and depositing them on the snow pack year after year  millennia after millennia  creating a kind of periodic table of elements that at this point is more than        feet thick. From this  we can detect an extraordinary number of things. We can see the calcium from the world's deserts  soot from distant wildfires  methane as an indicator of the strength of a Pacific monsoon  all wafted on winds from warmer latitudes to this remote and very cold place. Most importantly  these cylinders and this snow trap air. Each cylinder is about    percent ancient air  a pristine time capsule of greenhouse gases    carbon dioxide  methane  nitrous oxide    all unchanged from the day that snow formed and first fell. And this is the object of their scrutiny. But don't we already know what we need to know about greenhouse gases  Why do we need to study this anymore  Don't we already know how they affect temperatures  Don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our settled civilization  The truth is  we only know the outlines  and what we don't completely understand  we can't properly fix. Indeed  we run the risk of making things worse. Consider  the single most successful international environmental effort of the   th century  the Montreal Protocol  in which the nations of Earth banded together to protect the planet from the harmful effects of ozone destroying chemicals used at that time in air conditioners  refrigerators and other cooling devices. We banned those chemicals  and we replaced them  unknowingly  with other substances that  molecule per molecule  are a hundred times more potent as heat trapping  greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide. This process requires extraordinary precautions. The scientists must insure that the ice is not contaminated. Moreover  in this       mile journey  they have to insure this ice doesn't melt. Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics. They have to  in fact  make sure this ice never gets warmer than about    degrees below zero  otherwise  the key gases inside it will dissipate. So  in the coldest place on Earth  they work inside a refrigerator. As they handle the ice  in fact  they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven  so that  when their work gloves freeze and their fingers stiffen  they can don a fresh pair. They work against the clock and against the thermometer. So far  they've packed up about       feet of ice cores for shipment back to the United States. This past season  they manhandled them across the ice to waiting aircraft. The    th Air National Guard flew the most recent shipment of ice back to the coast of Antarctica  where it was boarded onto a freighter  shipped across the tropics to California  unloaded  put on a truck  driven across the desert to the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver  Colorado  where  as we speak  scientists are now slicing this material up for samples  for analysis  to be distributed to the laboratories around the country and in Europe. Antarctica was this planet's last empty quarter    the blind spot in our expanding vision of the world. Early explorers sailed off the edge of the map  and they found a place where the normal rules of time and temperature seem suspended. Here  the ice seems a living presence. The wind that rubs against it gives it voice. It is a voice of experience. It is a voice we should heed. Thank you. Cartoons are basically short stories. I tried to find one that didn't have a whole lot of words. Not all of them have happy endings. So how did I get started cartooning  I doodled a lot as a kid  and if you spend enough time doodling  sooner or later  something happens  all your career options run out. So you have to make a living cartooning. Actually  I fell in love with the ocean when I was a little boy  when I was about eight or nine. And I was particularly fascinated with sharks. This is some of my early work. Eventually  my mom took the red crayon away  so it was  unclear . But I'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine that really made me see the ocean differently  and it's become the foundation of my work because  I feel like  if in a day  I can see the ocean differently  then I can evoke that same kind of change in others  especially kids. Before that day  this is how I saw the ocean. It's just a big blue surface. And this is how we've seen the ocean since the beginning of time. It's a mystery. There's been a lot of folklore developed around the ocean  mostly negative. And that prompted people to make maps like this  with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land  but when you get to the waters edge  the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint. And this is the way I saw the ocean at school    as if to say   All geography and science lessons stop at water's edge. This part's not going to be on the test.  But that day I flew low over the islands    it was a family trip to the Caribbean  and I flew in a small plane low over the islands. This is what I saw. I saw hills and valleys. I saw forests and meadows. I saw grottoes and secret gardens and places I'd love to hide as a kid  if I could only breathe underwater. And best of all  I saw the animals. I saw a manta ray that looked as big as the plane I was flying in. And I flew over a lagoon with a shark in it  and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born. So from that day on  I was an ordinary kid walking around on dry land  but my head was down there  underwater. Up until that day  these were the animals that were most common in my life. These were the ones I'd like to draw    all variations of four legs and fur. But when you got to the ocean  my imagination was no competition for nature. Every time I'd come up with a crazy cartoon character on the drawing board  I'd find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier. And the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon and this enormous humpback whale was like something out of a science fiction movie. Whenever I talk to kids  I always like to tell them  the biggest animal that ever lived is still alive. It's not a dinosaur  it's a whale  animals as big as office buildings still swimming around out there in our ocean. Speaking of dinosaurs  sharks are basically the same fish they were     million years ago. So if you ever fantasize about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like  that's what a dinosaur looks like. So you have living dinosaurs and space aliens  animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions. It's just incredible  no Hollywood designer could come up with something more interesting than that. Or this fangtooth. The particles in the water make it look like it's floating in outer space. Could you image if we looked through the Hubble Telescope and we saw that  It would start a whole new space race. But instead  we stick a camera in the deep ocean  and we see a fish  and it doesn't capture our imagination as a society. We say to ourselves   Maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something.  So  what I'd like to do now is try a little drawing. So  I'm going to try to draw this fangtooth here. I love to draw the deep sea fish  because they are so ugly  but beautiful in their own way. Maybe we can give him a little bioluminescence here    give him a headlight  maybe a brake light  turn signals. But it's easy to see why these animals make such great cartoon characters  their shapes and sizes. So some of them actually seem to have powers like superheroes in a comic book. For instance  take these sea turtles. They kind of have a sixth sense like Superman's x ray vision. They can sense the magnetic fields of the earth. And they can use that sense to navigate hundreds of miles of open ocean. I kind of give my turtle hands just to make them an easier cartoon character to work with. Or take this sea cucumber. It's not an animal we draw cartoons of or draw at all. He's like an underwater Spiderman. He shoots out these sticky webs to entangle his enemy. Of course  sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears  which  in my opinion  makes them much more interesting a superhero. He can't spin a web anytime  he's got to pull his pants down first. Or the blowfish. The blowfish is like the Incredible Hulk. It can change its body into a big  intimidating fish in a matter of seconds. I'm going to draw this blowfish uninflated. And then I'm going to attempt onscreen animation here. Let's see. Try and inflate it.  You talkin' to me   See  he can inflate himself when he wants to be intimidating. Or take this swordfish. Could you imagine being born with a tool for a nose  Do you think he wakes up in the morning  looks in the mirror and says   Somebody's getting stabbed today.  Or this lionfish for instance. Imagine trying to make friends covered with razor sharp poisonous barbs. It's not something you want to put on your Facebook page  right  My characters are    my lead character's a shark named Sherman. He's a great white shark. And I kind of broke the mold with Sherman. I didn't want to go with this ruthless predator image. He's kind of just out there making a living. He's sort of a Homer Simpson with fins. And then his sidekick is a sea turtle  as I mentioned before  named Filmore. He uses his wonderful skills at navigation to wander the oceans  looking for a mate. And he does manage to find them  but great navigation skills  lousy pick up lines. He never seems to settle on any particular girl. I have a hermit crab named Hawthorne  who doesn't get a lot of respect as a hermit crab  so he kind of wishes he were a great white shark. And then I'll introduce you to one more character  this guy  Ernest  who is basically a juvenile delinquent in a fish body. So with characters  you can make stories. Sometimes making a story is as easy as putting two characters in a room and seeing what happens. So  imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom. Or  sometimes I take them to places that people have never heard of because they're underwater. For instance  I took them skiing in the Mid Atlantic Range  which is this range of mountains in the middle of the Atlantic. I've taken them to the Sea of Japan  where they met giant jellyfish. I've taken them camping in the kelp forests of California. This next one here  I did a story on the census of marine life. And that was a lot of fun because  as most of you know  it's a real project we've heard about. But it was a chance for me to introduce readers to a lot of crazy undersea characters. So we start off the story with Ernest  who volunteers as a census taker. He goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish. Then he meets the yeti crab  the famous vampire squid    elusive  hard to find    and the Dumbo octopus  which looks so much like a cartoon in real life that really didn't have to change a thing when I drew it. I did another story on marine debris. I was speaking to a lot of my friends in the conservation business  and they    I asked them   So what's one issue you would like everyone to know more about   And they said    this one friend of mine said   I've got one word for you  plastic.  And I told him   Well  I need something a little sexier than that. Plastic just is not going to do it.  We sort of worked things out. He wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride  which doesn't really work in voice balloons very well. I couldn't fit them in. So what I did was I made an adventure strip. Basically  this bottle travels a long way. What I'm trying to tell readers is that plastic doesn't really go away  it just continues to wash downstream. And a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean  which is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it  especially if they can't stand each other  like these two. So  I sent them to Boise  Idaho  where they dropped a plastic bottle into the Boise sewer system. And it ended up in the Boise River and then on to the Columbia River and then to the mouth of the Columbia and to the Pacific Ocean and then on to this place called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch    which is this giant Pacific gyre in the North Pacific  where a lot of this plastic ends up floating around    and then back onto the lagoon. So that was basically a buddy story with a plastic bottle following along. So a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway  but we really talked about marine debris and plastic in the course of that one. The third storyline I did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult. It was on shark finning  and I felt really strongly about this issue. And I felt like  since my main character was a shark  the comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this. Now  finning is the act of taking a shark  cutting the valuable fins off and throwing the live animal back in the water. It's cruel  it's wasteful. There's nothing funny or entertaining about it  but I really wanted to take this issue on. I had to kill my main character  who is a shark. We start with Sherman in a Chinese restaurant  who gets a fortune that he's about to get caught by a trawler  which he does. And then he dies. He gets finned  and then he gets thrown overboard. Ostensibly  he's dead now. And so I killed a character that's been in the newspaper for    years. So I got a lot of reader feedback on that one. Meanwhile  the other characters are talking about shark fin soup. I do three or four strips after that where we explore the finning issue and the shark fin soup issue. Sherman's up in shark heaven. This is what I love about comic strips  you know. You really don't have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief because  if you start with a talking shark  readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door. You can kind of do anything. It becomes a near death experience for Sherman. Meanwhile  Ernest finds his fins on the internet. There was a real website based in China that actually sold shark fins  so I kind of exposed that. And he clicks the  buy now  button. And voila  next day air  they show up  and they surgically reattach them. I ended that series with a kind of a mail in petition that encouraged our National Marine Fishery Service  to force other countries to have a stronger stance with shark management. Thanks. I'd like to end with a little metaphor here. I've been trying to think of a metaphor to represent Mission Blue  and this is what I came up with. Imagine you're in an enormous room  and it's as dark as a cave. And you can have anything in that room  anything you want  but you can't see anything. You've been given one tool  a hammer. So you wander around in the darkness  and you bump into something  and it feels like it's made of stone. It's big  it's heavy. You can't carry it away  so you bang it with your hammer  and you break off a piece. And you take the piece out into the daylight. And you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster. So you say to yourself   Well  that's worth something.  So you go back into the room  and you break this thing to pieces  and you haul it away. And you find other things  and you break that up  and you haul those away. And you're getting all kinds of cool stuff. And you hear other people doing the same thing. So you get this sense of urgency  like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible. And then some yells   Stop   And they turn up the lights. And you realize where you are  you're in the Louvre. And you've taken all this complexity and beauty  and you've turned it into a cheap commodity. And that's what we're doing with the ocean. And part of what Mission Blue is about is yelling   Stop   so that each of us    explorer  scientist  cartoonist  singer  chef    can turn up the lights in their own way. And that's what I hope my comic strip does in a small way. That's why I like what I do. Thanks for listening. So I'm going to talk to you about you about the political chemistry of oil spills and why this is an incredibly important  long  oily  hot summer  and why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted. But before I talk about the political chemistry  I actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil. This is a photograph from when I visited Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in      to watch the Minerals Management Service testing their ability to burn oil spills in ice. And what you see here is  you see a little bit of crude oil  you see some ice cubes  and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm. The napalm is burning there quite nicely. And the thing is  is that oil is really an abstraction for us as the American consumer. We're four percent of the world's population  we use    percent of the world's oil production. And we don't really understand what oil is  until you check out its molecules  And you don't really understand that until you see this stuff burn. So this is what happens as that burn gets going. It takes off. It's a big woosh. I highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday  because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture on the geopolitics of oil again. It'll just bake your retinas. So there it is  the retinas are baking. Let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil. Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules. It starts of with the very small ones  which are one carbon  four hydrogen    that's methane    it just floats off. Then there's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon. You've probably heard of benzene rings  they're very carcinogenic. And it goes all the way over to these big  thick  galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons  and they have thousands of hydrogens  and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them. Those are called the asphaltenes  they're an ingredient in asphalt. They're very important in oil spills. Let me tell you a little bit about the chemistry of oil in water. It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous. Oil doesn't sink  it floats. If it sank  it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill. And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water. It spreads out to be really thin  so you have a hard time corralling it. The next thing that happens is the light ends evaporate  and some of the toxic things float into the water column and kill fish eggs and smaller fish and things like that  and shrimp. And then the asphaltenes    and this is the crucial thing    the asphaltenes get whipped by the waves into a frothy emulsion  something like mayonnaise. It triples the amount of oily  messy goo that you have in the water  and it makes it very hard to handle. It also makes it very viscous. When the Prestige sank off the coast of Spain  there were big  floating cushions the size of sofa cushions of emulsified oil  with the consistency  or the viscosity  of chewing gum. It's incredibly hard to clean up. And every single oil is different when it hits water. When the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics  it's absolutely explosive. For the first time  American consumers will kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves. They have a  eureka   moment  when we suddenly understand oil in a different context. So I'm going to talk just a little bit about the origin of these politics  because it's really crucial to understanding why this summer is so important  why we need to stay focused. Nobody gets up in the morning and thinks   Wow  I'm going to go buy some three carbon to    carbon molecules to put in my tank and drive happily to work.  No  they think   Ugh. I have to go buy gas. I'm so angry about it. The oil companies are ripping me off. They set the prices  and I don't even know. I am helpless over this.  And this is what happens to us at the gas pump    and actually  gas pumps are specifically designed to diffuse that anger. You might notice that many gas pumps  including this one  are designed to look like ATMs. I've talked to engineers. That's specifically to diffuse our anger  because supposedly we feel good about ATMs. That shows you how bad it is. But actually  I mean  this feeling of helplessness comes in because most Americans actually feel that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy  not of the vicissitudes of the world oil market. And the thing is  too  is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume  which is somewhat reasonable  because in fact  we have designed this system where  if you want to get a job  it's much more important to have a car that runs  to have a job and keep a job  than to have a GED. And that's actually very perverse. Now there's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas  which is that we'd rather be doing anything else. This is BP's gas station in downtown Los Angeles. It is green. It is a shrine to greenishness.  Now   you think   why would something so lame work on people so smart   Well  the reason is  is because  when we're buying gas  we're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance. I mean  we're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else. We don't want to be buying oil  we want to be doing something green. And we get kind of in on our own con. I mean    and this is funny  it looks funny here. But in fact  that's why the slogan  beyond petroleum  worked. But it's an inherent part of our energy policy  which is we don't talk about reducing the amount of oil that we use. We talk about energy independence. We talk about hydrogen cars. We talk about biofuels that haven't been invented yet. And so  cognitive dissonance is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil  and it's really important to dealing with this oil spill. Okay  so the politics of oil are very moral in the United States. The oil industry is like a huge  gigantic octopus of engineering and finance and everything else  but we actually see it in very moral terms. This is an early on photograph    you can see  we had these gushers. Early journalists looked at these spills  and they said   This is a filthy industry.  But they also saw in it that people were getting rich for doing nothing. They weren't farmers  they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground. It's the  Beverly Hillbillies   basically. But in the beginning  this was seen as a very morally problematic thing  long before it became funny. And then  of course  there was John D. Rockefeller. And the thing about John D. is that he went into this chaotic wild east of oil industry  and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company  a multinational. It was terrifying  you think Walmart is a terrifying business model now  imagine what this looked like in the     s or     s. And it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy. But what's really amazing is that Ida Tarbell  the journalist  went in and did a big expos  of Rockefeller and actually got the whole antitrust laws put in place. But in many ways  that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us. And here's one of the things that Ida Tarbell said    she said   He has a thin nose like a thorn. There were no lips. There were puffs under the little colorless eyes with creases running from them.  Okay  so that guy is actually still with us. I mean  this is a very pervasive    this is part of our DNA. And then there's this guy  okay. So  you might be wondering why it is that  every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill  we call these CEOs down to Washington  and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them. And this is something that we've been doing since       when we first asked them   Why are there these obscene profits   And we've sort of personalized the whole oil industry into these CEOs. And we take it as  you know    we look at it on a moral level  rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level. And so I'm not saying these guys aren't liable to answer questions    I'm just saying that  when you focus on whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards  you don't actually get around to the point of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate  or you're going to get around to really reducing the amount of oil and reducing our dependence on oil. So I'm saying this is kind of a distraction. But it makes for good theater  and it's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week. So the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing. I mean  these pictures    this is from the Santa Barbara spill. You have these pictures of birds. They really influence people. When the Santa Barbara spill happened in       it formed the environmental movement in its modern form. It started Earth Day. It also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act  the Clean Air Act  the Clean Water Act. Everything that we are really stemmed from this period. I think it's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds and understand what happens to us. Here we are normally  we're standing at the gas pump  and we're feeling kind of helpless. We look at these pictures and we understand  for the first time  our role in this supply chain. We connect the dots in the supply chain. And we have this kind of    as voters  we have kind of a  eureka   moment. This is why these moments of these oil spills are so important. But it's also really important that we don't get distracted by the theater or the morals of it. We actually need to go in and work on the roots of the problem. One of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms. We were very reactive  as opposed to being proactive about what happened. And so what we did was  actually  we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling. We stopped drilling in ANWR  but we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed. In fact  it's continued to increase. The only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices. As you can see  our own production has fallen off as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out. We only have two percent of the world's oil reserves     percent of them are in the Persian Gulf. One of the things that's happened because of this is that  since       the country of Nigeria  or the part of Nigeria that pumps oil  which is the delta    which is two times the size of Maryland    has had thousands of oil spills a year. I mean  we've essentially been exporting oil spills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations. That has been the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill every year since     . And we can wrap our heads around the spills  because that's what we see here  but in fact  these guys actually live in a war zone. There's a thousand battle related deaths a year in this area twice the size of Maryland  and it's all related to the oil. And these guys  I mean  if they were in the U.S.  they might be actually here in this room. They have degrees in political science  degrees in business    they're entrepreneurs. They don't actually want to be doing what they're doing. And it's sort of one of the other groups of people who pay a price for us. The other thing that we've done  as we've continued to increase demand  is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs. One of the places we put in a big oil project in Chad  with Exxon. So the U.S. taxpayer paid for it  the World Bank  Exxon paid for it. We put it in. There was a tremendous banditry problem. I was there in     . We were driving along this dark  dark road  and the guy in the green stepped out  and I was just like   Ahhh  This is it.  And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out  and we realized it was okay. They have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields. But at the same time  Chad has become much more unstable  and we are not paying for that price at the pump. We pay for it in our taxes on April   th. We do the same thing with the price of policing the Persian Gulf and keeping the shipping lanes open. This is         we actually bombed two Iranian oil platforms that year. That was the beginning of an escalating U.S. involvement there that we do not pay for at the pump. We pay for it on April   th  and we can't even calculate the cost of this involvement. The other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil and our increased consumption is the Gulf of Mexico  which was not part of the moratoriums. Now what's happened in the Gulf of Mexico    as you can see  this is the Minerals Management diagram of wells for gas and oil. It's become this intense industrialized zone. It doesn't have the same resonance for us that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has  but it should  I mean  it's a bird sanctuary. Also  every time you buy gasoline in the United States  half of it is actually being refined along the coast  because the Gulf actually has about    percent of our refining capacity and a lot of our marine terminals as well. So the people of the Gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us through a less clean environment. And finally  American families also pay a price for oil. Now on the one hand  the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil  but on the other hand  the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work  generally in a fairly crummy car. If you look at people who make         a year  they have two kids  they might have three jobs or more  and then they have to really commute. They're actually spending more on their car and fuel than they are on taxes or on health care. And the same thing happens at the   th percentile  around       . Gasoline costs are a tremendous drain on the American economy  but they're also a drain on individual families and it's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher. So  what I'm going to talk to you about now is  what do we have to do this time  What are the laws  What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused  One thing is    we need to stay away from the theater. We need to stay away from the moratoriums. We need to focus really back again on the molecules. The moratoriums are fine  but we do need to focus on the molecules on the oil. One of the things that we also need to do  is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves into thinking that you can have a green world  before you reduce the amount of oil that we use. We need to focus on reducing the oil. What you see in this top drawing is a schematic of how petroleum gets used in the U.S. economy. It comes in on the side    the useful stuff is the dark gray  and the un useful stuff  which is called the rejected energy    the waste  goes up to the top. Now you can see that the waste far outweighs the actually useful amount. And one of the things that we need to do is  not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles and make them much more efficient  but we also need to fix the economy in general. We need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel. For example  we have an insurance system where the person who drives        miles a year pays the same insurance as somebody who drives      . We actually encourage people to drive more. We have policies that reward sprawl    we have all kinds of policies. We need to have more mobility choices. We need to make the gas price better reflect the real cost of oil. And we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry  which is at least    billion dollars a year  into something that allows middle class people to find better ways to commute. Whether that's getting a much more efficient car and also kind of building markets for new cars and new fuels down the road  this is where we need to be. We need to kind of rationalize this whole thing  and you can find more about this policy. It's called STRONG  which is  Secure Transportation Reducing Oil Needs Gradually   and the idea is instead of being helpless  we need to be more strong. They're up at NewAmerica.net. What's important about these is that we try to move from feeling helpless at the pump  to actually being active and to really sort of thinking about who we are  having kind of that special moment  where we connect the dots actually at the pump. Now supposedly  oil taxes are the third rail of American politics    the no fly zone. I actually    I agree that a dollar a gallon on oil is probably too much  but I think that if we started this year with three cents a gallon on gasoline  and upped it to six cents next year  nine cents the following year  all the way up to    cents by       that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption  and at the same time we would give people time to prepare  time to respond  and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time. Let me give you a little sense of how this would work. This is a gas receipt  hypothetically  for a year from now. The first thing that you have on the tax is    you have a tax for a stronger America       cents. So you're not helpless at the pump. And the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign  very similar to what you would find on a cigarette pack. And what it says is   The National Academy of Sciences estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car creates    cents in health care costs.  That's a lot. And so this    you can see that you're paying considerably less than the health care costs on the tax. And also  the hope is that you start to be connected to the whole greater system. And at the same time  you have a number that you can call to get more information on commuting  or a low interest loan on a different kind of car  or whatever it is you're going to need to actually reduce your gasoline dependence. With this whole sort of suite of policies  we could actually reduce our gasoline consumption    or our oil consumption    by    percent by     . So  three million barrels a day. But in order to do this  one of the things we really need to do  is we need to remember we are people of the hydrocarbon. We need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get distracted by the theater  not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance of the green possibilities that are out there. We need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules. Thank you. So I work in marketing  which I love  but my first passion was physics  a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher  when I had a little less gray hair. So he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us. And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you that physics can teach us something about marketing. So quick show of hands    who studied some marketing in university  Who studied some physics in university  Pretty good. And at school  Okay  lots of you. So  hopefully this will bring back some happy  or possibly some slightly disturbing memories. So  physics and marketing. We'll start with something very simple    Newton's Law   The force equals mass times acceleration.  This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign. But if we rearrange this formula quickly  we can get to acceleration equals force over mass  which means that for a larger particle    a larger mass    it requires more force to change its direction. It's the same with brands  the more massive a brand  the more baggage it has  the more force is needed to change its positioning. And that's one of the reasons why Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture rather than try to persuade the world that Andersen's could stand for something other than accountancy. It explains why Hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners  and why companies like Unilever and P G keep brands separate  like Ariel and Pringles and Dove rather than having one giant parent brand. So the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object the more force is needed to change its direction. The marketing is  the bigger a brand  the more difficult it is to reposition it. So think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures. Now  who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle  Getting a little more technical now. So this says that it's impossible  by definition  to measure exactly the state    i.e.  the position    and the momentum of a particle  because the act of measuring it  by definition  changes it. So to explain that    if you've got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it  then the photon of light has momentum  which knocks the particle  so you don't know where it was before you looked at it. By measuring it  the act of measurement changes it. The act of observation changes it. It's the same in marketing. So with the act of observing consumers  changes their behavior. Think about the group of moms who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group  and almost none of them buy lots of junk food. And yet  McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year. Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets  who stuff their trolleys full of fresh green vegetables and fruit  but don't shop like that any other day. And if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly look for porn on the Web  it's very few. Yet  at Google  we know it's the number one searched for category. So luckily  the science    no  sorry    the marketing is getting easier. Luckily  with now better point of sale tracking  more digital media consumption  you can measure more what consumers actually do  rather than what they say they do. So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle  because the observation changes it. The marketing is    the message for marketing is    that try to measure what consumers actually do  rather than what they say they'll do or anticipate they'll do. So next  the scientific method    an axiom of physics  of all science    says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation  you can only disprove it. What this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning  and it will strengthen it  but it will not conclusively prove it. And only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water. So if we take an example    Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the Earth. It only took one robust observation from Copernicus to blow that idea out of the water. And there are parallels for marketing    you can invest for a long time in a brand  but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers' belief. Take BP    they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand  but then one little accident. Think about Toyota. It was  for a long time  revered as the most reliable of cars  and then they had the big recall incident. And Tiger Woods  for a long time  the perfect brand ambassador. Well  you know the story. So the physics is that you cannot prove a hypothesis  but it's easy to disprove it    any hypothesis is shaky. And the marketing is that not matter how much you've invested in your brand  one bad week can undermine decades of good work. So be really careful to try and avoid the screw ups that can undermine your brand. And lastly  to the slightly obscure world of entropy    the second law of thermodynamics. This says that entropy  which is a measure of the disorder of a system  will always increase. The same is true of marketing. If we go back    years  the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand. But where we are today  things have changed. You can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the Conservative Party did earlier this year with their election poster. But then you lose control of it. With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer  it's impossible to control where it goes. Your brand starts being dispersed  it gets more chaotic. It's out of your control. I actually saw him speak    he did a good job. But while this may be unsettling for marketers  it's actually a good thing. This distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people  more in with the people. It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force  which is ultimately good for your brand. So  the lesson from physics is that entropy will always increase  it's a fundamental law. The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed. You can't fight it  so embrace it and find a way to work with it. So to close  my teacher  Mr. Vutter  told me that physics is cool  and hopefully  I've convinced you that physics can teach all of us  even in the world of marketing  something special. Thank you. Martin Luther King did not say   I have a nightmare   when he inspired the civil rights movements. He said   I have a dream.  And I have a dream. I have a dream that we can stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare  and this is going to be a challenge  because  if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times  nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic. I think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times   The Road.  It's a beautiful piece of filmmaking  but everything is desolate  everything is dead. And just a father and son trying to survive  walking along the road. And I think the environmental movement of which I am a part of has been complicit in creating this vision of the future. For too long  we have peddled a nightmarish vision of what's going to happen. We have focused on the worst case scenario. We have focused on the problems. And we have not thought enough about the solutions. We've used fear  if you like  to grab people's attention. And any psychologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism. It's part of the fight and flight mechanism  that when an animal is frightened    think of a deer. A deer freezes very  very still  poised to run away. And I think that's what we're doing when we're asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change. People are freezing and running away because we're using fear. And I think the environmental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is. What would it be like to be improving the human lot  And one of the problems that we face  I think  is that the only people that have cornered the market in terms of progress is a financial definition of what progress is  an economic definition of what progress is    that somehow  if we get the right numbers to go up  we're going to be better off  whether that's on the stock market  whether that's with GDP and economic growth  that somehow life is going to get better. This is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear    that more is better. Come on. In the Western world  we have enough. Maybe some parts of the world don't  but we have enough. And we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations. In fact  the architect of our national accounting system  Simon Kuznets  in the     s  said that   A nation's welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income.  But we've created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff. And indeed  this is probably historical  and it had its time. In the second World War  we needed to produce a lot of stuff. And indeed  we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff that we destroyed a lot of Europe  and we had to rebuild it afterwards. And so our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce. But as early as       this visionary man  Robert Kennedy  at the start of his ill fated presidential campaign  gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been. And he finished his talk with the phrase  that   The gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile.  How crazy is that  That our measure of progress  our dominant measure of progress in society  is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile  I believe  if Kennedy was alive today  he would be asking statisticians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile. He'd be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice  sustainability and people's well being. And actually  social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world. This is from a global survey. It's asking people  what do they want. And unsurprisingly  people all around the world say that what they want is happiness  for themselves  for their families  their children  their communities. Okay  they think money is slightly important. It's there  but it's not nearly as important as happiness  and it's not nearly as important as love. We all need to love and be loved in life. It's not nearly as important as health. We want to be healthy and live a full life. These seem to be natural human aspirations. Why are statisticians not measuring these  Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms  instead of just how much stuff we have  And really  this is what I've done with my adult life    is think about how do we measure happiness  how do we measure well being  how can we do that within environmental limits. And we created  at the organization that I work for  the New Economics Foundation  something we call the Happy Planet Index  because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy. Why don't we create a measure of progress that shows that  And what we do  is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens. That should be the goal of every nation on the planet. But we have to remember that there's a fundamental input to that  and that is how many of the planet's resources we use. We all have one planet. We all have to share it. It is the ultimate scarce resource  the one planet that we share. And economics is very interested in scarcity. When it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome  it thinks in terms of efficiency. It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck. And this is a measure of how much well being we get for our planetary resource use. It is an efficiency measure. And probably the easiest way to show you that  is to show you this graph. Running horizontally along the graph  is  ecological footprint   which is a measure of how much resources we use and how much pressure we put on the planet. More is bad. Running vertically upwards  is a measure called  happy life years.  It's about the well being of nations. It's like a happiness adjusted life expectancy. It's like quality and quantity of life in nations. And the yellow dot there you see  is the global average. Now  there's a huge array of nations around that global average. To the top right of the graph  are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well being  but they're using a lot of planet to get there. They are the U.S.A.  other Western countries going across in those triangles and a few Gulf states in there actually. Conversely  at the bottom left of the graph  are countries that are not producing much well being    typically  sub Saharan Africa. In Hobbesian terms  life is short and brutish there. The average life expectancy in many of these countries is only    years. Malaria  HIV AIDS are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world. But now for the good news  There are some countries up there  yellow triangles  that are doing better than global average  that are heading up towards the top left of the graph. This is an aspirational graph. We want to be top left  where good lives don't cost the earth. They're Latin American. The country on its own up at the top is a place I haven't been to. Maybe some of you have. Costa Rica. Costa Rica    average life expectancy is    and a half years. That is longer than in the USA. They are  according to the latest Gallup world poll  the happiest nation on the planet    than anybody  more than Switzerland and Denmark. They are the happiest place. They are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in  the  Western world    a quarter of the resources. What's going on there  What's happening in Costa Rica  We can look at some of the data.    percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources. Their government is one of the first to commit to be carbon neutral by     . They abolished the army in             . And they invested in social programs    health and education. They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America and in the world. And they have that Latin vibe  don't they. They have the social connectedness. The challenge is  that possibly    and the thing we might have to think about    is that the future might not be North American  might not be Western European. It might be Latin American. And the challenge  really  is to pull the global average up here. That's what we need to do. And if we're going to do that  we need to pull countries from the bottom  and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph. And then we're starting to create a happy planet. That's one way of looking at it. Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends. We don't have good data going back for every country in the world  but for some of the richest countries  the OECD group  we do. And this is the trend in well being over that time  a small increase  but this is the trend in ecological footprint. And so in strict happy planet methodology  we've become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to. And the point really is  is that I think  probably everybody in this room would like society to get to      without an apocalyptic something happening. It's actually not very long away. It's half a human lifetime away. A child entering school today will be my age in     . This is not the very distant future. This is what the U.K. government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like. And I put it to you  that is not business as usual. That is changing our business. That is changing the way we create our organizations  we do our government policy and we live our lives. And the point is  we need to carry on increasing well being. No one can go to the polls and say that quality of life is going to reduce. None of us  I think  want human progress to stop. I think we want it to carry on. I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing. And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in. I think this is what they want. They want quality of life to keep increasing. They want to hold on to what they've got. And if we're going to engage them  I think that's what we've got to do. And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more. Now that's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that  but the point is we need to turn those curves. And this is where I think we can take a leaf out of systems theory  systems engineers  where they create feedback loops  put the right information at the right point of time. Human beings are very motivated by the  now.  You put a smart meter in your home  and you see how much electricity you're using right now  how much it's costing you  your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly. What would that look like for society  Why is it  on the radio news every evening  I hear the FTSE      the Dow Jones  the dollar pound ratio    I don't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news. And why do I hear that  Why don't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday  or American used yesterday  Did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions  That's how you create a collective goal. You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it. And we need positive feedback loops for increasing well being At a government level  they might create national accounts of well being. At a business level  you might look at the well being of your employees  which we know is really linked to creativity  which is linked to innovation  and we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues. At a personal level  we need these nudges too. Maybe we don't quite need the data  but we need reminders. In the U.K.  we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do    never my best thing. What are these for happiness  What are the five things that you should do every day to be happier  We did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago  a big program called the Foresight program    lots and lots of people    involved lots of experts    everything evidence based    a huge tome. But a piece of work we did was on  what five positive actions can you do to improve well being in your life  And the point of these is they are  not quite  the secrets of happiness  but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from. And the first of these is to connect  is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life. Do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do  and energy  Keep building them. The second one is be active. The fastest way out of a bad mood  step outside  go for a walk  turn the radio on and dance. Being active is great for our positive mood. The third one is take notice. How aware are you of things going on around the world  the seasons changing  people around you  Do you notice what's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge  Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness  cognitive behavioral therapy   very  strong for our well being. The fourth is keep learning and keep is important    learning throughout the whole life course. Older people who keep learning and are curious  they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down. But it doesn't have to be formal learning  it's not knowledge based. It's more curiosity. It can be learning to cook a new dish  picking up an instrument you forgot as a child. Keep learning. And the final one is that most anti economic of activities  but give. Our generosity  our altruism  our compassion  are all hardwired to the reward mechanism in our brain. We feel good if we give. You can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning. You tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people. You measure their happiness at the end of the day  those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier that those that spent it on themselves. And these five ways  which we put onto these handy postcards  I would say  don't have to cost the earth. They don't have any carbon content. They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied. And so I think it's really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth. Now  Martin Luther King  on the eve of his death  gave an incredible speech. He said   I know there are challenges ahead  there may be trouble ahead  but I fear no one. I don't care. I have been to the mountain top  and I have seen the Promised Land.  Now  he was a preacher  but I believe the environmental movement and  in fact  the business community  government  needs to go to the top of the mountain top  and it needs to look out  and it needs to see the Promised Land  or the land of promise  and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want. And not only that  we need to create a Great Transition to get there  and we need to pave that great transition with good things. Human beings want to be happy. Pave them with the five ways. And we need to have signposts gathering people together and pointing them    something like the Happy Planet Index. And then I believe that we can all create a world we all want  where happiness does not cost the earth. We live on a human dominated planet  putting unprecedented pressure on the systems on Earth. This is bad news  but perhaps surprising to you  it's also part of the good news. We're the first generation    thanks to science    to be informed that we may be undermining the stability and the ability of planet Earth to support human development as we know it. It's also good news  because the planetary risks we're facing are so large  that business as usual is not an option. In fact  we're in a phase where transformative change is necessary  which opens the window for innovation  for new ideas and new paradigms. This is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability. On this journey  I'd like to bring  apart from yourselves  a good friend  a stakeholder  who's always absent when we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues  a stakeholder who refuses to compromise    planet Earth. So I thought I'd bring her with me today on stage  to have her as a witness of a remarkable journey  which humbly reminds us of the period of grace we've had over the past        years. This is the living conditions on the planet over the last         years. It's a very important period    it's roughly half the period when we've been fully modern humans on the planet. We've had the same  roughly  abilities that developed civilizations as we know it. This is the environmental conditions on the planet. Here  used as a proxy  temperature variability. It was a jumpy ride.        years back in a crisis  we leave Africa  we colonize Australia in another crisis         years back  we leave Asia for Europe in another crisis         years back  and then we enter the remarkably stable Holocene phase  the only period in the whole history of the planet  that we know of  that can support human development. A thousand years into this period  we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns. We go from a couple of million people to the seven billion people we are today. The Mesopotamian culture  we invent agriculture  we domesticate animals and plants. You have the Roman  the Greek and the story as you know it. The only phase  as we know it that can support humanity. The trouble is we're putting a quadruple sqeeze on this poor planet  a quadruple sqeeze  which  as its first squeeze  has population growth of course. Now  this is not only about numbers  this is not only about the fact that we're seven billion people committed to nine billion people  it's an equity issue as well. The majority of the environmental impacts on the planet have been caused by the rich minority  the    percent that jumped onto the industrial bandwagon in the mid   th century. The majority of the planet  aspiring for development  having the right for development  are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle  a momentous pressure. The second pressure on the planet is  of course the climate agenda    the big issue    where the policy interpretation of science is that it would be enough to stabilize greenhouse gases at     ppm to avoid average temperatures exceeding two degrees  to avoid the risk that we may be destabilizing the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  holding six meters    level rising  the risk of destabilizing the Greenland Ice Sheet  holding another seven meters    sea level rising. Now  you would have wished the climate pressure to hit a strong planet  a resilient planet  but unfortunately  the third pressure is the ecosystem decline. Never have we seen  in the past    years  such a sharp decline of ecosystem functions and services on the planet  one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term  in our forests  land and biodiversity. The forth pressure is surprise  the notion and the evidence that we need to abandon our old paradigm  that ecosystems behave linearly  predictably  controllably in our    so to say    linear systems  and that in fact  surprise is universal  as systems tip over very rapidly  abruptly and often irreversibly. This  dear friends  poses a human pressure on the planet of momentous scale. We may  in fact  have entered a new geological era    the Anthropocene  where humans are the predominant driver of change at a planetary level. Now  as a scientist  what's the evidence for this  Well  the evidence is  unfortunately  ample. It's not only carbon dioxide that has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change. You can take virtually any parameter that matters for human well being    nitrous oxide  methane  deforestation  overfishing land degredation  loss of species    they all show the same pattern over the past     years. Simultaneously  they branch off in the mid   s     years after the Second World War  showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise starts in the mid   s. You see  for the first time  an imprint on the global level. And I can tell you  you enter the disciplinary research in each of these  you find something remarkably important  the conclusion that we may have come to the point where we have to bend the curves  that we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade in the history humanity on the planet  the decade when we have to bend the curves. Now  as if this was not enough    to just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet    we also have to recognize the fact that systems do have multiple stable states  separated by thresholds    illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram  where the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system. Now  the system may gradually    under pressure of climate change  erosion  biodiversity loss    lose the depth of the cup  the resilience  but appear to be healthy and appear to suddenly  under a threshold  be tipping over. Upff. Sorry. Changing state and literally ending up in an undesired situation  where new biophysical logic takes over  new species take over  and the system gets locked. Do we have evidence of this  Yes  coral reef systems. Biodiverse  low nutrient  hard coral systems under multiple pressures of overfishing  unsustainable tourism  climate change. A trigger and the system tips over  loses its resilience  soft corals take over  and we get undesired systems that cannot support economic and social development. The Arctic    a beautiful system    a regulating biome at the planetary level  taking the knock after knock on climate change  appearing to be in a good state. No scientist could predict that in       suddenly  what could be crossing a threshold. The system suddenly  very surprisingly  loses    to    percent of its summer ice cover. And the drama is  of course  that when the system does this  the logic may change. It may get locked in an undesired state  because it changes color  absorbs more energy  and the system may get stuck. In my mind  the largest red flag warning for humanity that we are in a precarious situation. As a sideline  you know that the only red flag that popped up here was a submarine from an unnamed country that planted a red flag at the bottom of the Arctic to be able to control the oil resources. Now  if we have evidence  which we now have  that wetlands  forests   unclear  monsoon system  the rainforests  behave in this nonlinear way.    or so scientists around the world gathered and asked a question for the first time   Do we have to put the planet into the the pot   So we have to ask ourselves  are we threatening this extraordinarily stable Holocene state  Are we in fact putting ourselves in a situation where we're coming too close to thresholds that could lead to deleterious and very undesired  if now catastrophic  change for human development  You know  you don't want to stand there. In fact  you're not even allowed to stand where this gentleman is standing  at the foaming  slippery waters at the threshold. In fact  there's a fence quite upstream of this threshold  beyond which you are in a danger zone. And this is the new paradigm  which we gathered two  three years back  recognizing that our old paradigm of just analyzing and pushing and predicting parameters into the future  aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts  is of the past. Now we to ask ourselves  which are the large environmental processes that we have to be stewards of to keep ourselves safe in the Holocene  And could we even  thanks to major advancements in Earth systems science  identify the thresholds  the points where we may expect nonlinear change  And could we even define a planetary boundary  a fence  within which we then have a safe operating space for humanity  This work  which was published in  Nature   late       after a number of years of analysis  led to the final proposition that we can only find nine planetary boundaries with which  under active stewardship  would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space. These include  of course  climate. It may surprise you that it's not only climate. But it shows that we are interconnected  among many systems on the planet  with the three big systems  climate change  stratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification being the three big systems  where the scientific evidence of large scale thresholds in the paleo record of the history of the planet. But we also include  what we call  the slow variables  the systems that  under the hood  regulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet    the interference of the big nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on the planet  land use change  rate of biodiversity loss  freshwater use  functions which regulate biomass on the planet  carbon sequestration  diversity. And then we have two parameters which we were not able to quantify    air pollution  including warming gases and air polluting sulfates and nitrates  but also chemical pollution. Together  these form an integrated whole for guiding human development in the Anthropocene  understanding that the planet is a complex self regulating system. In fact  most evidence indicates that these nine may behave as three Musketeers   One for all. All for one.  You degrade forests  you go beyond the boundary on land  you undermine the ability of the climate system to stay stable. The drama here is  in fact  that it may show that the climate challenge is the easy one  if you consider the whole challenge of sustainable development. Now this is the Big Bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries. What you see here in black line is the safe operating space  the quantified boundaries  as suggested by this analysis. The yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point  the pre industrial point  where we're very safely in the safe operating space. In the '  s  we start branching out. In the '  s already  through the green revolution and the Haber Bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere    you know  human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole. We don't transgress the climate boundary until the early '  s  actually  right after Rio. And today  we are in a situation where we estimate that we've transgressed three boundaries  the rate of biodiversity loss  which is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity    one of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs    nitrogen and climate change. But we still have some degrees of freedom on the others  but we are approaching fast on land  water  phosphorus and oceans. But this gives a new paradigm to guide humanity  to put the light on our  so far overpowered industrial vehicle  which operates as if we're only on a dark  straight highway. Now the question then is  how gloomy is this  Is then sustainable development utopia  Well  there's no science to suggest. In fact  there is ample science to indicate that we can do this transformative change  that we have the ability to now move into a new innovative  a transformative gear  across scales. The drama is  of course  is that     countries on this planet have to simultaneously start moving in the same direction. But it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm  from the current linear  command and control thinking  looking at efficiencies and optimization towards a much more flexible  a much more adaptive approach  where we recognize that redundancy  both in social and environmental systems  is key to be able to deal with a turbulent era of global change. We have to invest in persistence  in the ability of social systems and ecological systems to withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup. We have to invest in transformations capability  moving from crisis into innovation and the ability to rise after a crisis  and of course to adapt to unavoidable change. This is a new paradigm. We're not doing that at any scale on governance. But is it happening anywhere  Do we have any examples of success on this mind shift being applied at the local level  Well  yes  in fact we do and the list can start becoming longer and longer. There's good news here  for example  from Latin America  where plow based farming systems of the '  s and '  s led farming basically to a dead end  with lower and lower yields  degrading the organic matter and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels in Paraguay  Uruguay and a number of countries  Brazil  leading to innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in partnership with scientists into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems combined with mulch farming with locally adapted technologies  which today  for example  in some countries  have led to a tremendous increase in area under mulch  zero till farming which  not only produces more food  but also sequesters carbon. The Australian Great Barrier Reef is another success story. Under the realization from tourist operators  fishermen  the Australian Great Barrier Reef Authority and scientists that the Great Barrier Reef is doomed under the current governance regime. Global change  beautification rack culture  overfishing and unsustainable tourism  all together placing this system in the realization of crisis. But the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset  which today has led to a completely new governance strategy to build resilience  acknowledge redundancy and invest in the whole system as an integrated whole  and then allow for much more redundancy in the system. Sweden  the country I come from  has other examples  where wetlands in southern Sweden were seen as    as in many countries    as flood prone polluted nuisance in the peri urban regions. But again  a crisis  new partnerships  actors locally  transforming these into a key component of sustainable urban planning. So crisis leading into opportunities. Now  what about the future  Well  the future  of course  has one massive challenge  which is feeding a world of nine billion people. We need nothing less than a new green revolution  and the planet boundaries shows that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink. It has to basically do this on current land. We cannot expand anymore  because it erodes the planetary boundaries. We cannot continue consuming water as we do today  with    percent of world rivers not even reaching the ocean. And we need a transformation. Well  interestingly  and based on my work and others in Africa  for example  we've shown that even the most vulnerable small scale rainfall farming systems  with innovations and supplementary irrigation to bridge dry spells and droughts  sustainable sanitation systems to close the loop on nutrients from toilets back to farmers' fields  and innovations in tillage systems  we can triple  quadruple  yield levels on current land. Elinor Ostrom  the latest Nobel laureate of economics  clearly shows empirically across the world that we can govern the commons if we invest in trust  local  action based partnerships and cross scale institutional innovations  where local actors  together  can deal with the global commons at a large scale. But even on the hard policy area we have innovations. We know that we have to move from our fossil dependence very quickly into a low carbon economy in record time. And what shall we do  Everybody talks about carbon taxes    it won't work    emission schemes  but for example  one policy measure  feed in tariffs on the energy system  which is already applied  from China doing it on offshore wind systems  all the way to the U.S. where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy  but you can subsidize electricity to poor people. You get people out of poverty. You solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector  while at the same time  stimulating innovation    examples of things that can be out scaled quickly at the planetary level. So there is    no doubt    opportunity here  and we can list many  many examples of transformative opportunities around the planet. The key though in all of these  the red thread  is the shift in mindset  moving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves into a dark future  where we instead backcast our future  and we say   What is the playing field on the planet  What are the planetary boundaries within which we can safely operate   and then backtrack innovations within that. But of course  the drama is  it clearly shows that incremental change is not an option. So  there is scientific evidence. They sort of say the harsh news  that we are facing the largest transformative development since the industrialization. In fact  what we have to do over the next    years is much more dramatic and more exciting than what we did when we moved into the situation we're in today. Now  science indicates that  yes  we can achieve a prosperous future within the safe operating space  if we move simultaneously  collaborating on a global level  from local to global scale  in transformative options  which build resilience on a finite planet. Thank you.
