I'm Michael Shermer  director of the Skeptics Society  publisher of  Skeptic  magazine. We investigate claims of the paranormal  pseudo science  fringe groups and cults  and claims of all kinds between  science and pseudo science and non science and junk science  voodoo science  pathological science  bad science  non science  and plain old non sense. And unless you've been on Mars recently  you know there's a lot of that out there. Some people call us debunkers  which is kind of a negative term. But let's face it  there's a lot of bunk. We are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there    well  we're sort of like the Ralph Naders of bad ideas  trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas. I'll show you an example of a bad idea. I brought this with me  this was given to us by NBC Dateline to test. It's produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia. It's called the Quadro      Dowser Rod. This was being sold to high school administrators for      apiece. It's a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it. You could dowse for all sorts of things  but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers. So the way it works is you go down the hallway  and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker  and then you open the locker. So it looks something like this. I'll show you. Well  it has kind of a right leaning bias. Well  this is science  so we'll do a controlled experiment. It'll go this way for sure. Sir  do you want to empty your pockets  please  sir  So the question was  can it actually find marijuana in students' lockers  And the answer is  if you open enough of them  yes. But in science  we have to keep track of the misses  not just the hits. And that's probably the key lesson to my short talk here  This is how psychics work  astrologers  tarot card readers and so on. People remember the hits and forget the misses. In science  we keep the whole database  and look to see if the number of hits somehow stands out from the total number you'd expect by chance. In this case  we tested it. We had two opaque boxes  one with government approved THC marijuana  and one with nothing. And it got it    percent of the time    which is exactly what you'd expect with a coin flip model. So that's just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do.  Skeptic  is the quarterly publication. Each one has a particular theme. This one is on the future of intelligence. Are people getting smarter or dumber  I have an opinion of this myself because of the business I'm in  but in fact  people  it turns out  are getting smarter. Three IQ points per    years  going up. Sort of an interesting thing. With science  don't think of skepticism as a thing  or science as a thing. Are science and religion compatible  It's like  are science and plumbing compatible  They're just two different things. Science is not a thing. It's a verb. It's a way of thinking about things. It's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena. I mean  what's more likely  that extraterrestrial intelligences or multi dimensional beings travel across vast distances of interstellar space to leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob's field in Puckerbrush  Kansas to promote skeptic.com  our web page  Or is it more likely that a reader of  Skeptic  did this with Photoshop  And in all cases we have to ask    What's the more likely explanation  Before we say something is out of this world  we should first make sure that it's not in this world. What's more likely  that Arnold had extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship  or that the  World Weekly News  makes stuff up  The same theme is expressed nicely here in this Sidney Harris cartoon. For those of you in the back  it says here   Then a miracle occurs. I think you need to be more explicit here in step two.  This single slide completely dismantles the intelligent design arguments. There's nothing more to it than that. You can say a miracle occurs  it's just that it doesn't explain anything or offer anything. There's nothing to test. It's the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationists. And it's true  scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers    dark energy or dark matter  something like that    until we figure out what it is  we'll call it this. It's the beginning of the causal chain for science. For intelligent design creationists  it's the end of the chain. So again  we can ask this  what's more likely  Are UFOs alien spaceships  or perceptual cognitive mistakes  or even fakes  This is a UFO shot from my house in Altadena  California  looking down over Pasadena. And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap  it's because it is. You don't even need Photoshop or high tech equipment  you don't need computers. This was shot with a throwaway Kodak Instamatic camera. You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go. Camera's ready    that's it. So  although it's possible that most of these things are fake or illusions or so on  and that some of them are real  it's more likely that all of them are fake  like the crop circles. On a more serious note  in all of science we're looking for a balance between data and theory. In the case of Galileo  he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn. First of all  there was no theory of planetary rings. Second of all  his data was grainy and fuzzy  and he couldn't quite make out what he was looking at. So he wrote that he had seen     I have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies.  And this is what he ended up concluding that he saw. So without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data  you can't have a good theory. It wasn't solved until     . This is Christiaan Huygens's book that catalogs all the mistakes people made trying to figure out what was going on with Saturn. It wasn't till Huygens had two things  He had a good theory of planetary rings and how the solar system operated  and he had better telescopic  more fine grain data in which he could figure out that as the Earth is going around faster    according to Kepler's Laws    than Saturn  then we catch up with it. And we see the angles of the rings at different angles  there. And that  in fact  turns out to be true. The problem with having a theory is that it may be loaded with cognitive biases. So one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things is that we have things  on a simple level  and then I'll go to more serious ones. Like  we have a tendency to see faces. This is the face on Mars. In       where there was a whole movement to get NASA to photograph that area because people thought this was monumental architecture made by Martians. Here's the close up of it from     . If you squint  you can still see the face. And when you're squinting  you're turning that from fine grain to coarse grain  so you're reducing the quality of your data. And if I didn't tell you what to look for  you'd still see the face  because we're programmed by evolution to see faces. Faces are important for us socially. And of course  happy faces  faces of all kinds are easy to see. You see the happy face on Mars  there. If astronomers were frogs  perhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog. Do you see him there  Little froggy legs. Or if geologists were elephants  Religious iconography. Discovered by a Tennessee baker in     . He charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun till he got a cease and desist from Mother Teresa's lawyer. Here's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Watsonville  just down the street  or is it up the street from here  Tree bark is particularly good because it's nice and grainy  branchy  black and white splotchy and you can get the pattern seeking    humans are pattern seeking animals. Here's the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo. Here's when the Virgin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich    which I got to actually hold in a Las Vegas casino    of course  this being America. This casino paid         on eBay for the cheese sandwich. But who does it really look like  The Virgin Mary  It has that sort of puckered lips      s era look. Virgin Mary in Clearwater  Florida. I actually went to see this one. There was a lot of people there. The faithful come in their wheelchairs and crutches  and so on. We went down and investigated. Just to give you a size  that's Dawkins  me and The Amazing Randi  next to this two  two and a half story sized image. All these candles  thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this. So we walked around the backside  to see what was going on. It turns out wherever there's a sprinkler head and a palm tree  you get the effect. Here's the Virgin Mary on the backside  which they started to wipe off. I guess you can only have one miracle per building. So is it really a miracle of Mary  or is it a miracle of Marge  And now I'm going to finish up with another example of this  with auditory illusions. There's this film   White Noise   with Michael Keaton  about the dead talking back to us. By the way  the whole business of talking to the dead is not that big a deal. Anybody can do it  turns out. It's getting the dead to talk back that's the really hard part. In this case  supposedly  these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena. There's a ReverseSpeech.com web page where I downloaded this stuff. This is the most famous one of all of these. Here's the forward version of the very famous song. If there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now. It's just a spring clean for the May Queen. Yes  there are two paths you can go by  but in the long run  There's still time to change the road you're on. Couldn't you just listen to that all day  All right  here it is backwards  and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there. What did you get  Audience  Satan  Satan. OK  at least we got  Satan . Now  I'll prime the auditory part of your brain to tell you what you're supposed to hear  and then hear it again. You can't miss it when I tell you what's there. I'm going to just end with a positive  nice little story. The Skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization. We're always looking for little good things that people do. And in England  there's a pop singer. One of the top popular singers in England today  Katie Melua. And she wrote a beautiful song. It was in the top five in       called   Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing.  It's a love story    she's sort of the Norah Jones of the UK    about how she much loves her guy  and compared to nine million bicycles  and so forth. And she has this one passage here. That's a guess  No one can ever say it's true  But I know that I will always be with you. Michael Shermer  Well  that's nice. At least she got it close. In America it'd be   We're       light years from the edge.  But my friend  Simon Singh  the particle physicist now turned science educator  who wrote the book  The Big Bang   and so on  uses every chance he gets to promote good science. And so he wrote an op ed piece in  The Guardian  about Katie's song  in which he said  well  we know exactly how far from the edge. You know  it's   .  billion light years  and it's not a guess. We know within precise error bars how close it is. So we can say  although not absolutely true  it's pretty close to being true. And  to his credit  Katie called him up after this op ed piece came out  and said   I'm so embarrassed. I was in the astronomy club. I should've known better.  And she re cut the song. So I will end with the new version. We are   .  billion light years from the edge of the observable universe. That's a good estimate with well defined error bars. And with the available information  I predict that I will always be with you. How cool is that  As other speakers have said  it's a rather daunting experience    a particularly daunting experience    to be speaking in front of this audience. But unlike the other speakers  I'm not going to tell you about the mysteries of the universe  or the wonders of evolution  or the really clever  innovative ways people are attacking the major inequalities in our world. Or even the challenges of nation states in the modern global economy. My brief  as you've just heard  is to tell you about statistics    and  to be more precise  to tell you some exciting things about statistics. And that's       that's rather more challenging than all the speakers before me and all the ones coming after me. One of my senior colleagues told me  when I was a youngster in this profession  rather proudly  that statisticians were people who liked figures but didn't have the personality skills to become accountants. And there's another in joke among statisticians  and that's   How do you tell the introverted statistician from the extroverted statistician   To which the answer is   The extroverted statistician's the one who looks at the other person's shoes.  But I want to tell you something useful    and here it is  so concentrate now. This evening  there's a reception in the University's Museum of Natural History. And it's a wonderful setting  as I hope you'll find  and a great icon to the best of the Victorian tradition. It's very unlikely    in this special setting  and this collection of people    but you might just find yourself talking to someone you'd rather wish that you weren't. So here's what you do. When they say to you   What do you do      you say   I'm a statistician.  Well  except they've been pre warned now  and they'll know you're making it up. And then one of two things will happen. They'll either discover their long lost cousin in the other corner of the room and run over and talk to them. Or they'll suddenly become parched and or hungry    and often both    and sprint off for a drink and some food. And you'll be left in peace to talk to the person you really want to talk to. It's one of the challenges in our profession to try and explain what we do. We're not top on people's lists for dinner party guests and conversations and so on. And it's something I've never really found a good way of doing. But my wife    who was then my girlfriend    managed it much better than I've ever been able to. Many years ago  when we first started going out  she was working for the BBC in Britain  and I was  at that stage  working in America. I was coming back to visit her. She told this to one of her colleagues  who said   Well  what does your boyfriend do   Sarah thought quite hard about the things I'd explained    and she concentrated  in those days  on listening. Don't tell her I said that. And she was thinking about the work I did developing mathematical models for understanding evolution and modern genetics. So when her colleague said   What does he do   She paused and said   He models things.  Well  her colleague suddenly got much more interested than I had any right to expect and went on and said   What does he model   Well  Sarah thought a little bit more about my work and said   Genes.   He models genes.  That is my first love  and that's what I'll tell you a little bit about. What I want to do more generally is to get you thinking about the place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in our world  and how we react to that  and how well we do or don't think about it. So you've had a pretty easy time up till now    a few laughs  and all that kind of thing    in the talks to date. You've got to think  and I'm going to ask you some questions. So here's the scene for the first question I'm going to ask you. Can you imagine tossing a coin successively  And for some reason    which shall remain rather vague    we're interested in a particular pattern. Here's one    a head  followed by a tail  followed by a tail. So suppose we toss a coin repeatedly. Then the pattern  head tail tail  that we've suddenly become fixated with happens here. And you can count  one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine        it happens after the   th toss. So you might think there are more interesting things to do  but humor me for the moment. Imagine this half of the audience each get out coins  and they toss them until they first see the pattern head tail tail. The first time they do it  maybe it happens after the   th toss  as here. The second time  maybe it's after the fourth toss. The next time  after the   th toss. So you do that lots and lots of times  and you average those numbers. That's what I want this side to think about. The other half of the audience doesn't like head tail tail    they think  for deep cultural reasons  that's boring    and they're much more interested in a different pattern    head tail head. So  on this side  you get out your coins  and you toss and toss and toss. And you count the number of times until the pattern head tail head appears and you average them. OK  So on this side  you've got a number    you've done it lots of times  so you get it accurately    which is the average number of tosses until head tail tail. On this side  you've got a number    the average number of tosses until head tail head. So here's a deep mathematical fact    if you've got two numbers  one of three things must be true. Either they're the same  or this one's bigger than this one  or this one's bigger than that one. So what's going on here  So you've all got to think about this  and you've all got to vote    and we're not moving on. And I don't want to end up in the two minute silence to give you more time to think about it  until everyone's expressed a view. OK. So what you want to do is compare the average number of tosses until we first see head tail head with the average number of tosses until we first see head tail tail. Who thinks that A is true    that  on average  it'll take longer to see head tail head than head tail tail  Who thinks that B is true    that on average  they're the same  Who thinks that C is true    that  on average  it'll take less time to see head tail head than head tail tail  OK  who hasn't voted yet  Because that's really naughty    I said you had to. OK. So most people think B is true. And you might be relieved to know even rather distinguished mathematicians think that. It's not. A is true here. It takes longer  on average. In fact  the average number of tosses till head tail head is    and the average number of tosses until head tail tail is eight. How could that be  Anything different about the two patterns  There is. Head tail head overlaps itself. If you went head tail head tail head  you can cunningly get two occurrences of the pattern in only five tosses. You can't do that with head tail tail. That turns out to be important. There are two ways of thinking about this. I'll give you one of them. So imagine    let's suppose we're doing it. On this side    remember  you're excited about head tail tail  you're excited about head tail head. We start tossing a coin  and we get a head    and you start sitting on the edge of your seat because something great and wonderful  or awesome  might be about to happen. The next toss is a tail    you get really excited. The champagne's on ice just next to you  you've got the glasses chilled to celebrate. You're waiting with bated breath for the final toss. And if it comes down a head  that's great. You're done  and you celebrate. If it's a tail    well  rather disappointedly  you put the glasses away and put the champagne back. And you keep tossing  to wait for the next head  to get excited. On this side  there's a different experience. It's the same for the first two parts of the sequence. You're a little bit excited with the first head    you get rather more excited with the next tail. Then you toss the coin. If it's a tail  you crack open the champagne. If it's a head you're disappointed  but you're still a third of the way to your pattern again. And that's an informal way of presenting it    that's why there's a difference. Another way of thinking about it    if we tossed a coin eight million times  then we'd expect a million head tail heads and a million head tail tails    but the head tail heads could occur in clumps. So if you want to put a million things down amongst eight million positions and you can have some of them overlapping  the clumps will be further apart. It's another way of getting the intuition. What's the point I want to make  It's a very  very simple example  an easily stated question in probability  which every    you're in good company    everybody gets wrong. This is my little diversion into my real passion  which is genetics. There's a connection between head tail heads and head tail tails in genetics  and it's the following. When you toss a coin  you get a sequence of heads and tails. When you look at DNA  there's a sequence of not two things    heads and tails    but four letters    As  Gs  Cs and Ts. And there are little chemical scissors  called restriction enzymes which cut DNA whenever they see particular patterns. And they're an enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology. And instead of asking the question   How long until I see a head tail head      you can ask   How big will the chunks be when I use a restriction enzyme which cuts whenever it sees G A A G  for example  How long will those chunks be   That's a rather trivial connection between probability and genetics. There's a much deeper connection  which I don't have time to go into and that is that modern genetics is a really exciting area of science. And we'll hear some talks later in the conference specifically about that. But it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies  a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated    you'll be relieved to know that I do something useful in my day job  rather more sophisticated than the head tail head story    but quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings and modern statistical techniques. And I will give you two little snippets    two examples    of projects we're involved in in my group in Oxford  both of which I think are rather exciting. You know about the Human Genome Project. That was a project which aimed to read one copy of the human genome. The natural thing to do after you've done that    and that's what this project  the International HapMap Project  which is a collaboration between labs in five or six different countries. Think of the Human Genome Project as learning what we've got in common  and the HapMap Project is trying to understand where there are differences between different people. Why do we care about that  Well  there are lots of reasons. The most pressing one is that we want to understand how some differences make some people susceptible to one disease    type   diabetes  for example    and other differences make people more susceptible to heart disease  or stroke  or autism and so on. That's one big project. There's a second big project  recently funded by the Wellcome Trust in this country  involving very large studies    thousands of individuals  with each of eight different diseases  common diseases like type   and type   diabetes  and coronary heart disease  bipolar disease and so on    to try and understand the genetics. To try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases. Why do we want to do that  Because we understand very little about most human diseases. We don't know what causes them. And if we can get in at the bottom and understand the genetics  we'll have a window on the way the disease works  and a whole new way about thinking about disease therapies and preventative treatment and so on. So that's  as I said  the little diversion on my main love. Back to some of the more mundane issues of thinking about uncertainty. Here's another quiz for you    now suppose we've got a test for a disease which isn't infallible  but it's pretty good. It gets it right    percent of the time. And I take one of you  or I take someone off the street  and I test them for the disease in question. Let's suppose there's a test for HIV    the virus that causes AIDS    and the test says the person has the disease. What's the chance that they do  The test gets it right    percent of the time. So a natural answer is    percent. Who likes that answer  Come on    everyone's got to get involved. Don't think you don't trust me anymore. Well  you're right to be a bit skeptical  because that's not the answer. That's what you might think. It's not the answer  and it's not because it's only part of the story. It actually depends on how common or how rare the disease is. So let me try and illustrate that. Here's a little caricature of a million individuals. So let's think about a disease that affects    it's pretty rare  it affects one person in       . Amongst these million individuals  most of them are healthy and some of them will have the disease. And in fact  if this is the prevalence of the disease  about     will have the disease and the rest won't. So now suppose we test them all. What happens  Well  amongst the     who do have the disease  the test will get it right    percent of the time  and    will test positive. Amongst all these other people who don't have the disease  the test will get it right    percent of the time. It'll only get it wrong one percent of the time. But there are so many of them that there'll be an enormous number of false positives. Put that another way    of all of them who test positive    so here they are  the individuals involved    less than one in     actually have the disease. So even though we think the test is accurate  the important part of the story is there's another bit of information we need. Here's the key intuition. What we have to do  once we know the test is positive  is to weigh up the plausibility  or the likelihood  of two competing explanations. Each of those explanations has a likely bit and an unlikely bit. One explanation is that the person doesn't have the disease    that's overwhelmingly likely  if you pick someone at random    but the test gets it wrong  which is unlikely. The other explanation is that the person does have the disease    that's unlikely    but the test gets it right  which is likely. And the number we end up with    that number which is a little bit less than one in        is to do with how likely one of those explanations is relative to the other. Each of them taken together is unlikely. Here's a more topical example of exactly the same thing. Those of you in Britain will know about what's become rather a celebrated case of a woman called Sally Clark  who had two babies who died suddenly. And initially  it was thought that they died of what's known informally as  cot death   and more formally as  Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.  For various reasons  she was later charged with murder. And at the trial  her trial  a very distinguished pediatrician gave evidence that the chance of two cot deaths  innocent deaths  in a family like hers    which was professional and non smoking    was one in    million. To cut a long story short  she was convicted at the time. Later  and fairly recently  acquitted on appeal    in fact  on the second appeal. And just to set it in context  you can imagine how awful it is for someone to have lost one child  and then two  if they're innocent  to be convicted of murdering them. To be put through the stress of the trial  convicted of murdering them    and to spend time in a women's prison  where all the other prisoners think you killed your children    is a really awful thing to happen to someone. And it happened in large part here because the expert got the statistics horribly wrong  in two different ways. So where did he get the one in    million number  He looked at some research  which said the chance of one cot death in a family like Sally Clark's is about one in      . So he said   I'll assume that if you have one cot death in a family  the chance of a second child dying from cot death aren't changed.  So that's what statisticians would call an assumption of independence. It's like saying   If you toss a coin and get a head the first time  that won't affect the chance of getting a head the second time.  So if you toss a coin twice  the chance of getting a head twice are a half    that's the chance the first time    times a half    the chance a second time. So he said   Here  I'll assume that these events are independent. When you multiply       together twice  you get about    million.  And none of this was stated to the court as an assumption or presented to the jury that way. Unfortunately here    and  really  regrettably    first of all  in a situation like this you'd have to verify it empirically. And secondly  it's palpably false. There are lots and lots of things that we don't know about sudden infant deaths. It might well be that there are environmental factors that we're not aware of  and it's pretty likely to be the case that there are genetic factors we're not aware of. So if a family suffers from one cot death  you'd put them in a high risk group. They've probably got these environmental risk factors and or genetic risk factors we don't know about. And to argue  then  that the chance of a second death is as if you didn't know that information is really silly. It's worse than silly    it's really bad science. Nonetheless  that's how it was presented  and at trial nobody even argued it. That's the first problem. The second problem is  what does the number of one in    million mean  So after Sally Clark was convicted    you can imagine  it made rather a splash in the press    one of the journalists from one of Britain's more reputable newspapers wrote that what the expert had said was   The chance that she was innocent was one in    million.  Now  that's a logical error. It's exactly the same logical error as the logical error of thinking that after the disease test  which is    percent accurate  the chance of having the disease is    percent. In the disease example  we had to bear in mind two things  one of which was the possibility that the test got it right or not. And the other one was the chance  a priori  that the person had the disease or not. It's exactly the same in this context. There are two things involved    two parts to the explanation. We want to know how likely  or relatively how likely  two different explanations are. One of them is that Sally Clark was innocent    which is  a priori  overwhelmingly likely    most mothers don't kill their children. And the second part of the explanation is that she suffered an incredibly unlikely event. Not as unlikely as one in    million  but nonetheless rather unlikely. The other explanation is that she was guilty. Now  we probably think a priori that's unlikely. And we certainly should think in the context of a criminal trial that that's unlikely  because of the presumption of innocence. And then if she were trying to kill the children  she succeeded. So the chance that she's innocent isn't one in    million. We don't know what it is. It has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statistical evidence. We know the children died. What matters is how likely or unlikely  relative to each other  the two explanations are. And they're both implausible. There's a situation where errors in statistics had really profound and really unfortunate consequences. In fact  there are two other women who were convicted on the basis of the evidence of this pediatrician  who have subsequently been released on appeal. Many cases were reviewed. And it's particularly topical because he's currently facing a disrepute charge at Britain's General Medical Council. So just to conclude    what are the take home messages from this  Well  we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance are very much a part of our everyday life. It's also true    and  although  you  as a collective  are very special in many ways  you're completely typical in not getting the examples I gave right. It's very well documented that people get things wrong. They make errors of logic in reasoning with uncertainty. We can cope with the subtleties of language brilliantly    and there are interesting evolutionary questions about how we got here. We are not good at reasoning with uncertainty. That's an issue in our everyday lives. As you've heard from many of the talks  statistics underpins an enormous amount of research in science    in social science  in medicine and indeed  quite a lot of industry. All of quality control  which has had a major impact on industrial processing  is underpinned by statistics. It's something we're bad at doing. At the very least  we should recognize that  and we tend not to. To go back to the legal context  at the Sally Clark trial all of the lawyers just accepted what the expert said. So if a pediatrician had come out and said to a jury   I know how to build bridges. I've built one down the road. Please drive your car home over it   they would have said   Well  pediatricians don't know how to build bridges. That's what engineers do.  On the other hand  he came out and effectively said  or implied   I know how to reason with uncertainty. I know how to do statistics.  And everyone said   Well  that's fine. He's an expert.  So we need to understand where our competence is and isn't. Exactly the same kinds of issues arose in the early days of DNA profiling  when scientists  and lawyers and in some cases judges  routinely misrepresented evidence. Usually    one hopes    innocently  but misrepresented evidence. Forensic scientists said   The chance that this guy's innocent is one in three million.  Even if you believe the number  just like the    million to one  that's not what it meant. And there have been celebrated appeal cases in Britain and elsewhere because of that. And just to finish in the context of the legal system. It's all very well to say   Let's do our best to present the evidence.  But more and more  in cases of DNA profiling    this is another one    we expect juries  who are ordinary people    and it's documented they're very bad at this    we expect juries to be able to cope with the sorts of reasoning that goes on. In other spheres of life  if people argued    well  except possibly for politics    but in other spheres of life  if people argued illogically  we'd say that's not a good thing. We sort of expect it of politicians and don't hope for much more. In the case of uncertainty  we get it wrong all the time    and at the very least  we should be aware of that  and ideally  we might try and do something about it. Thanks very much. I don't know about you  but I haven't quite figured out exactly what technology means in my life. I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about. Should I be pro technology  Should I embrace it full arms  Should I be wary  Like you  I'm very tempted by the latest thing. But at the other hand  a couple of years ago I gave up all of my possessions  sold all my technology    except for a bicycle    and rode across       miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body  fuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food. And I've since then tried to keep technology at arm's length in many ways  so it doesn't master my life. At the same time  I run a website on cool tools  where I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology. So I'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is as it relates to humanity  as it relates to nature  as it relates to the spiritual. And I'm not even sure we know what technology is. And one definition of technology is that which is first recorded. This is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find. It was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in     . Before that  obviously  technology didn't exist. But obviously it did. I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology. He says technology is anything that was invented after you were born. So it sums up a lot of what we're talking about. Danny Hillis actually has an update on that    he says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet. Which also  I think  gets into a little bit of our current idea. But I was interested in another definition of technology. Something  again  that went back to something more fundamental. Something that was deeper. And as I struggled to understand that  I came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to work for me in my investigations. And I'm  this morning  going to talk about this for the first time. So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud. The question that I came up with was this question  what does technology want  And by that  I don't mean  does it want chocolate or vanilla  By what it wants  I mean  what are its inherent trends and biases  What are its tendencies over time  One way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms  which we've heard a lot about. And the trick that Richard Dawkins does  which is to say  to look at them as simply as genes  as vehicles for genes. So he's saying  what do genes want  The selfish gene. And I'm applying a similar trick to say  what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology  What does technology want  Obviously  this in an incomplete question  just as looking at an organism as only a gene is an incomplete way of looking at it. But it's still very  very productive. So I'm attempting to say  if we take technology's view of the world  what does it want  And I think once we ask that question we have to go back  actually  to life. Because obviously  if we keep extending the origins of technology far back  I think we come back to life at some point. So that's where I want to begin my little exploration  is in life. And like you heard from the previous speakers  we don't really know what life there is on Earth right now. We have really no idea. Craig Venter's tremendous and brilliant attempt to DNA sequence things in the ocean is great. Brian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on Earth. And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects  just to see what's on life. And if we did that with our little Martian probe  which we have not done on Earth  we would begin to see some incredible species. This is not on another planet. These are things that are hidden away on our planet. This is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen. Each one of these organisms that we've described    that you've seen from Jamie and others  these magnificent things    what they're doing  each one of them  is they're hacking the rules of life. I can't think of a single general principle of biology that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism. Every single thing that we can think of    and if you heard Olivia's talk about the sexual habits  you'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life  because every single one of them is hacking something about it. This is a solar powered sea slug. It's a nudibranch that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy. This is another version of that. This is a sea dragon  and the one on the bottom  the blue one  is a juvenile that has not yet swallowed the acid  has not yet taken in the brown green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy. These are hacks  and if we looked at the general shape of the approaches to hacking life there are  current consensus  six kingdoms. Six different broad approaches  the plants  the animals  the fungi  the protests    the little things    the bacteria and the Archaea bacteria. The Archaeas. Those are the general approaches to life. That's one way to look at life on Earth today. But a more interesting way  the current way to take the long view  is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective. And here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution go over the linear time  we have it coming out from the center. So in the center is the most primitive  and this is a genealogical chart of all life on earth. This is all the same six kingdoms. You see       representative species  and you can see where we are. But what I like about this is it shows that every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved. Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans. They've been around just as long and gone through just the same kind of trial and error to get here. But we see that each one of these is actually hacking  and has a different way of finding out how to do life. And if we take the long term trends of life  if we begin to say  what does evolution want  There's several things that we see. One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth have we ever been where we don't find life. We find life at the bottom of every long term  long distance drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up    and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock. And wherever life is  it never retreats. It's ubiquitous and it wants to be more. More and more of the inert matter of the globe is being touched and animated by life. The second thing is is we see diversity. We also see specialization. We see the movement from a general purpose cell to the more specific and specialized. And we see a drift towards complexity that's very intuitive. And actually  we have current data that does show that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time. And the last thing  I bring back this nudibranch. One of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability. And by that it means that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life. Like those chloroplast cells    they're completely surrounded by other life. They never touch the inner matter. There is more and more co evolution. And so the general  long term trends of evolution are roughly these five  ubiquity  diversity  specialization  complexity and socialization. Now  I took that and said  OK  what are the long term trends in technology  And again  my question is  what does technology want  And so  remarkably  I discovered that there's also a drift toward specialization. That we see there's a general hammer  and hammers become more and more specific over time. There's obviously diversity. Huge numbers of things. This is all the contents of a Japanese home. I actually had my daughter    gave her a tally counter  and I gave her an assignment last summer to go around and count the number of species of technology in our household. And it came up with       different species of products. I did some research and found out that the King of England  Henry VIII  had only about       items in his household. And he was the King of England  and that was the entire wealth of England at the time. So we're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things. This is a scene from Star Wars where the  PO comes out and he sees machines making machines. How depraved  Well  this is actually what we're headed towards  world machines. And the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies. Most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology and not non technology  or even life. And thirdly  the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a cliche. And I'm happy to say  I was partly responsible for that cliche that machines are becoming biological  but that's pretty evident. So the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution. The same drives that we see towards ubiquity  towards diversity  towards socialization  towards complexity. That is maybe not a big surprise because if we map out  say  the evolution of armor  you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary type cladistic tree. I suggest that  in fact  technology is the seventh kingdom of life. That its operations and how it works is so similar that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom. And so it would be sort of approximately up there  coming out of the animal kingdom. And if we were to do that  we would find out    we could actually approach technology in this way. This is Niles Eldredge. He was the co developer with Stephen Jay Gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium. But as a sideline  he happens to collect cornets. He has one of the world's largest collections    about     of them. And he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites  or snails  and to do a morphological analysis  and try to derive their genealogical history over time. This is his chart  which is not quite published yet. But the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom  those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made. That does not happen in biology. When something is extinct  you can't have it as your parent. But that does happen in technology. And it turns out that that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree  and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus a biological system. In fact  this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that I began to think about what happens with old technology. And it turns out that  in fact  technologies don't die. So I suggested this to an historian of science  and he said   Well  what about  you know  come on  what about steam cars  They're not around anymore.  Well actually  they are. In fact  they're so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile. And this is a website of a guy who's selling brand new parts for the Stanley automobile. And the thing that I liked is sort of this one click  add to your cart button    for buying steam valves. I mean  it was just    it was really there. And so  I began to think about  well  maybe that's just a random sample. Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way. So I took the great big      Montgomery Ward's catalog and I randomly went through it. And I took a page    not quite a random page    I took a page that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the pages are filled with things that are still being made. But I took this page and I said  how many of these things are still being made  And not antiques. I want to know how many of these things are still in production. And the answer is  all of them. All of them are still being produced. So you've got corn shellers. I don't know who needs a corn sheller. Be it corn shellers    you've got ploughs  you've got fan mills  all these things    and these are not  again  antiques. These are    you can order these. You can go to the web and you can buy them now  brand new made. So in a certain sense  technologies don't die. In fact  you can buy  for    bucks  a stone age knife made exactly the same way that they were made        years ago. It's short  bone handle     bucks. And in fact  what's important is that this information actually never died out. It's not just that it was resurrected. It's continued all along. And in Papua New Guinea  they were making stone axes until two decades ago  just as a course of practical matters. Even when we try to get rid of a technology  it's actually very hard. So we've all heard about the Amish giving up cars. We've heard about the Japanese giving up guns. We've heard about this and that. But I actually went back and took what I could find  the examples in history where there have been prohibitions against technology  and then I tried to find out when they came back in  because they always came back in. And it turns out that the time  the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited  is decreasing over time. And that basically  you can delay technology  but you can't kill it. So this makes sense  because in a certain sense what culture is  is the accumulation of ideas. That's what it's for. It's so that ideas don't die out. And when we take that  we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the long term trajectory    again  in life's evolution    we find that each case    each of the major transitions in life    what they're really about is accelerating and changing the way in which evolution happens. They're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated. So all these steps in evolution are increasing  basically  the evolution of evolvability. So what's happening over time in life is that the ways in which you generate these new ideas  these new hacks  are increasing. And the real tricks are ways in which you kind of explore the way of exploring. And then what we see in the singularity  that prophesized by Kurzweil and others    his idea that technology is accelerating evolution. It's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas. So if you have life hacking    life means hacking  the game of survival    then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game. And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve. That is what we call an  infinite game.  That's the definition of  infinite game.  A finite game is play to win  and an infinite game is played to keep playing. And I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force. The origins of technology was not in       but was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang  and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe were compressed. The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot  and it was so tight in there  there was no room for any difference at all. That's the definition. There was no temperature. There was no difference whatsoever. And at the Big Bang  what it expanded was the potential for difference. So as it expands and as things expand what we have is the potential for differences  diversity  options  choices  opportunities  possibilities and freedoms. Those are all basically the same thing. And those are the things that technology brings us. That's what technology is bringing us  choices  possibilities  freedoms. That's what it's about. It's this expansion of room to make differences. And so a hammer  when we grab a hammer  that's what we're grabbing. And that's why we continue to grab technology    because we want those things. Those things are good. Differences  freedom  choices  possibilities. And each time we make a new opportunity place  we're allowing a platform to make new ones. And I think it's really important. Because if you can imagine Mozart before the technology of the piano was invented    what a loss to society there would be. Imagine Van Gogh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints. Imagine Hitchcock before the technologies of film. Somewhere  today  there are millions of young children being born whose technology of self expression has not yet been invented. We have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference. We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals. That's what technology really wants. I'm going to skip through some of the objections because I don't have answers to why there's deforestation. I don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies. I don't have an answer to how this impacts on our dignity  other than to suggest that maybe the seventh kingdom  because it's so close to what life is about  maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life. Maybe in some ways the fact that what we're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it. It's a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields  but it's a really good thing to use to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village. Our humanity is actually defined by technology. All the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology. This is the infinite game. That's what we're talking about. You see  technology is a way to evolve the evolution. It's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more. And it's actually a way of playing the game  of playing all the games. That's what technology wants. And so when I think about what technology wants  I think that it has to do with the fact that every person here    and I really believe this    every person here has an assignment. And your assignment is to spend your life discovering what your assignment is. That recursive nature is the infinite game. And if you play that well  you'll have other people involved  so even that game extends and continues even when you're gone. That is the infinite game. And what technology is is the medium in which we play that infinite game. And so I think that we should embrace technology because it is an essential part of our journey in finding out who we are. Thank you. Well  it's great to be here. We've heard a lot about the promise of technology  and the peril. I've been quite interested in both. If we could convert  .   percent of the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy  we could meet all of our projected needs for     . We can't do that today because solar panels are heavy  expensive and very inefficient. There are nano engineered designs  which at least have been analyzed theoretically  that show the potential to be very lightweight  very inexpensive  very efficient  and we'd be able to actually provide all of our energy needs in this renewable way. Nano engineered fuel cells could provide the energy where it's needed. That's a key trend  which is decentralization  moving from centralized nuclear power plants and liquid natural gas tankers to decentralized resources that are environmentally more friendly  a lot more efficient and capable and safe from disruption. Bono spoke very eloquently  that we have the tools  for the first time  to address age old problems of disease and poverty. Most regions of the world are moving in that direction. In       in East Asia and the Pacific region  there were     million people living in poverty    that number now is under     million. The World Bank projects by       it will be under    million  which is a reduction of    percent. I did enjoy Bono's comment linking Haight Ashbury to Silicon Valley. Being from the Massachusetts high tech community myself  I'd point out that we were hippies also in the     s  although we hung around Harvard Square. But we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty  and I'm going to talk about those issues  if we have the will. Kevin Kelly talked about the acceleration of technology. That's been a strong interest of mine  and a theme that I've developed for some    years. I realized that my technologies had to make sense when I finished a project. That invariably  the world was a different place when I would introduce a technology. And  I noticed that most inventions fail  not because the R D department can't get it to work    if you look at most business plans  they will actually succeed if given the opportunity to build what they say they're going to build    and    percent of those projects or more will fail  because the timing is wrong    not all the enabling factors will be in place when they're needed. So I began to be an ardent student of technology trends  and track where technology would be at different points in time  and began to build the mathematical models of that. It's kind of taken on a life of its own. I've got a group of    people that work with me to gather data on key measures of technology in many different areas  and we build models. And you'll hear people say  well  we can't predict the future. And if you ask me  will the price of Google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now  that's very hard to say. Will WiMax CDMA G  be the wireless standard three years from now  That's hard to say. But if you ask me  what will it cost for one MIPS of computing in       or the cost to sequence a base pair of DNA in       or the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in       it turns out that those are very predictable. There are remarkably smooth exponential curves that govern price performance  capacity  bandwidth. And I'm going to show you a small sample of this  but there's really a theoretical reason why technology develops in an exponential fashion. And a lot of people  when they think about the future  think about it linearly. They think they're going to continue to develop a problem or address a problem using today's tools  at today's pace of progress  and fail to take into consideration this exponential growth. The Genome Project was a controversial project in     . We had our best Ph.D. students  our most advanced equipment around the world  we got         th of the project done  so how're we going to get this done in    years  And    years into the project  the skeptics were still going strong    says   You're two thirds through this project  and you've managed to only sequence a very tiny percentage of the whole genome.  But it's the nature of exponential growth that once it reaches the knee of the curve  it explodes. Most of the project was done in the last few years of the project. It took us    years to sequence HIV    we sequenced SARS in    days. So we are gaining the potential to overcome these problems. I'm going to show you just a few examples of how pervasive this phenomena is. The actual paradigm shift rate  the rate of adopting new ideas  is doubling every decade  according to our models. These are all logarithmic graphs  so as you go up the levels it represents  generally multiplying by factor of    or    . It took us half a century to adopt the telephone  the first virtual reality technology. Cell phones were adopted in about eight years. If you put different communication technologies on this logarithmic graph  television  radio  telephone were adopted in decades. Recent technologies    like the PC  the web  cell phones    were under a decade. Now this is an interesting chart  and this really gets at the fundamental reason why an evolutionary process    and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes    accelerate. They work through interaction    they create a capability  and then it uses that capability to bring on the next stage. So the first step in biological evolution  the evolution of DNA    actually it was RNA came first    took billions of years  but then evolution used that information processing backbone to bring on the next stage. So the Cambrian Explosion  when all the body plans of the animals were evolved  took only    million years. It was     times faster. And then evolution used those body plans to evolve higher cognitive functions  and biological evolution kept accelerating. It's an inherent nature of an evolutionary process. So Homo sapiens  the first technology creating species  the species that combined a cognitive function with an opposable appendage    and by the way  chimpanzees don't really have a very good opposable thumb    so we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip and fine motor coordination  and use our mental models to actually change the world and bring on technology. But anyway  the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years  and then working through interaction  evolution used  essentially  the technology creating species to bring on the next stage  which were the first steps in technological evolution. And the first step took tens of thousands of years    stone tools  fire  the wheel    kept accelerating. We always used then the latest generation of technology to create the next generation. Printing press took a century to be adopted  the first computers were designed pen on paper    now we use computers. And we've had a continual acceleration of this process. Now by the way  if you look at this on a linear graph  it looks like everything has just happened  but some observer says   Well  Kurzweil just put points on this graph that fall on that straight line.  So  I took    different lists from key thinkers  like the Encyclopedia Britannica  the Museum of Natural History  Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar on the same    and these people were not trying to make my point  these were just lists in reference works  and I think that's what they thought the key events were in biological evolution and technological evolution. And again  it forms the same straight line. You have a little bit of thickening in the line because people do have disagreements  what the key points are  there's differences of opinion when agriculture started  or how long the Cambrian Explosion took. But you see a very clear trend. There's a basic  profound acceleration of this evolutionary process. Information technologies double their capacity  price performance  bandwidth  every year. And that's a very profound explosion of exponential growth. A personal experience  when I was at MIT    computer taking up about the size of this room  less powerful than the computer in your cell phone. But Moore's Law  which is very often identified with this exponential growth  is just one example of many  because it's basically a property of the evolutionary process of technology. I put    famous computers on this logarithmic graph    by the way  a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth    that's another exponential. It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in       two years in the middle  we're now doubling it every one year. And that's exponential growth through five different paradigms. Moore's Law was just the last part of that  where we were shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit  but we had electro mechanical calculators  relay based computers that cracked the German Enigma Code  vacuum tubes in the     s predicted the election of Eisenhower  discreet transistors used in the first space flights and then Moore's Law. Every time one paradigm ran out of steam  another paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth. They were shrinking vacuum tubes  making them smaller and smaller. That hit a wall. They couldn't shrink them and keep the vacuum. Whole different paradigm    transistors came out of the woodwork. In fact  when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm  it creates research pressure to create the next paradigm. And because we've been predicting the end of Moore's Law for quite a long time    the first prediction said       until now it says     . But by the teen years  the features of transistors will be a few atoms in width  and we won't be able to shrink them any more. That'll be the end of Moore's Law  but it won't be the end of the exponential growth of computing  because chips are flat. We live in a three dimensional world  we might as well use the third dimension. We will go into the third dimension and there's been tremendous progress  just in the last few years  of getting three dimensional  self organizing molecular circuits to work. We'll have those ready well before Moore's Law runs out of steam. Supercomputers    same thing. Processor performance on Intel chips  the average price of a transistor          you could buy one transistor for a dollar. You could buy    million in     . It's pretty remarkable how smooth an exponential process that is. I mean  you'd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment  but this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior    countries accusing each other of dumping products  IPOs  bankruptcies  marketing programs. You would think it would be a very erratic process  and you have a very smooth outcome of this chaotic process. Just as we can't predict what one molecule in a gas will do    it's hopeless to predict a single molecule    yet we can predict the properties of the whole gas  using thermodynamics  very accurately. It's the same thing here. We can't predict any particular project  but the result of this whole worldwide  chaotic  unpredictable activity of competition and the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable. And we can predict these trends far into the future. Unlike Gertrude Stein's roses  it's not the case that a transistor is a transistor. As we make them smaller and less expensive  the electrons have less distance to travel. They're faster  so you've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors  so the cost of a cycle of one transistor has been coming down with a halving rate of  .  years. You add other forms of innovation and processor design  you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year. And that's basically deflation       percent deflation. And it's not just computers. I mean  it's true of DNA sequencing  it's true of brain scanning  it's true of the World Wide Web. I mean  anything that we can quantify  we have hundreds of different measurements of different  information related measurements    capacity  adoption rates    and they basically double every            months  depending on what you're looking at. In terms of price performance  that's a    to    percent deflation rate. And economists have actually started worrying about that. We had deflation during the Depression  but that was collapse of the money supply  collapse of consumer confidence  a completely different phenomena. This is due to greater productivity  but the economist says   But there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that. If you have    percent deflation  people may increase their volume        percent  but they won't keep up with it.  But what we're actually seeing is that we actually more than keep up with it. We've had    percent per year compounded growth in dollars in information technology over the last    years. I mean  people didn't build iPods for        dollars    years ago. As the price performance makes new applications feasible  new applications come to the market. And this is a very widespread phenomena. Magnetic data storage    that's not Moore's Law  it's shrinking magnetic spots  different engineers  different companies  same exponential process. A key revolution is that we're understanding our own biology in these information terms. We're understanding the software programs that make our body run. These were evolved in very different times    we'd like to actually change those programs. One little software program  called the fat insulin receptor gene  basically says   Hold onto every calorie  because the next hunting season may not work out so well.  That was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago. We'd like to actually turn that program off. They tried that in animals  and these mice ate ravenously and remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim. They didn't get diabetes  they didn't get heart disease  they lived    percent longer  they got the health benefits of caloric restriction without the restriction. Four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this  felt that would be interesting drug for the human market  and that's just one of the        genes that affect our biochemistry. We were evolved in an era where it wasn't in the interests of people at the age of most people at this conference  like myself  to live much longer  because we were using up the precious resources which were better deployed towards the children and those caring for them. So  life    long lifespans    like  that is to say  much more than       weren't selected for  but we are learning to actually manipulate and change these software programs through the biotechnology revolution. For example  we can inhibit genes now with RNA interference. There are exciting new forms of gene therapy that overcome the problem of placing the genetic material in the right place on the chromosome. There's actually a    for the first time now  something going to human trials  that actually cures pulmonary hypertension    a fatal disease    using gene therapy. So we'll have not just designer babies  but designer baby boomers. And this technology is also accelerating. It cost    dollars per base pair in       then a penny in     . It's now under a   th of a cent. The amount of genetic data    basically this shows that smooth exponential growth doubled every year  enabling the genome project to be completed. Another major revolution  the communications revolution. The price performance  bandwidth  capacity of communications measured many different ways  wired  wireless is growing exponentially. The Internet has been doubling in power and continues to  measured many different ways. This is based on the number of hosts. Miniaturization    we're shrinking the size of technology at an exponential rate  both wired and wireless. These are some designs from Eric Drexler's book    which we're now showing are feasible with super computing simulations  where actually there are scientists building molecule scale robots. One has one that actually walks with a surprisingly human like gait  that's built out of molecules. There are little machines doing things in experimental bases. The most exciting opportunity is actually to go inside the human body and perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions. And this is less futuristic than it may sound. These things have already been done in animals. There's one nano engineered device that cures type   diabetes. It's blood cell sized. They put tens of thousands of these in the blood cell    they tried this in rats    it lets insulin out in a controlled fashion  and actually cures type   diabetes. What you're watching is a design of a robotic red blood cell  and it does bring up the issue that our biology is actually very sub optimal  even though it's remarkable in its intricacy. Once we understand its principles of operation  and the pace with which we are reverse engineering biology is accelerating  we can actually design these things to be thousands of times more capable. An analysis of this respirocyte  designed by Rob Freitas  indicates if you replace    percent of your red blood cells with these robotic versions  you could do an Olympic sprint for    minutes without taking a breath. You could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours    so   Honey  I'm in the pool   will take on a whole new meaning. It will be interesting to see what we do in our Olympic trials. Presumably we'll ban them  but then we'll have the specter of teenagers in their high schools gyms routinely out performing the Olympic athletes. Freitas has a design for a robotic white blood cell. These are      circa scenarios  but they're not as futuristic as it may sound. There are four major conferences on building blood cell sized devices  there are many experiments in animals. There's actually one going into human trial  so this is feasible technology. If we come back to our exponential growth of computing        dollars of computing is now somewhere between an insect and a mouse brain. It will intersect human intelligence in terms of capacity in the     s  but that'll be the hardware side of the equation. Where will we get the software  Well  it turns out we can see inside the human brain  and in fact not surprisingly  the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year. And with the new generation of scanning tools  for the first time we can actually see individual inter neural fibers and see them processing and signaling in real time    but then the question is  OK  we can get this data now  but can we understand it  Doug Hofstadter wonders  well  maybe our intelligence just isn't great enough to understand our intelligence  and if we were smarter  well  then our brains would be that much more complicated  and we'd never catch up to it. It turns out that we can understand it. This is a block diagram of a model and simulation of the human auditory cortex that actually works quite well    in applying psychoacoustic tests  gets very similar results to human auditory perception. There's another simulation of the cerebellum    that's more than half the neurons in the brain    again  works very similarly to human skill formation. This is at an early stage  but you can show with the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain and the exponential improvement in the resolution of brain scanning  we will succeed in reverse engineering the human brain by the     s. We've already had very good models and simulation of about    regions out of the several hundred. All of this is driving exponentially growing economic progress. We've had productivity go from    dollars to     dollars per hour of labor in the last    years. E commerce has been growing exponentially. It's now a trillion dollars. You might wonder  well  wasn't there a boom and a bust  That was strictly a capital markets phenomena. Wall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology  which it was  but then six months later  when it hadn't revolutionized all business models  they figured  well  that was wrong  and then we had this bust. All right  this is a technology that we put together using some of the technologies we're involved in. This will be a routine feature in a cell phone. It would be able to translate from one language to another. So let me just end with a couple of scenarios. By      computers will disappear. They'll be so small  they'll be embedded in our clothing  in our environment. Images will be written directly to our retina  providing full immersion virtual reality  augmented real reality. We'll be interacting with virtual personalities. But if we go to       we really have the full maturity of these trends  and you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw in terms of generations of technology  which are getting faster and faster  we'll have at that point. I mean  we will have two to the   th power greater price performance  capacity and bandwidth of these technologies  which is pretty phenomenal. It'll be millions of times more powerful than it is today. We'll have completed the reverse engineering of the human brain        dollars of computing will be far more powerful than the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity. Computers will combine the subtle pan recognition powers of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior  in terms of doing analytic thinking  remembering billions of facts accurately. Machines can share their knowledge very quickly. But it's not just an alien invasion of intelligent machines. We are going to merge with our technology. These nano bots I mentioned will first be used for medical and health applications  cleaning up the environment  providing powerful fuel cells and widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment. But they'll also go inside our brain  interact with our biological neurons. We've demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this. So  for example  full immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system  the nano bots shut down the signals coming from your real senses  replace them with the signals that your brain would be receiving if you were in the virtual environment  and then it'll feel like you're in that virtual environment. You can go there with other people  have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses.  Experience beamers   I call them  will put their whole flow of sensory experiences in the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the Internet. You can plug in and experience what it's like to be someone else. But most importantly  it'll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology  which in some sense we're doing already. We routinely do intellectual feats that would be impossible without our technology. Human life expectancy is expanding. It was    in       and with this sort of biotechnology  nano technology revolutions  this will move up very rapidly in the years ahead. My main message is that progress in technology is exponential  not linear. Many    even scientists    assume a linear model  so they'll say   Oh  it'll be hundreds of years before we have self replicating nano technology assembly or artificial intelligence.  If you really look at the power of exponential growth  you'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand. And information technology is increasingly encompassing all of our lives  from our music to our manufacturing to our biology to our energy to materials. We'll be able to manufacture almost anything we need in the     s  from information  in very inexpensive raw materials  using nano technology. These are very powerful technologies. They both empower our promise and our peril. So we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems. Thank you very much.
