As a particle physicist  I study the elementary particles and how they interact on the most fundamental level. For most of my research career  I've been using accelerators  such as the electron accelerator at Stanford University  just up the road  to study things on the smallest scale. But more recently  I've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale. Because  as I'll explain to you  the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected. So I'm going to tell you about our twenty first century view of the universe  what it's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are    at least some of the big questions. So  recently  we have realized that the ordinary matter in the universe    and by ordinary matter  I mean you  me  the planets  the stars  the galaxies    the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent of the content of the universe. Almost a quarter  or approximately a quarter of the matter in the universe  is stuff that's invisible. By invisible  I mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't reflect. It doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum  which is what we use to detect things. It doesn't interact at all. So how do we know it's there  We know it's there by its gravitational effects. In fact  this dark matter dominates the gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale  and I'll be telling you about the evidence for that. What about the rest of the pie  The rest of the pie is a very mysterious substance called dark energy. More about that later  OK. So for now  let's turn to the evidence for dark matter. In these galaxies  especially in a spiral galaxy like this  most of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy. This huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy. So we have these stars going around in circles like this. As you can imagine  even if you know physics  this should be intuitive  OK    that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed than those that are further out here  OK. So what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars  that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside. In other words  if we measured speed as a function of distance    this is the only time I'm going to show a graph  OK    we would expect that it goes down as the distance increases from the center of the galaxy. When those measurements are made  instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant  as a function of distance. If it's constant  that means that the stars out here are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see. In fact  this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter. And this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves  and it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy. So we see the galaxy and fixate on that  but it's actually a cloud of dark matter that's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy. Galaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space  they tend to cluster. And this is an example of a very  actually  famous cluster  the Coma cluster. And there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster. They're the white  fuzzy  elliptical things here. So these galaxy clusters    we take a snapshot now  we take a snapshot in a decade  it'll look identical. But these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds. They're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster  OK. So all of these galaxies are moving. We can measure the speeds of these galaxies  their orbital velocities  and figure out how much mass is in this cluster. And again  what we find is that there is much more mass there than can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see. Or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum  we see that there's a lot of gas in this cluster  as well. But that cannot account for the mass either. In fact  there appears to be about ten times as much mass here in the form of this invisible or dark matter as there is in the ordinary matter  OK. It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly. I'm just putting this big  blue blob on there  OK  to try to remind you that it's there. Can we see it more visually  Yes  we can. And so let me lead you through how we can do this. So here's an observer  it could be an eye  it could be a telescope. And suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe. How do we see that galaxy  A ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe for perhaps billions of years before it enters the telescope or your eye. Now  how do we deduce where the galaxy is  Well  we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling as it enters our eye  right  We say  the ray of light came this way  the galaxy must be there  OK. Now  suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies    and don't forget the dark matter  OK. Now  if we consider a different ray of light  one going off like this  we now need to take into account what Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity. And that was that the gravitational field  due to mass  will deflect not only the trajectory of particles  but will deflect light itself. So this light ray will not continue in a straight line  but would rather bend and could end up going into our eye. Where will this observer see the galaxy  You can respond. Up  right  We extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here. Is there any other ray of light that could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy  Yes  great. I see people going down like this. So a ray of light could go down  be bent up into the observer's eye  and the observer sees a ray of light here. Now  take into account the fact that we live in a three dimensional universe  OK  a three dimensional space. Are there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye  Yes  The rays would lie on a    I'd like to see    yeah  on a cone. So there's a whole ray of light    rays of light on a cone    that will all be bent by that cluster and make it into the observer's eye. If there is a cone of light coming into my eye  what do I see  A circle  a ring. It's called an Einstein ring. Einstein predicted that  OK. Now  it will only be a perfect ring if the source  the deflector and the eyeball  in this case  are all in a perfectly straight line. If they're slightly skewed  we'll see a different image. Now  you can do an experiment tonight over the reception  OK  to figure out what that image will look like. Because it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise  that has the right shape to produce this kind of effect. We call this gravitational lensing. And so  this is your instrument  OK. But ignore the top part. It's the base that I want you to concentrate  OK. So  actually  at home  whenever we break a wineglass  I save the bottom  take it over to the machine shop. We shave it off  and I have a little gravitational lens  OK. So it's got the right shape to produce the lensing. And so the next thing you need to do in your experiment is grab a napkin. I grabbed a piece of graph paper    I'm a physicist.  Laughter  So  a napkin. Draw a little model galaxy in the middle. And now put the lens over the galaxy  and what you'll find is that you'll see a ring  an Einstein ring. Now  move the base off to the side  and the ring will split up into arcs  OK. And you can put it on top of any image. On the graph paper  you can see how all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted. And again  this is a kind of an accurate model of what happens with the gravitational lensing. OK  so the question is  do we see this in the sky  Do we see arcs in the sky when we look at  say  a cluster of galaxies  And the answer is yes. And so  here's an image from the Hubble Space Telescope. Many of the images you are seeing are earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope. Well  first of all  for the golden shape galaxies    those are the galaxies in the cluster. They're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter that are causing the bending of the light to cause these optical illusions  or mirages  practically  of the background galaxies. So the streaks that you see  all these streaks  are actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away. So what we can do  then  is based on how much distortion we see in those images  we can calculate how much mass there must be in this cluster. And it's an enormous amount of mass. And also  you can tell by eye  by looking at this  that these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies. They are centered on some more spread out structure  and that is the dark matter in which the cluster is embedded  OK. So this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye. OK  so  a quick review then  to see that you're following. So the evidence that we have that a quarter of the universe is dark matter    this gravitationally attracting stuff    is that galaxies  the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies is much too large  it must be embedded in dark matter. The speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large  it must be embedded in dark matter. And we see these gravitational lensing effects  these distortions that say that  again  clusters are embedded in dark matter. OK. So now  let's turn to dark energy. So to understand the evidence for dark energy  we need to discuss something that Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session. And that is the fact that space itself is expanding. So if we imagine a section of our infinite universe    and so I've put down four spiral galaxies  OK    and imagine that you put down a set of tape measures  so every line on here corresponds to a tape measure  horizontal or vertical  for measuring where things are. If you could do this  what you would find that with each passing day  each passing year  each passing billions of years  OK  the distance between galaxies is getting greater. And it's not because galaxies are moving away from each other through space. They're not necessarily moving through space. They're moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger  OK. That's what the expansion of the universe or space means. So they're moving further apart. Now  what Stephen Hawking mentioned  as well  is that after the Big Bang  space expanded at a very rapid rate. But because gravitationally attracting matter is embedded in this space  it tends to slow down the expansion of the space  OK. So the expansion slows down with time. So  in the last century  OK  people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever  whether it would slow down  you know  will be slowing down  but continue forever  slow down and stop  asymptotically stop  or slow down  stop  and then reverse  so it starts to contract again. So a little over a decade ago  two groups of physicists and astronomers set out to measure the rate at which the expansion of space was slowing down  OK. By how much less is it expanding today  compared to  say  a couple of billion years ago  The startling answer to this question  OK  from these experiments  was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago  OK. So the expansion of space is actually speeding up. This was a completely surprising result. There is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen  OK. No one was predicting ahead of time this is what's going to be found. It was the opposite of what was expected. So we need something to be able to explain that. Now it turns out  in the mathematics  you can put it in as a term that's an energy  but it's a completely different type of energy from anything we've ever seen before. We call it dark energy  and it has this effect of causing space to expand. But we don't have a good motivation for putting it in there at this point  OK. So it's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in. Now  so at this point  then  what I want to really emphasize to you  is that  first of all  dark matter and dark energy are completely different things  OK. There are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe  and they have very different effects. Dark matter  because it gravitationally attracts  it tends to encourage the growth of structure  OK. So clusters of galaxies will tend to form  because of all this gravitational attraction. Dark energy  on the other hand  is putting more and more space between the galaxies  makes it  the gravitational attraction between them decrease  and so it impedes the growth of structure. So by looking at things like clusters of galaxies  and how they    their number density  how many there are as a function of time    we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure forming. In terms of dark matter  I said that we don't have any  you know  really persuasive argument for dark energy. Do we have anything for dark matter  And the answer is yes. We have well motivated candidates for the dark matter. Now  what do I mean by well motivated  I mean that we have mathematically consistent theories that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon  OK  things that I haven't even talked about  that each predict the existence of a very weakly interacting  new particle. So  this is exactly what you want in physics  where a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory that was actually developed for something else. But we don't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate  OK. One or both  who knows  Or it could be something completely different. Now  we look for these dark matter particles because  after all  they are here in the room  OK  and they didn't come in the door. They just pass through anything. They can come through the building  through the Earth    they're so non interacting. So one way to look for them is to build detectors that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it. So a crystal that will ring if that happens. So one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators have built such a detector. And they've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota  OK  deep under the ground  and in fact  in the last couple of days announced the most sensitive results so far. They haven't seen anything  OK  but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are. There's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy  to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this. The Large Hadron Collider  a particle physics accelerator  that we'll be turning on later this year. It is possible that dark matter particles might be produced at the Large Hadron Collider. Now  because they are so non interactive  they will actually escape the detector  so their signature will be missing energy  OK. Now  unfortunately  there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy  so it will be hard to tell the difference. And finally  for future endeavors  there are telescopes being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy    ground based telescopes  and there are three space based telescopes that are in competition right now to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy. So in terms of the big questions  what is dark matter  What is dark energy  The big questions facing physics. And I'm sure you have lots of questions  which I very much look forward to addressing over the next    hours  while I'm here. Thank you. Jambo  bonjour  zdravstvujtye  dayo  these are a few of the languages that I've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks  as I've been to    countries I think I'm up to  on this crazy tour I've been doing  checking out various aspects of the project that we're doing. And I'm going to tell you a little bit about later on. And visiting some pretty incredible places  places like Mongolia  Cambodia  New Guinea  South Africa  Tanzania twice    I was here a month ago. And the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that is utterly amazing  for lots of reasons. You see some incredible stuff. And you get to make these spot comparisons between people all around the globe. And the thing that you really take away from that  the kind of surface thing that you take away from it  is not that we're all one  although I'm going to tell you about that  but rather how different we are. There is so much diversity around the globe.       different languages spoken by six and a half billion people  all different colors  shapes  sizes. You walk down the street in any big city  you travel like that  and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species. How do we explain that diversity  Well  that's what I'm going to talk about today  is how we're using the tools of genetics  population genetics in particular  to tell us how we generated this diversity  and how long it took. Now  the problem of human diversity  like all big scientific questions    how do you explain something like that    can be broken down into sub questions. And you can ferret away at those little sub questions. First one is really a question of origins. Do we all share a common origin  in fact  And given that we do    and that's the assumption everybody  I think  in this room would make    when was that  When did we originate as a species  How long have we been divergent from each other  And the second question is related  but slightly different. If we do spring from a common source  how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe  and in the process generate all of this diversity  the different ways of life  the different appearances  the different languages around the world  Well  the question of origins  as with so many other questions in biology  seems to have been answered by Darwin over a century ago. In  The Descent of Man   he wrote   In each great region of the world  the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region. It's therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee  and as these two species are now man's nearest allies  it's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the African continent than elsewhere.  So we're done  we can go home    finished the origin question. Well  not quite. Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry  our common ancestry with apes. And it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent. Around    million years ago  they appear in the fossil record. Africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time  due to the vagaries of plate tectonics  floating around the Indian Ocean. Bumped into Eurasia around    million years ago  and then we had the first African exodus  as we call it. The apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia  became the gibbons and the orangutans. And the ones that stayed on in Africa evolved into the gorillas  the chimpanzees and us. So  yes  if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes  it's very clear  by looking at the fossil record  we started off here. But that's not really the question I'm asking. I'm asking about our human ancestry  things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room. If they were peering over your shoulder  you wouldn't leap back  like that. What about our human ancestry  Because if we go far enough back  we share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth. DNA ties us all together  so we share ancestry with barracuda and bacteria and mushrooms  if you go far enough back    over a billion years. What we're asking about though is human ancestry. How do we study that  Well  historically  it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology. Digging things up out of the ground  and largely on the basis of morphology    the way things are shaped  often skull shape    saying   This looks a little bit more like us than that  so this must be my ancestor. This must be who I'm directly descended from.  The field of paleoanthropology  I'll argue  gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry  but it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists. What do I mean by that  You're looking at a great example here. These are three extinct species of hominids  potential human ancestors. All dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge  by the Leakey family. And they're all dating to roughly the same time. From left to right  we've got Homo erectus  Homo habilis  and Australopithecus    now called Paranthropus boisei  the robust australopithecine. Three extinct species  same place  same time. That means that not all three could be my direct ancestor. Which one of these guys am I actually related to  Possibilities about our ancestry  but not the probabilities that we're really looking for. Well  a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently    again  largely skull shape. The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus  Carl von Linne  a Swedish botanist  who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet. You think you've got a tough job  And he did a pretty good job. He categorized about        species in  Systema Naturae.  He actually coined the term Homo sapiens    it means wise man in Latin. But looking around the world at the diversity of humans  he said   Well  you know  we seem to come in discreet sub species or categories.  And he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans  and a blatantly racist category he termed  Monstrosus   which basically included all the people he didn't like  including imaginary folk like elves. It's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well intentioned but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre Darwinian era. Except  if you had taken physical anthropology as recently as    or    years ago  in many cases you would have learned basically that same classification of humanity. Human races that according to physical anthropologists of        years ago    Carlton Coon is the best example    had been diverging from each other    this was in the post Darwinian era    for over a million years  since the time of Homo erectus. But based on what data  Very little. Very little. Morphology and a lot of guesswork. Well  what I'm going to talk about today  what I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem. Instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry  digging things up out of the ground  possible ancestors  and saying it on the basis of morphology    which we still don't completely understand  we don't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation    what we need to do is turn the problem on its head. Because what we're really asking is a genealogical problem  or a genealogical question. What we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today. And as any genealogist will tell you    anybody have a member of the family  or maybe you have tried to construct a family tree  trace back in time  You start in the present  with relationships you're certain about. You and your siblings  you have a parent in common. You and your cousins share a grandparent in common. You gradually trace further and further back into the past  adding these ever more distant relationships. But eventually  no matter how good you are at digging up the church records  and all that stuff  you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall. A point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors  and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance. Who were these people who came before  We have no written record. Well  actually  we do. Written in our DNA  in our genetic code    we have a historical document that takes us back in time to the very earliest days of our species. And that's what we study. Now  a quick primer on DNA. I suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist. It is a very long  linear molecule  a coded version of how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint. It's composed of four subunits  A  C  G and T  we call them. And it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint. How long is it  Well  it's billions of these subunits in length. A haploid genome    we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes    a haploid genome is around  .  billion nucleotides in length. And the whole thing  if you add it all together  is over six billion nucleotides long. If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body  and stretch it end to end  it's around two meters long. If you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body  and you stretch it end to end  it would reach from here to the moon and back  thousands of times. It's a lot of information. And so when you're copying this DNA molecule to pass it on  it's a pretty tough job. Imagine the longest book you can think of   War and Peace.  Now multiply it by    . And imagine copying that by hand. And you're working away until late at night  and you're very  very careful  and you're drinking coffee and you're paying attention  but  occasionally  when you're copying this by hand  you're going to make a little typo  a spelling mistake    substitute an I for an E  or a C for a T. Same thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations. It doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in. But when it does happen  and these changes get transmitted down through the generations  they become markers of descent. If you share a marker with someone  it means you share an ancestor at some point in the past  the person who first had that change in their DNA. And it's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation  the pattern of these markers in people all over the world  and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history  that we've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today. These are two pieces of DNA that we use quite widely in our work. Mitochondrial DNA  tracing a purely maternal line of descent. You get your mtDNA from your mother  and your mother's mother  all the way back to the very first woman. The Y chromosome  the piece of DNA that makes men men  traces a purely paternal line of descent. Everybody in this room  everybody in the world  falls into a lineage somewhere on these trees. Now  even though these are simplified versions of the real trees  they're still kind of complicated  so let's simplify them. Turn them on their sides  combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up. What's the take home message  Well  the thing that jumps out at you first is that the deepest lineages in our family trees are found within Africa  among Africans. That means that Africans have been accumulating this mutational diversity for longer. And what that means is that we originated in Africa. It's written in our DNA. Every piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa. And at some point in the past  a sub group of Africans left the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world. Now  how recently do we share this ancestry  Was it millions of years ago  which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world  No  the DNA tells a story that's very clear. Within the last         years  we all share an ancestor  a single person    Mitochondrial Eve  you might have heard about her    in Africa  an African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today. But what's even more amazing is that if you look at the Y chromosome side  the male side of the story  the Y chromosome Adam only lived around        years ago. That's only about       human generations  the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense. That tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time. This was an African man who gave rise to all the Y chromosome diversity around the world. It's only within the last        years that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world. Such an amazing story. We're all effectively part of an extended African family. Now  that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier  Why didn't Homo erectus evolve into separate species  or sub species rather  human races around the world  Why was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently  Well  that's a big question. These  why  questions  particularly in genetics and the study of history in general  are always the big ones  the ones that are tough to answer. And so when all else fails  talk about the weather. What was going on to the world's weather around        years ago  Well  we were going into the worst part of the last ice age. The last ice age started roughly         years ago. It went up and down  and it really started to accelerate around        years ago. Lots of evidence from sediment cores and the pollen types  oxygen isotopes and so on. We hit the last glacial maximum around        years ago  but basically  from        years on  things were getting really tough  getting very cold. The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets. New York City  Chicago  Seattle  all under a sheet of ice. Most of Britain  all of Scandinavia  covered by ice several kilometers thick. Now  Africa is the most tropical continent on the planet    about    percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn    and there aren't a lot of glaciers here  except on the high mountains here in East Africa. So what was going on here  We weren't covered in ice in Africa. Rather  Africa was drying out at that time. This is a paleo climatological map of what Africa looked like between        and        years ago  reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before. The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere. If you think about Antarctica  it's technically a desert  it gets so little precipitation. So the whole world was drying out. The sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert. The Sahara was much bigger then than it is now. And the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets  compared to what we have today. The evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time  roughly        years ago  crashed to fewer than       individuals. We nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails. And then something happened. A great illustration of it. Look at some stone tools. The ones on the left are from Africa  from around a million years ago. The ones on the right were made by Neanderthals  our distant cousins  not our direct ancestors  living in Europe  and they date from around        or        years ago. Now  at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience  basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups. The ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right. We are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago until around        to        years ago. The tool styles don't change that much. The evidence is that the human way of life didn't change that much during that period. But then            thousand years ago  somewhere in that region  all hell breaks loose. Art makes its appearance. The stone tools become much more finely crafted. The evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species  at particular times of the year. The population size started to expand. Probably  according to what many linguists believe  fully modern language  syntactic language    subject  verb  object    that we use to convey complex ideas  like I'm doing now  appeared around that time. We became much more social. The social networks expanded. This change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa  and they allowed us to start to expand around the world. We've been talking at this conference about African success stories. Well  you want the ultimate African success story  Look in the mirror. You're it. The reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa    probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now  around        thousand years ago    allowing us not only to survive in Africa  but to expand out of Africa. An early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia  leaving Africa around        years ago  reaching Australia very rapidly  by        years ago. A slightly later migration up into the Middle East. These would have been savannah hunters. So those of you who are going on one of the post conference tours  you'll get to see what a real savannah is like. And it's basically a meat locker. People who would have specialized in killing the animals  hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs  moving up  following the grasslands into the Middle East around        years ago  during one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara. Migrating eastward  following the grasslands  because that's what they were adapted to live on. And when they reached Central Asia  they reached what was effectively a steppe super highway  a grassland super highway. The grasslands at that time    this was during the last ice age    stretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea  and the entire continent was open to them. Entering Europe around        years ago  and finally  a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable  Siberia  inside the Arctic Circle  during the last ice age    temperature was at           even       perhaps    migrating into the Americas  ultimately reaching that final frontier. An amazing story  and it happened first in Africa. The changes that allowed us to do that  the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us  allowing us to create novel cultures  allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on. Now  that story I just told you is literally a whirlwind tour of how we populated the world  the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species. And that's the story that I told a couple of years ago in my book   The Journey of Man   and a film that we made with the same title. And as we were finishing up that film    it was co produced with National Geographic    I started talking to the folks at NG about this work. And they got really excited about it. They liked the film  but they said   You know  we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins  where we all came from  using the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world. You know  the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA  and we want to take it to the next level. What do you want to do next   Which is a great question to be asked by National Geographic. And I said   Well  you know  what I've sketched out here is just that. It is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet. And it's based on a few thousand people we've sampled from  you know  a handful of populations around the world. Studied a few genetic markers  and there are lots of gaps on this map. We've just connected the dots. What we need to do is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more    hundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world.  And that was the genesis of the Genographic Project. The project launched in April     . It has three core components. Obviously  science is a big part of it. The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples. People who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live that many of the rest of us have lost. So my ancestors come from all over northern Europe. I live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I'm not traveling. Where am I indigenous to  Nowhere really. My genes are all jumbled up. But there are people who retain that link to their ancestors that allows us to contextualize the DNA results. That's the focus of the field research  the centers that we've set up all over the world       of them  top population geneticists. But  in addition  we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world. How often do you get to participate in a big scientific project  The Human Genome Project  or a Mars Rover mission. In this case  you actually can. You can go onto our website  Nationalgeographic.com genographic. You can order a kit. You can test your own DNA. And you can actually submit those results to the database  and tell us a little about your genealogical background  have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort. Now  this is all a nonprofit enterprise  and so the money that we raise  after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components  gets plowed back into the project. The majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund. It's a charitable entity  basically a grant giving entity that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world for educational  cultural projects initiated by them. They apply to this fund in order to do various projects  and I'll show you a couple of examples. So how are we doing on the project  We've got about        samples collected from indigenous people around the world. The most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public          people have ordered these participation kits since we launched two years ago  which has raised around five million dollars  the majority of which  at least half  is going back into the Legacy Fund. We've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around         dollars. Projects around the world    documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone  preserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza  language revitalization in Tajikistan  etc.  etc. So the project is going very  very well  and I urge you to check out the website and watch this space. Thank you very much. Let's just start by looking at some great photographs. This is an icon of National Geographic  an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry. But the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out with a parody of National Geographic  and I shudder to think what they're going to do to this photograph. Oh  the wrath of Photoshop. This is a jet landing at San Francisco  by Bruce Dale. He mounted a camera on the tail. A poetic image for a story on Tolstoy  by Sam Abell. Pygmies in the DRC  by Randy Olson. I love this photograph because it reminds me of Degas' bronze sculptures of the little dancer. A polar bear swimming in the Arctic  by Paul Nicklen. Polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth    they're not very good swimmers    and we know what's happening to the ice. These are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa  photographed by Chris Johns. Shot straight down  so these are the shadows of the camels. This is a rancher in Texas  by William Albert Allard  a great portraitist. And Jane Goodall  making her own special connection  photographed by Nick Nichols. This is a soap disco in Spain  photographed by David Alan Harvey. And David said that there was lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor. But  hey  at least it's hygienic. These are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance  by David Doubilet. And this is a comet  captured by Dr. Euan Mason. And finally  the bow of the Titanic  without movie stars  photographed by Emory Kristof. Photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl of today's saturated  media world  because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment. Here's an example. Four years ago  I was at the beach with my son  and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches. But I turned away for a moment  and he got caught into a riptide and started to be pulled out towards the jetty. I can stand here right now and see  as I go tearing into the water after him  the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement. I can see the rocks are over here. There's a wave about to crash onto him. I can see his hands reaching out  and I can see his face in terror  looking at me  saying   Help me  Dad.  I got him. The wave broke over us. We got back on shore  he was fine. We were a little bit rattled. But this flashbulb memory  as it's called  is when all the elements came together to define not just the event  but my emotional connection to it. And this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer. Now I have to tell you  I was talking to Kyle last week about this  that I was going to tell this story. And he said   Oh  yeah  I remember that too  I remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me.  I thought I was a hero. So  this represents    this is a cross sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists  working at the very top of their craft    except one. This photograph was taken by Dr. Euan Mason in New Zealand last year  and it was submitted and published in National Geographic. Last year  we added a section to our website called  Your Shot   where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication. And it has become a wild success  tapping into the enthusiast photography community. The quality of these amateur photographs can  at times  be amazing. And seeing this reinforces  for me  that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them. But to be a great photojournalist  you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you. You've got to be able to make them all the time. But even more importantly  you need to know how to create a visual narrative. You need to know how to tell a story. So I'm going to share with you some coverages that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography. Photographer Nick Nichols went to document a very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary in Chad  called Zakouma. The original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species  of an exotic locale. And that is what Nick did  up to a point. This is a serval cat. He's actually taking his own picture  shot with what's called a camera trap. There's an infrared beam that's going across  and he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph. These are baboons at a watering hole. Nick    the camera  again  an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this. And Nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of baboons. A lion having a late night snack    notice he's got a broken tooth. And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den. I love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail. But the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants. It's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa. Here's a photograph shot in moonlight  something that digital photography has made a big difference for. It was with the elephants that this story pivoted. Nick  along with researcher Dr. Michael Fay  collared the matriarch of the herd. They named her Annie  and they began tracking her movements. The herd was safe within the confines of the park  because of this dedicated group of park rangers. But once the annual rains began  the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park. And that's when they ran into trouble. For outside the safety of the park were poachers  who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks. The matriarch that they were radio tracking  after weeks of moving back and forth  in and out of the park  came to a halt outside the park. Annie had been killed  along with    members of her herd. And they only came for the ivory. This is actually one of the rangers. They were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory  because they couldn't leave it there  because it's still valuable. But what Nick did was he brought back a story that went beyond the old school method of just straight   Isn't this an amazing world   And instead  created a story that touched our audiences deeply. Instead of just knowledge of this park  he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants  the rangers and the many issues surrounding human wildlife conflicts. Now let's go over to India. Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way. We were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman touches upon in his new world population project. For the first time in history  more people live in urban  rather than rural  environments. And most of that growth is not in the cities  but in the slums that surround them. Jonas Bendiksen  a very energetic photographer  came to me and said   We need to document this  and here's my proposal. Let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world.  And I said   Well  you know  that might be a bit ambitious for our budget.  So instead  what we did was we decided to  instead of going out and doing what would result in what we'd consider sort of a survey story    where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything    we put Jonas into Dharavi  which is part of Mumbai  India  and let him stay there  and really get into the heart and soul of this really major part of the city. What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exist in such places. He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned. By staying tightly focused in one place  Jonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community. And he did it in a beautiful way. Sometimes  though  the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture. We teamed up underwater photographer Brian Skerry and photojournalist Randy Olson to document the depletion of the world's fisheries. We weren't the only ones to tackle this subject  but the photographs that Brian and Randy created are among the best to capture both the human and natural devastation of overfishing. Here  in a photo by Brian  a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of Baja. I've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch  the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species. But here  Brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard. And Brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never before made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom. Back on land  Randy Olson photographed a makeshift fish market in Africa  where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals  the main parts having already been sent to Europe. And here in China  Randy shot a jellyfish market. As prime food sources are depleted  the harvest goes deeper into the oceans and brings in more such sources of protein. This is called fishing down the food chain. But there are also glimmers of hope  and I think anytime we're doing a big  big story on this  we don't really want to go and just look at all the problems. We also want to look for solutions. Brian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand  where commercial fishing had been banned    the result being that the overfished species have been restored  and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries. Photography can also compel us to confront issues that are potentially distressing and controversial. James Nachtwey  who was honored at last year's TED  took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq. It is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home  on the other. Jim started in the battlefield. Here  a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital. Here is in the field hospital. The soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest  as a reminder of home. From here  the more severely wounded are transported back to Germany  where they meet up with their families for the first time. And then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals  such as here in Walter Reed. And finally  often fitted with high tech prosthesis  they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their pre war lives. Jim took what could have been a straight up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply. Now  these stories are great examples of how photography can be used to address some of our most important topics. But there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are  when it comes down to it  just plain fun. Photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica to shoot a story on leopard seals. They have been rarely photographed  partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean. In fact  a year earlier  a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed. So you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water. Now  what leopard seals do mostly is  they eat penguins. You know of  The March of the Penguins.  This is sort of the munch of the penguins. Here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear. And then everybody kind of runs out and goes out. But then Paul got in the water. And he said he was never really afraid of this. Well  this one female came up to him. She's probably    it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph  but she's    feet long. So  she is pretty significant in size. And Paul said he was never really afraid  because she was more curious about him than threatened. This mouthing behavior  on the right  was really her way of saying to him   Hey  look how big I am   Or you know   My  what big teeth you have.  Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him. To her  here was this big  goofy creature in the water that for some reason didn't seem to be interested in chasing penguins. So what she did was she started to bring penguins to him  alive  and put them in front of him. She dropped them off  and then they would swim away. She'd kind of look at him  like  What are you doing   Go back and get them  and then bring them back and drop them in front of him. And she did this over the course of a couple of days  until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head. Which just resulted in a fantastic photograph. Eventually  though  Paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive. This is her just puffing out  you know  snorting out in disgust. And lost interest with him  and went back to what she does best. Paul set out to photograph a relatively mysterious and unknown creature  and came back with not just a collection of photographs  but an amazing experience and a great story. It is these kinds of stories  ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial that demonstrate the power of photojournalism. I believe that photography can make a real connection to people  and can be employed as a positive agent for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing our world today. Thank you. My favorite topic is shortcuts. The master of shortcuts    it's  of course  nature. But I will demonstrate different ways to get rid of difficulties and go to the point  to find an answer probably much quicker than Arthur did. So  first  we violate the common sense  the logic. All of you  if you hold your hand like this     degrees    all of you. Not you. All of you  right  Palm up. If you do this  the common  the logic says you must turn the wrist. Do you agree  Good. But I will first teach you a method  how you can do it without moving the wrist  and then the shortcut. You can do it immediately  right  Hold the hand like this  palm up. Don't move the wrist. The wrist is    I doesn't speak very many  but I do the best  what I are. Right molded you say  with iron  That was a joke  actually  and I    OK. Hold the hand palm up. Do this  don't move the wrist. Over the heart  don't move the wrist. Forward  don't move the wrist. Up  don't move the wrist. Over the heart  don't move the wrist. And forward. Yeah. Now    logic  logically  you have got to this position from this  without moving the wrist. Now  the shortcut. But it was six moves. Now with one move. I start here  palm down  you can follow. And then look at me. Yeah   Laughter  One move. OK. So  that was the warming up. Now  I need an assistant. I talked to a nice girl before  Zoe. She has left. No  A big hand. Good. Nice. And you can sit over there. One item here was water  right  And I will give my tribute to water. I think it's enough with water for me. The other guys can talk about    cheers. Beer has about    there's a lot of water in beer. So  now I will demonstrate different ways of memorizing  control cards and so on. And I think I'll take off this one. I work with a special method to do it  quick. I work with precision    oh  sorry    control and a very powerful ... memory system  right  So  if    I have studied the poker. I like to gamble. Officially  I don't gamble but ... So  if we are    if we have five person  and I will do a five handed poker game. Now I will interact. So a different person all the time  so not the same person can answer. So we have an agreement. Which one shall have a good poker hand  Which number  One  two  three  four or five   Audience  Three.  Lennart Green  Three    good. And here  I had a mat here to make it a little    the critical moment is    sorry. If a card shark gathers the cards together  immediately when he    before he deals the card. Now  so I think  number three  I have arranged them in a full house. With queens and    it's OK    queens and tens. That's a challenge. I like this. I will explain later. One  two  three  four  five. I start with three queens. So here you see the contrast when I treat the cards. And two tens. Yeah. Thank you. But also the other hand is good  if all the other guys have good hands too. So these guys have actually a stronger hand    three aces and two kings. This guy beats them with four of a kind  or deuce    deuce. No reaction  That with even    OK  and this. These look in order  I'm probably    hopefully    yeah. Three  four  five  six  seven and ... But  of course  I will have the winning hand. Ten  jack  queen  king  ace. Yeah. So  good. So the hand that looks so good from the beginning  number three  at the end was actually the lowest hand. Such life. Right  So  please mix them. Now  if you are interested  I will demonstrate some underground techniques. Yes  I work with kind of estimation  shuffle tracking    ah  good. Impressive. Thank you. So  first  the first term is estimation. Here  I can estimate exactly how many cards are put between my royal flush. Of course  I can count the cards  but this is much quicker. Right  You agree. So here I have  actually    I know exactly where the cards are. So here  I can make a bet  and this is actually one of the points where I get my money. So here      jack  queen  king  ace. OK. Next is a term    I do it quick. I call this stealing. So here  I think I know about where the cards are. I will spread the cards and you'll say stop  when I point to them  right. Point  say stop. Zoe  Stop. LG  Here    you see some are missing  And that's the stealing cards  which I did. OK. Now  another term called shuffle tracking. Shuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards  even if another person shuffles. This is a little risky. So    because if you look  now  I can still see it. You agree  But if you square    square  and shuffle  and then a cut. So here  to follow my cards  I must look at the shuffle from the begin    ah  we are started together. It's OK  it's OK. Come to    no  no  no  no. I'm joking  yeah  Any style    yeah  good. Here I have to calculate  but actually  I don't like to calculate. I work direct with the right brain. If you pass the left brain  you have to take care of logic and common sense. Direct in the right brain  that's much better. And so    Arthur Benjamin did a little of the same thing. And if you work with  in the right atmosphere  with humor  you have    that's the password to the cosmic bank of knowledge  where you can find any solution of any problem. OK. Now  I drop the cards  and you say stop anyway  right  Not at the last card. Zoe  Stop. LG  Yeah. When I'm sober  I do this much quicker  but we will check. Ah  not in order  it    that was a mistake. No  I'm kidding. No  now and then I put in a mistake  just to emphasize how difficult it is. Right  Yeah  last night I forgot that. That was a mistake. But now I'm glad I remember it. So  this deck is bought here. Sorry. I have a little pad to make it a little softer. This deck is bought here in America. It's called  Bicycle.  And this deck is very flexible  but not so many people know  if you check  if you press at the right spots  you see how thin and flexible this deck is  right  Now  you can carry this in your wallet  so ... You don't see it  make no reaction  So  but here  and    is the camera getting too much  No. Yeah   Audience  It's getting too much.  LG  Pardon  But then  when we will have it back  you do this. But not too much. Then you have to push it down again. Here  please. If you push these heaps    everyone see    push them together so they are really interlaced  right  Yeah  good. Perfect. Just push them through  good. Thank you. And then  I will demonstrate a thing from Russian satellite  stealen    stolen  probably copied from America but we will see. Here    shortcuts. I talk about shortcuts. Now I go very quick through the deck and try to find some pattern. The new chaos theory is already old  right  But you know  I think you are familiar with fractals    the Mandelbrot spirals and all these things. And it's much easier to memorize cards in a pattern way  and not concentrate. If you concentrate and calculate  then you go to    then it's the left brain. But if you just look and talk in another language ... Yeah  great. I think I have it. So now  different persons  older  tap. Please name any card  anyone. Jack of spades. I think jack of spades is number    from the top. One  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine            . Yes  right. So    oh  jack of spades. You said spades   Audience  Yes.  LG  Ah. My fault. Don't applaud  this was clubs. So  jack of spades. I think ...           sorry    . One  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine                                                            ah      yes. It's the last. Now  I do it quicker  better. OK. Another person. Oh  I forgot  I shouldn't shuffle but I think       actually  my technique is to peek  all the time. When I lift the heap  I peek. You see  yeah  perfect. Three  four  five  six. Then I calculate    yeah  good. Another person  another card.  Audience  Seven of diamonds.  LG  Seven of diamonds. Perfect  my favorite  yeah  seven. So I will do it quick  very quick  but in slow motion  so you can follow. Seven of   Audience  Diamonds.  LG  Diamonds  good. I start here. Good  thank you. The thing I did    I peeked. I know where the card were  then I chose it. So another person  another card. Another person. LG  Pardon  LG  Ten of diamonds  yeah. I think I do it the same way. I like to  so I know where it is. Ten of diamonds. But now I do it the regular speed  right  Ten of diamonds. Good. Maybe you will cut  Lift. Excellent. So  thank you. Another person  another card. LG  Pardon   Audience  Five of clubs.  LG  Five of clubs. It's not the same person  even if it's the same spot. We can take some over there later. So now  I will drop the cards. And you'll say stop  anywhere. Got it  Five of clubs. Not the last. Yes  that's difficult to find a card here. We do it again. The person who said five of clubs say stop  when the cards are in the air  right  LG  Very good. OK. OK  I had to use a little force there. I think we save five of clubs. And now a card with a contrast of five of clubs. Excellent. I love that card. Here  I will do the most difficult thing. For example  you are sitting in Las Vegas  and you're betting  and you let the other guys peek this card by mistake. Feel  it's just the regular  one card. And now  when I lift this card  it shall be your card. What was your card  LG  Queen of  Queen of hearts. So that's a tough challenge  right  So here  I grab    you know this  Five of clubs ... and queen of hearts. Yes  This is a tough one  because here I must take advantage of    I switch it with the five of clubs. So  now a false count. Which card shall I use  Queen or five  Zoe  The queen. LG  Queen  yes. So  I use the queen  and here's five of clubs. The false count    and the number one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight    you say the same card all the time. Eight  nine    . This is a kind of optical deal  right  When I put one card at a table    look  it's not one card. It's    look  it's a bunch of cards that gives this impression. Yeah. Now some hard stuff. I think we keep the queen here  yes. Now  to the satellites things. This    oh sorry  don't look at the beam. My fault. This is high frequency laser  and it's enough with a fraction of a second to destroy the retina completely. Right  sorry  my    I should have mentioned that  yeah. But you can relax  because it takes half an hour before it works  so you have plenty of time to see my whole performance. Now  I put the laser here  and    now  when I deal the cards in the laser  I know where they are but    yes  Did the camera got it  No  They didn't  What happened  LG  OK  I'll take another group. Do the cameras see the cards now  No   Audience  No  they're all gone.  LG  But you see the hand. Ah  good  good  good. But now. So now  that was the reason  right  You see the cards  Yes. Yeah  good. Now       one guy laughed. So now  to find the queen  do it this way  take back the other one  take back the queen. Yeah  interesting  but a little dangerous. I liked it. Now  a little more difficult. Name    anyone  name  please  any suit. So here  here I have to peek  lots of cards. I think there are lots of    I don't know how many    but        spades in a deck  at least  right  So every time I lift the heap  I peek  right. Then I arrange them so I can get them quick. Perfect  excellent. So I start with the ace    yeah  ace. Ah  yeah    spades  Same mistake as before  right  So    I arrange the spades    the clubs. I try to do this right here. First  I take the spades. You see  I don't work with prestige  so always do mistakes. It doesn't matter to me. And now and then  I get some extra sympathy points  right  One  two  three  four    yes  the camera got it  Five  six  seven  eight    ah    nine      the jack  jack of spades  queen of    I like that laugh  yeah  Good. Queen. Wait  wait  wait    please take any card. Grab any one. Quick  quick  good. And we switch this to the king. Ace of diamonds. And now  look  ace of diamonds will guide. So I find ... king of spades. There was the place. And here is king of spades  correct  Yeah  OK. Now  a little more difficult thing. Maybe you think I have the cards in order already  so you help me to shuffle again. Another suit  please. LG  It was after the blindfold. I like this guy  yeah. OK. That should be my end effect  but OK. Armani    who said Armani  You  I drop the cards and you    which size  Which size  It's a piece of cake. I like challenges. Which size  Say stop.  Audience  Stop.  LG  Yeah  Armani. OK. Ah  this is tough. OK  a suit. I had clubs before  spades. Another suit.  Audience  Diamonds.  LG  Diamonds  perfect. So  in this case  I try to locate diamonds. I look at the cards  and OK. We try. Yeah. You help me. If I drop the card face up  like this  you reverse it. Zoe  OK. LG  OK  now. Do with both hands  and quick. Yes  good  good. I think we have it now. Yeah  good  good. So here  diamonds  hearts    no  diamonds. Good  good. Stop. Do you see the pattern  No  Now  Yes  yes  OK. I work with pattern. Oh sorry  I dropped one. Maybe it's important    yeah    nine of diamonds  OK. So now    I always ask  why do I put myself in this position  I have to figure out so many outs  when I miss some cards  but I love it. So now  I will do it. I will try to find the diamonds  but I will do it the hard way. It's too easy to do it right away  right  I think I will do it ... blindfolded. At this distance  it works immediately. Aargh  Duct tape. I look    shake the cards  so I don't. Go ahead. Yeah  good. I like the empathy. Empathy. But it was    did you hear  It was women's voice. Hear the guy    yeah  more  more  more. Yeah  good. Yeah. You can take the nostril too  because some guys think       some guys think I can peek through the nostril  so do more. Go  go. Right  Good. Satisfied  Looks good  like Batman. Ow  No  with dignity and elegance  right  But I like her  yeah. I said  be a little tough. And it was OK. One more  The last. OK. All right. Now you must agree that I'm    I must rely on other senses  right  I work with vibration. So  what was the card  Diamonds. Ah  I memorized hearts. So now I have to improvise again. Maybe I'll stand up. Half. Diamonds    I'll start with ace of diamonds. Just kidding  warming up    king of hearts. And I give you a diamonds  so they    so you put them here  in a nice row  right. And you can see  yeah  Good. Ace of diamonds  yes  Zoe  Yeah. LG  Good. Good. Two     Applause     thank you. I never ever miss two. This is interesting. Always I've found two  but the wrong color. Spades  sorry. And the deck is a gift to you after  so let the skepticals here  in this  examine them  right  Remind me. It's a gift. Two    and it was two of spades  right  Sorry  two of diamonds. I'll do it quick now. Three    three of diamonds. Yes  Four    I like challenges  yes. Yeah  good. Chris Anderson  You're peeking. LG  Pardon  CA  You're peeking. You just got to    this is a request from the lady in the back. Okay. Try that. LG  Yeah. Also listen. OK  now. This is maybe a little tough. We will try. Yes  Good  OK. So  how many cards  Five  Zoe  Four. LG  Four. Is five the next card  Zoe  Five of diamonds  yeah. LG  It's not here  Zoe  It's not there. LG  Oh. So here  all the cards are face down    you agree   Audience  Yes.  LG  Yes  You see that in the screen  And this is face up  and it's not at the bottom here. So next card will be    was it five  Zoe  Five. LG  Yeah    I will reverse it face up here. Yes  Zoe  Yeah. LG  Six    six with the thumb. Seven. Yeah  I do this. I know where it is  because I peeked before and then I do this. Right  Eight. If    and then nine  right  Yeah. Yesterday    the day before yesterday  I was in Vegas  and I used this actually. Nine  Yeah  Correct  No  Yes  Ah  good  good. Ten    once again  I love this Jonny Wayne move. Yeah. Jack    you  unclear  with Jack  Jack of diamonds  correct   Audience  No.  LG  Yes  And queen  Queen  with misdirection. Misdirection.  Applause  Yeah  And then  king  after exactly five seconds. Yeah. Five. Five seconds. One  two  three  four    mmm  Check it. Yes  CA  King of diamonds. LG  Ah  Good. Oh. Touch me  feel    ah  ah  you know  CA  Ladies and gentlemen  Lennart Green  LG  Okay  thank you. Dogs have interests. They have interest sniffing each other  chasing squirrels. And if we don't make that a reward in training  that will be a distraction. It's always sort of struck me as really a scary thought that if you see a dog in a park  and the owner is calling it  and the owner says  you know   Puppy  come here  come here   and the dog thinks   Hmm  interesting. I'm sniffing this other dog's rear end  the owner's calling.  It's a difficult choice  right  Rear end  owner. Rear end wins. I mean  you lose. You cannot compete with the environment  if you have an adolescent dog's brain. So  when we train  we're always trying to take into account the dog's point of view. Now  I'm here largely because there's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment that    on one side  we have people who think that you train a dog  number one  by making up rules  human rules. We don't take the dog's point of view into account. So the human says   You're going to act this way  damn it. We're going to force you to act against your will  to bend to our will.  Then  number two  we keep these rules a secret from the dog. And then number three  now we can punish the dog for breaking rules he didn't even know existed. So you get a little puppy  he comes. His only crime is he grew. When he was a little puppy  he puts his paws on your leg    you know  isn't that nice  And you go   Oh  there's a good boy.  You bend down  you pat him    you reward him for jumping up. His one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff  and a few months later  he weighs  you know     pounds. Every time he jumps up  he gets all sorts of abuse. I mean  it is really very  very scary the abuse that dogs get. So  this whole dominance issue    number one  what we get in dog training is this Mickey Mouse interpretation of a very complicated social system. And they take this stuff seriously. Male dogs are very serious about a hierarchy  because it prevents physical fights. Of course  female dogs  bitches  on the other hand  have several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule. The number one is   I have it  you don't.  And what you will find is a very  very low ranking bitch will quite easily keep a bone away from a high ranking male. So  we get in dog training this notion of dominances  or of the alpha dog. I'm sure that you've heard this. Dogs get so abused. Dogs  horses and humans    these are the three species which are so abused in life. And the reason is built into their behavior    is to always come back and apologize. Like   Oh  I'm sorry you had to beat me. I'm really sorry  yes  it's my fault.  They are just so beatable  and that's why they get beaten. The poor puppy jumps up  you open the dog book  what does it say   Hold his front paws  squeeze his front paws  stamp on his hind feet  squirt him in the face with lemon juice  hit him on the head with a rolled up newspaper  knee him in the chest  flip him over backwards.  Because he grew  And because he's performing a behavior you've trained him to do  This is insanity. I ask owners   Well  how would you like the dog to greet you   And people say   Well  I don't know  to sit  I guess.  I said   Let's teach him to sit.  And then we give him a reason for sitting. Because the first stage is basically teaching a dog ESL. I could speak to you and say   Laytay chai  paisey  paisey.  Go on  something should happen now. Why aren't you responding  Oh  you don't speak Swahili. Well  I've got news for you. The dog doesn't speak English  or American  or Spanish  or French. So the first stage in training is to teach the dog ESL  English as a second language. And that's how we use the food lure in the hand  and we use food because we're dealing with owners. My wife doesn't need food    she's a great trainer  much better than I am. I don't need food  but the average owner says   Puppy  sit.  Or they go   Sit  sit  sit.  They're making a hand signal in front of the dog's rectum for some reason  like the dog has a third eye there    it's insane. You know   Sit  sit.  No  we go   Puppy  sit     boom  it's got it in six to    trials. Then we phase out the food as a lure  and now the dog knows that  sit  means sit  and you can actually communicate to a dog in a perfectly constructed English sentence.  Phoenix  come here  take this  and go to Jamie  please.  And I've taught her  Phoenix    come here    take this    go to  and the name of my son   Jamie.  And the dog can take a note  and I've got my own little search and rescue dog. He'll find Jamie wherever he is  you know  wherever kids are  crushing rocks by a stream or something  and take him a little message that says   Hey  dinner's ready. Come in for dinner.  So  at this point  the dog knows what we want it to do. Will it do it  Not necessarily  no. As I said  if he's in the park and there's a rear end to sniff  why come to the owner  The dog lives with you  the dog can get you any time. The dog can sniff your butt  if you like  when he wants to. At the moment  he's in the park  and you are competing with smells  and other dogs  and squirrels. So the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do  and this is very easy. We use the Premack principle. Basically  we follow a low frequency behavior    one the dog doesn't want to do    by a high frequency behavior  commonly known as a behavior problem  or a dog hobby    something the dog does like to do. That will then become a reward for the lower frequency behavior. So we go   sit   on the couch   sit   tummy rub   sit   look  I throw a tennis ball   sit   say hello to that other dog. Yes  we put  sniff butt  on queue.  Sit   sniff butt. So now all of these distractions that worked against training now become rewards that work for training. And what we're doing  in essence  is we're teaching the dog  kind of like    we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us. And I can imagine this dog  you know  speaking through the fence to  say  an Akita  saying   Wow  my owners  they are so incredibly easy to train. They're like Golden Retrievers. All I have to do is sit  and they do everything. They open doors  they drive my car  they massage me  they will throw tennis balls  they will cook for me and serve the food. It's like  if I just sit  that's my command. Then I have my own personal doorman  chauffeur  masseuse  chef and waiter.  And now the dog's really happy. And this  to me  is always what training is. So we really motivate the dog to want to do it  such that the need for punishment seldom comes up. Now we move to phase three  when now    there's times  you know  when daddy knows best. And I have a little sign on my fridge  and it says   Because I'm the daddy  that's why.  Sorry  no more explanation.  I'm the daddy  you're not. Sit.  And there's times  for example  if my son's friends leave the door open  the dogs have to know you don't step across this line. This is a life or death thing. You leave this  the sanctity of your house  and you could be hit on the street. So some things we have to let the dog know   You mustn't do this.  And so we have to enforce  but without force. People here get very confused about what a punishment is. They think a punishment is something nasty. I bet a lot of you do  right  You think it's something painful  or scary  or nasty. It doesn't have to be. There's several definitions of what a punishment is  but one definition  the most popular  is  a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior  such that it's less likely to occur in the future. It does not have to be nasty  scary or painful. And I would say  if it doesn't have to be  then maybe it shouldn't be. I was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago. And this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital  plus the brother in law  plus the child. And I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house  and they never took it outside. The dog is actually euthanized now  but this was a dog I worked with for a while. A lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen  so while I was there    this was on the fourth visit    we did a four and a half hour down stay  with the dog on his mat. And he was kept there by the owner's calm insistence. When the dog would try to leave the mat  she would say   Rover  on the mat  on the mat  on the mat.  The dog broke his down stay    times in four and a half hours  while she cooked dinner  because we had a lot of aggression related towards food. The breaks got fewer and fewer. You see  the punishment was working. The behavior problem was going away. She never raised her voice. If she did  she would have got bitten. It's not a good dog you shout at. And a lot of my friends train really neat animals  grizzly bears    if you've ever seen a grizzly bear on the telly or in film  then it's a friend of mine who's trained it    killer whales. I love it because it wires you up. How are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear   Bad bear  bad bear   Voom  Your head now is     yards away  sailing through the air  OK  This is crazy. So  where do we go from here  We want a better way. Dogs deserve better. But for me  the reason for this actually has to do with dogs. It has to do with watching people train puppies  and realizing they have horrendous interaction skills  horrendous relationship skills. Not just with their puppy  but with the rest of the family at class. I mean  my all time classic is another  come here  one. You see someone in the park    and I'll cover my mic when I say this  because I don't want to wake you up    and there's the owner in the park  and their dog's over here  and they say   Rover  come here. Rover  come here. Rover  come here  you son of a bitch.  The dog says   I don't think so.  I mean  who in their right mind would think that a dog would want to approach them when they're screaming like that  Instead  the dog says   I know that tone. I know that tone. Previously  when I've approached  I've gotten punished there.  I was walking onto a plane    this  for me  was a pivotal moment in my career  and it really cemented what I wanted to do with this whole puppy training thing  the notion of how to teach puppies in a dog friendly way to want to do what we want to do  so we don't have to force them. You know  I puppy train my child. And the seminal moment was  I was getting on a plane in Dallas  and in row two was a father  I presume  and a young boy about five  kicking the back of the chair.  Johnny  don't do that.  Kick  kick  kick.  Johnny  don't do that.  Kick  kick  kick. I'm standing right here with my bag. The father leans over  grabs him like this and gives him ugly face. And ugly face is this    when you go face to face with a puppy or a child  you say   What are you doing  Now stop it  stop it  stop it   And I went   Oh my God  do I do something   That child has lost everything    that one of the two people he can trust in this world has absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet. And I thought   Do I tell this jerk to quit it   I thought   Ian  stay out of it  stay out of it  you know  walk on.  I walked to the back of the plane  I sat down  and a thought came to me. If that had been a dog  I would have laid him out. If he had kicked a dog  I would have punched him out. He kicked a child  grabs the child like this and I let it go. And this is what it's all about. These relationship skills are so easy. I mean  we as humans  our shallowness when we choose a life mate based on the three Cs    coat color  conformation  cuteness. You know  kind of like a little robot. This is how we go into a relationship  and it's hunky dory for a year. And then  a little behavior problem comes up. No different from the dog barking. The husband won't clear up his clothes  or the wife's always late for meetings  whatever it is  OK  And it then starts  and we get into this thing  and our personal feedback    there's two things about it. When you watch people interacting with animals or other people  there is very little feedback  it's too infrequent. And when it happens  it's bad  it's nasty. You see it's especially in families  especially with spouses  especially with children  especially with parents. You see it especially in the workplace  especially from boss to employee. It's as if there's some schadenfreude there  that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong  so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them. And this  I would say  is the biggest human foible that we have. It really is. We take the good for granted  and we moan and groan at the bad. And I think this whole notion of these skills should be taught. You know  calculus is wonderful. When I was a kid  I was a calculus whiz. I don't understand a thing about it now  but I could do it as a kid. Geometry  fantastic. You know  quantum mechanics    these are cool things. But they don't save marriages and they don't raise children. And my look to the future is  and what I want to do with this doggy stuff  is to teach people that you know  your husband's just as easy to train. Probably easier    if you got a Rottie    much easier to train. Your kids are easy to train. All you've got to do is to watch them  to time sample the behavior  and say  every five minutes  you ask the question   Is it good  or is it bad   If it's good  say   That was really neat  thank you.  That is such a powerful training technique. This should be taught in schools. Relationships    how do you negotiate  How you do negotiate with your friend who wants your toy  You know  how to prepare you for your first relationship  How on earth about raising children  We think how we do it    one night in bed  we're pregnant  and then we're raising the most important thing in life  a child. No  this is what should be taught    the good living  the good habits  which are just as hard to break as bad habits. So  that would be my wish to the future. Ah  damn  I wanted to end exactly on time  but I got eight  seven  six  five  four  three  two    so thank you very much. That's my talk  thank you. I d like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo  who was put to sleep a couple of days ago  because he got too old. But apparently he was a very nice dog and he always let the cat sleep in the dog bed.    Dog panting noise  Heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh.     I'm just a'walking my dog  singing my song  strolling along.     Yeah  it's just me and my dog  catching some sun. We can't go wrong.     My life was lonely and blue.     Yeah  I was sad as a sailor      I was an angry 'un too.     Then there was you    appeared when I was entangled with youth and fear      and nerves jingle jangled  vermouth and beer were getting me mangled up.     But then I looked in your eyes     and I was no more a failure.     You looked so wacky and wise.     And I said   Lord  I'm happy  'cause I'm just a'walking my dog      catching some sun. We can't go wrong.      Yeah  it's just me and my dog  singing our song  strolling along.     'Cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt      and I don't care what the politicians spout.     If you need a companion  why  just go out to the pound      and find yourself a hound  and make that doggie proud      'cause that's what it's all about.      Dog panting noise  Heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh.     My life was tragic and sad.     I was the archetypal loser.     I was a pageant gone bad.     And then there was you    on time  and wagging your tail     in the cutest mime that you was in jail.     I said   Woof  be mine   and you gave a wail and then     I was no longer alone.     And I was no more a boozer.     We'll make the happiest home.     And I said   Lord  I'm happy  'cause I m just a'walking my dog      singing my song  strolling along.      Yeah  it's just me and my dog  catching some sun. We can't go wrong      'cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt      and I don t care what the politicians spout.     If you need a companion  why  just go out to the pound      and find yourself a hound  and make that doggie proud      'cause that's what it's all about      that's what it's all about      that's what it's all abou BOW WOW WOW WOW     that's what it's all about.      Dog panting noise  Heh  heh  heh  heh  heh.   Good dog  Thank you. Ninety nine percent of us have the dream of listeners. Not being the musicians    the listeners  right  And we crave one thing  even though we kind of don't know it all the time. We crave to be in the room with the musician the day it was recorded  the day it was played. And we go to live concerts  and we get that as much as we can. But then we listen to the other    percent of our stuff recorded. And it turns out the further back you go in history  the little rougher it sounds. And so we said  there's a solution to this. Let's separate the performance  as a thing  out from the recording  which was how it was made. You know  the thing with microphones in the room and all that day. But the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers  and what instruments they were using. And it's the data hidden inside the recording. In order to do this  it's a lot of hardware and software that runs in a very high resolution. And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro that looks like a nice grand piano there. And you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things    but full of solenoids  and fiber optics  and computers and all this kind of stuff. The highest resolution out of Japan. And this just didn't work until we could cross this line that says high definition. And we were able to cross this line  called the uncanny valley  in terms of    artificial intelligence terms. We have a process where we  you know  kind of put it into the computer and digitize it  and then a whole lot of analysis. And we look at every single note  and all the attributes of those notes  how hard they were struck  and how they were held down  and how you move the fingers. So we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers. And  you know  it's a thing your piano teacher teaches you  but we never had a science behind these kinds of things. I'm going to start with Glenn Gould. He died    years ago this year  and was born    years ago this year. Was a beloved pianist  maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century. He just got tired of being in front of an audience  and felt like    a performing monkey was  in fact  his term. So he stepped back  and did nothing but the crafting of his work. And Gould's specialty was playing Bach. His maybe most famous recording was something called  The Goldberg Variations.  Bach only wrote themes and variations one time. He wrote some early pieces  but late in his life  in his mature period  he said   Here's a theme       variations.  In fact  the theme isn't even the melody  it's the bass line. And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about  one in mono  and one in stereo. And the one in mono  by the way  he used the pedal  and as he got older  he said   No  no  wait a minute. I'm going to get very scientific about this  and not use the pedal.  What I'd like you to hear live is the      version  and we'll play the first couple pieces of it. Glenn Gould      . How about that  So let me tell you a little bit how this was done. First of all  let me get you to the end step. This is    we have a fairly complex process that  you know  software and musicians and so on  but when we're all done  we know that the ear is the final arbiter. We can play the original in one ear  and a new recording in the other. So I'm going to do this for you right now  what you just heard. And in the right speaker is going to be the original recording  and the left speaker is going to be the new recording  actually of an instrument just like that one  and I'm going to play them together at the same time. That's the original.  Unclear  That's the two together. Before  Jurassic Park   there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle  right  So  in the video world  we've been able to invent  in our lifetimes  natural behavior. And this is kind of another example of putting a science behind natural behavior. And then you heard the original. Ultimately  I started with the experience. And the experience is  I want to be in the room and hear the musicians. Lots of you can afford to buy one of these. But  if not  there is now high definition surround sound. And I got to tell you  if you haven't heard high definition surround  go down to your audio dealer  your audiophile dealer. It's so involving compared to regular stereo. But if you don't have that  maybe you can listen on your headphones. And so on the same disk we have five recordings    Sony has five recordings. And you could listen in headphones with this thing called binaural recording. And it's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument  and it's got microphones where the ears are. And when you put on headphones  and you listen to this  you're inside of Glenn Gould's body. And it is a chuckle until  you know  the musicians  who are musicians who play the piano  listen to this  say   I can't believe it  It's just what it's like to play the piano.  Except now you're inside Glenn Gould's body playing the piano  and it feels like your fingers are making the decisions and moving through the whole process. It's a game changer. Here's now something we know in spectacular quality. The whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. What you heard today was not perfect. It's an amalgam of wood  and cast iron  and felt  and steel strings  and all these  and they're all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity. So when you go into the recording session  you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to. There's the whole action there  sitting  kind of  on the side  and the dummy head and our recording engineers standing around while we rebuild the piano. Without putting dates next to these things  step by step music will be turned into data  like every field that's occurred in the past    or    years. Audio has come very late to this game    I'm not talking about digitizing  and bits  and re mastering. I'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from  which is how it was performed. And audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool    they're high resolution  and they're wired straight to our emotions  and you can't trick them very easily. Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement  you know. All right  there's this episode of  Star Trek.  I get it    it was all just laid in for me yesterday there. The episode of  Star Trek  for me was James Daly played Methuselah    remember this one  And at some point he's dancing with his    and I won't ruin the episode for you  from     . Right  do you know where I'm going  And Nimoy  I'm sorry  Spock sits down at the piano  and he starts playing this Brahms waltz  and they all dance to it. And then Spock turns round  he goes   James  I know all of the Brahms waltzes  and I don't believe this is one of them in the category.  That's where I'm at. I want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn't write. I want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn't play. But I believe we're on a path now  when we get to data  that we can distill styles  and templates  and formulas  and all these kinds of things  again  that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world. It's now coming in this world. The transition will be this one. It says right now  we think music is notes and how they're played. And I believe this is coming. Because what you've just heard was a computer playing data    no Glenn Gould in the room. But yet  it was human. And I believe you'll get to the next step  the real dream of listeners. Every time you listen to a recording today  every time you take out your iPod and whatever  every time you listen to it  it's the same thing    it's frozen. Wouldn't it be cool if every time you listened  it could be different  This morning  you're sadder  you want to hear your song  the same song  played sadder than you did yesterday. You want to hear it played by different musicians. You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever. We've seen all these  Star Treks   and they're all holodeck episodes as well. Every time I listen to that  I get goose bumps. It's so amazing  it's so exciting. Every time I listen to that recording it's like   Oh my God  I can't believe I'm in the same room. I can't believe this is happening.  It's a way better experience than whatever you're used to listening to  in whatever form. And lastly  I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum. So I've really overshot my budget here. We made a new recording of him playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September. It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in     . And I've got to tell you  we have this lab where we build and measure everything  back in Raleigh  North Carolina  and we flew out to Los Angeles. And as the president of the company  I didn't feel real comfortable about where we were. That's a real uncomfortable feeling  when all the equipment's come out and a whole Sony team  and people are going to be sitting there in the audience. And we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine  which has not changed since       still seats       people. And on the sweet spot on the stage  Tatum starts playing ... and every note  every beat  every slur  every accent  every pedal was perfect  because he played it for that room on that day. And we captured all that data all over again. And I want you to hear that right now. And fortunately  it's right in here. This is an encore he used to do. It's one minute long. It's an Irish jig  and I want you to hear his humor. And that's just what the live audience did. So thank you very much  Michael  thank you for the opportunity. I have a tough job to do. You know  when I looked at the profile of the audience here  with their connotations and design  in all its forms  and with so much and so many people working on collaborative and networks  and so on  that I wanted to tell you  I wanted to build an argument for primary education in a very specific context. In order to do that in    minutes  I have to bring out four ideas    it's like four pieces of a puzzle. And if I succeed in doing that  maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on  and perhaps help me do my work. The first piece of the puzzle is remoteness and the quality of education. Now  by remoteness  I mean two or three different kinds of things. Of course  remoteness in its normal sense  which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center  you get to remoter areas. What happens to education  The second  or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world  you have pockets  like slums  or shantytowns  or poorer areas  which are socially and economically remote from the rest of the city  so it's us and them. What happens to education in that context  So keep both of those ideas of remoteness. We made a guess. The guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers. If they do have  they cannot retain those teachers. They do not have good enough infrastructure. And if they had some infrastructure  they have difficulty maintaining it. But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was we hired a car  looked up on Google  found a route into northern India from New Delhi which  you know  which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about     kilometers  and wherever we found a school  administered a set of standard tests  and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph. The graph was interesting  although you need to consider it carefully. I mean  this is a very small sample  you should not generalize from it. But it was quite obvious  quite clear  that for this particular route that I had taken  the remoter the school was  the worse its results seemed to be. That seemed a little damning  and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure  or with the availability of electricity  and things like that. To my surprise  it did not correlate. It did not correlate with the size of classrooms. It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure. It did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate. But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire to each of these schools  with one single question for the teachers    which was   Would you like to move to an urban  metropolitan area         percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that  they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi  and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi    because  you know  those are relatively better off areas    and then from     kilometers out of Delhi  the answer is consistently yes. I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that  I wish I was in some other school  probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results. So it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools  as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat  and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms and that sort of thing. It appears that way. When you take education and technology  then I find in the literature that  you know  things like websites  collaborative environments    you've been listening to all that in the morning    it's always piloted first in the best schools  the best urban schools  and  according to me  biases the result. The literature    one part of it  the scientific literature    consistently blames ET as being over hyped and under performing. The teachers always say  well  it's fine  but it's too expensive for what it does. Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting  let's say     percent of whatever they could do. You put in this new super duper technology  and now they get    percent. So the principal looks at it and says    percent for         dollars  Forget it. If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools  where the score was    percent  and  let's say  took that up to    percent    that will be a completely different thing. So the relative change that ET  Educational Technology  would make  would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top  but we seem to be doing it the other way about. So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach the underprivileged first  not the other way about. And finally came the question of  how do you tackle teacher perception  Whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology  the teacher's first reaction is  you cannot replace a teacher with a machine    it's impossible. I don't know why it's impossible  but  even for a moment  if you did assume that it's impossible    I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke  the science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo  and he said something which completely solves this problem. He said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine  should be. So  you know  it puts the teacher into a tough bind  you have to think. Anyway  so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education  whatever alternative you want  is required where schools don't exist  where schools are not good enough  where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough  for whatever reason. If you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies  then you don't need an alternative education. So far I haven't come across such an area  except for one case. I won't name the area  but somewhere in the world people said  we don't have this problem  because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools. There are such areas  but    anyway  I'd never heard that anywhere else. I'm going to talk about children and self organization  and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like. They're called the hole in the wall experiments. I'll have to really rush through this. They're a set of experiments. The first one was done in New Delhi in     . And what we did over there was pretty much simple. I had an office in those days which bordered a slum  an urban slum  so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum. They cut a hole inside that wall    which is how it has got the name hole in the wall    and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole  sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end  a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall  put it on high speed Internet  put the Internet Explorer there  put it on Altavista.com    in those days    and just left it there. And this is what we saw. So that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole in the wall. About eight hours later  we found this kid. To the right is this eight year old child who    and to his left is a six year old girl  who is not very tall. And what he was doing was  he was teaching her to browse. So it sort of raised more questions than it answered. Is this real  Does the language matter  because he's not supposed to know English  Will the computer last  or will they break it and steal it    and did anyone teach them  The last question is what everybody said  but you know  I mean  they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office  can you show me how to do it  and then somebody taught him. So I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it  this time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India  where I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything. So it was a warm day  and the hole in the wall was on that decrepit old building. This is the first kid who came there  he later on turned out to be a    year old school dropout. He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad. Very quickly  he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad something moves on the screen    and later on he told me   I have never seen a television where you can do something.  So he figured that out. It took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television. And then  as he was doing that  he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad    you'll see him do that. He did that  and the Internet Explorer changed page. Eight minutes later  he looked from his hand to the screen  and he was browsing  he was going back and forth. When that happened  he started calling all the neighborhood children  like  children would come and see what's happening over here. And by the evening of that day     children were all browsing. So eight minutes and an embedded computer seemed to be all that we needed there. So we thought that this is what was happening  that children in groups can self instruct themselves to use a computer and the Internet. But under what circumstances  At this time there was a    the main question was about English. People said  you know  you really ought to have this in Indian languages. So I said  have what  shall I translate the Internet into some Indian language  That's not possible. So  it has to be the other way about. But let's see  how do the children tackle the English language  I took the experiment out to northeastern India  to a village called Madantusi  where  for some reason  there was no English teacher  so the children had not learned English at all. And I built a similar hole in the wall. One big difference in the villages  as opposed to the urban slums  there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk. In the urban slums  the girls tend to stay away. I left the computer there with lots of CDs    I didn't have any Internet    and came back three months later. So when I came back there  I found these two kids  eight  and    year olds  who were playing a game on the computer. And as soon as they saw me they said   We need a faster processor and a better mouse.  I was real surprised. You know  how on earth did they know all this  And they said   Well  we've picked it up from the CDs.  So I said   But how did you understand what's going on over there   So they said   Well  you've left this machine which talks only in English  so we had to learn English.  So then I measured  and they were using     English words with each other    mispronounced  but correct usage    words like exit  stop  find  save  that kind of thing  not only to do with the computer but in their day to day conversations. So  Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier  in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really wanted to. Finally  I got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable  if they happen everywhere else. India is a good place to do such an experiment in  because we have all the ethnic diversities  all the    you know  the genetic diversity  all the racial diversities  and also all the socio economic diversities. So  I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world. So I did this for almost five years  and this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of India. This is the Himalayas. Up in the north  very cold. I also had to check or invent an engineering design which would survive outdoors  and I was using regular  normal PCs  so I needed different climates  for which India is also great  because we have very cold  very hot  and so on. This is the desert to the west. Near the Pakistan border. And you see here a little clip of    one of these villages    the first thing that these children did was to find a website to teach themselves the English alphabet. Then to central India    very warm  moist  fishing villages  where humidity is a very big killer of electronics. So we had to solve all the problems we had without air conditioning and with very poor power  so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running. I want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again. This sequence is also nice. This is a small child  a six year old  telling his eldest sister what to do. And this happens very often with these computers  that the younger children are found teaching the older ones. What did we find  We found that six  to    year olds can self instruct in a connected environment  irrespective of anything that we could measure. So if they have access to the computer  they will teach themselves  including intelligence. I couldn't find a single correlation with anything  but it had to be in groups. And that may be of great  you know  interest to this group  because all of you are talking about groups. So here was the power of what a group of children can do  if you lift the adult intervention. Just a quick idea of the measurements. We took standard statistical techniques  so I'm going to not talk about that. But we got a clean learning curve  almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school. I'll leave it at that  because  I mean  it sort of says it all  doesn't it  What could they learn to do  Basic Windows functions  browsing  painting  chatting and email  games and educational material  music downloads  playing video. In short  what all of us do. And over     children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer. So  how do they do that  If you calculated the actual time of access  it would work out to minutes per day  so that's not how it's happening. What you have  actually  is there is one child operating the computer. And surrounding him are usually three other children  who are advising him on what they should do. If you test them  all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them. Around these four are usually a group of about    children  who are also advising  usually wrongly  about everything that's going on on the computer. And all of them also will clear a test given on that subject. So they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing. It seems counter intuitive to adult learning  but remember  eight year olds live in a society where most of the time they are told  don't do this  you know  don't touch the whiskey bottle. So what does the eight year old do  He observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched. And if you tested him  he would answer every question correctly on that topic. So  they seem to be able to acquire very quickly. So what was the conclusion over the six years of work  It was that primary education can happen on its own  or parts of it can happen on its own. It does not have to be imposed from the top downwards. It could perhaps be a self organizing system  so that was the second bit that I wanted to tell you  that children can self organize and attain an educational objective. The third piece was on values  and again  to put it very briefly  I conducted a test over     children spread across all over India  and asked them    I gave them about    different values oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions. We got all sorts of opinions. Yes  no or I don't know. I simply took those questions where I got    percent yeses and    percent noes    so I was able to get a collection of    such statements. These were areas where the children were clearly confused  because half said yes and half said no. A typical example being   Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies.  They don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question  perhaps none of us do. So I leave you with this third question. Can technology alter the acquisition of values  Finally  self organizing systems  about which  again  I won't say too much because you've been hearing all about it. Natural systems are all self organizing  galaxies  molecules  cells  organisms  societies    except for the debate about an intelligent designer. But at this point in time  as far as science goes  it's self organization. But other examples are traffic jams  stock market  society and disaster recovery  terrorism and insurgency. And you know about the Internet based self organizing systems. So here are my four sentences then. Remoteness affects the quality of education. Educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first  and other areas later. Values are acquired  doctrine and dogma are imposed    the two opposing mechanisms. And learning is most likely a self organizing system. If you put all the four together  then it gives    according to me    it gives us a goal  a vision  for educational technology. An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital  automatic  fault tolerant  minimally invasive  connected and self organized. As educationists  we have never asked for technology  we keep borrowing it. PowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology  but it was not meant for education  it was meant for making boardroom presentations. We borrowed it. Video conferencing. The personal computer itself. I think it's time that the educationists made their own specs  and I have such a set of specs. This is a brief look at that. And such a set of specs should produce the technology to address remoteness  values and violence. So I thought I'd give it a name    why don't we call it  outdoctrination.  And could this be a goal for educational technology in the future  So I want to leave that as a thought with you. Thank you. So what's image got do with it  And I must say  I think Emeka is trying to send a lot of subliminal messages  because I'm going to keep harping on some of the issues that have come up. But I'm going to try and do something different  and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories  and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we've been talking about. So  Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions  as you can see. We're not the only ones. And you know  it's amazing. I mean  we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent. Just think about that  you know  And this is typically what we've been talking about  the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff. Now  why is that a problem  A typical disaster story  disease  corruption  poverty. And some of you might be standing here thinking  saying   OK  you know  Ory  you're Harvard educated  and all you privileged people come here  saying  'Forget the poor people. Let's focus on business and the markets  and whatever.'   And they're all   There's the    percent of Africans who really need help.  And I want to tell you that this is my story  OK  And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here. We start with poverty. I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire  but I know what it is to grow up without having money  or being able to support family. Euvin was talking about bellwether signs. The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast. You know  when things were good  we had eggs and sausages. When things were bad  we had porridge. And like many African families  my parents could never save because they supported siblings  cousins  you know  their parents  and things were always dicey. Now  when I was born  they realized they had a pretty smart kid  and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school  which was free. And they adopted a very interesting approach to education  which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford. So they took me to a private  Catholic  elementary school  which set the foundation for what ended up being my career. And what happened was  because they could afford it sometimes  sometimes not  I got kicked out pretty much every term. You know  someone would come in with a list of the people who haven't paid school fees  and when they started getting pretty strict  you had to leave  until your school fees could be paid. And I remember thinking  I mean  why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school  Because you know  as a kid you're embarrassed and you're sensitive  and everyone knows you guys don't have money. But they kept at it  and I now understand why they did what they did. They talk about corruption. In Kenya  we have an entrance exam to go into high school. And there's national schools  which are like the best schools  and provincial schools. My dream school at that time was Kenya High School  a national school. I missed the cutoff by one point. And I was so disappointed  and I was like   Oh my God  you know  what am I going to do   And my father said   OK  listen. Let's go and try and talk to the headmistress. You know  it's just one point. I mean  maybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there.  So we went to the school  and because we were nobodies  and because we didn't have privilege  and because my father didn't have the right last name  he was treated like dirt. And I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him  saying  you know  who do you think you are  And  you know  you must be joking if you think you can get a slot. And I had gone to school with other girls  who were kids of politicians  and who had done much  much worse than I did  and they had slots there. And there's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you  you know  And we left  and I swore to myself  and I was like   I'm never  ever going to have to beg for anything in my life.  They called me two weeks later  they're like  oh  yeah  you can come now. And I told them to stuff it. Final story  and I sort of have to speak quickly. Disease. My father  who I've been talking about  died of AIDS in     . He never told anyone that he had AIDS  his fear of the stigma was so strong. And I'm pretty much the one who figured it out  because I was a nerd. And I was in the States at the time  and they called me. He was very sick  the first time he got sick. And he had Cryptococcal meningitis. And so I went on to Google  Cryptococcal meningitis  you know. Because of doctor patient privilege  they couldn't really tell us what was going on. But they were like  you know  this is a long term thing. And when I went online and looked at the infectious    read about the disease  I pretty much realized what was going on. The first time he got sick  he recovered. But what happened was that he had to be on medication that  at that time    Diflucan  which in the States is used for yeast infections    cost    dollars a pill. He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life. You know  so money ran out. He got sick again. And up until that time  he had a friend who used to travel to India  and he used to import  bring him  could get him a generic version of it. And that kept him going. But the money ran out. He got sick again. He got sick on a Friday. At that time  there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya  and we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash for him to start the treatment until Monday. The hospital put him on a water drip for three days. And finally  we figured  well  OK  we'd better just try and take him to a public hospital. At least he'll get treated while we try to figure out the money situation. And he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him. And  you know  now  imagine if    and I could go on and on    imagine if this is all you know about me. How would you look at me  With pity  you know. Sadness. And this is how you look at Africa. This is the damage it causes. You don't see the other side of me. You don't see the blogger  you don't see the Harvard educated lawyer  the vibrant person  you know  And I just wanted to personalize that. Because we talk about it in big terms  and you wonder  you know  so what  But it's damaging. And I'm not unique  right  Imagine if all you knew about William was the fact that he grew up in a poor village. And you didn't know about the windmill  you know  And I was just moved. I was actually crying during his presentation. He was like  I try and I make. I was like Nike should hire him  you know   Just do it   And this is  again  the point I'm trying to make. When you focus just on the disasters       we're ignoring the potential. So  what is to be done  First of all  Africans  we need to get better at telling our stories. We heard about that yesterday. We had some of them this morning. And this is an example  you know  blogging is one way of doing that. Afrigator is an aggregator of African blogs that was developed in South Africa. So we need to start getting better. If no one else will tell our stories  let's do it. And going back to the point I was trying to make  this is the Swahili Wikipedia. Swahili is spoken by about    million people in East Africa. It only has five contributors. Four of them are white males    non native speakers. The other person is    Ndesanjo  if you're here  stand up    is a Tanzanian   the  first Swahili blogger. He's the only African who's contributing to this. People  please. We can't whine and complain the West is doing this. What are we doing  Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers  Why are we not generating our own content  You know  it's not enough to complain. We need to act. Reuters now integrates African blogs into their coverage of Africa. So  that's a start  and we've heard of all their other initiatives. The cheetah generation. The aid approach  you know  is flawed. And after all the hoopla of Live    we're still not anywhere in the picture. No  you're not. But the point I'm trying to make  though  is that it's not enough for us to criticize. And for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should I be  should I move back  should I stay  You know  just jump. The continent needs you. And I can't emphasize that enough  you know. I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C.  Covington and Burling  six figures. With two paychecks  or three paychecks  I could solve a lot of my family's problems. But I walked away from that  because my passion was here  and because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling. And because I'm needed here  you know  I probably can win a prize for the most ways to use a Harvard Law School degree because of all the things I'm doing. One is because I'm pretty aggressive  and I try and find  you know  opportunities. But there is such a need  you know  I'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called Enablis that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa. We're now moving into East Africa. And we give them business development services  as well as financing loan and equity. I've also set up a project in Kenya  and what we do is we track the performance of Kenyan MPs. My partner  M  who's a tech guru  hacked WordPress. It costs us  like     dollars a month just for hosting. Everything else on there is a labor of love. We've manually entered all the data there. And you can get profiles of each MP  questions they've asked in parliament. We have a comment function  where people can ask their MPs questions. There are some MPs who participate  and come back and ask. And basically  we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians. You know  I believe that accountability stems from demand. You're not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart. And we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders. What are they doing  You know  they're not going to change just out of nowhere. So we need new policies  we need    where's that coming from  you know  Another thing is that these leaders are a reflection of our society. We talk about African governments like they've been dropped from Mars  you know  They come from us. And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like  And how can we change that  So Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable. Where do we go from here  I believe in the power of ideas. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge. And I'd ask all of you  when you leave here  please just share  and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going  because it can make a difference. The other thing I want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual. I've had lots of conversations about things I think need to be happening in Africa. People are like   OK  if you don't do aid  I'm a bleeding heart liberal  what can I do   And when I talk about my ideas  they're like   BBut it's not scalable  you know. Give me something I can do with Paypal.  It's not that easy  you know  And sometimes just taking an interest in the individual  in the fellows you've met  and the businesspeople you've met  it can make a huge difference  especially in Africa  because usually the individual in Africa carries a lot of people behind them. Practically. I mean  when I was a first year student in law school  my mom's business had collapsed  so I was supporting her. My sister was struggling to get through undergrad. I was helping her pay her tuition. My cousin ran out of school fees  and she's really smart. I was paying her school fees. A cousin of mine died of AIDS  left an orphan  so we said  well  what are we going to do with her  You know  she's now my baby sister. And because of the opportunities that were afforded to me  I am able to lift all those people. So  don't underestimate that. An example. This man changed my life. He's a professor. He's now at Vanderbilt. He's an undergrad professor  Mitchell Seligson. And because of him  I got into Harvard Law School  because he took an interest. I was taking a class of his  and he was just like  this is an overeager student  which we don't normally get in the United States  because everyone else is cynical and jaded. He called me to his office and said   What do you want to do when you grow up   I said   I want to be a lawyer.  And he was like   Why  You know  we don't need another lawyer in the United States.  And he tried to talk me out of it  but it was like   OK  I know nothing about applying to law school  I'm poli sci Ph.D. But  you know  let's figure out what I need you to do  what I need to do to help you out.  It was like   Where do you want to go   And to me at that time university    I was at University of Pitts for undergrad  and that was like heaven  OK  because compared to what could have been in Kenya. So I'm like   Yeah  I'm just applying to Pitt for law school.  He was like   Why  You know  you're smart  you have all these things going for you.  And I'm like   Because I'm here and it's cheap  and you know  I kind of like Pittsburgh.  Like  that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard for applying to law school. And  you know  so he took me under his wing  and he encouraged me. And he said   Look  you can get into Harvard  you're that good  OK  And if they don't admit you  they're the ones who are messed up.  And he built me up  you know  And this is just an illustration. You can meet other individuals here. We just need a push. That's all I needed was a push to go to the next level. Basically  I want to end with my vision for Africa  you know  A gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave the continent so that we can fulfill our potential. You know  my vision is that my daughter  and any other African child being born today  can be whoever they want to be here  without having to leave. And they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born. That's one thing you Americans take for granted  you know  That you can grow up  you know  not so good circumstances  and you can move. Just because you are born in rural Arkansas  whatever  that doesn't define who you are. For most Africans today  where you live  or where you were born  and the circumstances under which you were born  determine the rest of your life. I would like to see that change  and the change starts with us. And as Africans  we need to take responsibility for our continent. Thank you. Stephanie White  I'm going to let her introduce herself to everybody. Can you tell everybody your name  Einstein  Einstein. SW  This is Einstein. Can you tell everyone  hi   E  Hello. SW  That's nice. Can you be polite  E  Hi  sweetheart. SW  Much better. Well  Einstein is very honored to be here at TED       amongst all you modern day Einsteins. In fact  she's very excited. E  Woo. SW  Yeah. Since we've arrived  there's been a constant buzz about all the exciting speakers here for the conference. This morning we've heard a lot of whispers about Tom Reilly's wrap up on Saturday. Einstein  did you hear whispers  E   Squawks  SW  Yeah. Einstein's especially interested in Penelope's talk. A lot of her research goes on in caves  which can get pretty dusty. E  Achoo  SW  It could make her sneeze. But more importantly  her research could help Einstein find a cure for her never ending scratchy throat. Einstein   Coughs  SW  Yeah. Well  Bob Russell was telling us about his work on nanotubes in his research at the microscopic level. Well  that's really cool  but what Einstein's really hoping is that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five pound peanut. E  Oh  my God  My God  My God  SW  Yeah. She would get really  really excited. That is one big peanut. Since Einstein is a bird  she's very interested in things that fly. She thinks Burt Rutan is very impressive. E  Ooh. SW  Yeah. She especially likes his latest achievement  SpaceShipOne. Einstein  would you like to ride in Burt's spaceship  E   Spaceship noise  SW  Even if it doesn't have a laser  E   Laser noise  SW  Yeah  yeah. That was pretty funny  Einstein. Now  Einstein also thinks  you know  working in caves and travelling through space    it's all very dangerous jobs. It would be very dangerous if you fell down. E  Wheeeeeee   Splat  SW  Yeah. Little splat at the end there. Einstein  did that hurt  E  Ow  ow  ow. SW  Yeah. It's all a lot of hard work. E   Squawks  SW  Yeah. It can get a bird like Einstein frustrated. E   Squawks  SW  Yeah  it sure can. But when Einstein needs to relax from her job educating the public  she loves to take in the arts. If the children of the Uganda need another dance partner  Einstein could sure fit the bill  because she loves to dance. Can you get down  E   Bobbing head   Laughter  SW  Let's get down for everybody. Come on now. She's going to make me do it  too. Ooh  ooh. Einstein  Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh. SW  Do your head now. E  Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh. SW  Or maybe Sirena Huang would like to learn some arias on her violin  and Einstein can sing along with some opera  E   Operatic squawk  SW  Very good. Or maybe Stu just needs another backup singer  Einstein  can you also sing  I know  you need to get rid of that seed first. Can you sing  E  La  la. SW  There you go. And  of course  if all else fails  you can just run off and enjoy a fun fiesta. E   Squawks  SW  All right. Well  Einstein was pretty embarrassed to admit this earlier  but she was telling me backstage that she had a problem. E  What's the matter  SW  No  I don't have a problem. You have the problem  remember  You were saying that you were really embarrassed  because you're in love with a pirate  E  Yar. SW  There you go. And what do pirates like to drink  E  Beer. SW  Yeah  that's right. But you don't like to drink beer  Einstein. You like to drink water. E   Water sound  SW  Very good. Now  really  she is pretty nervous. Because one of her favorite folks from back home is here  and she's pretty nervous to meet him. She thinks Al Gore is a really good looking man. What do you say to a good looking man  E  Hey  baby. SW  And so do all the folks back home in Tennessee. E  Yee haw. SW  And since she's such a big fan  she knows that his birthday is coming up at the end of March. And we didn't think he'd be in town then  so Einstein wanted to do something special for him. So let's see if Einstein will sing  Happy Birthday  to Al Gore. Can you sing  Happy Birthday  to him  E  Happy birthday to you. SW  Again. E  Happy birthday to you. SW  Again. E  Happy birthday to you. SW  Big finish. E  Happy birthday to you. SW  Good job  Well  before we wrap it up  she would like to give a shout out to all our animal friends back at the Knoxville Zoo. Einstein  do you want to say  hi  to all the owls  E  Woo  woo  woo. SW  What about the other birds  E  Tweet  tweet  tweet. SW  And the penguin  E  Quack  quack  quack. SW  There we go. Let's get that one out of there. How about a chimpanzee  E  Ooh  ooh  ooh. Aah  aah  aah. SW  Very good. What about a wolf  E  Ooooowww. SW  And a pig  E  Oink  oink  oink. SW  And the rooster  E  Cock a doodle doo  SW  And how about those cats  E  Meow. SW  At the zoo we have big cats from the jungle. E  Grrrrr. SW  What about a skunk  E  Stinker. SW  She's a comedian. I suppose you think you're famous  Are you famous  E  Superstar. SW  Yeah. You are a superstar. Well  we would like to encourage all of you to do your part to help protect Einstein's animal friends  and to do your part to help protect their homes that they live  in . Now  Einstein does say it best when we ask her. Why do we want to protect your home  E  I'm special. SW  You are very special. What would you like to say to all these nice people  E  I love you. SW  That's good. Can you blow them a kiss  E   Kissing noise  SW  And what do you say when it's time to go  E  Goodbye. SW  Good job. Thank you all.
