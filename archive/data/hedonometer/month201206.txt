Is E.T. out there  Well  I work at the SETI Institute. That's almost my name. SETI  Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. In other words  I look for aliens  and when I tell people that at a cocktail party  they usually look at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face. I try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate. Now  a lot of people think that this is kind of idealistic  ridiculous  maybe even hopeless  but I just want to talk to you a little bit about why I think that the job I have is actually a privilege  okay  and give you a little bit of the motivation for my getting into this line of work  if that's what you call it. This thing   whoops  can we go back  Hello  come in  Earth. There we go. All right. This is the Owens Valley Radio Observatory behind the Sierra Nevadas  and in       I was working there collecting data for my thesis. Now  it's kinda lonely  it's kinda tedious  just collecting data  so I would amuse myself by taking photos at night of the telescopes or even of myself  because  you know  at night  I would be the only hominid within about    miles. So here are pictures of myself. The observatory had just acquired a new book  written by a Russian cosmologist by the name of Joseph Shklovsky  and then expanded and translated and edited by a little known Cornell astronomer by the name of Carl Sagan. And I remember reading that book  and at   in the morning I was reading this book and it was explaining how the antennas I was using to measure the spins of galaxies could also be used to communicate  to send bits of information from one star system to another. Now  at   o'clock in the morning when you're all alone  haven't had much sleep  that was a very romantic idea  but it was that idea    the fact that you could in fact prove that there's somebody out there just using this same technology    that appealed to me so much that    years later I took a job at the SETI Institute. Now  I have to say that my memory is notoriously porous  and I've often wondered whether there was any truth in this story  or I was just  you know  misremembering something  but I recently just blew up this old negative of mine  and sure enough  there you can see the Shklovsky and Sagan book underneath that analog calculating device. So it was true. All right. Now  the idea for doing this  it wasn't very old at the time that I made that photo. The idea dates from       when a young astronomer by the name of Frank Drake used this antenna in West Virginia  pointed it at a couple of nearby stars in the hopes of eavesdropping on E.T. Now  Frank didn't hear anything. Actually he did  but it turned out to be the U.S. Air Force  which doesn't count as extraterrestrial intelligence. But Drake's idea here became very popular because it was very appealing   and I'll get back to that   and on the basis of this experiment  which didn't succeed  we have been doing SETI ever since  not continuously  but ever since. We still haven't heard anything. We still haven't heard anything. In fact  we don't know about any life beyond Earth  but I'm going to suggest to you that that's going to change rather soon  and part of the reason  in fact  the majority of the reason why I think that's going to change is that the equipment's getting better. This is the Allen Telescope Array  about     miles from whatever seat you're in right now. This is something that we're using today to search for E.T.  and the electronics have gotten very much better too. This is Frank Drake's electronics in     . This is the Allen Telescope Array electronics today. Some pundit with too much time on his hands has reckoned that the new experiments are approximately     trillion times better than they were in           trillion times better. That's a degree of an improvement that would look good on your report card  okay  But something that's not appreciated by the public is  in fact  that the experiment continues to get better  and  consequently  tends to get faster. This is a little plot  and every time you show a plot  you lose    percent of the audience. I have    of these.  Laughter  But what I plotted here is just some metric that shows how fast we're searching. In other words  we're looking for a needle in a haystack. We know how big the haystack is. It's the galaxy. But we're going through the haystack no longer with a teaspoon but with a skip loader  because of this increase in speed. In fact  those of you who are still conscious and mathematically competent  will note that this is a semi log plot. In other words  the rate of increase is exponential. It's exponentially improving. Now  exponential is an overworked word. You hear it on the media all the time. They don't really know what exponential means  but this is exponential. In fact  it's doubling every    months  and  of course  every card carrying member of the digerati knows that that's Moore's Law. So this means that over the course of the next two dozen years  we'll be able to look at a million star systems  a million star systems  looking for signals that would prove somebody's out there. Well  a million star systems  is that interesting  I mean  how many of those star systems have planets  And the facts are  we didn't know the answer to that even as recently as    years ago  and in fact  we really didn't know it even as recently as six months ago. But now we do. Recent results suggest that virtually every star has planets  and more than one. They're like  you know  kittens. You get a litter. You don't get one kitten. You get a bunch. So in fact  this is a pretty accurate estimate of the number of planets in our galaxy  just in our galaxy  by the way  and I remind the non astronomy majors among you that our galaxy is only one of     billion that we can see with our telescopes. That's a lot of real estate  but of course  most of these planets are going to be kind of worthless  like  you know  Mercury  or Neptune. Neptune's probably not very big in your life. So the question is  what fraction of these planets are actually suitable for life  We don't know the answer to that either  but we will learn that answer this year  thanks to NASA's Kepler Space Telescope  and in fact  the smart money  which is to say the people who work on this project  the smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets that might be suitable for life is maybe one in a thousand  one in a hundred  something like that. Well  even taking the pessimistic estimate  that it's one in a thousand  that means that there are at least a billion cousins of the Earth just in our own galaxy. Okay  now I've given you a lot of numbers here  but they're mostly big numbers  okay  so  you know  keep that in mind. There's plenty of real estate  plenty of real estate in the universe  and if we're the only bit of real estate in which there's some interesting occupants  that makes you a miracle  and I know you like to think you're a miracle  but if you do science  you learn rather quickly that every time you think you're a miracle  you're wrong  so probably not the case. All right  so the bottom line is this  Because of the increase in speed  and because of the vast amount of habitable real estate in the cosmos  I figure we're going to pick up a signal within two dozen years. And I feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you  Either we're going to find E.T. in the next two dozen years  or I'll buy you a cup of coffee. So that's not so bad. I mean  even with two dozen years  you open up your browser and there's news of a signal  or you get a cup of coffee. Now  let me tell you about some aspect of this that people don't think about  and that is  what happens  Suppose that what I say is true. I mean  who knows  but suppose it happens. Suppose some time in the next two dozen years we pick up a faint line that tells us we have some cosmic company. What is the effect  What's the consequence  Now  I might be at ground zero for this. I happen to know what the consequence for me would be  because we've had false alarms. This is       and this is a photo I made at about   o'clock in the morning in Mountain View here  when we were watching the computer monitors because we had picked up a signal that we thought   This is the real deal.  All right  And I kept waiting for the Men in Black to show up. Right  I kept waiting for    I kept waiting for my mom to call  somebody to call  the government to call. Nobody called. Nobody called. I was so nervous that I couldn't sit down. I just wandered around taking photos like this one  just for something to do. Well  at      in the morning  with my head down on my desk because I obviously hadn't slept all night  the phone rings and it's The New York Times. And I think there's a lesson in that  and that lesson is that if we pick up a signal  the media  the media will be on it faster than a weasel on ball bearings. It's going to be fast. You can be sure of that. No secrecy. That's what happens to me. It kind of ruins my whole week  because whatever I've got planned that week is kind of out the window. But what about you  What's it going to do to you  And the answer is that we don't know the answer. We don't know what that's going to do to you  not in the long term  and not even very much in the short term. I mean  that would be a bit like asking Chris Columbus in        Hey Chris  you know  what happens if it turns out that there's a continent between here and Japan  where you're sailing to  what will be the consequences for humanity if that turns out to be the case   And I think Chris would probably offer you some answer that you might not have understood  but it probably wouldn't have been right  and I think that to predict what finding E.T.'s going to mean  we can't predict that either. But here are a couple things I can say. To begin with  it's going to be a society that's way in advance of our own. You're not going to hear from alien Neanderthals. They're not building transmitters. They're going to be ahead of us  maybe by a few thousand years  maybe by a few millions years  but substantially ahead of us  and that means  if you can understand anything that they're going to say  then you might be able to short circuit history by getting information from a society that's way beyond our own. Now  you might find that a bit hyperbolic  and maybe it is  but nonetheless  it's conceivable that this will happen  and  you know  you could consider this like  I don't know  giving Julius Caesar English lessons and the key to the library of Congress. It would change his day  all right  That's one thing. Another thing that's for sure going to happen is that it will calibrate us. We will know that we're not that miracle  right  that we're just another duck in a row  we're not the only kids on the block  and I think that that's philosophically a very profound thing to learn. We're not a miracle  okay  The third thing that it might tell you is somewhat vague  but I think interesting and important  and that is  if you find a signal coming from a more advanced society  because they will be  that will tell you something about our own possibilities  that we're not inevitably doomed to self destruction. Because they survived their technology  we could do it too. Normally when you look out into the universe  you're looking back in time. All right  That's interesting to cosmologists. But in this sense  you actually can look into the future  hazily  but you can look into the future. So those are all the sorts of things that would come from a detection. Now  let me talk a little bit about something that happens even in the meantime  and that is  SETI  I think  is important  because it's exploration  and it's not only exploration  it's comprehensible exploration. Now  I gotta tell you  I'm always reading books about explorers. I find exploration very interesting  Arctic exploration  you know  people like Magellan  Amundsen  Shackleton  you see Franklin down there  Scott  all these guys. It's really nifty  exploration. And they're just doing it because they want to explore  and you might say   Oh  that's kind of a frivolous opportunity   but that's not frivolous. That's not a frivolous activity  because  I mean  think of ants. You know  most ants are programmed to follow one another along in a long line  but there are a couple of ants  maybe one percent of those ants  that are what they call pioneer ants  and they're the ones that wander off. They're the ones you find on the kitchen countertop. You gotta get them with your thumb before they find the sugar or something. But those ants  even though most of them get wiped out  those ants are the ones that are essential to the survival of the hive. So exploration is important. I also think that exploration is important in terms of being able to address what I think is a critical lack in our society  and that is the lack of science literacy  the lack of the ability to even understand science. Now  look  a lot has been written about the deplorable state of science literacy in this country. You've heard about it. Well  here's one example  in fact. Polls taken  this poll was taken    years ago. It shows like roughly one third of the public thinks that aliens are not only out there  we're looking for them out there  but they're here  right  Sailing the skies in their saucers and occasionally abducting people for experiments their parents wouldn't approve of. Well  that would be interesting if it was true  and job security for me  but I don't think the evidence is very good. That's more  you know  sad than significant. But there are other things that people believe that are significant  like the efficacy of homeopathy  or that evolution is just  you know  sort of a crazy idea by scientists without any legs  or  you know  evolution  all that sort of thing  or global warming. These sorts of ideas don't really have any validity  that you can't trust the scientists. Now  we've got to solve that problem  because that's a critically important problem  and you might say   Well  okay  how are we gonna solve that problem with SETI   Well  let me suggest to you that SETI obviously can't solve the problem  but it can address the problem. It can address the problem by getting young people interested in science. Look  science is hard  it has a reputation of being hard  and the facts are  it is hard  and that's the result of     years of science  right  I mean  in the   th century  in the   th century you could become an expert on any field of science in an afternoon by going to a library  if you could find the library  right  In the   th century  if you had a basement lab  you could make major scientific discoveries in your own home. Right  Because there was all this science just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up. Now  that's not true anymore. Today  you've got to spend years in grad school and post doc positions just to figure out what the important questions are. It's hard. There's no doubt about it. And in fact  here's an example  the Higgs boson  finding the Higgs boson. Ask the next    people you see on the streets   Hey  do you think it's worthwhile to spend billions of Swiss francs looking for the Higgs boson   And I bet the answer you're going to get  is   Well  I don't know what the Higgs boson is  and I don't know if it's important.  And probably most of the people wouldn't even know the value of a Swiss franc  okay  And yet we're spending billions of Swiss francs on this problem. Okay  So that doesn't get people interested in science because they can't comprehend what it's about. SETI  on the other hand  is really simple. We're going to use these big antennas and we're going to try to eavesdrop on signals. Everybody can understand that. Yes  technologically  it's very sophisticated  but everybody gets the idea. So that's one thing. The other thing is  it's exciting science. It's exciting because we're naturally interested in other intelligent beings  and I think that's part of our hardwiring. I mean  we're hardwired to be interested in beings that might be  if you will  competitors  or if you're the romantic sort  possibly even mates. Okay  I mean  this is analogous to our interest in things that have big teeth. Right  We're interested in things that have big teeth  and you can see the evolutionary value of that  and you can also see the practical consequences by watching Animal Planet. You notice they make very few programs about gerbils. It's mostly about things that have big teeth. Okay  so we're interested in these sorts of things. And not just us. It's also kids. This allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a hook to science  because SETI involves all kinds of science  obviously biology  obviously astronomy  but also geology  also chemistry  various scientific disciplines all can be presented in the guise of   We're looking for E.T.  So to me this is interesting and important  and in fact  it's my policy  even though I give a lot of talks to adults  you give talks to adults  and two days later they're back where they were. But if you give talks to kids  you know  one in    of them  some light bulb goes off  and they think   Gee  I'd never thought of that   and then they go  you know  read a book or a magazine or whatever. They get interested in something. Now it's my theory  supported only by anecdotal  personal anecdotal evidence  but nonetheless  that kids get interested in something between the ages of eight and   . You've got to get them there. So  all right  I give talks to adults  that's fine  but I try and make    percent of the talks that I give  I try and make those for kids. I remember when a guy came to our high school  actually  it was actually my junior high school. I was in sixth grade. And he gave some talk. All I remember from it was one word  electronics. It was like Dustin Hoffman in  The Graduate   right  when he said  plastics   whatever that means  plastics. All right  so the guy said electronics. I don't remember anything else. In fact  I don't remember anything that my sixth grade teacher said all year  but I remember electronics. And so I got interested in electronics  and you know  I studied to get my ham license. I was wiring up stuff. Here I am at about    or something  doing that sort of stuff. Okay  That had a big effect on me. So that's my point  that you can have a big effect on these kids. In fact  this reminds me  I don't know  a couple years ago I gave a talk at a school in Palo Alto where there were about a dozen    year olds that had come to this talk. I had been brought in to talk to these kids for an hour. Eleven year olds  they're all sitting in a little semi circle looking up at me with big eyes  and I started  there was a white board behind me  and I started off by writing a one with    zeroes after it  and I said   All right  now look  this is the number of stars in the visible universe  and this number is so big there's not even a name for it.  And one of these kids shot up his hand  and he said   Well  actually there is a name for it. It's a sextra quadra hexa something or other.  Right  Now  that kid was wrong by four orders of magnitude  but there was no doubt about it  these kids were smart. Okay  So I stopped giving the lecture. All they wanted to do was ask questions. In fact  my last comments to these kids  at the end I said   You know  you kids are smarter than the people I work with.  Now    Laughter  They didn't even care about that. What they wanted was my email address so they could ask me more questions.  Laughter  Let me just say  look  my job is a privilege because we're in a special time. Previous generations couldn't do this experiment at all. In another generation down the line  I think we will have succeeded. So to me  it is a privilege  and when I look in the mirror  the facts are that I really don't see myself. What I see is the generation behind me. These are some kids from the Huff School  fourth graders. I talked there  what  two weeks ago  something like that. I think that if you can instill some interest in science and how it works  well  that's a payoff beyond easy measure. Thank you very much. So I thought I'd talk about identity. That's sort of an interesting enough topic to me. And the reason was  because when I was asked to do this  I'd just read  in one of the papers  I can't remember  something from someone at Facebook saying  well   we need to make everybody use their real names.  and then that's basically all the problems solved. And that's so wrong  that's such a fundamentally  reactionary view of identity  and it's going to get us into all sorts of trouble. And so what I thought I'd do is I'll explain four sort of problems about it  and then I'll suggest a solution  which hopefully you might find interesting. So just to frame the problem  what does authenticity mean  That's me  that's a camera phone picture of me looking at a painting.  What's the Problem   That's a painting that was painted by a very famous forger  and because I'm not very good at presentations  I already can't remember the name that I wrote on my card. And he was incarcerated in  I think  Wakefield Prison for forging masterpieces by  I think  French Impressionists. And he's so good at it  that when he was in prison  everybody in prison  the governor and whatever  wanted him to paint masterpieces to put on the walls  because they were so good. And so that's a masterpiece  which is a fake of a masterpiece  and bonded into the canvas is a chip which identifies that as a real fake  if you see what I mean. So when we're talking about authenticity  it's a little more fractal than it appears and that's a good example to show it. I tried to pick four problems that will frame the issue properly. So the first problem  I thought  Chip and PIN  right   Banks and legacies bringing down the system from within   Offline solutions do not work online  I'm guessing everyone's got a chip and PIN card  right  So why is that a good example  That's the example of how legacy thinking about identity subverts the security of a well constructed system. That chip and PIN card that's in your pocket has a little chip on it that cost millions of pounds to develop  is extremely secure  you can put scanning electron microscopes on it  you can try and grind it down  blah blah blah. Those chips have never been broken  whatever you read in the paper. And for a joke  we take that super secure chip and we bond it to a trivially counterfeitable magnetic stripe and for very lazy criminals  we still emboss the card. So if you're a criminal in a hurry and you need to copy someone's card  you can just stick a piece of paper on it and rub a pencil over it just to sort of speed things up. And even more amusingly  and on my debit card too  we print the name and the SALT code and everything else on the front too. Why  There is no earthly reason why your name is printed on a chip and PIN card. And if you think about it  it's even more insidious and perverse than it seems at first. Because the only people that benefit from having the name on the card are criminals. You know what your name is  right  And when you go into a shop and buy something  it's a PIN  he doesn't care what the name is. The only place where you ever have to write your name on the back is in America at the moment. And whenever I go to America  and I have to pay with a mag stripe on the back of the card  I always sign it Carlos Tethers anyway  just as a security mechanism  because if a transaction ever gets disputed  and it comes back and it says Dave Birch  I know it must have been a criminal  because I would never sign it Dave Birch. So if you drop your card in the street  it means a criminal can pick it up and read it. They know the name  from the name they can find the address  and then they can go off and buy stuff online. Why do we put the name on the card  Because we think identity is something to do with names  and because we're rooted in the idea of the identity card  which obsesses us. And I know it crashed and burned a couple of years ago  but if you're someone in politics or the home office or whatever  and you think about identity  you can only think of identity in terms of cards with names on them. And that's very subversive in a modern world. So the second example I thought I'd use is chatrooms.  Chatrooms and Children  I'm very proud of that picture  that's my son playing in his band with his friends for the first ever gig  I believe you call it  where he got paid. And I love that picture. I like the picture of him getting into medical school a lot better  I like that picture for the moment. Why do I use that picture  Because that was very interesting  watching that experience as an old person. So him and his friends  they get together  they booked a room  like a church hall  and they got all their friends who had bands  and they got them together  and they do it all on Facebook  and then they sell tickets  and the first band on the   I was going to say  menu   that's probably the wrong word for it  isn't it  The first band on the list of bands that appears at some public music performance of some kind gets the sales from the first    tickets  then the next band gets the next     and so on. They were at the bottom of the menu  they were like fifth  I thought they had no chance. He actually got    quid. Fantastic  right  But my point is  that all worked perfectly  except on the web. So they're sitting on Facebook  and they're sending these messages and arranging things and they don't know who anybody is  right  That's the big problem we're trying to solve. If only they were using the real names  Then you wouldn't be worried about them on the Internet. And so when he says to me   Oh  I want to go to a chatroom to talk about guitars  or something  I'm like   oh  well  I don't want you to go into a chatroom to talk about guitars  because they might not all be your friends  and some of the people that are in the chatroom might be perverts and teachers and vicars.  I mean  they generally are  when you look in the paper  right  So I want to know who all the people in the chatroom are. So okay  you can go in the chatroom  but only if everybody in the chatroom is using their real names  and they submit full copies of their police report. But of course  if anybody in the chatroom asked for his real name  I'd say no. You can't give them your real name. Because what happens if they turn out to be perverts  and teachers and whatever. So you have this odd sort of paradox where I'm happy for him to go into this space if I know who everybody else is  but I don't want anybody else to know who he is. And so you get this sort of logjam around identity where you want full disclosure from everybody else  but not from yourself. And there's no progress  we get stuck. And so the chatroom thing doesn't work properly  and it's a very bad way of thinking about identity. So on my RSS feed  I saw this thing about   I just said something bad about my RSS feed  didn't I  I should stop saying it like that. For some random reason  I can't imagine  something about cheerleaders turned up in my inbox. And I read this story about cheerleaders  and it's a fascinating story. This happened a couple of years ago in the U.S. There were some cheerleaders in a team at a high school in the U.S.  and they said mean things about their cheerleading coach  as I'm sure kids do about all of their teachers all of the time  and somehow the cheerleading coach found out about this. She was very upset. And so she went to one of the girls  and said   you have to give me your Facebook password.  I read this all the time  where even at some universities and places of education  kids are forced to hand over their Facebook passwords. So you've got to give them your Facebook password. She was a kid  What she should have said is   my lawyer will be calling you first thing in the morning. It's an outrageous imposition on my  th Amendment right to privacy  and you're going to be sued for all the money you've got.  That's what she should have said. But she's a kid  so she hands over the password. The teacher can't log into Facebook  because the school has blocked access to Facebook. So the teacher can't log into Facebook until she gets home. So the girl tells her friends  guess what happened  The teacher logged in  she knows. So the girls just all logged into Facebook on their phones  and deleted their profiles. And so when the teacher logged in  there was nothing there. My point is  those identities  they don't think about them the same way. Identity is  especially when you're a teenager  a fluid thing. You have lots of identities. And you can have an identity  you don't like it  because it's subverted in some way  or it's insecure  or it's inappropriate  you just delete it and get another one. The idea that you have an identity that's given to you by someone  the government or whatever  and you have to stick with that identity and use it in all places  that's absolutely wrong. Why would you want to really know who someone was on Facebook  unless you wanted to abuse them and harass them in some way  And it just doesn't work properly. And my fourth example is there are some cases where you really want to be   In case you're wondering  that's me at the G   protest. I wasn't actually at the G   protest  but I had a meeting at a bank on the day of the G   protest  and I got an email from the bank saying please don't wear a suit  because it'll inflame the protesters. I look pretty good in a suit  frankly  so you can see why it would drive them into an anti capitalist frenzy. So I thought  well  look. If I don't want to inflame the protesters  the obvious thing to do is go dressed as a protester. So I went dressed completely in black  you know  with a black balaclava  I had black gloves on  but I've taken them off to sign the visitor's book. I'm wearing black trousers  black boots  I'm dressed completely in black. I go into the bank at    o'clock  go   Hi  I'm Dave Birch  I've got a   o'clock with so and so there.  Sure. They sign me in. There's my visitor's badge. So this nonsense about you've got to have real names on Facebook and whatever  that gets you that kind of security. That gets you security theater  where there's no actual security  but people are sort of playing parts in a play about security. And as long as everybody learns their lines  everyone's happy. But it's not real security. Especially because I hate banks more than the G   protesters do  because I work for them. I know that things are actually worse than these guys think. But suppose I worked next to somebody in a bank who was doing something. Suppose I was sitting next to a rogue trader  and I want to report it to the boss of the bank. So I log on to do a little bit of whistleblowing. I send a message  this guy's a rogue trader. That message is meaningless if you don't know that I'm a trader at the bank. If that message just comes from anybody  it has zero information value. There's no point in sending that message. But if I have to prove who I am  I'll never send that message. It's just like the nurse in the hospital reporting the drunk surgeon. That message will only happen if I'm anonymous. So the system has to have ways of providing anonymity there  otherwise we don't get where we want to get to. So four issues. So what are we going to do about it  Well  what we tend to do about it is we think about Orwell space. And we try to make electronic versions of the identity card that we got rid of in     . So we think if we had a card  call it a Facebook login  which proves who you are  and I make you carry it all the time  that solves the problem. And of course  for all those reasons I've just outlined  it doesn't  and it might  actually  make some problems worse. The more times you're forced to use your real identity  certainly in transactional terms  the more likely that identity is to get stolen and subverted. The goal is to stop people from using identity in transactions which don't need identity  which is actually almost all transactions. Almost all of the transactions you do are not  who are you  They're  are you allowed to drive the car  are you allowed in the building  are you over     etcetera  etcetera. So my suggestion I  like James  think that there should be a resurgence of interest in R   D. I think this is a solvable problem. It's something we can do about. Naturally  in these circumstances  I turn to Doctor Who. Because in this  as in so many other walks of life  Doctor Who has already shown us the answer. So I should say  for some of our foreign visitors  Doctor Who is the greatest living scientist in England  and a beacon of truth and enlightenment to all of us. And this is Doctor Who with his psychic paper. Come on  you guys must have seen Doctor Who's psychic paper. You're not nerds if you say yes. Who's seen Doctor Who's psychic paper  Oh right  you were in the library the whole time studying I guess. Is that what you're going to tell us  Doctor Who's psychic paper is when you hold up the psychic paper  the person  in their brain  sees the thing that they need to see. So I want to show you a British passport  I hold up the psychic paper  you see a British passport. I want to get into a party  I hold up the psychic paper  I show you a party invitation. You see what you want to see. So what I'm saying is we need to make an electronic version of that  but with one tiny  tiny change  which is that it'll only show you the British passport if I've actually got one. It'll only show you the party invitation if I actually have one. It will only show you that I'm over    if I actually am over   . But nothing else. So you're the bouncer at the pub  you need to know that I'm over     instead of showing you my driving license  which shows you I know how to drive  what my name is  my address  all these kind of things  I show you my psychic paper  and all it tells you is am I over    or not. Right. Is that just a pipe dream  Of course not  otherwise I wouldn't be here talking to you. So in order to build that and make it work  I'm only going to name these things  I'll not go into them  we need a plan  which is we're going to build this as an infrastructure for everybody to use  to solve all of these problems. We're going to make a utility  the utility has to be universal  you can use it everywhere  I'm just giving you little flashes of the technology as we go along. That's a Japanese ATM  the fingerprint template is stored inside the mobile phone. So when you want to draw money out  you put the mobile phone on the ATM  and touch your finger  your fingerprint goes through to the phone  the phone says yes  that's whoever  and the ATM then gives you some money. It has to be a utility that you can use everywhere. It has to be absolutely convenient  that's me going into the pub. All the device on the door of the pub is allowed is  is this person over    and not barred from the pub  And so the idea is  you touch your ID card to the door  and if I am allowed in  it shows my picture  if I'm not allowed in  it shows a red cross. It doesn't disclose any other information. It has to have no special gadgets. That can only mean one thing  following on from Ross's statement  which I agree with completely. If it means no special gadgets  it has to run on a mobile phone. That's the only choice we have  we have to make it work on mobile phones. There are  .  billion mobile phone subscriptions. My favorite statistic of all time  only   billion toothbrushes in the world. That means something  I don't know what. I rely on our futurologists to tell me. It has to be a utility which is extensible. So it has to be something that anybody could build on. Anybody should be able to use this infrastructure  you don't need permissions  licenses  whatever  anyone should be able to write some code to do this. You know what symmetry is  so you don't need a picture of it. This is how we're going to do it. We're going to do it using phones  and we're going to do it using mobile proximity. I'm going to suggest to you the technology to implement Doctor Who's psychic paper is already here  and if any of you have got one of the new Barclay's debit cards with the contactless interface on it  you've already got that technology. If you've ever been up to the big city  and used an Oyster card at all  does that ring any bells to anybody  The technology already exists. The first phones that have the technology built in  the Google Nexus  the S   the Samsung Wifi  .   the first phones that have the technology built into them are already in the shops. So the idea that the gas man can turn up at my mom's door and he can show my mom his phone  and she can tap it with her phone  and it will come up with green if he really is from British Gas and allowed in  and it'll come up with red if he isn't  end of story. We have the technology to do that. And what's more  although some of those things sounded a bit counter intuitive  like proving I'm over    without proving who I am  the cryptography to do that not only exists  it's extremely well known and well understood. Digital signatures  the blinding of public key certificates  these technologies have been around for a while  we've just had no way of packaging them up. So the technology already exists. We know it works  There are a few examples of the technology being used in experimental places. That's London Fashion Week  where we built a system with O   that's for the Wireless Festival in Hyde Park  you can see the persons walking in with their VIP band  it's just being checked by the Nokia phone that's reading the band. I'm only putting those up to show you these things are prosaic  this stuff works in these environments. They don't need to be special. So finally  I know that you can do this  because if you saw the episode of Doctor Who  the Easter special of Doctor Who  where he went to Mars in a bus  I should say again for our foreign students  that doesn't happen every episode. This was a very special case. So in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus  I can't show you the clip  due to the outrageous restrictions of Queen Anne style copyright by the BBC  but in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus  Doctor Who is clearly shown getting on to the bus with the Oyster card reader using his psychic paper. Which proves that psychic paper has an MSE interface. Thank you very much. All right. So  like all good stories  this starts a long  long time ago when there was basically nothing. So here is a complete picture of the universe about    odd billion years ago. All energy is concentrated into a single point of energy. For some reason it explodes  and you begin to get these things. So you're now about    billion years into this. And these things expand and expand and expand into these giant galaxies  and you get trillions of them. And within these galaxies you get these enormous dust clouds. And I want you to pay particular attention to the three little prongs in the center of this picture. If you take a close up of those  they look like this. And what you're looking at is columns of dust where there's so much dust    by the way  the scale of this is a trillion vertical miles    and what's happening is there's so much dust  it comes together and it fuses and ignites a thermonuclear reaction. And so what you're watching is the birth of stars. These are stars being born out of here. When enough stars come out  they create a galaxy. This one happens to be a particularly important galaxy  because you are here. And as you take a close up of this galaxy  you find a relatively normal  not particularly interesting star. By the way  you're now about two thirds of the way into this story. So this star doesn't even appear until about two thirds of the way into this story. And then what happens is there's enough dust left over that it doesn't ignite into a star  it becomes a planet. And this is about a little over four billion years ago. And soon thereafter there's enough material left over that you get a primordial soup  and that creates life. And life starts to expand and expand and expand  until it goes kaput. Now the really strange thing is life goes kaput  not once  not twice  but five times. So almost all life on Earth is wiped out about five times. And as you're thinking about that  what happens is you get more and more complexity  more and more stuff to build new things with. And we don't appear until about   .   percent of the time into this story  just to put ourselves and our ancestors in perspective. So within that context  there's two theories of the case as to why we're all here. The first theory of the case is that's all she wrote. Under that theory  we are the be all and end all of all creation. And the reason for trillions of galaxies  sextillions of planets  is to create something that looks like that and something that looks like that. And that's the purpose of the universe  and then it flat lines  it doesn't get any better. The only question you might want to ask yourself is  could that be just mildly arrogant  And if it is    and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction. There were only about       of our species left. A few more weeks without rain  we would have never seen any of these. So maybe you have to think about a second theory if the first one isn't good enough. Second theory is  Could we upgrade  Well  why would one ask a question like that  Because there have been at least    upgrades so far of humanoids. So it turns out that we have upgraded. We've upgraded time and again and again. And it turns out that we keep discovering upgrades. We found this one last year. We found another one last month. And as you're thinking about this  you might also ask the question  So why a single human species  Wouldn't it be really odd if you went to Africa and Asia and Antarctica and found exactly the same bird    particularly given that we co existed at the same time with at least eight other versions of humanoid at the same time on this planet  So the normal state of affairs is not to have just a Homo sapiens  the normal state of affairs is to have various versions of humans walking around. And if that is the normal state of affairs  then you might ask yourself  all right  so if we want to create something else  how big does a mutation have to be  Well Svante Paabo has the answer. The difference between humans and Neanderthal is  .    percent of gene code. That's how big the difference is one species to another. This explains most contemporary political debates. But as you're thinking about this  one of the interesting things is how small these mutations are and where they take place. Difference human Neanderthal is sperm and testis  smell and skin. And those are the specific genes that differ from one to the other. So very small changes can have a big impact. And as you're thinking about this  we're continuing to mutate. So about        years ago by the Black Sea  we had one mutation in one gene which led to blue eyes. And this is continuing and continuing and continuing. And as it continues  one of the things that's going to happen this year is we're going to discover the first        human genomes  because it's gotten cheap enough to do the gene sequencing. And when we find these  we may find differences. And by the way  this is not a debate that we're ready for  because we have really misused the science in this. In the     s  we thought there were major differences between people. That was partly based on Francis Galton's work. He was Darwin's cousin. But the U.S.  the Carnegie Institute  Stanford  American Neurological Association took this really far. That got exported and was really misused. In fact  it led to some absolutely horrendous treatment of human beings. So since the     s  we've been saying there are no differences  we're all identical. We're going to know at year end if that is true. And as we think about that  we're actually beginning to find things like  do you have an ACE gene  Why would that matter  Because nobody's ever climbed an       meter peak without oxygen that doesn't have an ACE gene. And if you want to get more specific  how about a    R genotype  Well it turns out that every male Olympic power athelete ever tested carries at least one of these variants. If that is true  it leads to some very complicated questions for the London Olympics. Three options  Do you want the Olympics to be a showcase for really hardworking mutants  Option number two  Why don't we play it like golf or sailing  Because you have one and you don't have one  I'll give you a tenth of a second head start. Version number three  Because this is a naturally occurring gene and you've got it and you didn't pick the right parents  you get the right to upgrade. Three different options. If these differences are the difference between an Olympic medal and a non Olympic medal. And it turns out that as we discover these things  we human beings really like to change how we look  how we act  what our bodies do. And we had about   .  million plastic surgeries in the United States  except that with the technologies that are coming online today  today's corrections  deletions  augmentations and enhancements are going to seem like child's play. You already saw the work by Tony Atala on TED  but this ability to start filling things like inkjet cartridges with cells are allowing us to print skin  organs and a whole series of other body parts. And as these technologies go forward  you keep seeing this  you keep seeing this  you keep seeing things          human genome sequence    and it seems like nothing's happening  until it does. And we may just be in some of these weeks. And as you're thinking about these two guys sequencing a human genome in      and the Public Project sequencing the human genome in       then you don't hear a lot  until you hear about an experiment last year in China  where they take skin cells from this mouse  put four chemicals on it  turn those skin cells into stem cells  let the stem cells grow and create a full copy of that mouse. That's a big deal. Because in essence what it means is you can take a cell  which is a pluripotent stem cell  which is like a skier at the top of a mountain  and those two skiers become two pluripotent stem cells  four  eight      and then it gets so crowded after    divisions that those cells have to differentiate. So they go down one side of the mountain  they go down another. And as they pick that  these become bone  and then they pick another road and these become platelets  and these become macrophages  and these become T cells. But it's really hard  once you ski down  to get back up. Unless  of course  if you have a ski lift. And what those four chemicals do is they take any cell and take it way back up the mountain so it can become any body part. And as you think of that  what it means is potentially you can rebuild a full copy of any organism out of any one of its cells. That turns out to be a big deal because now you can take  not just mouse cells  but you can human skin cells and turn them into human stem cells. And then what they did in October is they took skin cells  turned them into stem cells and began to turn them into liver cells. So in theory  you could grow any organ from any one of your cells. Here's a second experiment  If you could photocopy your body  maybe you also want to take your mind. And one of the things you saw at TED about a year and a half ago was this guy. And he gave a wonderful technical talk. He's a professor at MIT. But in essence what he said is you can take retroviruses  which get inside brain cells of mice. You can tag them with proteins that light up when you light them. And you can map the exact pathways when a mouse sees  feels  touches  remembers  loves. And then you can take a fiber optic cable and light up some of the same things. And by the way  as you do this  you can image it in two colors  which means you can download this information as binary code directly into a computer. So what's the bottom line on that  Well it's not completely inconceivable that someday you'll be able to download your own memories  maybe into a new body. And maybe you can upload other people's memories as well. And this might have just one or two small ethical  political  moral implications. Just a thought. Here's the kind of questions that are becoming interesting questions for philosophers  for governing people  for economists  for scientists. Because these technologies are moving really quickly. And as you think about it  let me close with an example of the brain. The first place where you would expect to see enormous evolutionary pressure today  both because of the inputs  which are becoming massive  and because of the plasticity of the organ  is the brain. Do we have any evidence that that is happening  Well let's take a look at something like autism incidence per thousand. Here's what it looks like in     . Here's what it looks like in                 . Here's the increase in less than a decade. And we still don't know why this is happening. What we do know is  potentially  the brain is reacting in a hyperactive  hyper plastic way  and creating individuals that are like this. And this is only one of the conditions that's out there. You've also got people with who are extraordinarily smart  people who can remember everything they've seen in their lives  people who've got synesthesia  people who've got schizophrenia. You've got all kinds of stuff going on out there  and we still don't understand how and why this is happening. But one question you might want to ask is  are we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain and of how we process data  Because when you think of how much data's coming into our brains  we're trying to take in as much data in a day as people used to take in in a lifetime. And as you're thinking about this  there's four theories as to why this might be going on  plus a whole series of others. I don't have a good answer. There really needs to be more research on this. One option is the fast food fetish. There's beginning to be some evidence that obesity and diet have something to do with gene modifications  which may or may not have an impact on how the brain of an infant works. A second option is the sexy geek option. These conditions are highly rare. But what's beginning to happen is because these geeks are all getting together  because they are highly qualified for computer programming and it is highly remunerated  as well as other very detail oriented tasks  that they are concentrating geographically and finding like minded mates. So this is the assortative mating hypothesis of these genes reinforcing one another in these structures. The third  is this too much information  We're trying to process so much stuff that some people get synesthetic and just have huge pipes that remember everything. Other people get hyper sensitive to the amount of information. Other people react with various psychological conditions or reactions to this information. Or maybe it's chemicals. But when you see an increase of that order of magnitude in a condition  either you're not measuring it right or there's something going on very quickly  and it may be evolution in real time. Here's the bottom line. What I think we are doing is we're transitioning as a species. And I didn't think this when Steve Gullans and I started writing together. I think we're transitioning into Homo evolutis that  for better or worse  is not just a hominid that's conscious of his or her environment  it's a hominid that's beginning to directly and deliberately control the evolution of its own species  of bacteria  of plants  of animals. And I think that's such an order of magnitude change that your grandkids or your great grandkids may be a species very different from you. Thank you very much. When I go to parties  it doesn't usually take very long for people to find out that I'm a scientist and I study sex. And then I get asked questions. And the questions usually have a very particular format. They start with the phrase   A friend told me   and then they end with the phrase   Is this true   And most of the time I'm glad to say that I can answer them  but sometimes I have to say   I'm really sorry  but I don't know because I'm not that kind of a doctor.  That is  I'm not a clinician  I'm a comparative biologist who studies anatomy. And my job is to look at lots of different species of animals and try to figure out how their tissues and organs work when everything's going right  rather than trying to figure out how to fix things when they go wrong  like so many of you. And what I do is I look for similarities and differences in the solutions that they've evolved for fundamental biological problems. So today I'm here to argue that this is not at all an esoteric Ivory Tower activity that we find at our universities  but that broad study across species  tissue types and organ systems can produce insights that have direct implications for human health. And this is true both of my recent project on sex differences in the brain  and my more mature work on the anatomy and function of penises. And now you know why I'm fun at parties. So today I'm going to give you an example drawn from my penis study to show you how knowledge drawn from studies of one organ system provided insights into a very different one. Now I'm sure as everyone in the audience already knows    I did have to explain it to my nine year old late last week    penises are structures that transfer sperm from one individual to another. And the slide behind me barely scratches the surface of how widespread they are in animals. There's an enormous amount of anatomical variation. You find muscular tubes  modified legs  modified fins  as well as the mammalian fleshy  inflatable cylinder that we're all familiar with    or at least half of you are. And I think we see this tremendous variation because it's a really effective solution to a very basic biological problem  and that is getting sperm in a position to meet up with eggs and form zygotes. Now the penis isn't actually required for internal fertiliztion  but when internal fertilization evolves  penises often follow. And the question I get when I start talking about this most often is   What made you interested in this subject   And the answer is skeletons. You wouldn't think that skeletons and penises have very much to do with one another. And that's because we tend to think of skeletons as stiff lever systems that produce speed or power. And my first forays into biological research  doing dinosaur paleontology as an undergraduate  were really squarely in that realm. But when I went to graduate school to study biomechanics  I really wanted to find a dissertation project that would expand our knowledge of skeletal function. I tried a bunch of different stuff. A lot of it didn't pan out. But then one day I started thinking about the mammalian penis. And it's really an odd sort of structure. Before it can be used for internal fertilization  its mechanical behavior has to change in a really dramatic fashion. Most of the time it's a flexible organ. It's easy to bend. But before it's brought into use during copulation it has to become rigid  it has to become difficult to bend. And moreover  it has to work. A reproductive system that fails to function produces an individual that has no offspring  and that individual is then kicked out of the gene pool. And so I thought   Here's a problem that just cries out for a skeletal system    not one like this one  but one like this one    because  functionally  a skeleton is any system that supports tissue and transmits forces. And I already knew that animals like this earthworm  indeed most animals  don't support their tissues by draping them over bones. Instead they're more like reinforced water balloons. They use a skeleton that we call a hydrostatic skeleton. And a hydrostatic skeleton uses two elements. The skeletal support comes from an interaction between a pressurized fluid and a surrounding wall of tissue that's held in tension and reinforced with fibrous proteins. And the interaction is crucial. Without both elements you have no support. If you have fluid with no wall to surround it and keep pressure up  you have a puddle. And if you have just the wall with no fluid inside of it to put the wall in tension  you've got a little wet rag. When you look at a penis in cross section  it has a lot of the hallmarks of a hydrostatic skeleton. It has a central space of spongy erectile tissue that fills with fluid    in this case blood    surrounded by a wall of tissue that's rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen. But at the time when I started this project  the best explanation I could find for penal erection was that the wall surrounded these spongy tissues  and the spongy tissues filled with blood and pressure rose and voila  it became erect. And that explained to me expansion    made sense  more fluid  you get tissues that expand    but it didn't actually explain erection. Because there was no mechanism in this explanation for making this structure hard to bend. And no one had systematically looked at the wall tissue. So I thought  wall tissue's important in skeletons. It has to be part of the explanation. And this was the point at which my graduate adviser said   Whoa  Hold on. Slow down.  Because after about six months of me talking about this  I think he finally figured out that I was really serious about the penis thing. So he sat me down  and he warned me. He was like   Be careful going down this path. I'm not sure this project's going to pan out.  Because he was afraid I was walking into a trap. I was taking on a socially embarrassing question with an answer that he thought might not be particularly interesting. And that was because every hydrostatic skeleton that we had found in nature up to that point had the same basic elements. It had the central fluid  it had the surrounding wall  and the reinforcing fibers in the wall were arranged in crossed helices around the long axis of the skeleton. So the image behind me shows a piece of tissue in one of these cross helical skeletons cut so that you're looking at the surface of the wall. The arrow shows you the long axis. And you can see two layers of fibers  one in blue and one in yellow  arranged in left handed and right handed angles. And if you weren't just looking at a little section of the fibers  those fibers would be going in helices around the long axis of the skeleton    something like a Chinese finger trap  where you stick your fingers in and they get stuck. And these skeletons have a particular set of behaviors  which I'm going to demonstrate in a film. It's a model skeleton that I made out of a piece of cloth that I wrapped around an inflated balloon. The cloth's cut on the bias. So you can see that the fibers wrap in helices  and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves  which means the skeleton's flexible. It lengthens  shortens and bends really easily in response to internal or external forces. Now my adviser's concern was what if the penile wall tissue is just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton. What are you going to contribute  What new thing are you contributing to our knowledge of biology  And I thought   Yeah  he does have a really good point here.  So I spent a long  long time thinking about it. And one thing kept bothering me  and that's  when they're functioning  penises don't wiggle. So something interesting had to be going on. So I went ahead  collected wall tissue  prepared it so it was erect  sectioned it  put it on slides and then stuck it under the microscope to have a look  fully expecting to see crossed helices of collagen of some variety. But instead I saw this. There's an outer layer and an inner layer. The arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton. I was really surprised at this. Everyone I showed it was really surprised at this. Why was everyone surprised at this  That's because we knew theoretically that there was another way of arranging fibers in a hydrostatic skeleton  and that was with fibers at zero degrees and    degrees to the long axis of the structure. The thing is  no one had ever seen it before in nature. And now I was looking at one. Those fibers in that particular orientation give the skeleton a very  very different behavior. I'm going to show a model made out of exactly the same materials. So it'll be made of the same cotton cloth  same balloon  same internal pressure. But the only difference is that the fibers are arranged differently. And you'll see that  unlike the cross helical model  this model resists extension and contraction and resists bending. Now what that tells us is that wall tissues are doing so much more than just covering the vascular tissues. They're an integral part of the penile skeleton. If the wall around the erectile tissue wasn't there  if it wasn't reinforced in this way  the shape would change  but the inflated penis would not resist bending  and erection simply wouldn't work. It's an observation with obvious medical applications in humans as well  but it's also relevant in a broad sense  I think  to the design of prosthetics  soft robots  basically anything where changes of shape and stiffness are important. So to sum up  Twenty years ago  I had a college adviser tell me  when I went to the college and said   I'm kind of interested in anatomy   they said   Anatomy's a dead science.  He couldn't have been more wrong. I really believe that we still have a lot to learn about the normal structure and function of our bodies. Not just about its genetics and molecular biology  but up here in the meat end of the scale. We've got limits on our time. We often focus on one disease  one model  one problem  but my experience suggests that we should take the time to apply ideas broadly between systems and just see where it takes us. After all  if ideas about invertebrate skeletons can give us insights about mammalian reproductive systems  there could be lots of other wild and productive connections lurking out there just waiting to be found. Thank you. I have the answer to a question that we've all asked. The question is  Why is it that the letter X represents the unknown  Now I know we learned that in math class  but now it's everywhere in the culture    The X prize  the X Files  Project X  TEDx. Where'd that come from  About six years ago I decided that I would learn Arabic  which turns out to be a supremely logical language. To write a word or a phrase or a sentence in Arabic is like crafting an equation  because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information. That's one of the reasons so much of what we've come to think of as Western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era by the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks. This includes the little system in Arabic called al jebra. And al jebr roughly translates to  the system for reconciling disparate parts.  Al jebr finally came into English as algebra. One example among many. The Arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom finally made their way to Europe    which is to say Spain    in the   th and   th centuries. And when they arrived there was tremendous interest in translating this wisdom into a European language. But there were problems. One problem is there are some sounds in Arabic that just don't make it through a European voice box without lots of practice. Trust me on that one. Also  those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in European languages. Here's one of the culprits. This is the letter SHeen  and it makes the sound we think of as SH     sh.  It's also the very first letter of the word shalan  which means  something  just like the the English word  something     some undefined  unknown thing. Now in Arabic  we can make this definite by adding the definite article  al.  So this is al shalan    the unknown thing. And this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics  such as this   th century derivation of proofs. The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material is that the letter SHeen and the word shalan can't be rendered into Spanish because Spanish doesn't have that SH  that  sh  sound. So by convention  they created a rule in which they borrowed the CK sound   ck  sound  from the classical Greek in the form of the letter Kai. Later when this material was translated into a common European language  which is to say Latin  they simply replaced the Greek Kai with the Latin X. And once that happened  once this material was in Latin  it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost     years. But now we have the answer to our question. Why is it that X is the unknown  X is the unknown because you can't say  sh  in Spanish. And I thought that was worth sharing. I collaborate with bacteria. And I'm about to show you some stop motion footage that I made recently where you'll see bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment over the period of an hour. So what you're seeing here is the bacteria metabolizing  and as they do so they create an electrical charge. And this attracts metals from their local environment. And these metals accumulate as minerals on the surface of the bacteria. One of the most pervasive problems in the world today for people is inadequate access to clean drinking water. And the desalination process is one where we take out salts. We can use it for drinking and agriculture. Removing the salts from water    particularly seawater    through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe. So seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane filtration technology. We take the water from the sea and we apply pressure. And this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane. This takes energy  producing clean water. But we're also left with a concentrated salt solution  or brine. But the process is very expensive and it's cost prohibitive for many countries around the globe. And also  the brine that's produced is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea. And this is detrimental to the local ecology of the sea area that it's pumped back out into. So I work in Singapore at the moment  and this is a place that's really a leading place for desalination technology. And Singapore proposes by      to produce       million liters per day of desalinated water. But this will produce an equally massive amount of desalination brine. And this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play. So what we're doing at the moment is we're accumulating metals like calcium  potassium and magnesium from out of desalination brine. And this  in terms of magnesium and the amount of water that I just mentioned  equates to a   .  billion mining industry for Singapore    a place that doesn't have any natural resources. So I'd like you to image a mining industry in a way that one hasn't existed before  imagine a mining industry that doesn't mean defiling the Earth  imagine bacteria helping us do this by accumulating and precipitating and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine. And what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube  a mining industry that is in harmony with nature. Thank you. Today I'm going to unpack for you three examples of iconic design  and it makes perfect sense that I should be the one to do it because I have a Bachelor's degree in Literature. But I'm also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of Design Within Reach catalogs  so I pretty much know everything there is. Now  I'm sure you recognize this object  many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at Los Angeles International Airport over the past couple of days. This is known as the Theme Building  that is its name for reasons that are still very murky. And it is perhaps the best example we have in Los Angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture. It was first excavated in      as they were building LAX  although scientists believe that it dates back to the year      Before Common Era  when it was used as a busy transdimensional space port by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revolving restaurants. It is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located  of course  at Stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design  the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously  the much better access to parking. When it was uncovered  it ushered in a new era of streamlined  archaically futuristic design called Googie  which came to be synonymous with the Jet Age  a misnomer. After all  the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often  preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls. Ah yes  a table. We use these every day. And on top of it  the juicy salif. This is a design by Philippe Starck  who I believe is in the audience at this very moment. And you can tell it is a Starck design by its precision  its playfulness  its innovation and its promise of imminent violence. It is a design that challenges your intuition    it is not what you think it is when you first see it. It is not a fork designed to grab three hors d'oeuvres at a time  which would be useful out in the lobby  I would say. And despite its obvious influence by the ancient astronauts and its space agey ness and tripodism  it is not something designed to attach to your brain and suck out your thoughts. It is in fact a citrus juicer and when I say that  you never see it as anything else again. It is also not a monument to design  it is a monument to design's utility. You can take it home with you  unlike the Theme Building  which will stay where it is forever. This is affordable and can come home with you and  as such  it can sit on your kitchen counter    it can't go in your drawers  trust me  I found that out the hard way    and make your kitchen counter into a monument to design. One other thing about it  if you do have one at home  let me tell you one of the features you may not know  when you fall asleep  it comes alive and it walks around your house and goes through your mail and watches you as you sleep. Okay  what is this object  I have no idea. I don't know what that thing is. It looks terrible. Is it a little hot plate  I don't get it. Does anyone know  Chi  It's an ... iPhone. iPhone. Oh yes  that's right  I remember those  I had my whole bathroom tiles redone with those back in the good old days. No  I have an iPhone. Of course I do. Here is my well loved iPhone. I do so many things on this little device. I like to read books on it. More than that  I like to buy books on it that I never have to feel guilty about not reading because they go in here and I never look at them again and it's perfect. I use it every day to measure the weight of an ox  for example. Every now and then  I admit that I complete a phone call on it occasionally. And yet I forget about it all the time. This is a design that once you saw it  you forgot about it. It is easy to forget the gasp inducement that occurred in      when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life. Unlike the Theme Building  this is not alien technology. Or I should say  what it did was it took technology which  unlike people in this room  to many other people in the world  still feels very alien  and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate. And unlike the juicy salif  it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain  rather  it simply attaches itself to your brain. And you didn't even notice it happened. So there you go. My name is John Hodgman. I just explained design. Thank you very much. I always wanted to become a walking laboratory of social engagement  to resonate other people's feelings  thoughts  intentions  motivations  in the act of being with them. As a scientist  I always wanted to measure that resonance  that sense of the other that happens so quickly  in the blink of an eye. We intuit other people's feelings. We know the meaning of their actions even before they happen. We're always in this stance of being the object of somebody else's subjectivity. We do that all the time. We just can't shake it off. It's so important that the very tools that we use to understand ourselves  to understand the world around them  is shaped by that stance. We are social to the core. So my journey in autism really started when I lived in a residential unit for adults with autism. Most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long stay hospitals. This is a long time ago. And for them  autism was devastating. They had profound intellectual disabilities. They didn't talk. But most of all  they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them  from their environment and from the people. In fact  at the time  if you walked into a school for individuals with autism  you'd hear a lot of noise  plenty of commotion  actions  people doing things  but they're always doing things by themselves. So they may be looking at a light in the ceiling  or they may be isolated in the corner  or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements  in self stimulatory movements that led them nowhere. Extremely  extremely isolated. Well  now we know that autism is this disruption  the disruption of this resonance that I am telling you. These are survival skills. These are survival skills that we inherited over many  many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution. You see  babies are born in a state of utter fragility. Without the caregiver  they wouldn't survive  so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with these mechanisms of survival. They orient to the caregiver. From the first days and weeks of life  babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment. They prefer to look at people rather than at things  and even as they're looking at people  they look at people's eyes  because the eye is the window to the other person's experiences  so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away. Well  they orient to the caregiver. The caregiver seeks the baby. And it's out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind  the social mind  the social brain  depends on. We always think about autism as something that happens later on in life. It doesn't. It begins with the beginning of life. As babies engage with caregivers  they soon realize that  well  there is something in between the ears that is very important    it's invisible  you can't see    but is really critical  and that thing is called attention. And they learn soon enough  even before they can utter one word that they can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want. They also learn to follow other people's gaze  because whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about. And soon enough  they start to learn about the meaning of things  because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something  they're not just getting a directional cue  they are getting the other person's meaning of that thing  the attitude  and soon enough they start building this body of meanings  but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction. Those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with others. Well  this is a little    month old little girl  and she has autism. And I am coming so close to her that I am maybe two inches from her face  and she's quite oblivious to me. Imagine if I did that to you  and I came two inches from your face. You'd do probably two things  wouldn't you  You would recoil. You would call the police.  Laughter  You would do something  because it's literally impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space and not get a reaction. We do so  remember  intuitively  effortlessly. This is our body wisdom. It's not something that is mediated by our language. Our body just knows that  and we've known that for a long time. And this is not something that happens to humans only. It happens to some of our phylatic cousins  because if you're a monkey  and you look at another monkey  and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you  and that is considered to be a signal or threat  well  you are not going to be alive for long. So something that in other species are survival mechanisms  without them they wouldn't basically live  we bring into the context of human beings  and this is what we need to simply act  act socially. Now  she is oblivious to me  and I am so close to her  and you think  maybe she can see you  maybe she can hear you. Well  a few minutes later  she goes to the corner of the room  and she finds a tiny little piece of candy  an M M. So I could not attract her attention  but something  a thing  did. Now  most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people. Now  for this girl  that division line is not so clear  and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like. Now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences. Now  what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating herself further and further. So we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic  the brain determines who we are going to be. But in fact the brain also becomes who we are  and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction  this is what's happening with her mind and this is what's happening with her brain. Well  autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders  and it's a brain disorder. It's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born. We now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism. There are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled  but there are those that are gifted. There are those individuals who don't talk at all. There are those individuals who talk too much. There are those individuals that if you observe them in their school  you see them running the periphery fence of the school all day if you let them  to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage you repeatedly  relentlessly  but often in an awkward fashion  without that immediate resonance. Well  this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time. When I started in this field  we thought that there were four individuals with autism per         a very rare condition. Well  now we know it's more like one in    . There are millions of individuals with autism all around us. The societal cost of this condition is huge. In the U.S. alone  maybe    to    billion dollars  and you know what  Most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled  individuals who need wrap around services  services that are very  very intensive  and those services can cost in excess of    to        dollars a year. Those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment  because now we know that autism creates itself as they diverge in that pathway of learning that I mentioned to you. Were we to be able to identify this condition at an earlier point  and intervene and treat  I can tell you  and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past    years  this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition. Also  we have a window of opportunity  because the brain is malleable for just so long  and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life. It's not that that window closes. It doesn't. But it diminishes considerably. And yet  the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years  and in disadvantaged populations  the populations that don't have access to clinical services  rural populations  minorities  the age of diagnosis is later still  which is almost as if I were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe. So I feel that we have a bio ethical imperative. The science is there  but no science is of relevance if it doesn't have an impact on the community  and we just can't afford that missed opportunity  because children with autism become adults with autism  and we feel that those things that we can do for these children  for those families  early on  will have lifetime consequences  for the child  for the family  and for the community at large. So this is our view of autism. There are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism. In fact  we believe that there are going to be something between     and     genes associated with autism  and genetic anomalies  much more than just genes. And we actually have a bit of a question here  because if there are so many different causes of autism  how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome  Because people like myself  when we walk into a playroom  we recognize a child as having autism. So how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity  And the answer is  what lies in between  which is development. And in fact  we are very interested in those first two years of life  because those liabilities don't necessarily convert into autism. Autism creates itself. Were we to be able to intervene during those years of life  we might attenuate for some  and God knows  maybe even prevent for others. So how do we do that  How do we enter that feeling of resonance  how do we enter another person's being  I remember when I interacted with that    month older  that the thing that came to mind was   How do you come into her world  Is she thinking about me  Is she thinking about others   Well  it's hard to do that  so we had to create the technologies. We had to basically step inside a body. We had to see the world through her eyes. And so in the past many years we've been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking. We can see moment by moment what children are engaging with. Well  this is my colleague Warren Jones  with whom we've been building these methods  these studies  for the past    years  and you see there a happy five month older  it's a five month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world  his mom  the caregiver  but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare. What we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory  but in order for us to do that  we had to create these very sophisticated measures  measures of how people  how little babies  how newborns  engage with the world  moment by moment  what is important  and what is not. Well  we created those measures  and here  what you see is what we call a funnel of attention. You're watching a video. Those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of    typically developing two year olds  and we freeze one frame  and this is what the typical children are doing. In this scan pass  in green here  are two year olds with autism. So on that frame  the children who are typical are watching this  the emotion of expression of that little boy as he's fighting a little bit with the little girl. What are the children with autism doing  They are focusing on the revolving door  opening and shutting. Well  I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen only in our five minute experiment. It happens moment by moment in their real lives  and their minds are being formed  and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers. Well  we took a construct from our pediatrician friends  the concept of growth charts. You know  when you take a child to the pediatrician  and so you have physical height  and weight. Well we decided that we're going to create growth charts of social engagement  and we sought children from the time that they are born  and what you see here on the x axis is two  three  four  five  six months and nine  until about the age of    months  and this is the percent of their viewing time that they are focusing on people's eyes  and this is their growth chart. They start over here  they love people's eyes  and it remains quite stable. It sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months. Now  let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic. It's something very different. It starts way up here  but then it's a free fall. It's very much like they brought into this world the reflex that orients them to people  but it has no traction. It's almost as if that stimulus  you  you're not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives. Now  we thought that those data were so powerful in a way  that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life  because if you interact with a two  and a three month older  you'd be surprised by how social those babies are. And what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated very easily. And using these kinds of measures  and many others  what we found out is that our science could  in fact  identify this condition early on. We didn't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge in the second year of life. If we measured things that are  evolutionarily  highly conserved  and developmentally very early emerging  things that are online from the first weeks of life  we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months  and that's what we are doing now. Now  we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children  but this would be for naught if we didn't have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community. Now we want those devices  of course  to be deployed by those who are in the trenches  our colleagues  the primary care physicians  who see every child  and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice  because they have to see so many children. And we want to do that universally so that we don't miss any child  but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention  for treatment. We need to be able to work with the families  to support the families  to manage those first years with them. We need to be able to really go from universal screening to universal access to treatment  because those treatments are going to change these children's and those families' lives. Now  when we think about what we  can  do in those first years  I can tell you  having been in this field for so long  one feels really rejuvenated. There is a sense that the science that one worked on can actually have an impact on realities  preventing  in fact  those experiences that I really started in my journey in this field. I thought at the time that this was an intractable condition. No longer. We can do a great deal of things. And the idea is not to cure autism. That's not the idea. What we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times  the profound intellectual disabilities  the lack of language  the profound  profound isolation. We feel that individuals with autism  in fact  have a very special perspective on the world  and we need diversity  and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength  predictable situations  situations that can be defined. Because after all  they learn about the world almost like about it  rather than learning how to function in it. But this is a strength  if you're working  for example  in technology. And there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities. We want them to be free of that. We want that the next generations of individuals with autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise. Well thank you for listening to me.  Applause  I am no designer  nope  no way. My dad was  which is kind of an interesting way to grow up. I had to figure out what it is my dad did and why it was important. Dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up  you know   Bad design is just people not thinking  John   he would say whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower or  say  a typewriter ribbon would get tangled or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen. You know   Design    bad design  there's just no excuse for it. It's letting stuff happen without thinking about it. Every object should be about something  John. It should imagine a user. It should cast that user in a story starring the user and the object. Good design   my dad said   is about supplying intent.  That's what he said. Dad helped design the control panels for the IBM     computer. That was a big deal  that was important. He worked for Kodak for a while  that was important. He designed chairs and desks and other office equipment for Steelcase  that was important. I knew design was important in my house because  for heaven's sake  it put food on our table  right  And design was in everything my dad did. He had a Dixieland jazz band when we were growing up  and he would always cover Louis Armstrong tunes. And I would ask him every once in a while   Dad  do you want it to sound like the record   We had lots of old jazz records lying around the house. And he said   No  never  John  never. The song is just a given  that's how you have to think about it. You gotta make it your own. You gotta design it. Show everyone what you intend   is what he said.  Doing that  acting by design  is what we all should be doing. It's where we all belong.  All of us  Designers  Oh  oh  Dad. Oh  Dad. The song is just a given. It's how you cover it that matters. Well  let's hold on to that thought for just a minute. It's kind of like this wheelchair I'm in  right  The original tune  It's a little scary.  Ooh  what happened to that dude  He can't walk. Anybody know the story  Anybody   I don't like to talk about this very much  but I'll tell you guys the story today. All right  exactly    years ago this week  that's right  I was in a poorly designed automobile that hit a poorly designed guardrail on a poorly designed road in Pennsylvania  and plummeted down a     foot embankment and killed two people in the car. But ever since then  the wheelchair has been a given in my life. My life  at the mercy of good design and bad design. Think about it. Now  in design terms  a wheelchair is a very difficult object. It mostly projects tragedy and fear and misfortune  and it projects that message  that story  so strongly that it almost blots out anything else. I roll swiftly through an airport  right  And moms grab their kids out of the way and say   Don't stare   The poor kid  you know  has this terrified look on his face  God knows what they think. And for decades  I'm going  why does this happen  What can I do about it  How can I change this  I mean there must be something. So I would roll  I'd make no eye contact    just kinda frown  right  Or I'd dress up really  really sharply or something. Or I'd make eye contact with everyone    that was really creepy  that didn't work at all. You know anything  I'd try. I wouldn't shower for a week    nothing worked. Nothing whatsoever worked until a few years ago  my six year old daughters were looking at this wheelchair catalog that I had  and they said   Oh  Dad  Dad  Look  you gotta get these  these flashy wheels    you gotta get 'em   And I said   Oh  girls  Dad is a very important journalist  that just wouldn't do at all.  And of course  they immediately concluded   Oh  what a bummer  Dad. Journalists aren't allowed to have flashy wheels. I mean  how important could you be then   they said. I went   Wait a minute  all right  right    I'll get the wheels.  Purely out of protest  I got the flashy wheels  and I installed them and    check this out. Could I have my special light cue please  Look at that  Now ... look at  look at this  Look at this  So what you are looking at here has completely changed my life  I mean totally changed my life. Instead of blank stares and awkwardness  now it is pointing and smiling  People going   Awesome wheels  dude  Those are awesome  I mean  I want some of those wheels   Little kids say   Can I have a ride   And of course there's the occasional person    usually a middle aged male who will say   Oh  those wheels are great  I guess they're for safety  right   No  They're not for safety. No  no  no  no  no. What's the difference here  the wheelchair with no lights and the wheelchair with lights  The difference is intent. That's right  that's right  I'm no longer a victim. I chose to change the situation    I'm the Commander of the Starship Wheelchair with the phaser wheels in the front. Right  Intent changes the picture completely. I choose to enhance this rolling experience with a simple design element. Acting with intent. It conveys authorship. It suggests that someone is driving. It's reassuring  people are drawn to it. Someone making the experience their own. Covering the tragic tune with something different  something radically different. People respond to that. Now it seems simple  but actually I think in our society and culture in general  we have a huge problem with intent. Now go with me here. Look at this guy. You know who this is  It's Anders Breivik. Now  if he intended to kill in Olso  Norway last year  dozens and dozens of young people    if he intended to do that  he's a vicious criminal. We punish him. Life in prison. Death penalty in the United States  not so much in Norway. But  if he instead acted out of a delusional fantasy  if he was motivated by some random mental illness  he's in a completely different category. We may put him away for life  but we watch him clinically. It's a completely different domain. As an intentional murderer  Anders Breivik is merely evil. But as a dysfunctional  as a dysfunctional murderer psychotic  he's something much more complicated. He's the breath of some primitive  ancient chaos. He's the random state of nature we emerged from. He's something very  very different. It's as though intent is an essential component for humanity. It's what we're supposed to do somehow. We're supposed to act with intent. We're supposed to do things by design. Intent is a marker for civilization. Now here's an example a little closer to home  My family is all about intent. You can probably tell there are two sets of twins  the result of IVF technology  in vitro fertilization technology  due to some physical limitations I won't go into. Anyway  in vitro technology  IVF  is about as intentional as agriculture. Let me tell you  some of you may have the experience. In fact  the whole technology of sperm extraction for spinal cord injured males was invented by a veterinarian. I met the dude. He's a great guy. He carried this big leather bag full of sperm probes for all of the animals that he'd worked with  all the different animals. Probes he designed  and in fact  he was really  really proud of these probes. He would say   You're right between horse and squirrel  John.  But anyway  so when my wife and I decided to upgrade our early middle age    we had four kids  after all    with a little different technology that I won't explain in too much detail here    my urologist assured me I had nothing whatsoever to worry about.  No need for birth control  Doc  are you sure about that    John  John  I looked at your chart. From your sperm tests we can confidently say that you're basically a form of birth control.  Well  What a liberating thought  Yes  And after a couple very liberating weekends  my wife and I  utilizing some cutting edge erectile technology that is certainly worthy of a TEDTalk someday but I won't get into it now  we noticed some familiar  if unexpected  symptoms. I wasn't exactly a form of birth control. Look at that font there. My wife was so pissed. I mean  did a designer come up with that  No  I don't think a designer did come up with that. In fact  maybe that's the problem. And so  little Ajax was born. He's like our other children  but the experience is completely different. It's something like my accident  right  He came out of nowhere. But we all had to change  but not just react to the given  we bend to this new experience with intent. We're five now. Five. Facing the given with intent. Doing things by design. Hey  the name Ajax    you can't get much more intentional than that  right  We're really hoping he thanks us for that later on. But I never became a designer. No  no  no  no. Never attempted. Never even close. I did love some great designs as I was growing up  The HP   S calculator    God  I loved that thing. Oh God  I wish I had one. Man  I love that thing. I could afford that. Other designs I really couldn't afford  like the          Targa. In school  I studied nothing close to design or engineering  I studied useless things like the Classics  but there were some lessons even there    this guy  Plato  it turns out he's a designer. He designed a state in  The Republic   a design never implemented. Listen to one of the design features of Plato's Government  .    The State in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed  and the State in which they are most eager  the worst.  Well  got that wrong  didn't we  But look at that statement  it's all about intent. That's what I love about it. But consider what Plato is doing here. What is he doing  It's a grand idea of design    a huge idea of design  common to all of the voices of religion and philosophy that emerged in the Classical period. What was going on then  They were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive  As the human race emerged from a prehistoric chaos  a confrontation with random  brutal nature  they suddenly had a moment to think    and there was a lot to think about. All of a sudden  human existence needed an intent. Human life needed a reason. Reality itself needed a designer. The given was replaced by various aspects of intent  by various designs  by various gods. Gods we're still fighting about. Oh yeah. Today we don't confront the chaos of nature. Today it is the chaos of humanity's impact on the Earth itself that we confront. This young discipline called design  I think  is in fact the emerging ethos formulating and then answering a very new question  What shall we do now in the face of the chaos that we have created  What shall we do  How shall we inscribe intent on all the objects we create  on all the circumstances we create  on all the places we change  The consequences of a planet with   billion people and counting. That's the tune we're all covering today  all of us. And we can't just imitate the past. No. That won't do. That won't do at all. Here's my favorite design moment  In the city of Kinshasa in Zaire in the     s  I was working for ABC News  and I was reporting on the fall of Mobutu Sese Seko  the dictator  the brutal dictator in Zaire  who raped and pillaged that country. There was rioting in the middle of Kinshasa. The place was falling apart  it was a horrible  horrible place  and I needed to go and explore the center of Kinshasa to report on the rioting and the looting. People were carrying off vehicles  carrying off pieces of buildings. Soldiers were in the streets shooting at looters and herding some in mass arrests. In the middle of this chaos  I'm rolling around in a wheelchair  and I was completely invisible. Completely. I was in a wheelchair  I didn't look like a looter. I was in a wheelchair  I didn't look like a journalist  particularly  at least from their perspective. And I didn't look like a soldier  that's for sure. I was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of Zaire  completely invisible. And all of a sudden  from around a corner  comes this young man  paralyzed  just like me  in this metal and wood and leather pedal  three wheel tricycle wheelchair device  and he pedals up to me as fast as he can. He goes   Hey  mister  Mister   And I looked at him    he didn't know any other English than that  but we didn't need English  no  no  no  no  no. We sat there and compared wheels and tires and spokes and tubes. And I looked at his whacky pedal mechanism  he was full of pride over his design. I wish I could show you that contraption. His smile  our glow as we talked a universal language of design  invisible to the chaos around us. His machine  homemade  bolted  rusty  comical. My machine  American made  confident  sleek. He was particularly proud of the comfortable seat  really comfortable seat he had made in his chariot and its beautiful fabric fringe around the edge. Oh  I wish I'd had those sparkly wheels back then to have shown him  man  He would have loved those  Oh yeah. He would have understood those  a chariot of pure intent    think about it    in a city out of control. Design blew it all away for a moment. We spoke for a few minutes and then each of us vanished back into the chaos. He went back to the streets of Kinshasa  I went to my hotel. And I think of him now  now ... And I pose this question. An object imbued with intent    it has power  it's treasure  we're drawn to it. An object devoid of intent    it's random  it's imitative  it repels us. It's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away. This is what we must demand of our lives  of our objects  of our things  of our circumstances  living with intent. And I have to say that on that score  I have a very unfair advantage over all of you. And I want to explain it to you now because this is a very special day. Thirty six years ago at nearly this moment  a    year old boy awoke from a coma to ask a nurse a question  but the nurse was already there with an answer.  You've had a terrible accident  young man. You've broken your back. You'll never walk again.  I said   I know all that    what day is it   You see  I knew that the car had gone over the guardrail on the   th of February  and I knew that      was a leap year.  Nurse  Is this the   th or the   th   And she looked at me and said   It's March  st.  And I went   Oh my God. I've got some catching up to do   And from that moment  I knew the given was that accident  I had no option but to make up this new life without walking. Intent    a life with intent    lived by design  covering the original with something better. It's something for all of us to do or find a way to do in these times. To get back to this  to get back to design  and as my daddy suggested a long time ago   Make the song your own  John. Show everybody what you intend.  Daddy  this one's for you.   Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner     but he was another man.     Jo Jo left his home in Tucson  Arizona to attend a California bash.     Get back  get back      get back to where you once belonged.     Get back  get back      get back to where you once belonged.   So my freshman year of college I signed up for an internship in the housing unit at Greater Boston Legal Services. Showed up the first day ready to make coffee and photocopies  but was paired with this righteous  deeply inspired attorney named Jeff Purcell  who thrust me onto the front lines from the very first day. And over the course of nine months I had the chance to have dozens of conversations with low income families in Boston who would come in presenting with housing issues  but always had an underlying health issue. So I had a client who came in  about to be evicted because he hasn't paid his rent. But he hasn't paid his rent  of course  because he's paying for his HIV medication and just can't afford both. We had moms who would come in  daughter has asthma  wakes up covered in cockroaches every morning. And one of our litigation strategies was actually to send me into the home of these clients with these large glass bottles. And I would collect the cockroaches  hot glue gun them to this poster board that we'd bring to court for our cases. And we always won because the judges were just so grossed out. Far more effective  I have to say  than anything I later learned in law school. But over the course of these nine months  I grew frustrated with feeling like we were intervening too far downstream in the lives of our clients    that by the time they came to us  they were already in crisis. And at the end of my freshman year of college  I read an article about the work that Dr. Barry Zuckerman was doing as Chair of Pediatrics at Boston Medical Center. And his first hire was a legal services attorney to represent the patients. So I called Barry  and with his blessing  in October      walked into the waiting room of the pediatrics clinic at Boston Medical Center. I'll never forget  the TVs played this endless reel of cartoons. And the exhaustion of mothers who had taken two  three  sometimes four buses to bring their child to the doctor was just palpable. The doctors  it seemed  never really had enough time for all the patients  try as they might. And over the course of six months  I would corner them in the hallway and ask them a sort of naive but fundamental question   If you had unlimited resources  what's the one thing you would give your patients   And I heard the same story again and again  a story we've heard hundreds of times since then. They said   Every day we have patients that come into the clinic    child has an ear infection  I prescribe antibiotics. But the real issue is there's no food at home. The real issue is that child is living with    other people in a two bedroom apartment. And I don't even ask about those issues because there's nothing I can do. I have    minutes with each patient. Patients are piling up in the clinic waiting room. I have no idea where the nearest food pantry is. And I don't even have any help.  In that clinic  even today  there are two social workers for        pediatric patients  which is better than a lot of the clinics out there. So Health Leads was born of these conversations    a simple model where doctors and nurses can prescribe nutritious food  heat in the winter and other basic resources for their patients the same way they prescribe medication. Patients then take their prescriptions to our desk in the clinic waiting room where we have a core of well trained college student advocates who work side by side with these families to connect them out to the existing landscape of community resources. So we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room    totally lemonade stand style. But today we have a thousand college student advocates who are working to connect nearly       patients and their families with the resources that they need to be healthy. So    months ago I got this email that changed my life. And the email was from Dr. Jack Geiger  who had written to congratulate me on Health Leads and to share  as he said  a bit of historical context. In      Dr. Geiger founded one of the first two community health centers in this country  in a brutally poor area in the Mississippi Delta. And so many of his patients came in presenting with malnutrition that be began prescribing food for them. And they would take these prescriptions to the local supermarket  which would fill them and then charge the pharmacy budget of the clinic. And when the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington  D.C.    which was funding Geiger's clinic    found out about this  they were furious. And they sent this bureaucrat down to tell Geiger that he was expected to use their dollars for medical care    to which Geiger famously and logically responded   The last time I checked my textbooks  the specific therapy for malnutrition was food.  So when I got this email from Dr. Geiger  I knew I was supposed to be proud to be part of this history. But the truth is I was devastated. Here we are     years after Geiger has prescribed food for his patients  and I have doctors telling me   On those issues  we practice a 'don't ask  don't tell' policy.  Forty five years after Geiger  Health Leads has to reinvent the prescription for basic resources. So I have spent hours upon hours trying to make sense of this weird Groundhog Day. How is it that if for decades we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients  and especially low income patients  healthy  that we didn't use it  If we know what it takes to have a healthcare system rather than a sick care system  why don't we just do it  These questions  in my mind  are not hard because the answers are complicated  they are hard because they require that we be honest with ourselves. My belief is that it's almost too painful to articulate our aspirations for our healthcare system  or even admit that we have any at all. Because if we did  they would be so removed from our current reality. But that doesn't change my belief that all of us  deep inside  here in this room and across this country  share a similar set of desires. That if we are honest with ourselves and listen quietly  that we all harbor one fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare  that it keep us healthy. This aspiration that our healthcare keep us healthy is an enormously powerful one. And the way I think about this is that healthcare is like any other system. It's just a set of choices that people make. What if we decided to make a different set of choices  What if we decided to take all the parts of healthcare that have drifted away from us and stand firm and say   No. These things are ours. They will be used for our purposes. They will be used to realize our aspiration   What if everything we needed to realize our aspiration for healthcare was right there in front of us just waiting to be claimed  So that's where Health Leads began. We started with the prescription pad    a very ordinary piece of paper    and we asked  not what do patients need to get healthy    antibiotics  an inhaler  medication    but what do patients need to be healthy  to not get sick in the first place  And we chose to use the prescription for that purpose. So just a few miles from here at Children's National Medical Center  when patients come into the doctor's office  they're asked a few questions. They're asked   Are you running out of food at the end of the month  Do you have safe housing   And when the doctor begins the visit  she knows height  weight  is there food at home  is the family living in a shelter. And that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices  but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient  using Health Leads like any other sub specialty referral. The problem is  once you get a taste of what it's like to realize your aspiration for healthcare  you want more. So we thought  if we can get individual doctors to prescribe these basic resources for their patients  could we get an entire healthcare system to shift its presumption  And we gave it a shot. So now at Harlem Hospital Center when patients come in with an elevated body mass index  the electronic medical record automatically generates a prescription for Health Leads. And our volunteers can then work with them to connect patients to healthy food and excercise programs in their communities. We've created a presumption that if you're a patient at that hospital with an elevated BMI  the four walls of the doctor's office probably aren't going to give you everything you need to be healthy. You need more. So on the one hand  this is just a basic recoding of the electronic medical record. And on the other hand  it's a radical transformation of the electronic medical record from a static repository of diagnostic information to a health promotion tool. In the private sector  when you squeeze that kind of additional value out of a fixed cost investment  it's called a billion dollar company. But in my world  it's called reduced obesity and diabetes. It's called healthcare    a system where doctors can prescribe solutions to improve health  not just manage disease. Same thing in the clinic waiting room. So every day in this country three million patients pass through about         clinic waiting rooms in this country. And what do they do when they're there  They sit  they watch the goldfish in the fish tank  they read extremely old copies of Good Housekeeping magazine. But mostly we all just sit there forever  waiting. How did we get here where we devote hundreds of acres and thousands of hours to waiting  What if we had a waiting room where you don't just sit when you're sick  but where you go to get healthy. If airports can become shopping malls and McDonald's can become playgrounds  surely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room. And that's what Health Leads has tried to do  to reclaim that real estate and that time and to use it as a gateway to connect patients to the resources they need to be healthy. So it's a brutal winter in the Northeast  your kid has asthma  your heat just got turned off  and of course you're in the waiting room of the ER  because the cold air triggered your child's asthma. But what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously  the waiting room became the place where Health Leads turned your heat back on  And of course all of this requires a broader workforce. But if we're creative  we already have that too. We know that our doctors and nurses and even social workers aren't enough  that the ticking minutes of health care are too constraining. Health just takes more time. It requires a non clinical army of community health workers and case managers and many others. What if a small part of that next healthcare workforce were the    million college students in this country  Unencumbered by clinical responsibilities  unwilling to take no for an answer from those bureaucracies that tend to crush patients  and with an unparalleled ability for information retrieval honed through years of using Google. Now lest you think it improbable that a college volunteer can make this kind of commitment  I have two words for you  March Madness. The average NCAA Division I men's basketball player dedicates    hours a week to his sport. Now we may think that's good or bad  but in either case it's real. And Health Leads is based on the presumption that for too long we have asked too little of our college students when it comes to real impact in vulnerable communities. College sports teams say   We're going to take dozens of hours at some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning and we're going to measure your performance  and your team's performance  and if you don't measure up or you don't show up  we're going to cut you off the team. But we'll make huge investments in your training and development  and we'll give you an extraordinary community of peers.  And people line up out the door just for the chance to be part of it. So our feeling is  if it's good enough for the rugby team  it's good enough for health and poverty. Health Leads too recruits competitively  trains intensively  coaches professionally  demands significant time  builds a cohesive team and measures results    a kind of Teach for America for healthcare. Now in the top    cities in the U.S. with the largest number of Medicaid patients  each of those has at least        college students. New York alone has half a million college students. And this isn't just a sort of short term workforce to connect patients to basic resources  it's a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline who've spent two  three  four years in the clinic waiting room talking to patients about their most basic health needs. And they leave with the conviction  the ability and the efficacy to realize our most basic aspirations for health care. And the thing is  there's thousands of these folks already out there. So Mia Lozada is Chief Resident of Internal Medicine at UCSF Medical Center  but for three years as an undergraduate she was a Health Leads volunteer in the clinic waiting room at Boston Medical Center. Mia says   When my classmates write a prescription  they think their work is done. When I write a prescription  I think  can the family read the prescription  Do they have transportation to the pharmacy  Do they have food to take with the prescription  Do they have insurance to fill the prescription  Those are the questions I learned at Health Leads  not in medical school.  Now none of these solutions    the prescription pad  the electronic medical record  the waiting room  the army of college students    are perfect. But they are ours for the taking    simple examples of the vast under utilized healthcare resources that  if we reclaimed and redeployed  could realize our most basic aspiration of healthcare. So I had been at Legal Services for about nine months when this idea of Health Leads started percolating in my mind. And I knew I had to tell Jeff Purcell  my attorney  that I needed to leave. And I was so nervous  because I thought he was going to be disappointed in me for abandoning our clients for some crazy idea. And I sat down with him and I said   Jeff  I have this idea that we could mobilize college students to address patients' most basic health needs.  And I'll be honest  all I wanted was for him to not be angry at me. But he said this   Rebecca  when you have a vision  you have an obligation to realize that vision. You must pursue that vision.  And I have to say  I was like  Whoa. That's a lot of pressure.  I just wanted a blessing  I didn't want some kind of mandate. But the truth is I've spent every waking minute nearly since then chasing that vision. I believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country. I believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare  it will not be by the diseases cured  but by the diseases prevented. It will not be by the excellence of our technologies or the sophistication of our specialists  but by how rarely we needed them. And most of all  I believe that when we measure healthcare  it will be  not by what the system was  but by what we chose it to be. Thank you. Thank you. Evidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures create their identity in some kind of narrative form. From mother to daughter  preacher to congregant  teacher to pupil  storyteller to audience. Whether in cave paintings or the latest uses of the Internet  human beings have always told their histories and truths through parable and fable. We are inveterate storytellers. But where  in our increasingly secular and fragmented world  do we offer communality of experience  unmediated by our own furious consumerism  And what narrative  what history  what identity  what moral code are we imparting to our young  Cinema is arguably the   th century's most influential art form. Its artists told stories across national boundaries  in as many languages  genres and philosophies as one can imagine. Indeed  it is hard to find a subject that film has yet to tackle. During the last decade we've seen a vast integration of global media  now dominated by a culture of the Hollywood blockbuster. We are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation  not story  is king. What was common to us all    years ago    the telling of stories between generations    is now rarified. As a filmmaker  it worried me. As a human being  it puts the fear of God in me. What future could the young build with so little grasp of where they've come from and so few narratives of what's possible  The irony is palpable  technical access has never been greater  cultural access never weaker. And so in      we set up FILMCLUB  an organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools followed by discussions. If we could raid the annals of     years of film  maybe we could build a narrative that would deliver meaning to the fragmented and restless world of the young. Given the access to technology  even a school in a tiny rural hamlet could project a DVD onto a white board. In the first nine months we ran    clubs across the U.K.  with kids in age groups between five and    watching a film uninterrupted for    minutes. The films were curated and contextualized. But the choice was theirs  and our audience quickly grew to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide. The outcome  immediate. It was an education of the most profound and transformative kind. In groups as large as     and as small as three  these young people discovered new places  new thoughts  new perspectives. By the time the pilot had finished  we had the names of a thousand schools that wished to join. The film that changed my life is a      film by Vittorio De Sica   Miracle in Milan.  It's a remarkable comment on slums  poverty and aspiration. I had seen the film on the occasion of my father's   th birthday. Technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema  find and pay for the print and the projectionist. But for my father  the emotional and artistic importance of De Sica's vision was so great that he chose to celebrate his half century with his three teenage children and    of their friends   In order   he said   to pass the baton of concern and hope on to the next generation.  In the last shot of  Miracle in Milan   slum dwellers float skyward on flying brooms. Sixty years after the film was made and    years after I first saw it  I see young faces tilt up in awe  their incredulity matching mine. And the speed with which they associate it with  Slumdog Millionaire  or the favelas in Rio speaks to the enduring nature. In a FILMCLUB season about democracy and government  we screened  Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.  Made in       the film is older than most of our members' grandparents. Frank Capra's classic values independence and propriety. It shows how to do right  how to be heroically awkward. It is also an expression of faith in the political machine as a force of honor. Shortly after  Mr. Smith  became a FILMCLUB classic  there was a week of all night filibustering in the House of Lords. And it was with great delight that we found young people up and down the country explaining with authority what filibustering was and why the Lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle. After all  Jimmy Stewart filibustered for two entire reels. In choosing  Hotel Rwanda   they explored genocide of the most brutal kind. It provoked tears as well as incisive questions about unarmed peace keeping forces and the double dealing of a Western society that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind. And when  Schindler's List  demanded that they never forget  one child  full of the pain of consciousness  remarked   We already forgot  otherwise how did 'Hotel Rwanda' happen   As they watch more films their lives got palpably richer.  Pickpocket  started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement.  To Sir  with Love  ignited its teen audience. They celebrated a change in attitude towards non white Britons  but railed against our restless school system that does not value collective identity  unlike that offered by Sidney Poitier's careful tutelage. By now  these thoughtful  opinionated  curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms    black and white  subtitled  documentary  non narrative  fantasy    and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose. Six thousand reviews each school week vying for the honor of being review of the week. From    clubs  we became hundreds  then thousands  until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids in       clubs right across the country. And although the numbers were  and continue to be  extraordinary  what became more extraordinary was how the experience of critical and curious questioning translated into life. Some of our kids started talking with their parents  others with their teachers  or with their friends. And those without friends started making them. The films provided communality across all manner of divide. And the stories they held provided a shared experience.  Persepolis  brought a daughter closer to her Iranian mother  and  Jaws  became the way in which one young boy was able to articulate the fear he'd experienced in flight from violence that killed first his father then his mother  the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey. Who was right  who wrong  What would they do under the same conditions  Was the tale told well  Was there a hidden message  How has the world changed  How could it be different  A tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children who the world didn't think were interested. And they themselves had not known they cared. And as they wrote and debated  rather than seeing the films as artifacts  they began to see themselves. I have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller. In a moment she can invoke images of running barefoot on Table Mountain and playing cops and robbers. Quite recently she told me that in       two of her sisters and my father traveled on a boat to Israel without my grandparents. When the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions  it was these teenagers that fed the crew. I was past    when my father died. He never mentioned that journey. My mother's mother left Europe in a hurry without her husband  but with her three year old daughter and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt. After two years in hiding  my grandfather appeared in London. He was never right again. And his story was hushed as he assimilated. My story started in England with a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents. I had  Anne Frank    The Great Escape    Shoah    Triumph of the Will.  It was Leni Riefenstahl in her elegant Nazi propaganda who gave context to what the family had to endure. These films held what was too hurtful to say out loud  and they became more useful to me than the whispers of survivors and the occasional glimpse of a tattoo on a maiden aunt's wrist. Purists may feel that fiction dissipates the quest of real human understanding  that film is too crude to tell a complex and detailed history  or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth. But within the reels lie purpose and meaning. As one    year old said after watching  Wizard of Oz    Every person should watch this  because unless you do you may not know that you too have a heart.  We honor reading  why not honor watching with the same passion  Consider  Citizen Kane  as valuable as Jane Austen. Agree that  Boyz n the Hood   like Tennyson  offers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding that work together. Each a piece of memorable art  each a brick in the wall of who we are. And it's okay if we remember Tom Hanks better than astronaut Jim Lovell or have Ben Kingsley's face superimposed onto that of Gandhi's. And though not real  Eve Harrington  Howard Beale  Mildred Pierce are an opportunity to discover what it is to be human  and no less helpful to understanding our life and times as Shakespeare is in illuminating the world of Elizabethan England. We guessed that film  whose stories are a meeting place of drama  music  literature and human experience  would engage and inspire the young people participating in FILMCLUB. What we could not have foreseen was the measurable improvements in behavior  confidence and academic achievement. Once reluctant students now race to school  talk to their teachers  fight  not on the playground  but to choose next week's film    young people who have found self definition  ambition and an appetite for education and social engagement from the stories they have witnessed. Our members defy the binary description of how we so often describe our young. They are neither feral nor myopically self absorbed. They are  like other young people  negotiating a world with infinite choice  but little culture of how to find meaningful experience. We appeared surprised at the behaviors of those who define themselves by the size of the tick on their shoes  yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered. If we want different values we have to tell a different story  a story that understands that an individual narrative is an essential component of a person's identity  that a collective narrative is an essential component of a cultural identity  and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself as part of a group. Because when these people get home after a screening of  Rear Window  and raise their gaze to the building next door  they have the tools to wonder who  apart from them  is out there and what is their story. Thank you. When I was a child growing up in Maine  one of my favorite things to do was to look for sand dollars on the seashores of Maine  because my parents told me it would bring me luck. But you know  these shells  they're hard to find. They're covered in sand  they're difficult to see. However  over time  I got used to looking for them. I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them. This grew into a passion for finding things  a love for the past and archaeology. And eventually  when I started studying Egyptology  I realized that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough. Because all of the sudden  in Egypt  my beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine to one eight hundred miles long  next to the Nile. And my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities. This is really what brought me to using satellite imagery. For trying to map the past  I knew that I had to see differently. So I want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infrared. This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta called Mendes. And the site visibly appears brown  but when we use the infrared and we process it  all of the sudden  using false color  the site appears as bright pink. What you are seeing are the actual chemical changes to the landscape caused by the building materials and activities of the ancient Egyptians. What I want to share with you today is how we've used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city  called Itjtawy  missing for thousands of years. Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital for over four hundred years  at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom  about four thousand years ago. The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt  and the site is really important  because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance for ancient Egyptian art  architecture and religion. Egyptologists have always known the site of Itjtawy was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it  indicated within the red circles here  but somewhere within this massive flood plain. This area is huge    it's four miles by three miles in size. The Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy  and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east  it covered over the city. So  how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape  Finding it randomly would be the equivalent of locating a needle in a haystack  blindfolded  wearing baseball mitts. So what we did is we used NASA topography data to map out the landscape  very subtle changes. We started to be able to see where the Nile used to flow. But you can see in more detail  and even more interesting  this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy. So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists to do coring work  which you see here. When I say coring  it's like ice coring  but instead of layers of climate change  you're looking for layers of human occupation. And  five meters down  underneath a thick layer of mud  we found a dense layer of pottery. What this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy  five meters down  we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years  dating to the Middle Kingdom  dating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is. We also found work stone    carnelian  quartz and agate that shows that there was a jeweler's workshop here. These might not look like much  but when you think about the most common stones used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom  these are the stones that were used. So  we have a dense layer of occupation dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site. We also have evidence of an elite jeweler's workshop  showing that whatever was there was a very important city. No Itjtawy was here yet  but we're going to be returning to the site in the near future to map it out. And even more importantly  we have funding to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well. So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom    it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy four thousand years ago.  Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings. There's nothing like it in the land.  So as it turns out  TED was not founded in      AD. Making ideas actually started in      BC at a not lost for long city  found from above. It certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective. Thank you very much. Thank you. When I was about    years old I can remember flipping through channels at home during summer vacation  looking for a movie to watch on HBO    and how many of you remember  Ferris Bueller's Day Off   Oh yeah  great movie  right     Well  I saw Matthew Broderick on the screen  and so I thought   Sweet  Ferris Bueller. I'll watch this   It wasn't Ferris Bueller. And forgive me Matthew Broderick  I know you've done other movies besides Ferris Bueller  but that's how I remember you  you're Ferris. But you weren't doing Ferris y things at the time  you were doing gay things at the time. He was in a movie called  Torch Song Trilogy.  And  Torch Song Trilogy  was based on a play about this drag queen who essentially was looking for love. Love and respect    that's what the whole film was about. And as I'm watching it  I'm realizing that they're talking about me. Not the drag queen part    I am not shaving my hair for anyone    but the gay part. The finding love and respect  the part about trying to find your place in the world. So as I'm watching this  I see this powerful scene that brought me to tears  and it stuck with me for the past    years. And there's this quote that the main character  Arnold  tells his mother as they're fighting about who he is and the life that he lives.  There's one thing more    there's just one more thing you better understand. I've taught myself to sew  cook  fix plumbing  build furniture  I can even pat myself on the back when necessary  all so I don't have to ask anyone for anything. There's nothing I need from anyone except for love and respect  and anyone who can't give me those two things has no place in my life.  I remember that scene like it was yesterday  I was     I was in tears  I was in the closet  and I'm looking at these two people  Ferris Bueller and some guy I'd never seen before  fighting for love. When I finally got to a place in my life where I came out and accepted who I was  and was really quite happy  to tell you the truth  I was happily gay and I guess that's supposed to be right because gay means happy too. I realized there were a lot of people who weren't as gay as I was    gay being happy  not gay being attracted to the same sex. In fact  I heard that there was a lot of hate and a lot of anger and a lot of frustration and a lot of fear about who I was and the gay lifestyle. Now  I'm sitting here trying to figure out  the gay lifestyle    the gay lifestyle   and I keep hearing this word over and over and over again  lifestyle  lifestyle  lifestyle. I've even heard politicians say that the gay lifestyle is a greater threat to civilization than terrorism. That's when I got scared. Because I'm thinking  if I'm gay and I'm doing something that's going to destroy civilization  I need to figure out what this stuff is  and I need to stop doing it right now. So  I took a look at my life  a hard look at my life  and I saw some things very disturbing. And I want to begin sharing these evil things that I've been doing with you  starting with my mornings. I drink coffee. Not only do I drink coffee  I know other gay people who drink coffee. I get stuck in traffic    evil  evil traffic. Sometimes I get stuck in lines at airports. I look around  and I go   My God  look at all these gay people  We're all trapped in these lines  These long lines trying to get on an airplane  My God  this lifestyle that I'm living is so freaking evil   I clean up. This is not an actual photograph of my son's room  his is messier. And because I have a    year old  all I do is cook and cook and cook. Any parents out there of teenagers  All we do is cook for these people    they eat two  three  four dinners a night    it's ridiculous  This is the gay lifestyle. And after I'm done cooking and cleaning and standing in line and getting stuck in traffic  my partner and I  we get together and we decide that we're gonna go and have some wild and crazy fun. We're usually in bed before we find out who's eliminated on  American Idol.  We have to wake up and find out the next day who's still on because we're too freaking tired to hear who stays on. This is the super duper evil gay lifestyle. Run for your heterosexual lives  people. When my partner  Steve  and I first started dating  he told me this story about penguins. And I didn't know where he was going with it at first. He was kind of a little bit nervous when he was sharing it with me  but he told me that when a penguin finds a mate that they want to spend the rest of their life with  they present them with a pebble    the perfect pebble. And then he reaches into his pocket  and he brings this out to me. And I looked at it  and I was like  this is really cool. And he says   I want to spend the rest of my life with you.  So I wear this whenever I have to do something that makes me a little nervous  like  I don't know  a TEDx talk. I wear this when I am apart from him for a long period of time. And sometimes I just wear it just because. How many people out there are in love  Anyone in love out there  You might be gay. Because I  too  am in love  and apparently that's part of the gay lifestyle that I warned you about. You may want to tell your spouse. Who  if they're in love  might be gay as well. How many of you are single  Any single people out there  You too might be gay  Because I know some gay people who are also single. It's really scary  this gay lifestyle thing  it's super duper evil and there's no end to it  It goes and goes and engulfs  It's really quite silly  isn't it  That's why I'm so happy to finally hear President Obama come out and say that he supports    that he supports marriage equality. It's a wonderful day in our country's history  it's a wonderful day in the globe's history to be able to have an actual sitting president say  enough of this    first to himself  and then to the rest of the world. It's wonderful. But there's something that's been disturbing me since he made that remark just a short time ago. And that is  apparently  this is just another move by the gay activists that's on the gay agenda. And I'm disturbed by this because I've been openly gay now for quite some time. I've been to all of the functions  I've been to fundraisers  I've written about the topic  and I have yet to receive my copy of this gay agenda. I've paid my dues on time  I've marched in gay pride flags parades and the whole nine  and I've yet to see a copy of the gay agenda. It's very  very frustrating  and I was feeling left out  like I wasn't quite gay enough. But then something wonderful happened  I was out shopping  as I tend to do  and I came across a bootleg copy of the official gay agenda. And I said to myself   LZ  for so long  you have been denied this. When you get in front of this crowd  you're gonna share the news. You're gonna spread the gay agenda so no one else has to wonder  what exactly is in the gay agenda  What are these gays up to  What do they want   So  without further ado  I will present to you  ladies and gentlemen    now be careful  'cause it's evil    a copy  the official copy  of the gay agenda. The gay agenda  people  There it is  Did you soak it all in  The gay agenda. Some of you may be calling it  what  the Constitution of the United States  is that what you call it too  The U.S. Constitution is the gay agenda. These gays  people like me  want to be treated like full citizens and it's all written down in plain sight. I was blown away when I saw it. I was like  wait  this is the gay agenda  Why didn't you just call it the Constitution so I knew what you were talking about  I wouldn't have been so confused  I wouldn't have been so upset. But there it is. The gay agenda. Run for your heterosexual lives. Did you know that in all the states where there is no shading that people who are gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered can be kicked out of their apartments for being gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered  That's the only reason that a landlord needs to have them removed  because there's no protection from discrimination of GLBT people. Did you know in the states where there's no shading that you can be fired for being gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered  Not based upon the quality of your work  how long you've been there  if you stink  just if you're gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered. All of which flies in the face of the gay agenda  also known as the U.S. Constitution. Specifically  this little amendment right here   No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.  I'm looking at you  North Carolina. But you're not looking at the U.S. Constitution. This is the gay agenda  equality. Not special rights  but the rights that were already written by these people    these elitists  if you will. Educated  well dressed  some would dare say questionably dressed. Nonetheless  our forefathers  right  The people that  we say  knew what they were doing when they wrote the Constitution    the gay agenda  if you will. All of that flies in the face of what they did. That is the reason why I felt it was imperative that I presented you with this copy of the gay agenda. Because I figured if I made it funny  you wouldn't be as threatened. I figured if I was a bit irreverent  you wouldn't find it serious. But when you see the map  and you see our state of Michigan    it's legal to fire someone for being gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered  that it's legal to remove someone from their home because they're gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered  then you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality is not about stripping someone's rights away  it's about granting them the rights that  have  already been stated. And we're just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated  that we've already agreed upon. There are people living in fear of losing their jobs so they don't show anyone who they really are right here at home. This isn't just about North Carolina  all those states that were clear  it's legal. If I could brag for a second  I have a    year old son from my marriage. He has a  . . He is starting a new club at school  Policy Debate. He's a budding track star  he has almost every single record in middle school for every event that he competed in. He volunteers. He prays before he eats. I would like to think  as his father    and he lives with me primarily    that I had a little something to do with all of that. I would like to think that he's a good boy  a respectful young man. I would like to think that I've proven to be a capable father. But if I were to go to the state of Michigan today  and try to adopt a young person who is in an orphanage  I would be disqualified for only one reason  because I'm gay. It doesn't matter what I've already proven  what I can do with my heart. It's because of what the state of Michigan says that I am that I am disqualified for any sort of adoption. And that's not just about me  that's about so many other Michiganders  U.S. citizens  who don't understand why what they are is so much more significant than who they are. This story just keeps playing over and over and over again in our country's history. There was a time in which  I don't know  people who were black couldn't have the same rights. People who happened to be women didn't have the same rights  couldn't vote. There was a point in our history in which  if you were considered disabled  that an employer could just fire you  before the Americans with Disabilities Act. We keep doing this over and over again. And so here we are        gay agenda  gay lifestyle  and I'm not a good dad and people don't deserve to be able to protect their families because of what they are  not who they are. So when you hear the words  gay lifestyle  and  gay agenda  in the future  I encourage you to do two things  One  remember the U.S. Constitution  and then two  if you wouldn't mind looking to your left  please. Look to your right. That person next to you is a brother  is a sister. And they should be treated with love and respect. Thank you. So  that's what I've done with my life.  Laughter  Thank you.  Applause  As a kid  I grew up on a farm in Florida  and I did what most little kids do. I played a little baseball  did a few other things like that  but I always had the sense of being an outsider  and it wasn't until I saw pictures in the magazines that a couple other guys skate  I thought   Wow  that's for me   you know  Because there was no coach standing directly over you  and these guys  they were just being themselves. There was no opponent directly across from you. And I loved that sense  so I started skating when I was about    years old  in       and when I did  I picked it up pretty quickly. In fact  here's some footage from about     . It wasn't until '   I won my first amateur championship  and then  by '    I was     and I won my first world championship  which was amazing to me  and in a very real sense  that was the first real victory I had. Oh  watch this. This is a casper slide  where the board's upside down. Mental note on that one.  Laughs  And this one here  An ollie. So  as she mentioned  that is overstated for sure  but that's why they called me the godfather of modern street skating. Here's some images of that. Now  I was about halfway through my pro career in  I would say  the mid '  s. Freestyle itself  we developed all these flat ground tricks as you saw  but there was evolving a new kind of skateboarding  where guys were taking it to the streets  and they were using that ollie  like I showed you  They were using it to get up onto stuff like bleachers and handrails and over stairwells and all kinds of cool stuff. So it was evolving upwards. In fact  when someone tells you they're a skater today  they pretty much mean a street skater  because freestyle  it took about five years for it to die  and at that stage  I'd been a  champion  champion for    years  which  phew  And suddenly it was over for me. That's it. It was gone. They took my pro model off the shelf  which was essentially pronouncing you dead publicly. That's how you make your money  you know  You have a signature board and wheels and shoes and clothes. I had all that stuff  and it's gone. The crazy thing was  there was a really liberating sense about it  because I no longer had to protect my record as a champion.  Champion   again. Champion sounds so goofy  but it's what it was  right  And I got to    What drew me to skateboarding  the freedom was now restored  where I could just create things  because that's where the joy was for me  always  was creating new stuff. The other thing that I had was a deep well of tricks to draw from that were rooted in these flat ground tricks. Stuff the normal guys were doing was very much different. So  as humbling and rotten as it was   And believe me  it was rotten. I would go to skate spots  and I was already  like   famous guy   right  And everyone thought I was good. But in this new terrain  I was horrible. So people would go   Oh  he's all    Oh  what happened to Mullen    Laughter   Laughs  So  humbling as it was  I began again. Here are some tricks that I started to bring to that new terrain.  Skateboard noises  And again  there's this undergirding layer of influence of freestyle that made me   Oh  that one  That's  like  the hardest thing I've ever done. Okay  look at that. It's a darkslide. See how it's sliding on the backside  Those are super fun.  Laughter  And  actually  not that hard. You know  at the very root of that  see  caspers  see how you throw it   Skateboard noises  Simple as that  right  No biggie.  Laughter  And your front foot  the way it grabs it  is    I'd seen someone slide on the back of the board like that  and I was like   How can I get it over   Because that had not yet been done. And then it dawned on me  and here's part of what I'm saying. I had an infrastructure. I had this deep layer  where it was like  oh my gosh  it's just your foot. It's just the way you throw your board over. Just let the ledge do that  and it's easy  and the next thing you know  there's    more tricks based out of the variations. So that's the kind of thing that  here  check this out  here's another way  and I won't overdo this. A little indulgent  I understand. There's something called a primo slide. It is the funnest trick ever to do. It's like skinboarding. And this one  look how it slides sideways  every which way  Okay  so when you're skating  and you take a fall  the board slips that way or that way. It's kind of predictable. This  It goes every which way. It's like a cartoon  the falls  and that's what I love the most about it. It's so much fun to do. In fact  when I started doing them  I remember  because I got hurt. I had to get a knee surgery  right  So there were a couple of days where  actually a couple of weeks  where I couldn't skate at all. It would give out on me. And I would watch the guys  I'd go to this warehouse where a lot of the guys were skating  my friends  and I was like   Man I gotta do something new. I want to do something new. I want to start fresh. I want to start fresh.  And so the night before my surgery  I'd watched  and I was like   How am I going to do this   So I ran up  and I jumped on my board  and I cavemanned  and I flipped it down  and I remember thinking  I landed so light footed  thinking  if my knee gives  they'll just have more work to do in the morning. And so  when it was the crazy thing. I don't know how many of you guys have had surgery  but     Laughter     you are so helpless  right  You're on this gurney and you're watching the ceiling go by  every time it's always that  and right when they're putting the mask on you before you go to sleep  all I was thinking is   Man  when I wake up and I get better  the first thing I'm going to do is film that trick.   Laughter  And indeed I did. It was the very first thing I filmed  which was awesome. Now  let me    I told you a little bit about the evolution of the tricks. Consider that content  in a sense. What we do as street skaters is  you have these tricks. Say I'm working on darkslides  or a primo  that you guys know this stuff now.  Laughter   Laughs  What you do is you cruise around the same streets that you've seen a hundred times  but suddenly  because you already have something in this fixed domain of this target  it's like  what will match this trick  How can I expand  how can the context  how can the environment change the very nature of what I do  So you drive and drive and drive  and  actually I gotta admit  just because I was struggling with this because I'm here  but I'll just say it  is  I cannot tell you  not only to be here in front of you  but what a privilege it is to be at USC campus  because I have been escorted off of this campus so many times.  Laughter  So let me give you another example of how context shapes content. This is a place not that far from here. It's a rotten neighborhood. Your first consideration is  am I gonna get beat up  You go out and    See this wall  It's fairly mellow  and it's beckoning to do bank tricks  right  But there's this other aspect of it for wheelies  so check this out. There's a few tricks  again  how environment changes the nature of your tricks. Freestyle oriented  manual down    wheelie down. Watch  this one  Oh  I love this. It's like surfing  this one  the way you catch it. This one  a little sketchy going backwards  and watch the back foot  watch the back foot. Oop.  Laughs  Mental note right there. Again  we'll get back to that. Here. Back foot  back foot. Okay  up there  That was called a     flip. Notice how the board flipped and spun this way  both axes. And another example of how the context changed  and the creative process for me and for most skaters  is  you go  you get out of the car  you check for security  you check for stuff.  Laughter  It's funny  you get to know their rhythms  you know  the guys that cruise around  and skateboarding is such a humbling thing  man. No matter how good you are  right  you still gotta deal with   So you hit this wall  and when I hit it  the first thing you do is you fall forward  and I'm like  all right  all right. As you adjust  you punch it up  and then when I would do that  it was throwing my shoulder this way  which as I was doing it  I was like   Oh wow  that's begging for a     flip   because that's how you load up for a     flip. And so this is what I want to emphasize that  as you can imagine  all of these tricks are made of sub movements  executive motor functions  more granular to the degree to which I can't quite tell you  but one thing I do know is  every trick is made of combining two or three or four or five movements. And so  as I'm going up  these things are floating around  and you have to sort of let the cognitive mind  like  rest back  pull it back a little bit  and let your intuition go as you feel these things. And these sub movements are just kind of floating around  and as the wall hits you  they connect themselves to an extent  and that's when the cognitive mind  you think   Oh      flip  I'm going to make that.  So that's how that works to me  the creative process  the process itself of street skating. So  next   Oh  mind you.  Laughs  Those are the community. These are some of the best skaters in the world. These are my friends. Oh my gosh  they're such good people. And the beauty of skateboarding is that  no one guy is the best. In fact  I know this is rotten to say  they're my friends  but a couple of them actually don't look that comfortable on their board. What makes them great is the degree to which they use their skateboarding to individuate themselves. Every single one of these guys  you look at them  you can see a silhouette of them  and you realize  like   Oh  that's him  that's Haslam  that's Koston  there's these guys  these are the guys. And skaters  I think they tend to be outsiders who seek a sense of belonging  but belonging on their own terms  and real respect is given by how much we take what other guys do  these basic tricks      flips  we take that  we make it our own  and then we contribute back to the community the inner way that edifies the community itself. The greater the contribution  the more we express and form our individuality  which is so important to a lot of us who feel like rejects to begin with. The summation of that gives us something we could never achieve as an individual. I should say this. There's some sort of beautiful symmetry that the degree to which we connect to a community is in proportion to our individuality  which we are expressing by what we do. Next. These guys. Very similar community that's extremely conducive to innovation. Notice a couple of these shots from the Police Department. But it is quite similar. I mean  what is it to hack  right  It's knowing a technology so well that you can manipulate it and steer it to do things it was never intended to do  right  And they're not all bad. You can be a Linux kernel hacker  make it more stable  right  More safe  more secure. You can be an iOS hacker  make your iPhone do stuff it wasn't supposed to. Not authorized  but not illegal. And then you've got some of these guys  right  What they do is very similar to our creative process. They connect disparate information  and they bring it together in a way that a security analyst doesn't expect. Right  It doesn't make them good people  but it's at the heart of engineering  at the heart of a creative community  an innovative community  and the open source community  the basic ethos of it is  take what other people do  make it better  give it back so we all rise further. Very similar communities  very similar. We have our edgier sides  too. It's funny  my dad was right. These are my peers. But I respect what they do  and they respect what I do  because they can do things. It's amazing what they can do. In fact  one of them  he was Ernst   Young's Entrepreneur of the Year for San Diego County  so they're not  you never know who you're dealing with. We've all had some degree of fame. In fact  I've had so much success that I strangely always feel unworthy of. I've had a patent  and that was cool  and we started a company  and it grew  and it became the biggest  and then it went down  and then it became the biggest again  which is harder than the first time  and then we sold it  and then we sold it again. So I've had some success. And in the end  when you've had all of these things  what is it that continues to drive you  As I mentioned  the knee stuff and these things  what is it that will punch you  Because it's not just the mind. What is it that will punch you and make you do something and bring it to another level  and when you've had it all  sometimes  guys  they die on the vine with all of that talent  and one of the things we've had  all of us  is fame  I think the best kind of fame  because you can take it off. I've been all around the world  and there will be a thousand kids crying out your name  and it's such a weird  visceral experience. It's like  it's disorienting. And you get in a car  and you drive away  and    minute drive  and you get out  and no one gives a rat's who you are.  Laughs  And it gives you that clarity of perspective of  man  I'm just me  and popularity  what does that really mean again  Not much. It's peer respect that drives us. That's the one thing that makes us do what we do. I've had over a dozen bones  these guys  this guy  over  what  eight     concussions  to the point where it's comedy  right  It is actually comedy. They mess with him. Next. And this is something deeper  and this is where I'm   I think I was on tour when I  I was reading one of the Feynman biographies. It was the red one or the blue one. And he made this statement that was so profound to me. It was that the Nobel Prize was the tombstone on all great work  and it resonated because I had won    out of    contests that I'd entered over    years  and it made me bananas. In fact  winning isn't the word. I won it once. The rest of the time  you're just defending  and you get into this  like  turtle posture  you know  Where you're not doing. It usurped the joy of what I loved to do because I was no longer doing it to create and have fun  and when it died out from under me  that was one of the most liberating things because I could create. And look  I understand that I am on the very edge of preachy  right here. I'm not here to do that. It's just that I'm in front of a very privileged audience. If you guys aren't already leaders in your community  you probably will be  and if there's anything I can give you that will transcend what I've gotten from skateboarding  the only things of meaning  I think  and of permanence  it's not fame  it's not all these things. What it is is that there's an intrinsic value in creating something for the sake of creating it  and better than that  because  man  I'm    years old  or I'll be     and how pathetic is that I'm still skateboarding  but there is   a community of your own making  and seeing it dispersed  and seeing younger  more talented  just different talent  take it to levels you can never imagine  because that lives on. So thank you for your time. Krisztina Holly  I have a question for you. So you've really reinvented yourself in the past from freestyle to street  and  I think it was about four years ago you officially retired. Is that it  What's next  Rodney Mullen  That's a good question. KH  Something tells me it's not the end. RM  Yeah. I  every time you think you've chased something down  it's funny  no matter how good you are  and I know guys like this  it feels like you're polishing a turd. You know   Laughter  And I thought  the only way I can extend this is to change something infrastructural  and so that's what I proceeded to do  through a long story  one of desperation  so if I do it  rather than talk about it  if I do it  you'll be the first to know. KH  All right  we won't ask you any more. RM  You'll get a text. KH   Laughs  Right. Thank you. Good job.  Applause  RM  Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Like most journalists  I'm an idealist. I love unearthing good stories  especially untold stories. I just didn't think that in       women would still be in that category. I'm the President of the Journalism and Women Symposium    JAWS. That's Sharky. I joined    years ago because I wanted female role models  and I was frustrated by the lagging status of women in our profession and what that meant for our image in the media. We make up half the population of the world  but we're just    percent of the news subjects quoted in news stories. And we're just    percent of the experts quoted in stories. And now  with today's technology  it's possible to remove women from the picture completely. This is a picture of President Barack Obama and his advisors  tracking the killing of Osama bin Laden. You can see Hillary Clinton on the right. Let's see how the photo ran in an Orthodox Jewish newspaper based in Brooklyn. Hillary's completely gone. The paper apologized  but said it never runs photos of women  they might be sexually provocative. This is an extreme case  yes. But the fact is  women are only    percent of the sources in stories on politics  and only    percent in stories on the economy. The news continues to give us a picture where men outnumber women in nearly all occupational categories  except two  students and homemakers. So we all get a very distorted picture of reality. The problem is  of course  there aren't enough women in newsrooms. They report at just    percent of stories in print  TV and radio. Even in stories on gender based violence  men get an overwhelming majority of print space and airtime. Case in point  This March  the New York Times ran a story by James McKinley about a gang rape of a young girl     years old  in a small Texas town. McKinley writes that the community is wondering   How could their boys have been drawn into this    Drawn into this     like they were seduced into committing an act of violence. And the first person he quotes says   These boys will have to live with this the rest of their lives.  You don't hear much about the    year old victim  except that she wore clothes that were a little old for her and she wore makeup. The Times was deluged with criticism. Initially  it defended itself  and said   These aren't our views. This is what we found in our reporting.  Now  here's a secret you probably know already  Your stories are constructed. As reporters  we research  we interview. We try to give a good picture of reality. We also have our own unconscious biases. But The Times makes it sound like anyone would have reported this story the same way. I disagree with that. So three weeks later  The Times revisits the story. This time  it adds another byline to it with McKinley's  Erica Goode. What emerges is a truly sad  horrific tale of a young girl and her family trapped in poverty. She was raped numerous times by many men. She had been a bright  easygoing girl. She was maturing quickly  physically  but her bed was still covered with stuffed animals. It's a very different picture. Perhaps the addition of Ms. Goode is what made this story more complete. The Global Media Monitoring Project has found that stories by female reporters are more likely to challenge stereotypes than those by male reporters. At KUNM here in Albuquerque  Elaine Baumgartel did some graduate research on the coverage of violence against women. What she found was many of these stories tend to blame victims and devalue their lives. They tend to sensationalize  and they lack context. So for her graduate work  she did a three part series on the murder of    women  found buried on Albuquerque's West Mesa. She tried to challenge those patterns and stereotypes in her work and she tried to show the challenges that journalists face from external sources  their own internal biases and cultural norms. And she worked with an editor at National Public Radio to try to get a story aired nationally. She's not sure that would have happened if the editor had not been a female. Stories in the news are more than twice as likely to present women as victims than men  and women are more likely to be defined by their body parts. Wired magazine  November     . Yes  the issue was about breast tissue engineering. Now I know you're all distracted  so I'll take that off. Eyes up here. So    Here's the thing  Wired almost never puts women on its cover. Oh  there have been some gimmicky ones    Pam from  The Office   manga girls  a voluptuous model covered in synthetic diamonds. Texas State University professor Cindy Royal wondered in her blog how are young women like her students supposed to feel about their roles in technology  reading Wired. Chris Anderson  the editor of Wired  defended his choice and said there aren't enough women  prominent women in technology to sell a cover  to sell an issue. Part of that is true  there aren't as many prominent women in technology. Here's my problem with that argument  Media tells us every day what's important  by the stories they choose and where they place them  it's called agenda setting. How many people knew the founders of Facebook and Google before their faces were on a magazine cover  Putting them there made them more recognizable. Now  Fast Company Magazine embraces that idea. This is its cover from November         . The issue is about the most prominent and influential women in technology. Editor Robert Safian told the Poynter Institute   Silicon Valley is very white and very male. But that's not what Fast Company thinks the business world will look like in the future  so it tries to give a picture of where the globalized world is moving.  By the way  apparently  Wired took all this to heart. This was its issue in April. That's Limor Fried  the founder of Adafruit Industries  in the Rosie the Riveter pose. It would help to have more women in positions of leadership in media. A recent global survey found that    percent of the top media management jobs are still held by men. But this is also about something far more complex  our own unconscious biases and blind spots. Shankar Vedantam is the author of  The Hidden Brain  How Our Unconscious Minds Elect Presidents  Control Markets  Wage Wars  and Save Our Lives.  He told the former ombudsman at National Public Radio  who was doing a report on how women fare in NPR coverage  unconscious bias flows throughout most of our lives. It's really difficult to disentangle those strands. But he did have one suggestion. He used to work for two editors who said every story had to have at least one female source. He balked at first  but said he eventually followed the directive happily  because his stories got better and his job got easier. Now  I don't know if one of the editors was a woman  but that can make the biggest difference. The Dallas Morning News won a Pulitzer Prize in      for a series it did on women around the world  but one of the reporters told me she's convinced it never would have happened if they had not had a female assistant foreign editor  and they would not have gotten some of those stories without female reporters and editors on the ground  particularly one on female genital mutilation    men would just not be allowed into those situations. This is an important point to consider  because much of our foreign policy now revolves around countries where the treatment of women is an issue  such as Afghanistan. What we're told in terms of arguments against leaving this country is that the fate of the women is primary. Now  I'm sure a male reporter in Kabul can find women to interview. Not so sure about rural  traditional areas  where I'm guessing women can't talk to strange men. It's important to keep talking about this  in light of Lara Logan. She was the CBS News correspondent who was brutally sexually assaulted in Egypt's Tahrir Square  right after this photo was taken. Almost immediately  pundits weighed in  blaming her and saying things like   You know  maybe women shouldn't be sent to cover those stories.  I never heard anyone say this about Anderson Cooper and his crew  who were attacked covering the same story. One way to get more women into leadership is to have other women mentor them. One of my board members is an editor at a major global media company  but she never thought about this as a career path  until she met female role models at JAWS. But this is not just a job for super journalists or my organization. You all have a stake in a strong  vibrant media. Analyze your news. And speak up when there are gaps missing in coverage  like people at The New York Times did. Suggest female sources to reporters and editors. Remember    a complete picture of reality may depend upon it. And I'll leave you with a video clip that I first saw in        when I was a student in London. It's for The Guardian newspaper. It's actually long before I ever thought about becoming a journalist  but I was very interested in how we learn to perceive our world. Narrator  An event seen from one point of view gives one impression. Seen from another point of view  it gives quite a different impression. But it's only when you get the whole picture  you can fully understand what's going on.  The Guardian  Megan Kamerick  I think you'll all agree that we'd be better off if we all had the whole picture. Two weeks ago  I was sitting at the kitchen table with my wife Katya  and we were talking about what I was going to talk about today. We have an    year old son  his name is Lincoln. He was sitting at the same table  doing his math homework. And during a pause in my conversation with Katya  I looked over at Lincoln and I was suddenly thunderstruck by a recollection of a client of mine. My client was a guy named Will. He was from North Texas. He never knew his father very well  because his father left his mom while she was pregnant with him. And so  he was destined to be raised by a single mom  which might have been all right except that this particular single mom was a paranoid schizophrenic  and when Will was five years old  she tried to kill him with a butcher knife. She was taken away by authorities and placed in a psychiatric hospital  and so for the next several years Will lived with his older brother  until he committed suicide by shooting himself through the heart. And after that Will bounced around from one family member to another  until  by the time he was nine years old  he was essentially living on his own. That morning that I was sitting with Katya and Lincoln  I looked at my son  and I realized that when my client  Will  was his age  he'd been living by himself for two years. Will eventually joined a gang and committed a number of very serious crimes  including  most seriously of all  a horrible  tragic murder. And Will was ultimately executed as punishment for that crime. But I don't want to talk today about the morality of capital punishment. I certainly think that my client shouldn't have been executed  but what I would like to do today instead is talk about the death penalty in a way I've never done before  in a way that is entirely noncontroversial. I think that's possible  because there is a corner of the death penalty debate    maybe the most important corner    where everybody agrees  where the most ardent death penalty supporters and the most vociferous abolitionists are on exactly the same page. That's the corner I want to explore. Before I do that  though  I want to spend a couple of minutes telling you how a death penalty case unfolds  and then I want to tell you two lessons that I have learned over the last    years as a death penalty lawyer from watching well more than a hundred cases unfold in this way. You can think of a death penalty case as a story that has four chapters. The first chapter of every case is exactly the same  and it is tragic. It begins with the murder of an innocent human being  and it's followed by a trial where the murderer is convicted and sent to death row  and that death sentence is ultimately upheld by the state appellate court. The second chapter consists of a complicated legal proceeding known as a state habeas corpus appeal. The third chapter is an even more complicated legal proceeding known as a federal habeas corpus proceeding. And the fourth chapter is one where a variety of things can happen. The lawyers might file a clemency petition  they might initiate even more complex litigation  or they might not do anything at all. But that fourth chapter always ends with an execution. When I started representing death row inmates more than    years ago  people on death row did not have a right to a lawyer in either the second or the fourth chapter of this story. They were on their own. In fact  it wasn't until the late     s that they acquired a right to a lawyer during the third chapter of the story. So what all of these death row inmates had to do was rely on volunteer lawyers to handle their legal proceedings. The problem is that there were way more guys on death row than there were lawyers who had both the interest and the expertise to work on these cases. And so inevitably  lawyers drifted to cases that were already in chapter four    that makes sense  of course. Those are the cases that are most urgent  those are the guys who are closest to being executed. Some of these lawyers were successful  they managed to get new trials for their clients. Others of them managed to extend the lives of their clients  sometimes by years  sometimes by months. But the one thing that didn't happen was that there was never a serious and sustained decline in the number of annual executions in Texas. In fact  as you can see from this graph  from the time that the Texas execution apparatus got efficient in the mid  to late     s  there have only been a couple of years where the number of annual executions dipped below   . In a typical year in Texas  we're averaging about two people a month. In some years in Texas  we've executed close to    people  and this number has never significantly declined over the last    years. And yet  at the same time that we continue to execute about the same number of people every year  the number of people who we're sentencing to death on an annual basis has dropped rather steeply. So we have this paradox  which is that the number of annual executions has remained high but the number of new death sentences has gone down. Why is that  It can't be attributed to a decline in the murder rate  because the murder rate has not declined nearly so steeply as the red line on that graph has gone down. What has happened instead is that juries have started to sentence more and more people to prison for the rest of their lives without the possibility of parole  rather than sending them to the execution chamber. Why has that happened  It hasn't happened because of a dissolution of popular support for the death penalty. Death penalty opponents take great solace in the fact that death penalty support in Texas is at an all time low. Do you know what all time low in Texas means  It means that it's in the low    percent. Now  that's really good compared to the mid     s  when it was in excess of    percent  but we can't explain the decline in death sentences and the affinity for life without the possibility of parole by an erosion of support for the death penalty  because people still support the death penalty. What's happened to cause this phenomenon  What's happened is that lawyers who represent death row inmates have shifted their focus to earlier and earlier chapters of the death penalty story. So    years ago  they focused on chapter four. And they went from chapter four    years ago to chapter three in the late     s. And they went from chapter three in the late     s to chapter two in the mid     s. And beginning in the mid  to late     s  they began to focus on chapter one of the story. Now  you might think that this decline in death sentences and the increase in the number of life sentences is a good thing or a bad thing. I don't want to have a conversation about that today. All that I want to tell you is that the reason that this has happened is because death penalty lawyers have understood that the earlier you intervene in a case  the greater the likelihood that you're going to save your client's life. That's the first thing I've learned. Here's the second thing I learned  My client Will was not the exception to the rule  he was the rule. I sometimes say  if you tell me the name of a death row inmate    doesn't matter what state he's in  doesn't matter if I've ever met him before    I'll write his biography for you. And eight out of    times  the details of that biography will be more or less accurate. And the reason for that is that    percent of the people on death row are people who came from the same sort of dysfunctional family that Will did. Eighty percent of the people on death row are people who had exposure to the juvenile justice system. That's the second lesson that I've learned. Now we're right on the cusp of that corner where everybody's going to agree. People in this room might disagree about whether Will should have been executed  but I think everybody would agree that the best possible version of his story would be a story where no murder ever occurs. How do we do that  When our son Lincoln was working on that math problem two weeks ago  it was a big  gnarly problem. And he was learning how  when you have a big old gnarly problem  sometimes the solution is to slice it into smaller problems. That's what we do for most problems    in math  in physics  even in social policy    we slice them into smaller  more manageable problems. But every once in a while  as Dwight Eisenhower said  the way you solve a problem is to make it bigger. The way we solve this problem is to make the issue of the death penalty bigger. We have to say  all right. We have these four chapters of a death penalty story  but what happens before that story begins  How can we intervene in the life of a murderer before he's a murderer  What options do we have to nudge that person off of the path that is going to lead to a result that everybody    death penalty supporters and death penalty opponents    still think is a bad result  the murder of an innocent human being  You know  sometimes people say that something isn't rocket science. And by that  what they mean is rocket science is really complicated and this problem that we're talking about now is really simple. Well that's rocket science  that's the mathematical expression for the thrust created by a rocket. What we're talking about today is just as complicated. What we're talking about today is also rocket science. My client Will and    percent of the people on death row had five chapters in their lives that came before the four chapters of the death penalty story. I think of these five chapters as points of intervention  places in their lives when our society could've intervened in their lives and nudged them off of the path that they were on that created a consequence that we all    death penalty supporters or death penalty opponents    say was a bad result. Now  during each of these five chapters  when his mother was pregnant with him  in his early childhood years  when he was in elementary school  when he was in middle school and then high school  and when he was in the juvenile justice system    during each of those five chapters  there were a wide variety of things that society could have done. In fact  if we just imagine that there are five different modes of intervention  the way that society could intervene in each of those five chapters  and we could mix and match them any way we want  there are          more than          possible strategies that we could embrace in order to nudge kids like Will off of the path that they're on. So I'm not standing here today with the solution. But the fact that we still have a lot to learn  that doesn't mean that we don't know a lot already. We know from experience in other states that there are a wide variety of modes of intervention that we could be using in Texas  and in every other state that isn't using them  in order to prevent a consequence that we all agree is bad. I'll just mention a few. I won't talk today about reforming the legal system. That's probably a topic that is best reserved for a room full of lawyers and judges. Instead  let me talk about a couple of modes of intervention that we can all help accomplish  because they are modes of intervention that will come about when legislators and policymakers  when taxpayers and citizens  agree that that's what we ought to be doing and that's how we ought to be spending our money. We could be providing early childhood care for economically disadvantaged and otherwise troubled kids  and we could be doing it for free. And we could be nudging kids like Will off of the path that we're on. There are other states that do that  but we don't. We could be providing special schools  at both the high school level and the middle school level  but even in K    that target economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids  and particularly kids who have had exposure to the juvenile justice system. There are a handful of states that do that  Texas doesn't. There's one other thing we can be doing    well  there are a bunch of other things    there's one other thing that I'm going to mention  and this is going to be the only controversial thing that I say today. We could be intervening much more aggressively into dangerously dysfunctional homes  and getting kids out of them before their moms pick up butcher knives and threaten to kill them. If we're going to do that  we need a place to put them. Even if we do all of those things  some kids are going to fall through the cracks and they're going to end up in that last chapter before the murder story begins  they're going to end up in the juvenile justice system. And even if that happens  it's not yet too late. There's still time to nudge them  if we think about nudging them rather than just punishing them. There are two professors in the Northeast    one at Yale and one at Maryland    they set up a school that is attached to a juvenile prison. And the kids are in prison  but they go to school from eight in the morning until four in the afternoon. Now  it was logistically difficult. They had to recruit teachers who wanted to teach inside a prison  they had to establish strict separation between the people who work at the school and the prison authorities  and most dauntingly of all  they needed to invent a new curriculum because you know what  People don't come into and out of prison on a semester basis. But they did all those things. Now  what do all of these things have in common  What all of these things have in common is that they cost money. Some of the people in the room might be old enough to remember the guy on the old oil filter commercial. He used to say   Well  you can pay me now or you can pay me later.  What we're doing in the death penalty system is we're paying later. But the thing is that for every        dollars that we spend intervening in the lives of economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids in those earlier chapters  we save        dollars in crime related costs down the road. Even if you don't agree that there's a moral imperative that we do it  it just makes economic sense. I want to tell you about the last conversation that I had with Will. It was the day that he was going to be executed  and we were just talking. There was nothing left to do in his case. And we were talking about his life. And he was talking first about his dad  who he hardly knew  who had died  and then about his mom  who he did know  who was still alive. And I said to him   I know the story. I've read the records. I know that she tried to kill you.  I said   But I've always wondered whether you really actually remember that.  I said   I don't remember anything from when I was five years old. Maybe you just remember somebody telling you.  And he looked at me and he leaned forward  and he said   Professor      he'd known me for    years  he still called me Professor. He said   Professor  I don't mean any disrespect by this  but when your mama picks up a butcher knife that looks bigger than you are  and chases you through the house screaming she's going to kill you  and you have to lock yourself in the bathroom and lean against the door and holler for help until the police get there   he looked at me and he said   that's something you don't forget.  I hope there's one thing you all won't forget  In between the time you arrived here this morning and the time we break for lunch  there are going to be four homicides in the United States. We're going to devote enormous social resources to punishing the people who commit those crimes  and that's appropriate because we should punish people who do bad things. But three of those crimes are preventable. If we make the picture bigger and devote our attention to the earlier chapters  then we're never going to write the first sentence that begins the death penalty story. Thank you. Those of you who have seen the film  Moneyball   or have read the book by Michael Lewis  will be familiar with the story of Billy Beane. Billy was supposed to be a tremendous ballplayer  all the scouts told him so. They told his parents that they predicted that he was going to be a star. But what actually happened when he signed the contract    and by the way  he didn't want to sign that contract  he wanted to go to college    which is what my mother  who actually does love me  said that I should do too  and I did    well  he didn't do very well. He struggled mightily. He got traded a couple of times  he ended up in the Minors for most of his career  and he actually ended up in management. He ended up as a General Manager of the Oakland A's. Now for many of you in this room  ending up in management  which is also what I've done  is seen as a success. I can assure you that for a kid trying to make it in the Bigs  going into management ain't no success story. It's a failure. And what I want to talk to you about today  and share with you  is that our healthcare system  our medical system  is just as bad at predicting what happens to people in it    patients  others    as those scouts were at predicting what would happen to Billy Beane. And yet  every day thousands of people in this country are diagnosed with preconditions. We hear about pre hypertension  we hear about pre dementia  we hear about pre anxiety  and I'm pretty sure that I diagnosed myself with that in the green room. We also refer to subclinical conditions. There's subclinical atherosclerosis  subclinical hardening of the arteries  obviously linked to heart attacks  potentially. One of my favorites is called subclinical acne. If you look up subclinical acne  you may find a website  which I did  which says that this is the easiest type of acne to treat. You don't have the pustules or the redness and inflammation. Maybe that's because you don't actually have acne. I have a name for all of these conditions  it's another precondition  I call them preposterous. In baseball  the game follows the pre game. Season follows the pre season. But with a lot of these conditions  that actually isn't the case  or at least it isn't the case all the time. It's as if there's a rain delay  every single time in many cases. We have pre cancerous lesions  which often don't turn into cancer. And yet  if you take  for example  subclinical osteoporosis  a bone thinning disease  the precondition  otherwise known as osteopenia  you would have to treat     women for three years in order to prevent one broken bone. That's an awful lot of women when you multiply by the number of women who were diagnosed with this osteopenia. And so is it any wonder  given all of the costs and the side effects of the drugs that we're using to treat these preconditions  that every year we're spending more than two trillion dollars on healthcare and yet         people a year    and that's a conservative estimate    are dying not because of the conditions they have  but because of the treatments that we're giving them and the complications of those treatments  We've medicalized everything in this country. Women in the audience  I have some pretty bad news that you already know  and that's that every aspect of your life has been medicalized. Strike one is when you hit puberty. You now have something that happens to you once a month that has been medicalized. It's a condition  it has to be treated. Strike two is if you get pregnant. That's been medicalized as well. You have to have a high tech experience of pregnancy  otherwise something might go wrong. Strike three is menopause. We all know what happened when millions of women were given hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms for decades until all of a sudden we realized  because a study came out  a big one  NIH funded. It said  actually  a lot of that hormone replacement therapy may be doing more harm than good for many of those women. Just in case  I don't want to leave the men out    I am one  after all    I have really bad news for all of you in this room  and for everyone listening and watching elsewhere  You all have a universally fatal condition. So  just take a moment. It's called pre death. Every single one of you has it  because you have the risk factor for it  which is being alive. But I have some good news for you  because I'm a journalist  I like to end things in a happy way or a forward thinking way. And that good news is that if you can survive to the end of my talk  which we'll see if that happens for everyone  you will be a pre vivor. I made up pre death. If I used someone else's pre death  I apologize  I think I made it up. I didn't make up pre vivor. Pre vivor is what a particular cancer advocacy group would like everyone who just has a risk factor  but hasn't actually had that cancer  to call themselves. You are a pre vivor. We've had HBO here this morning. I'm wondering if Mark Burnett is anywhere in the audience  I'd like to suggest a reality TV show called  Pre vivor.  If you develop a disease  you're off the island. But the problem is  we have a system that is completely    basically promoted this. We've selected  at every point in this system  to do what we do  and to give everyone a precondition and then eventually a condition  in some cases. Start with the doctor patient relationship. Doctors  most of them  are in a fee for service system. They are basically incentivized to do more    procedures  tests  prescribe medications. Patients come to them  they want to do something. We're Americans  we can't just stand there  we have to do something. And so they want a drug. They want a treatment. They want to be told  this is what you have and this is how you treat it. If the doctor doesn't give you that  you go somewhere else. That's not very good for doctors' business. Or even worse  if you are diagnosed with something eventually  and the doctor didn't order that test  you get sued. We have pharmaceutical companies that are constantly trying to expand the indications  expand the number of people who are eligible for a given treatment  because that obviously helps their bottom line. We have advocacy groups  like the one that's come up with pre vivor  who want to make more and more people feel they are at risk  or might have a condition  so that they can raise more funds and raise visibility  et cetera. But this isn't actually  despite what journalists typically do  this isn't actually about blaming particular players. We are all responsible. I'm responsible. I actually root for the Yankees  I mean talk about rooting for the worst possible offender when it comes to doing everything you can do. Thank you. But everyone is responsible. I went to medical school  and I didn't have a course called How to Think Skeptically  or How Not to Order Tests. We have this system where that's what you do. And it actually took being a journalist to understand all these incentives. You know  economists like to say  there are no bad people  there are just bad incentives. And that's actually true. Because what we've created is a sort of Field of Dreams  when it comes to medical technology. So when you put another MRI in every corner  you put a robot in every hospital saying that everyone has to have robotic surgery. Well  we've created a system where if you build it  they will come. But you can actually perversely tell people to come  convince them that they have to come. It was when I became a journalist that I really realized how I was part of this problem  and how we all are part of this problem. I was medicalizing every risk factor  I was writing stories  commissioning stories  every day  that were trying to  not necessarily make people worried  although that was what often happened. But  you know  there are ways out. I saw my own internist last week  and he said to me   You know   and he told me something that everyone in this audience could have told me for free  but I paid him for the privilege  which is that I need to lose some weight. Well  he's right. I've had honest to goodness high blood pressure for a dozen years now  same age my father got it  and it's a real disease. It's not pre hypertension  it's actual hypertension  high blood pressure. Well  he's right  but he didn't say to me  well  you have pre obesity or you have pre diabetes  or anything like that. He didn't say  better start taking this Statin  you need to lower your cholesterol. No  he said   Go out and lose some weight. Come back and see me in a bit  or just give me a call and let me know how you're doing.  So that's  to me  a way forward. Billy Beane  by the way  learned the same thing. He learned  from watching this kid who he eventually hired  who was really successful for him  that it wasn't swinging for the fences  it wasn't swinging at every pitch like the sluggers do  which is what all the expensive teams like the Yankees like to    they like to pick up those guys. This kid told him  you know  you gotta watch the guys  and you gotta go out and find the guys who like to walk  because getting on base by a walk is just as good  and in our healthcare system we need to figure out  is that really a good pitch or should we let it go by and not swing at everything  Thanks. As a magician  I'm always interested in performances that incorporate elements of illusion. And one of the most remarkable was the tanagra theater  which was popular in the early part of the   th century. It used mirrors to create the illusion of tiny people performing on a miniature stage. Now  I won't use mirrors  but this is my digital tribute to the tanagra theater. So let the story begin. On a dark and stormy night    really     it was the   th of July      . Lightning lit the sky  and a baby was born. His name was Nikola  Nikola Tesla. Now the baby grew into a very smart guy. Let me show you. Tesla  what is     multiplied by      Nikola Tesla  The result is        . Marco Tempest  Now Tesla's brain worked in the most extraordinary way. When a word was mentioned  an image of it instantly appeared in his mind. Tree. Chair. Girl. They were hallucinations  which vanished the moment he touched them. Probably a form of synesthesia. But it was something he later turned to his advantage. Where other scientists would play in their laboratory  Tesla created his inventions in his mind. NT  To my delight  I discovered I could visualize my inventions with the greatest facility. MT  And when they worked in the vivid playground of his imagination  he would build them in his workshop. NT  I needed no models  drawings or experiments. I could picture them as real in my mind  and there I run it  test it and improve it. Only then do I construct it. MT  His great idea was alternating current. But how could he convince the public that the millions of volts required to make it work were safe  To sell his idea  he became a showman. NT  We are at the dawn of a new age  the age of electricity. I have been able  through careful invention  to transmit  with the mere flick of a switch  electricity across the ether. It is the magic of science. Tesla has over     patents to his name  radio  wireless telegraphy  remote control  robotics. He even photographed the bones of the human body. But the high point was the realization of a childhood dream  harnessing the raging powers of Niagara Falls  and bringing light to the city. But Tesla's success didn't last. NT  I had bigger ideas. Illuminating the city was only the beginning. A world telegraphy center    imagine news  messages  sounds  images delivered to any point in the world instantly and wirelessly. MT  It's a great idea  it was a huge project. Expensive  too. NT  They wouldn't give me the money. MT  Well  maybe you shouldn't have told them it could be used to contact other planets. NT  Yes  that was a big mistake. MT  Tesla's career as an inventor never recovered. He became a recluse. Dodged by death  he spent much of his time in his suite at the Waldorf Astoria. NT  Everything I did  I did for mankind  for a world where there would be no humiliation of the poor by the violence of the rich  where products of intellect  science and art will serve society for the betterment and beautification of life. MT  Nikola Tesla died on the  th of January      . His final resting place is a golden globe that contains his ashes at the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade. His legacy is with us still. Tesla became the man who lit the world  but this was only the beginning. Tesla's insight was profound. NT  Tell me  what will man do when the forests disappear  and the coal deposits are exhausted  MT  Tesla thought he had the answer. We are still asking the question. Thank you. Everyone is both a learner and a teacher. This is me being inspired by my first tutor  my mom  and this is me teaching Introduction to Artificial Intelligence to     students at Stanford University. Now the students and I enjoyed the class  but it occurred to me that while the subject matter of the class is advanced and modern  the teaching technology isn't. In fact  I use basically the same technology as this   th century classroom. Note the textbook  the sage on the stage  and the sleeping guy in the back.  Laughter  Just like today. So my co teacher  Sebastian Thrun  and I thought  there must be a better way. We challenged ourselves to create an online class that would be equal or better in quality to our Stanford class  but to bring it to anyone in the world for free. We announced the class on July   th  and within two weeks         people had signed up for it. And that grew to         students from     countries. We were thrilled to have that kind of audience  and just a bit terrified that we hadn't finished preparing the class yet.  Laughter  So we got to work. We studied what others had done  what we could copy and what we could change. Benjamin Bloom had showed that one on one tutoring works best  so that's what we tried to emulate  like with me and my mom  even though we knew it would be one on thousands. Here  an overhead video camera is recording me as I'm talking and drawing on a piece of paper. A student said   This class felt like sitting in a bar with a really smart friend who's explaining something you haven't grasped  but are about to.  And that's exactly what we were aiming for. Now  from Khan Academy  we saw that short    minute videos worked much better than trying to record an hour long lecture and put it on the small format screen. We decided to go even shorter and more interactive. Our typical video is two minutes  sometimes shorter  never more than six  and then we pause for a quiz question  to make it feel like one on one tutoring. Here  I'm explaining how a computer uses the grammar of English to parse sentences  and here  there's a pause and the student has to reflect  understand what's going on and check the right boxes before they can continue. Students learn best when they're actively practicing. We wanted to engage them  to have them grapple with ambiguity and guide them to synthesize the key ideas themselves. We mostly avoid questions like   Here's a formula  now tell me the value of Y when X is equal to two.  We preferred open ended questions. One student wrote   Now I'm seeing Bayes networks and examples of game theory everywhere I look.  And I like that kind of response. That's just what we were going for. We didn't want students to memorize the formulas  we wanted to change the way they looked at the world. And we succeeded. Or  I should say  the students succeeded. And it's a little bit ironic that we set about to disrupt traditional education  and in doing so  we ended up making our online class much more like a traditional college class than other online classes. Most online classes  the videos are always available. You can watch them any time you want. But if you can do it any time  that means you can do it tomorrow  and if you can do it tomorrow  well  you may not ever get around to it.  Laughter  So we brought back the innovation of having due dates.  Laughter  You could watch the videos any time you wanted during the week  but at the end of the week  you had to get the homework done. This motivated the students to keep going  and it also meant that everybody was working on the same thing at the same time  so if you went into a discussion forum  you could get an answer from a peer within minutes. Now  I'll show you some of the forums  most of which were self organized by the students themselves. From Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng  we learned the concept of  flipping  the classroom. Students watched the videos on their own  and then they come together to discuss them. From Eric Mazur  I learned about peer instruction  that peers can be the best teachers  because they're the ones that remember what it's like to not understand. Sebastian and I have forgotten some of that. Of course  we couldn't have a classroom discussion with tens of thousands of students  so we encouraged and nurtured these online forums. And finally  from Teach For America  I learned that a class is not primarily about information. More important is motivation and determination. It was crucial that the students see that we're working hard for them and they're all supporting each other. Now  the class ran    weeks  and in the end  about half of the         students watched at least one video each week  and over        finished all the homework  putting in    to     hours. They got this statement of accomplishment. So what have we learned  Well  we tried some old ideas and some new and put them together  but there are more ideas to try. Sebastian's teaching another class now. I'll do one in the fall. Stanford Coursera  Udacity  MITx and others have more classes coming. It's a really exciting time. But to me  the most exciting part of it is the data that we're gathering. We're gathering thousands of interactions per student per class  billions of interactions altogether  and now we can start analyzing that  and when we learn from that  do experimentations  that's when the real revolution will come. And you'll be able to see the results from a new generation of amazing students. Good evening. We are in this wonderful open air amphitheater and we are enjoying ourselves in that mild evening temperature tonight  but when Qatar will host the football World Cup    years from now        we already heard it will be in the hot  very hot and sunny summer months of June and July. And when Qatar has been assigned to the World Cup all  many people around the world have been wondering  how would it be possible that football players show spectacular football  run around in this desert climate  How would it be possible that spectators sit  enjoy themselves in open air stadia in this hot environment  Together with the architects of Albert Speer   Partner  our engineers from Transsolar have been supporting  have been developing open air stadia based on     percent solar power  on     percent solar cooling. Let me tell you about that  but let me start with comfort. Let me start with the aspect of comfort  because many people are confusing ambient temperature with thermal comfort. We are used to looking at charts like that  and you see this red line showing the air temperature in June and July  and yes  that's right  it's picking up to    degrees C. It's actually very hot. But air temperature is not the full set of climatic parameters which define comfort. Let me show you analysis a colleague of mine did looking on different football  World Cups  Olympic Games around the world  looking on the comfort and analyzing the comfort people have perceived at these different sport activities  and let me start with Mexico. Mexico temperature has been  air temperature has been something between     up to    degrees C  and people enjoyed themselves. It was a very comfortable game in Mexico City. Have a look. Orlando  same kind of stadium  open air stadium. People have been sitting in the strong sun  in the very high humidity in the afternoon  and they did not enjoy. It was not comfortable. The air temperature was not too high  but it was not comfortable during these games. What about Seoul  Seoul  because of broadcast rights  all the games have been in the late afternoon. Sun has already been set  so the games have been perceived as comfortable. What about Athens  Mediterranean climate  but in the sun it was not comfortable. They didn't perceive comfort. And we know that from Spain  we know that  sol y sombra.  If you have a ticket  and you get a ticket for the shade  you pay more  because you're in a more comfortable environment. What about Beijing  It's again  sun in the day and high humidity  and it was not comfortable. So if I overlay  and if you overlay all these comfort envelopes  what we see is  in all these places  air temperature has been ranging something from    to     and if you go on the line      of    degrees C ambient temperatures. If you go along that line you see there has been all kind of comfort  all kinds of perceived outdoor comfort  ranging from very comfortable to very uncomfortable. So why is that  This is because there are more parameters influencing our thermal comfort  which is the sun  the direct sun  the diffuse sun  which is wind  strong wind  mild wind  which is air humidity  which is the radiant temperature of the surroundings where we are in. And this is air temperature. All these parameters go into the comfort feeling of our human body  and scientists have developed a parameter  which is the perceived temperature  where all these parameters go in and help designers to understand which is the driving parameter that I feel comfort or that I don't feel comfort. Which is the driving parameter which gives me a perceived temperature  And these parameters  these climatic parameters are related to the human metabolism. Because of our metabolism  we as human beings  we produce heat. I'm excited  I'm talking to you  I'm probably producing     watts at the moment. You are sitting  you are relaxed  you're looking at me. It's probably     watts each person is producing  and we need to get rid of that energy. I need  with my body  to get rid of the energy  and the harder it is for myself  for my body  to get rid of the energy  the less comfort I feel. That's it. And if I don't get rid of the energy  I will die. If we overlay what happens during the football World Cup  what will happen in June  July  we will see  yes  air temperature will be much higher  but because the games and the plays will be in the afternoon  it's probably the same comfort rating we've found in other places which has perceived as non comfortable. So we sat together with a team which prepared the Bid Book  or goal  that we said  let's aim for perceived temperature  for outdoor comfort in this range  which is perceived with a temperature of    degrees Celsius perceived temperature  which is extremely comfortable. People would feel really fine in an open outdoor environment. But what does it mean  If we just look on what happens  we see  temperature's too high. If we apply the best architectural design  climate engineering design  we won't get much better. So we need to do something active. We need  for instance  to bring in radiant cooling technology  and we need to combine this with so called soft conditioning. And how does it look like in a stadium  So the stadium has a few elements which create that outdoor comfort. First of all  it's shading. It needs to protect where the people are sitting against strong and warm wind. But that's not all what we need to do. We need to use active systems. Instead of blowing a hurricane of chilled air through the stadium  we can use radiant cooling technologies  like a floor heating system where water pipes are embedded in the floor. And just by using cold water going through the water pipes  you can release the heat which is absorbed during the day in the stadium  so you can create that comfort  and then by adding dry air instead of down chilled air  the spectators and the football players can adjust to their individual comfort needs  to their individual energy balance. They can adjust and find their comfort they need to find. There are    stadia probably to come  but there are    training pitches where all the individual countries are going to train. We applied the same concept  shading of the training pitch  using a shelter against wind  then using the grass. Natural watered lawn is a very good cooling source stabilizing temperature  and using dehumidified air to create comfort. But even the best passive design wouldn't help. We need active system. And how do we do that  Our idea for the bid was     percent solar cooling  based on the idea that we use the roof of the stadia  we cover the roofs of the stadia with PV systems. We don't borrow any energy from history. We are not using fossil energies. We are not borrowing energy from our neighbors. We're using energy we can harvest on our roofs  and also on the training pitches  which will be covered with large  flexible membranes  and we will see in the next years an industry coming up with flexible photovoltaics  giving the possibilities of shading against strong sun and producing electric energy in the same time. And this energy now is harvested throughout the year  sent into the grid  is replacing fossils in the grid  and when I need it for the cooling  I take it back from the grid and I use the solar energy which I have brought to the grid back when I need it for the solar cooling. And I can do that in the first year and I can balance that in the next     and the next    years  this energy  which is necessary to condition a World Cup in Qatar  the next    years  this energy goes into the grid of Qatar. So this     Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  This is not only useful for stadia. We can use that also in open air places and streets  and we've been working on the City of the Future in Masdar  which is in the United Emirates  Abu Dhabi. And I had the pleasure to work on the central plaza. And the same idea to use there  to create outdoor conditions which are perceived as comfortable. People enjoy going there instead of going into a shopping mall  which is chilled down and which is cooled. We wanted to create an outdoor space which is so comfortable that people can go there in the early afternoon  even in these sunny and hot summer months  and they can enjoy and meet there with their families.  Applause  And the same concept  shade against the sun  shade against the wind  and use  use and take advantage of the sun you can harvest on your footprint. And these beautiful umbrellas. So I'd like to encourage you to pay attention to your thermal comfort  to your thermal environment  tonight and tomorrow  and if you'd like to learn more about that  I invite you to go to our website. We uploaded a very simple perceived temperature calculator where you can check out about your outdoor comfort. And I also hope that you share the idea that if engineers and designers can use all these different climatic parameters  it will be possible to create really good and comfortable outdoor conditions  to change our thermal perception that we feel comfortable in an outdoor environment  and we can do that with the best passive design  but also using the energy source of the site in Qatar which is the sun. Thank you very much.  Applause  Shukran.  Applause  As a kid  I was fascinated with all things air and space. I would watch Nova on PBS. Our school would show Bill Nye the Science Guy. When I was in elementary school  my next door neighbor  he gave me a book for my birthday. It was an astronomy book  and I poured over that thing for hours on end  and it was a combination of all these things that inspired me to pursue space exploration as my own personal dream  and part of that dream was  I always wanted to just fly around the solar system and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft. Well  a number of years later  I graduated from UCLA and I found myself at NASA  working for the jet propulsion laboratory  and there our team was challenged to create a  D visualization of the solar system  and today I want to show you what we've done so far. Now  the kicker is  everything I'm about to do here you can do at home  because we built this for the public for you guys to use. So what you're looking at right now is the Earth. You can see the United States and California and San Diego  and you can use the mouse or the keyboard to spin things around. Now  this isn't new. Anyone who's used Google Earth has seen this before  but one thing we like to say in our group is  we do the opposite of Google Earth. Google Earth goes from this view down to your backyard. We go from this view out to the stars. So the Earth is cool  but what we really want to show are the spacecraft  so I'm going to bring the interface back up  and now you're looking at a number of satellites orbiting the Earth. These are a number of our science space Earth orbiters. We haven't included military satellites and weather satellites and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites. If we did  it would be a complete mess  because there's a lot of stuff out there. And the cool thing is  we actually created  D models for a number of these spacecraft  so if you want to visit any of these  all you need to do is double click on them. So I'm going to find the International Space Station  double click  and it will take us all the way down to the ISS. And now you're riding along with the ISS where it is right now. And the other cool thing is  not only can we move the camera around  we can also control time  so I can slide this jog dial here to shuttle time forward  and now we can see what a sunset on the ISS would look like  and they get one every    minutes.  Laughter  All right  so what about the rest of it  Well  I can click on this home button over here  and that will take us up to the inner solar system  and now we're looking at the rest of the solar system. You can see  there's Saturn  there's Jupiter  and while we're here  I want to point out something. It's actually pretty busy. Here we have the Mars Science Laboratory on its way to Mars  just launched last weekend. Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter  there. We have Dawn orbiting Vesta  and we have over here New Horizons on a straight shot to Pluto. And I mention this because there's this strange public perception that NASA's dead  that the space shuttles stopped flying and all of the sudden there's no more spacecraft out there. Well  a lot of what NASA does is robotic exploration  and we have a lot of spacecraft out there. Granted  we're not sending humans up at the moment  well at least with our own launch vehicles  but NASA is far from dead  and one of the reasons why we write a program like this is so that people realize that there's so many other things that we're doing. Anyway  while we're here  again  if you want to visit anything  all you need to do is double click. So I'm just going to double click on Vesta  and here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta  and this is happening right now. I'm going to double click on Uranus  and we can see Uranus rotating on its side along with its moons. You can see how it's tilted at about    degrees. And just being able to visit different places and go through different times  we have data from      to     . Granted  we don't have everything in between  because some of the data is hard to get. Just being able to visit places in different times  you can explore this for hours  literally hours on end  but I want to show you one thing in particular  so I'm going to open up the destination tab  spacecraft outer planet missions  Voyager    and I'm going to bring up the Titan flyby. So now we've gone back in time. We're now riding along with Voyager  . The date here is November         . Now  there's a funny thing going on here. It doesn't look like anything's going on. It looks like I've paused the program. It's actually running at real rate right now  one second per second  and in fact  Voyager   here is flying by Titan at I think it's        miles per hour. It only looks like nothing's moving because  well  Saturn here is         miles away  and Titan here is       to       miles away. It's just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing's happening. But to make it more interesting  I'm going to speed up time  and we can watch as Voyager   flies by Titan  which is a hazy moon of Saturn. It actually has a very thick atmosphere. And I'm going to recenter the camera on Saturn  here. I'm going to pull out  and I want to show you Voyager   as it flies by Saturn. There's a point to be made here. With a  D visualization like this  we can not only just say Voyager   flew by Saturn. There's a whole story to tell here. And even better  because it's an interactive application  you can tell the story for yourself. If you want to pause it  you can pause it. If you want to keep going  if you want to change the camera angle  you can do that  and because of that  I can show you that Voyager   doesn't just fly by Saturn. It actually flies underneath Saturn. Now  what happens is  as it flies underneath Saturn  Saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up and out of the solar system  so if I just keep letting this go  you can see Voyager   fly up like that. And  in fact  I'm going to go back to the solar system. I'm going to go back to today  now  and I want to show you where Voyager   is. Right there  above  way above the solar system  way beyond our solar system. And here's the thing. Now you know how it got there. Now you know why  and to me  that's the point of this program. You can manipulate it yourself. You can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself. You know  the theme today is  The World In Your Grasp.  Well  we're trying to give you the solar system in your grasp    Laughter    and we hope once it's there  you'll be able to learn for yourself what we've done out there  and what we're about to do. And my personal dream is for kids to take this and explore and see the wonders out there and be inspired  as I was as a kid  to pursue STEM education and to pursue a dream in space exploration. Thank you.  Applause  Over the last two decades  India has become a global hub for software development and offshoring of back office services  as we call it  and what we were interested in finding out was that because of this huge industry that has started over the last two decades in India  offshoring software development and back office services  there's been a flight of white collar jobs from the developed world to India. When this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs to China  it has  you know  led to considerable angst amongst the Western populations. In fact  if you look at polls  they show a declining trend for support for free trade in the West. Now  the Western elites  however  have said this fear is misplaced. For example  if you have read   I suspect many of you have done so   read the book by Thomas Friedman called  The World Is Flat   he said  basically  in his book that  you know  this fear for free trade is wrong because it assumes  it's based on a mistaken assumption that everything that can be invented has been invented. In fact  he says  it's innovation that will keep the West ahead of the developing world  with the more sophisticated  innovative tasks being done in the developed world  and the less sophisticated  shall we say  drudge work being done in the developing world. Now  what we were trying to understand was  is this true  Could India become a source  or a global hub  of innovation  just like it's become a global hub for back office services and software development  And for the last four years  my coauthor Phanish Puranam and I spent investigating this topic. Initially  or  you know  as people would say  you know  in fact the more aggressive people who are supporting the Western innovative model  say   Where are the Indian Googles  iPods and Viagras  if the Indians are so bloody smart    Laughter  So initially  when we started our research  we went and met several executives  and we asked them   What do you think  Will India go from being a favored destination for software services and back office services to a destination for innovation   They laughed. They dismissed us. They said   You know what  Indians don't do innovation.  The more polite ones said   Well  you know  Indians make good software programmers and accountants  but they can't do the creative stuff.  Sometimes  it took a more  took a veneer of sophistication  and people said   You know  it's nothing to do with Indians. It's really the rule based  regimented education system in India that is responsible for killing all creativity.  They said  instead  if you want to see real creativity  go to Silicon Valley  and look at companies like Google  Microsoft  Intel. So we started examining the R amp D and innovation labs of Silicon Valley. Well  interestingly  what you find there is  usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab or the R amp D center as they may call it  and more often than not  it's an Indian.  Laughter  So I immediately said   Well  but you could not have been educated in India  right  You must have gotten your education here.  It turned out  in every single case  they came out of the Indian educational system. So we realized that maybe we had the wrong question  and the right question is  really  can Indians based out of India do innovative work  So off we went to India. We made  I think  about a dozen trips to Bangalore  Mumbai  Gurgaon  Delhi  Hyderabad  you name it  to examine what is the level of corporate innovation in these cities. And what we found was  as we progressed in our research  was  that we were asking really the wrong question. When you ask   Where are the Indian Googles  iPods and Viagras   you are taking a particular perspective on innovation  which is innovation for end users  visible innovation. Instead  innovation  if you remember  some of you may have read the famous economist Schumpeter  he said   Innovation is novelty in how value is created and distributed.  It could be new products and services  but it could also be new ways of producing products. It could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries. Once you take this  there's no reason to restrict innovation  the beneficiaries of innovation  just to end users. When you take this broader conceptualization of innovation  what we found was  India is well represented in innovation  but the innovation that is being done in India is of a form we did not anticipate  and what we did was we called it  invisible innovation.  And specifically  there are four types of invisible innovation that are coming out of India. The first type of invisible innovation out of India is what we call innovation for business customers  which is led by the multinational corporations  which have    in the last two decades  there have been     R amp D centers set up in India by multinational companies employing more than         professionals. Now  when you consider the fact that  historically  the R amp D center of a multinational company was always in the headquarters  or in the country of origin of that multinational company  to have     R amp D centers of multinational corporations in India is truly a remarkable figure. When we went and talked to the people in those innovation centers and asked them what are they working on  they said   We are working on global products.  They were not working on localizing global products for India  which is the usual role of a local R amp D. They were working on truly global products  and companies like Microsoft  Google  AstraZeneca  General Electric  Philips  have already answered in the affirmative the question that from their Bangalore and Hyderabad R amp D centers they are able to produce products and services for the world. But of course  as an end user  you don't see that  because you only see the name of the company  not where it was developed. The other thing we were told then was   Yes  but  you know  the kind of work that is coming out of the Indian R amp D center cannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming out of the U.S. R amp D centers.  So my coauthor Phanish Puranam  who happens to be one of the smartest people I know  said he's going to do a study. What he did was he looked at those companies that had an R amp D center in USA and in India  and then he looked at a patent that was filed out of the U.S. and a similar patent filed out of the same company's subsidiary in India  so he's now comparing the patents of R amp D centers in the U.S. with R amp D centers in India of the same company to find out what is the quality of the patents filed out of the Indian centers and how do they compare with the quality of the patents filed out of the U.S. centers  Interestingly  what he finds is   and by the way  the way we look at the quality of a patent is what we call forward citations  How many times does a future patent reference the older patent    he finds something very interesting. What we find is that the data says that the number of forward citations of a patent filed out of a U.S. R amp D subsidiary is identical to the number of forward citations of a patent filed by an Indian subsidiary of the same company within that company. So within the company  there's no difference in the forward citation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus their U.S. subsidiaries. So that's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of India. The second kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call outsourcing innovation to Indian companies  where many companies today are contracting Indian companies to do a major part of their product development work for their global products which are going to be sold to the entire world. For example  in the pharma industry  a lot of the molecules are being developed  but you see a major part of that work is being sent to India. For example  XCL Technologies  they developed two of the mission critical systems for the new Boeing     Dreamliner  one to avoid collisions in the sky  and another to allow landing in zero visibility. But of course  when you climb onto the Boeing      you are not going to know that this is invisible innovation out of India. The third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call process innovations  because of an injection of intelligence by Indian firms. Process innovation is different from product innovation. It's about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufacture a new product  but not a new product itself  Only in India do millions of young people dream of working in a call center. What happens   You know  it's a dead end job in the West  what high school dropouts do. What happens when you put hundreds of thousands of smart  young  ambitious kids on a call center job  Very quickly  they get bored  and they start innovating  and they start telling the boss how to do this job better  and out of this process innovation comes product innovations  which are then marketed around the world. For example       Customer  traditional call center company  used to be a traditional call center company. Today they're developing analytical tools to do predictive modeling so that before you pick up the phone  you can guess or predict what this phone call is about. It's because of an injection of intelligence into a process which was considered dead for a long time in the West. And the last kind of innovation  invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call management innovation. It's not a new product or a new process but a new way to organize work  and the most significant management innovation to come out of India  invented by the Indian offshoring industry is what we call the global delivery model. What the global delivery model allows is  it allows you to take previously geographically core located tasks  break them up into parts  send them around the world where the expertise and the cost structure exists  and then specify the means for reintegrating them. Without that  you could not have any of the other invisible innovations today. So  what I'm trying to say is  what we are finding in our research is  that if products for end users is the visible tip of the innovation iceberg  India is well represented in the invisible  large  submerged portion of the innovation iceberg. Now  this has  of course  some implications  and so we developed three implications of this research. The first is what we called sinking skill ladder  and now I'm going to go back to where I started my conversation with you  which was about the flight of jobs. Now  of course  when we first  as a multinational company  decide to outsource jobs to India in the R amp D  what we are going to do is we are going to outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to India  the least sophisticated jobs  just like Tom Friedman would predict. Now  what happens is  when you outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to India for innovation and for R amp D work  at some stage in the very near future you are going to have to confront a problem  which is where does the next step of the ladder people come from within your company  So you have two choices then  Either you bring the people from India into the developed world to take positions in the next step of the ladder   immigration   or you say  there's so many people in the bottom step of the ladder waiting to take the next position in India  why don't we move the next step to India  What we are trying to say is that once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder  you    it's a self perpetuating act  because of the sinking skill ladder  and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that you can't be an investment banker without having been an analyst once. You can't be a professor without having been a student. You can't be a consultant without having been a research associate. So  if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs  at some stage  the next step of the ladder has to follow. The second thing we bring up is what we call the browning of the TMT  the top management teams. If the R amp D talent is going to be based out of India and China  and the largest growth markets are going to be based out of India and China  you have to confront the problem that your top management of the future is going to have to come out of India and China  because that's where the product leadership is  that's where the important market leadership is. Right  And the last thing we point out in this slide  which is  you know  that to this story  there's one caveat. India has the youngest growing population in the world. This demographic dividend is incredible  but paradoxically  there's also the mirage of mighty labor pools. Indian institutes and educational system  with a few exceptions  are incapable of producing students in the quantity and quality needed to keep this innovation engine going  so companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this  but in the end it does not absolve the government of the responsibility for creating this educational structure. So finally  I want to conclude by showing you the profile of one company  IBM. As many of you know  IBM has always been considered for the last hundred years to be one of the most innovative companies. In fact  if you look at the number of patents filed over history  I think they are in the top or the top two or three companies in the world of all patents filed in the USA as a private company. Here is the profile of employees of IBM over the last decade. In       they had         employees  or         employees  out of which          were in America        were in India. In       they had         employees  by which time the U.S. employees had moved to          whereas the Indian employees had gone to        . Well  in       they decided they're not going to reveal this data anymore  so I had to make some estimates based on various sources. Here are my best guesses. Okay  I'm not saying this is the exact number  it's my best guess. It gives you a sense of the trend. There are         people now at IBM  out of which        are remaining in the U.S.  and         are in India. So you tell me  is IBM an American company  or an Indian company   Laughter  Ladies and gentlemen  thank you very much.  Applause  What I'm going to do is to just give a few notes  and this is from a book I'm preparing called  Letters to a Young Scientist.  I'd thought it'd be appropriate to present it  on the basis that I have had extensive experience in teaching  counseling scientists across a broad array of fields. And you might like to hear some of the principles that I've developed in doing that teaching and counseling. So let me begin by urging you  particularly you on the youngsters' side  on this path you've chosen  to go as far as you can. The world needs you  badly. Humanity is now fully into the techno scientific age. There is going to be no turning back. Although varying among disciplines    say  astrophysics  molecular genetics  the immunology  the microbiology  the public health  to the new area of the human body as a symbiont  to public health  environmental science. Knowledge in medical science and science overall is doubling every    to    years. Technology is increasing at a comparable rate. Between them  the two already pervade  as most of you here seated realize  every dimension of human life. So swift is the velocity of the techno scientific revolution  so startling in its countless twists and turns  that no one can predict its outcome even a decade from the present moment. There will come a time  of course  when the exponential growth of discovery and knowledge  which actually began in the     s  has to peak and level off  but that's not going to matter to you. The revolution is going to continue for at least several more decades. It'll render the human condition radically different from what it is today. Traditional fields of study are going to continue to grow and in so doing  inevitably they will meet and create new disciplines. In time  all of science will come to be a continuum of description  an explanation of networks  of principles and laws. That's why you need not just be training in one specialty  but also acquire breadth in other fields  related to and even distant from your own initial choice. Keep your eyes lifted and your head turning. The search for knowledge is in our genes. It was put there by our distant ancestors who spread across the world  and it's never going to be quenched. To understand and use it sanely  as a part of the civilization yet to evolve requires a vastly larger population of scientifically trained people like you. In education  medicine  law  diplomacy  government  business and the media that exist today. Our political leaders need at least a modest degree of scientific literacy  which most badly lack today    no applause  please. It will be better for all if they prepare before entering office rather than learning on the job. Therefore you will do well to act on the side  no matter how far into the laboratory you may go  to serve as teachers during the span of your career. I'll now proceed quickly  and before else  to a subject that is both a vital asset and a potential barrier to a scientific career. If you are a bit short in mathematical skills  don't worry. Many of the most successful scientists at work today are mathematically semi literate. A metaphor will serve here  Where elite mathematicians and statisticians and theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm of science  the remaining large majority of basic applied scientists  including a large portion of those who could be said to be of the first rank  are the ones who map the terrain  they scout the frontiers  they cut the pathways  they raise the buildings along the way. Some may have considered me foolhardy  but it's been my habit to brush aside the fear of mathematics when talking to candidate scientists. During    years of teaching biology at Harvard  I watched sadly as bright students turned away from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non required courses in science because they were afraid of failure. These math phobes deprive science and medicine of immeasurable amounts of badly needed talent. Here's how to relax your anxieties  if you have them  Understand that mathematics is a language ruled like other verbal languages  or like verbal language generally  by its own grammar and system of logic. Any person with average quantitative intelligence who learns to read and write mathematics at an elementary level will  as in verbal language  have little difficulty picking up most of the fundamentals if they choose to master the mathspeak of most disciplines of science. The longer you wait to become at least semi literate the harder the language of mathematics will be to master  just as again in any verbal language  but it can be done at any age. I speak as an authority on that subject  because I'm an extreme case. I didn't take algebra until my freshman year at the University of Alabama. They didn't teach it before then. I finally got around to calculus as a    year old tenured professor at Harvard  where I sat uncomfortably in classes with undergraduate students  little more than half my age. A couple of them were students in a course I was giving on evolutionary biology. I swallowed my pride  and I learned calculus. I found out that in science and all its applications  what is crucial is not that technical ability  but it is imagination in all of its applications. The ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes pictured by intuition. I found out that advances in science rarely come upstream from an ability to stand at a blackboard and conjure images from unfolding mathematical propositions and equations. They are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work  during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant. Ideas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied for its own sake. Of foremost importance is a thorough  well organized knowledge of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain you propose to enter. When something new is discovered  it's logical then that one of the follow up steps is to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward. If that step proves too difficult for the person or team that made the discovery  a mathematician can then be added by them as a collaborator. Consider the following principle  which I will modestly call Wilson's Principle Number One  It is far easier for scientists including medical researchers  to require needed collaboration in mathematics and statistics than it is for mathematicians and statisticians to find scientists able to make use of their equations. It is important in choosing the direction to take in science to find the subject at your level of competence that interests you deeply  and focus on that. Keep in mind  then  Wilson's Second Principle  For every scientist  whether researcher  technician  teacher  manager or businessman  working at any level of mathematical competence  there exists a discipline in science or medicine for which that level is enough to achieve excellence. Now I'm going to offer quickly several more principles that will be useful in organizing your education and career  or if you're teaching  how you might enhance your own teaching and counseling of young scientists. In selecting a subject in which to conduct original research  or to develop world class expertise  take a part of the chosen discipline that is sparsely inhabited. Judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on hand. This is not to de emphasize the essential requirement of broad training  or the value of apprenticing yourself in ongoing research to programs of high quality. It is important also to acquire older mentors within these successful programs  and to make friends and colleagues of your age for mutual support. But through it all  look for a way to break out  to find a field and subject not yet popular. We have seen this demonstrated already in the talks preceding mine. There is the quickest way advances are likely to occur  as measured in discoveries per investigator per year. You may have heard the military dictum for the gathering of armies  March to the sound of the guns. In science  the exact opposite is the case  March away from the sound of the guns. So Wilson's Principle Number Three  March away from the sound of the guns. Observe from a distance  but do not join the fray. Make a fray of your own. Once you have settled on a specialty  and the profession you can love  and you've secured opportunity  your potential to succeed will be greatly enhanced if you study it enough to become an expert. There are thousands of professionally delimited subjects sprinkled through physics and chemistry to biology and medicine. And on then into the social sciences  where it is possible in short time to acquire the status of an authority. When the subject is still very thinly populated  you can with diligence and hard work become the world authority. The world needs this kind of expertise  and it rewards the kind of people willing to acquire it. The existing information and what you self discover may at first seem skimpy and difficult to connect to other bodies of knowledge. Well  if that's the case  good. Why hard instead of easy  The answer deserves to be stated as Principle Number Four. In the attempt to make scientific discoveries  every problem is an opportunity  and the more difficult the problem  the greater will be the importance of its solution. Now this brings me to a basic categorization in the way scientific discoveries are made. Scientists  pure mathematicians among them  follow one or the other of two pathways  First through early discoveries  a problem is identified and a solution is sought. The problem may be relatively small  for example  where exactly in a cruise ship does the norovirus begin to spread  Or larger  what's the role of dark matter in the expansion of the universe  As the answer is sought  other phenomena are typically discovered and other questions are asked. This first of the two strategies is like a hunter  exploring a forest in search of a particular quarry  who finds other quarries along the way. The second strategy of research is to study a subject broadly searching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena like a hunter in what we call  the naturalist's trance   the researcher of mind is open to anything interesting  any quarry worth taking. The search is not for the solution of the problem  but for problems themselves worth solving. The two strategies of research  original research  can be stated as follows  in the final principle I'm going to offer you  For every problem in a given discipline of science  there exists a species or entity or phenomenon ideal for its solution. And conversely  for every species or other entity or phenomenon  there exist important problems for the solution of which  those particular objects of research are ideally suited. Find out what they are. You'll find your own way to discover  to learn  to teach. The decades ahead will see dramatic advances in disease prevention  general health  the quality of life. All of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice of the medicine and the science behind it you will master. You have chosen a calling that will come in steps to give you satisfaction  at its conclusion  of a life well lived. And I thank you for having me here tonight. Oh  thank you. Thank you very much. I salute you. So  last month  the Encyclopaedia Britannica announced that it is going out of print after     years  which made me nostalgic  because I remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library back when I was a kid  maybe    years old. And I wondered if I could update that game  not just for modern methods  but for the modern me. So I tried. I went to an online encyclopedia  Wikipedia  and I entered the term  Earth.  You can start anywhere  this time I chose Earth. And the first rule of the game is pretty simple. You just have to read the article until you find something you don't know  and preferably something your dad doesn't even know. And in this case  I quickly found this  The furthest point from the center of the Earth is not the tip of Mount Everest  like I might have thought  it's the tip of this mountain  Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador. The Earth spins  of course  as it travels around the sun  so the Earth bulges a little bit around the middle  like some Earthlings. And even though Mount Chimborazo isn't the tallest mountain in the Andes  it's one degree away from the equator  it's riding that bulge  and so the summit of Chimborazo is the farthest point on Earth from the center of the Earth. And it is really fun to say. So I immediately decided  this is going to be the name of the game  or my new exclamation. You can use it at TED. Chimborazo  right  It's like  eureka  and  bingo  had a baby. I didn't know that  that's pretty cool. Chimborazo  So the next rule of the game is also pretty simple. You just have to find another term and look that up. Now in the old days  that meant getting out a volume and browsing through it alphabetically  maybe getting sidetracked  that was fun. Nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from. I can go literally anywhere in the world  I think since I was already in Ecuador  I just decided to click on the word  tropical.  That took me to this wet and warm band of the tropics that encircles the Earth. Now that's the Tropic of Cancer in the north and the Tropic of Capricorn in the south  that much I knew  but I was surprised to learn this little fact  Those are not cartographers' lines  like latitude or the borders between nations  they are astronomical phenomena caused by the Earth's tilt  and they change. They move  they go up  they go down. In fact  for years  the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn have been steadily drifting towards the equator at the rate of about    meters per year  and nobody told me that. I didn't know it. Chimborazo  So to keep the game going  I just have to find another term and look that one up. Since I'm already in the tropics  I chose  Tropical rainforest.  Famous for its diversity  human diversity. There are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet. They're all over the globe  but virtually all of them live in tropical rainforests. This is the only place you can go nowadays and not get  friended.  The link that I clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end. It mentioned leopards and ring tailed coatis and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and then coleoptera  which turn out to be beetles. Now I clicked on this on purpose  but if I'd somehow gotten here by mistake  it does remind me  for the band  see  The Beatles   for the car see  Volkswagon Beetle   but I am here for beetle beetles. This is the most successful order on the planet by far. Something between    and    percent of all life forms on the planet  including plants  are beetles. That means the next time you are in the grocery store  take a look at the four people ahead of you in line. Statistically  one of you is a beetle. And if it is you  you are astonishingly well adapted. There are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums. There are predator beetles  that attack other insects and still look pretty cute to us. There are beetles that roll little balls of dung great distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings. This reminded the ancient Egyptians of their god Khepri  who renews the ball of the sun every morning  which is how that dung rolling scarab became that sacred scarab on the breastplate of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun. Beetles  I was reminded  have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom. Fireflies are not flies  fireflies are beetles. Fireflies are coleoptera  and coleoptera communicate in other ways as well. Like my next link  The chemical language of pheromones. Now the pheromone page took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex. Yeah. And the link to aphrodisiac. Now that's something that increases sexual desire  possibly chocolate. There is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine that might be an aphrodisiac. But as the article mentions  because of enzyme breakdown  it's unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally. So those of you who only eat your chocolate  you might have to experiment. The link I clicked on here   sympathetic magic   mostly because I understand what both of those words mean. But not when they're together like that. I do like sympathy. I do like magic. So when I click on  sympathetic magic   I get sympathetic magic and voodoo dolls. This is the boy in me getting lucky again. Sympathetic magic is imitation. If you imitate something  maybe you can have an effect on it. That's the idea behind voodoo dolls  and possibly also cave paintings. The link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind. I would love to see Google maps inside some of these caves. We've got tens of thousands years old artwork. Common themes around the globe include large wild animals and tracings of human hands  usually the left hand. We have been a dominantly right handed tribe for millenia  so even though I don't know why a paleolithic person would trace his hand or blow pigment on it from a tube  I can easily picture how he did it. And I really don't think it's that different form our own little dominant hand avatar right there that I'm going to use now to click on the term for  hand   go to the page for  hand   where I found the most fun and possibly embarrassing bit of trivia I've found in a long time. It's simply this  The back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar. Now that's embarrassing  because up until now  every time I've said   I know it like the back of my hand   I've really been saying   I'm totally familiar with that  I just don't know it's freaking name  right   And the link I clicked on here  well  lemurs  monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar. I click on chimpanzee  and I get our closest genetic relative. Pan troglodytes  the name we give him  means  cave dweller.  He doesn't. He lives in rainforests and savannas. It's just that we're always thinking of this guy as lagging behind us  evolutionarily or somehow uncannily creeping up on us  and in some cases  he gets places before us. Like my next link  the almost irresistible link  Ham the Astrochimp. I click on him  and I really thought he was going to bring me full circle twice  in fact. He's born in Cameroon  which is smack in the middle of my tropics map  and more specifically his skeleton wound up in the Smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles. In between those two landmarks in Ham's life  he flew into space. He experienced weightlessness and re entry months before the first human being to do it  Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. When I click on Yuri Gagarin's page  I get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature  huge in heroism. Top estimates  Soviet estimates  put this guy at  .   meters  that is less than five and a half feet tall max  possibly because he was malnourished as a child. Germans occupied Russia. A Nazi officer took over the Gagarin household  and he and his family built and lived in a mud hut. Years later  the boy from that cramped mud hut would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule on the tip of a rocket who volunteered to be launched into outer space  the first one of any of us to really physically leave this planet. And he didn't just leave it  he circled it once. Fifty years later  as a tribute  the International Space Station  which is still up there tonight  synced its orbit with Gagarin's orbit  at the exact same time of day  and filmed it  so you can go online and you can watch over     minutes of what must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride  possibly a lonely one  the first person to ever see such a thing. And then when you've had your fill of that  you can click on one more link. You can come back to Earth. You return to where you started. You can finish your game. You just need to find one more fact that you didn't know. And for me  I quickly landed on this one  The Earth has a tolerance of about .   percent from the reference spheroid  which is less than the .   percent allowed in billiard balls. This is the kind of fact I would have loved as a boy. I found it myself. It's got some math that I can do. I'm pretty sure my dad doesn't know it. What this means is that if you could shrink the Earth to the size of a billiard ball  if you could take planet Earth  with all its mountain tops and caves and rainforests  astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees  voodoo dolls  fireflies  chocolate  sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea  you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball  it would be as smooth as a billiard ball  presumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle. That's pretty cool. I didn't know that. Chimborazo  Thank you. So a few weeks ago  a friend of mine gave this toy car to his   year old son. But instead of going into a store and buying one  like we do normally  he went to this website and he downloaded a file  and then he printed it on this printer. So this idea that you can manufacture objects digitally using these machines is something that The Economist magazine defined as the Third Industrial Revolution. Actually  I argue that there is another revolution going on  and it's the one that has to do with open source hardware and the maker's movement  because the printer that my friend used to print the toy is actually open source. So you go to the same website  you can download all the files that you need in order to make that printer  the construction files  the hardware  the software  all the instruction is there. And also this is part of a large community where there are thousands of people around the world that are actually making these kinds of printers  and there's a lot of innovation happening because it's all open source. You don't need anybody's permission to create something great. And that space is like the personal computer in       like the Apples with the other companies are fighting  and we will see in a few years  there will be the Apple of this kind of market come out. Well  there's also another interesting thing. I said the electronics are open source  because at the heart of this printer there is something I'm really attached to  these Arduino boards  the motherboard that sort of powers this printer  is a project I've been working on for the past seven years. It's an open source project. I worked with these friends of mine that I have here. So the five of us  two Americans  two Italians and a Spaniard  we    Laughter  You know  it's a worldwide project.  Laughter  So we came together in this design institute called the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea  which was teaching interaction design  this idea that you can take design from the simple shape of an object and you can move it forward to design the way you interact with things. Well  when you design an object that's supposed to interact with a human being  if you make a foam model of a mobile phone  it doesn't make any sense. You have to have something that actually interacts with people. So  we worked on Arduino and a lot of other projects there to create platforms that would be simple for our students to use  so that our students could just build things that worked  but they don't have five years to become an electronics engineer. We have one month. So how do I make something that even a kid can use  And actually  with Arduino  we have kids like Sylvia that you see here  that actually make projects with Arduino. I have    year old kids stop me and show me stuff they built for Arduino that's really scary to see the capabilities that kids have when you give them the tools. So let's look at what happens when you make a tool that anybody can just pick up and build something quickly  so one of the examples that I like to sort of kick off this discussion is this example of this cat feeder. The gentleman who made this project had two cats. One was sick and the other one was healthy  so he had to make sure they ate the proper food. So he made this thing that recognizes the cat from a chip mounted inside on the collar of the cat  and opens the door and the cat can eat the food. This is made by recycling an old CD player that you can get from an old computer  some cardboard  tape  couple of sensors  a few blinking LEDs  and then suddenly you have a tool. You build something that you cannot find on the market. And I like this phrase   Scratch your own itch.  If you have an idea  you just go and you make it. This is the equivalent of sketching on paper done with electronics. So one of the features that I think is important about our work is that our hardware  on top of being made with love in Italy   as you can see from the back of the circuit    Laughter  is that it's open  so we publish all the design files for the circuit online  so you can download it and you can actually use it to make something  or to modify  to learn. You know  when I was learning about programming  I learned by looking at other people's code  or looking at other people's circuits in magazines. And this is a good way to learn  by looking at other people's work. So the different elements of the project are all open  so the hardware is released with a Creative Commons license. So  you know  I like this idea that hardware becomes like a piece of culture that you share and you build upon  like it was a song or a poem with Creative Commons. Or  the software is GPL  so it's open source as well. The documentation and the hands on teaching methodology is also open source and released as the Creative Commons. Just the name is protected so that we can make sure that we can tell people what is Arduino and what isn't. Now  Arduino itself is made of a lot of different open source components that maybe individually are hard to use for a    year old kid  so Arduino wraps everything together into a mashup of open source technologies where we try to give them the best user experience to get something done quickly. So you have situations like this  where some people in Chile decided to make their own boards instead of buying them  to organize a workshop and to save money. Or there are companies that make their own variations of Arduino that fit in a certain market  and there's probably  maybe like a     of them or something at the moment. This one is made by a company called Adafruit  which is run by this woman called Limor Fried  also known as Ladyada  who is one of the heroes of the open source hardware movement and the maker movement. So  this idea that you have a new  sort of turbo charged DIY community that believes in open source  in collaboration  collaborates online  collaborates in different spaces. There is this magazine called Make that sort of gathered all these people and sort of put them together as a community  and you see a very technical project explained in a very simple language  beautifully typeset. Or you have websites  like this one  like Instructables  where people actually teach each other about anything. So this one is about Arduino projects  the page you see on the screen  but effectively here you can learn how to make a cake and everything else. So let's look at some projects. So this one is a quadcopter. It's a small model helicopter. In a way  it's a toy  no  And so this one was military technology a few years ago  and now it's open source  easy to use  you can buy it online. DIY Drones is the community  they do this thing called ArduCopter. But then somebody actually launched this start up called Matternet  where they figured out that you could use this to actually transport things from one village to another in Africa  and the fact that this was easy to find  open source  easy to hack  enabled them to prototype their company really quickly. Or  other projects. Matt Richardson  I'm getting a little sick of hearing about the same people on TV over and over and over again  so I decided to do something about it. This Arduino project  which I call the Enough Already  will mute the TV anytime any of these over exposed personalities is mentioned.  Laughter  I'll show you how I made it.  Applause  MB  Check this out. MR  Our producers caught up with Kim Kardashian earlier today to find out what she was planning on wearing to her   MB  Eh   Laughter  MR  It should do a pretty good job of protecting our ears from having to hear about the details of Kim Kardashian's wedding. MB  Okay. So  you know  again  what is interesting here is that Matt found this module that lets Arduino process TV signals  he found some code written by somebody else that generates infrared signals for the TV  put it together and then created this great project. It's also used  Arduino's used  in serious places like  you know  the Large Hadron Collider. There's some Arduino balls collecting data and sort of measuring some parameters. Or it's used for   So this is a musical interface built by a student from Italy  and he's now turning this into a product. Because it was a student project becoming a product. Or it can be used to make an assistive device. This is a glove that understands the sign language and transforms the gestures you make into sounds and writes the words that you're signing on a display And again  this is made of all different parts you can find on all the websites that sell Arduino compatible parts  and you assemble it into a project. Or this is a project from the ITP part of NYU  where they met with this boy who has a severe disability  cannot play with the PS   so they built this device that allows the kid to play baseball although he has limited movement capability. Or you can find it in arts projects. So this is the txtBomber. So you put a message into this device and then you roll it on the wall  and it basically has all these solenoids pressing the buttons on spray cans  so you just pull it over a wall and it just writes on the wall all the political messages. So  yeah.  Applause  Then we have this plant here. This is called Botanicalls  because there's an Arduino ball with a Wi Fi module in the plant  and it's measuring the well being of the plant  and it's creating a Twitter account where you can actually interact with the plant.  Laughter  So  you know  this plant will start to say   This is really hot   or there's a lot of  you know   I need water right now.   Laughter  So it just gives a personality to your plant. Or this is something that twitters when the baby inside the belly of a pregnant woman kicks.  Laughter  Or this is a    year old kid in Chile who made a system that detects earthquakes and publishes on Twitter. He has         followers. He's    and he anticipated a governmental project by one year.  Applause  Or again  another project where  by analyzing the Twitter feed of a family  you can basically point where they are  like in the  Harry Potter  movie. So you can find out everything about this project on the website. Or somebody made a chair that twitters when somebody farts.  Laughter  It's interesting how  in       Gizmodo basically defined  said that this project actually gives a meaning to Twitter  so it was   a lot changed in between.  Laughter  So very serious project. When the Fukushima disaster happened  a bunch of people in Japan  they realized that the information that the government was giving wasn't really open and really reliable  so they built this Geiger counter  plus Arduino  plus network interface. They made     of them and gave them to people around Japan  and essentially the data that they gathered gets published on this website called Cosm  another website they built  so you can actually get reliable real time information from the field  and you can get unbiased information. Or this machine here  it's from the DIY bio movement  and it's one of the steps that you need in order to process DNA  and again  it's completely open source from the ground up. Or you have students in developing countries making replicas of scientific instruments that cost a lot of money to make. Actually they just build them themselves for a lot less using Arduino and a few parts. This is a pH probe. Or you get kids  like these kids  they're from Spain. They learned how to program and to make robots when they were probably  like      and then they started to use Arduino to make these robots that play football. They became world champions by making an Arduino based robot. And so when we had to make our own educational robot  we just went to them and said  you know   You design it  because you know exactly what is needed to make a great robot that excites kids.  Not me. I'm an old guy. What am I supposed to excite  huh   Laughter  But as I   in terms of educational assets.  Laughter  There's also companies like Google that are using the technology to create interfaces between mobile phones  tablets and the real world. So the Accessory Development Kit from Google is open source and based on Arduino  as opposed to the one from Apple which is closed source  NDA  sign your life to Apple. Here you are. There's a giant maze  and Joey's sitting there  and the maze is moving when you tilt the tablet. Also  I come from Italy  and the design is important in Italy  and yet very conservative. So we worked with a design studio called Habits  in Milan  to make this mirror  which is completely open source. This doubles also as an iPod speaker. So the idea is that the hardware  the software  the design of the object  the fabrication  everything about this project is open source and you can make it yourself. So we want other designers to pick this up and learn how to make great devices  to learn how to make interactive products by starting from something real. But when you have this idea  you know  what happens to all these ideas  There's  like  thousands of ideas that I   You know  it would take seven hours for me to do all the presentations. I will not take all the seven hours. Thank you. But let's start from this example  So  the group of people that started this company called Pebble  they prototyped a watch that communicates via Bluetooth with your phone  and you can display information on it. And they prototyped with an old LCD screen from a Nokia mobile phone and an Arduino. And then  when they had a final project  they actually went to Kickstarter and they were asking for         dollars to make a few of them to sell. They got    million dollars. They got a completely fully funded start up  and they don't have to  you know  get VCs involved or anything  just excite the people with their great project. The last project I want to show you is this  It's called ArduSat. It's currently on Kickstarter  so if you want to contribute  please do it. It's a satellite that goes into space  which is probably the least open source thing you can imagine  and it contains an Arduino connected to a bunch of sensors. So if you know how to use Arduino  you can actually upload your experiments into this satellite and run them. So imagine  if you as a high school can have the satellite for a week and do satellite space experiments like that. So  as I said  there's lots of examples  and I'm going to stop here. And I just want to thank the Arduino community for being the best  and just every day making lots of projects. Thank you.  Applause  And thanks to the community. Chris Anderson  Massimo  you told me earlier today that you had no idea  of course  that it would take off like this. MB  No. CA  I mean  how must you feel when you read this stuff and you see what you've unlocked  MB  Well  it's the work of a lot of people  so we as a community are enabling people to make great stuff  and I just feel overwhelmed. It's just  it's difficult to describe this. Every morning  I wake up and I look at all the stuff that Google Alerts sends me  and it's just amazing. It's just going into every field that you can imagine. CA  Thank you so much.  Applause  Openness. It's a word that denotes opportunity and possibilities. Open ended  open hearth  open source  open door policy  open bar.  Laughter  And everywhere the world is opening up  and it's a good thing. Why is this happening  The technology revolution is opening the world. Yesterday's Internet was a platform for the presentation of content. The Internet of today is a platform for computation. The Internet is becoming a giant global computer  and every time you go on it  you upload a video  you do a Google search  you remix something  you're programming this big global computer that we all share. Humanity is building a machine  and this enables us to collaborate in new ways. Collaboration can occur on an astronomical basis. Now a new generation is opening up the world as well. I started studying kids about    years ago     so actually    years ago now    and I noticed how my own children were effortlessly able to use all this sophisticated technology  and at first I thought   My children are prodigies    Laughter  But then I noticed all their friends were like them  so that was a bad theory. So I've started working with a few hundred kids  and I came to the conclusion that this is the first generation to come of age in the digital age  to be bathed in bits. I call them the Net Generation. I said  these kids are different. They have no fear of technology  because it's not there. It's like the air. It's sort of like  I have no fear of a refrigerator. And    Laughter  And there's no more powerful force to change every institution than the first generation of digital natives. I'm a digital immigrant. I had to learn the language. The global economic crisis is opening up the world as well. Our opaque institutions from the Industrial Age  everything from old models of the corporation  government  media  Wall Street  are in various stages of being stalled or frozen or in atrophy or even failing  and this is now creating a burning platform in the world. I mean  think about Wall Street. The core modus operandi of Wall Street almost brought down global capitalism. Now  you know the idea of a burning platform  that you're somewhere where the costs of staying where you are become greater than the costs of moving to something different  perhaps something radically different. And we need to change and open up all of our institutions. So this technology push  a demographic kick from a new generation and a demand pull from a new economic global environment is causing the world to open up. Now  I think  in fact  we're at a turning point in human history  where we can finally now rebuild many of the institutions of the Industrial Age around a new set of principles. Now  what is openness  Well  as it turns out  openness has a number of different meanings  and for each there's a corresponding principle for the transformation of civilization. The first is collaboration. Now  this is openness in the sense of the boundaries of organizations becoming more porous and fluid and open. The guy in the picture here  I'll tell you his story. His name is Rob McEwen. I'd like to say   I have this think tank  we scour the world for amazing case studies.  The reason I know this story is because he's my neighbor.  Laughter  He actually moved across the street from us  and he held a cocktail party to meet the neighbors  and he says   You're Don Tapscott. I've read some of your books.  I said   Great. What do you do   And he says   Well I used to be a banker and now I'm a gold miner.  And he tells me this amazing story. He takes over this gold mine  and his geologists can't tell him where the gold is. He gives them more money for geological data  they come back  they can't tell him where to go into production. After a few years  he's so frustrated he's ready to give up  but he has an epiphany one day. He wonders   If my geologists don't know where the gold is  maybe somebody else does.  So he does a  radical  thing. He takes his geological data  he publishes it and he holds a contest on the Internet called the Goldcorp Challenge. It's basically half a million dollars in prize money for anybody who can tell me  do I have any gold  and if so  where is it   Laughter  He gets submissions from all around the world. They use techniques that he's never heard of  and for his half a million dollars in prize money  Rob McEwen finds  .  billion dollars worth of gold. The market value of his company goes from    million to    billion dollars  and I can tell you  because he's my neighbor  he's a happy camper.  Laughter  You know  conventional wisdom says talent is inside  right  Your most precious asset goes out the elevator every night. He viewed talent differently. He wondered  who are their peers  He should have fired his geology department  but he didn't. You know  some of the best submissions didn't come from geologists. They came from computer scientists  engineers. The winner was a computer graphics company that built a three dimensional model of the mine where you can helicopter underground and see where the gold is. He helped us understand that social media's becoming social production. It's not about hooking up online. This is a new means of production in the making. And this Ideagora that he created  an open market  agora  for uniquely qualified minds  was part of a change  a profound change in the deep structure and architecture of our organizations  and how we sort of orchestrate capability to innovate  to create goods and services  to engage with the rest of the world  in terms of government  how we create public value. Openness is about collaboration. Now secondly  openness is about transparency. This is different. Here  we're talking about the communication of pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations  employees  customers  business partners  shareholders  and so on. And everywhere  our institutions are becoming naked. People are all bent out of shape about WikiLeaks  but that's just the tip of the iceberg. You see  people at their fingertips now  everybody  not just Julian Assange  have these powerful tools for finding out what's going on  scrutinizing  informing others  and even organizing collective responses. Institutions are becoming naked  and if you're going to be naked  well  there's some corollaries that flow from that. I mean  one is  fitness is no longer optional.  Laughter  You know  Or if you're going to be naked  you'd better get buff. Now  by buff I mean  you need to have good value  because value is evidenced like never before. You say you have good products. They'd better be good. But you also need to have values. You need to have integrity as part of your bones and your DNA as an organization  because if you don't  you'll be unable to build trust  and trust is a sine qua non of this new network world. So this is good. It's not bad. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. And we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world. Now  the third meaning and corresponding principle of openness is about sharing. Now this is different than transparency. Transparency is about the communication of information. Sharing is about giving up assets  intellectual property. And there are all kinds of famous stories about this. IBM gave away     million dollars of software to the Linux movement  and that gave them a multi billion dollar payoff. Now  conventional wisdom says   Well  hey  our intellectual property belongs to us  and if someone tries to infringe it  we're going to get out our lawyers and we're going to sue them.  Well  it didn't work so well for the record labels  did it  I mean  they took   They had a technology disruption  and rather than taking a business model innovation to correspond to that  they took and sought a legal solution and the industry that brought you Elvis and the Beatles is now suing children and is in danger of collapse. So we need to think differently about intellectual property. I'll give you an example. The pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble. First of all  there aren't a lot of big inventions in the pipeline  and this is a big problem for human health  and the pharmaceutical industry has got a bigger problem  that they're about to fall off something called the patent cliff. Do you know about this  They're going to lose    to    percent of their revenue in the next    months. And what are you going to do  like  cut back on paper clips or something  No. We need to reinvent the whole model of scientific research. The pharmaceutical industry needs to place assets in a commons. They need to start sharing precompetitive research. They need to start sharing clinical trial data  and in doing so  create a rising tide that could lift all boats  not just for the industry but for humanity. Now  the fourth meaning of openness  and corresponding principle  is about empowerment. And I'm not talking about the motherhood sense here. Knowledge and intelligence is power  and as it becomes more distributed  there's a concomitant distribution and decentralization and disaggregation of power that's underway in the world today. The open world is bringing freedom. Now  take the Arab Spring. The debate about the role of social media and social change has been settled. You know  one word  Tunisia. And then it ended up having a whole bunch of other words too. But in the Tunisian revolution  the new media didn't cause the revolution  it was caused by injustice. Social media didn't create the revolution  it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and who didn't want to be treated as subjects anymore. But just as the Internet drops transaction and collaboration costs in business and government  it also drops the cost of dissent  of rebellion  and even insurrection in ways that people didn't understand. You know  during the Tunisian revolution  snipers associated with the regime were killing unarmed students in the street. So the students would take their mobile devices  take a picture  triangulate the location  send that picture to friendly military units  who'd come in and take out the snipers. You think that social media is about hooking up online  For these kids  it was a military tool to defend unarmed people from murderers. It was a tool of self defense. You know  as we speak today  young people are being killed in Syria  and up until three months ago  if you were injured on the street  an ambulance would pick you up  take you to the hospital  you'd go in  say  with a broken leg  and you'd come out with a bullet in your head. So these    somethings created an alternative health care system  where what they did is they used Twitter and basic publicly available tools that when someone's injured  a car would show up  it would pick them up  take them to a makeshift medical clinic  where you'd get medical treatment  as opposed to being executed. So this is a time of great change. Now  it's not without its problems. Up until two years ago  all revolutions in human history had a leadership  and when the old regime fell  the leadership and the organization would take power. Well  these wiki revolutions happen so fast they create a vacuum  and politics abhors a vacuum  and unsavory forces can fill that  typically the old regime  or extremists  or fundamentalist forces. You can see this playing out today in Egypt. But that doesn't matter  because this is moving forward. The train has left the station. The cat is out of the bag. The horse is out of the barn. Help me out here  okay  I mean  we're not putting this one back. The open world is bringing empowerment and freedom. I think  at the end of these four days  that you'll come to conclude that the arc of history is a positive one  and it's towards openness. If you go back a few hundred years  all around the world it was a very closed society. It was agrarian  and the means of production and political system was called feudalism  and knowledge was concentrated in the church and the nobility. People didn't know about things. There was no concept of progress. You were born  you lived your life and you died. But then Johannes Gutenberg came along with his great invention  and  over time  the society opened up. People started to learn about things  and when they did  the institutions of feudal society appeared to be stalled  or frozen  or failing. It didn't make sense for the church to be responsible for medicine when people had knowledge. So we saw the Protestant Reformation. Martin Luther called the printing press  God's highest act of grace.  The creation of a corporation  science  the university  eventually the Industrial Revolution  and it was all good. But it came with a cost. And now  once again  the technology genie is out of the bottle  but this time it's different. The printing press gave us access to the written word. The Internet enables each of us to be a producer. The printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge. The Internet gives us access  not just to information and knowledge  but to the intelligence contained in the crania of other people on a global basis. To me  this is not an information age  it's an age of networked intelligence. It's an age of vast promise  an age of collaboration  where the boundaries of our organizations are changing  of transparency  where sunlight is disinfecting civilization  an age of sharing and understanding the new power of the commons  and it's an age of empowerment and of freedom. Now  what I'd like to do is  to close  to share with you some research that I've been doing. I've tried to study all kinds of organizations to understand what the future might look like  but I've been studying nature recently. You know  bees come in swarms and fish come in schools. Starlings  in the area around Edinburgh  in the moors of England  come in something called a murmuration  and the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings of the birds  and throughout the day the starlings are out over a    mile radius sort of doing their starling thing. And at night they come together and they create one of the most spectacular things in all of nature  and it's called a murmuration. And scientists that have studied this have said they've never seen an accident. Now  this thing has a function. It protects the birds. You can see on the right here  there's a predator being chased away by the collective power of the birds  and apparently this is a frightening thing if you're a predator of starlings. And there's leadership  but there's no one leader. Now  is this some kind of fanciful analogy  or could we actually learn something from this  Well  the murmuration functions to record a number of principles  and they're basically the principles that I have described to you today. This is a huge collaboration. It's an openness  it's a sharing of all kinds of information  not just about location and trajectory and danger and so on  but about food sources. And there's a real sense of interdependence  that the individual birds somehow understand that their interests are in the interest of the collective. Perhaps like we should understand that business can't succeed in a world that's failing. Well  I look at this thing  and I get a lot of hope. Think about the kids today in the Arab Spring  and you see something like this that's underway. And imagine  just consider this idea  if you would  What if we could connect ourselves in this world through a vast network of air and glass  Could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge  Could we start to share our intelligence  Could we create some kind of collective intelligence that goes beyond an individual or a group or a team to create  perhaps  some kind of consciousness on a global basis  Well  if we could do this  we could attack some big problems in the world. And I look at this thing  and  I don't know  I get a lot of hope that maybe this smaller  networked  open world that our kids inherit might be a better one  and that this new age of networked intelligence could be an age of promise fulfilled and of peril unrequited. Let's do this. Thank you. So I'm a woman with chronic schizophrenia. I've spent hundreds of days in psychiatric hospitals. I might have ended up spending most of my life on the back ward of a hospital  but that isn't how my life turned out. In fact  I've managed to stay clear of hospitals for almost three decades  perhaps my proudest accomplishment. That's not to say that I've remained clear of all psychiatric struggles. After I graduated from the Yale Law School and got my first law job  my New Haven analyst  Dr. White  announced to me that he was going to close his practice in three months  several years before I had planned to leave New Haven. White had been enormously helpful to me  and the thought of his leaving shattered me. My best friend Steve  sensing that something was terribly wrong  flew out to New Haven to be with me. Now I'm going to quote from some of my writings   I opened the door to my studio apartment. Steve would later tell me that  for all the times he had seen me psychotic  nothing could have prepared him for what he saw that day. For a week or more  I had barely eaten. I was gaunt. I walked as though my legs were wooden. My face looked and felt like a mask. I had closed all the curtains in the apartment  so in the middle of the day the apartment was in near total darkness. The air was fetid  the room a shambles. Steve  both a lawyer and a psychologist  has treated many patients with severe mental illness  and to this day he'll say I was as bad as any he had ever seen. 'Hi ' I said  and then I returned to the couch  where I sat in silence for several moments. 'Thank you for coming  Steve. Crumbling world  word  voice. Tell the clocks to stop. Time is. Time has come.' 'White is leaving ' Steve said somberly. 'I'm being pushed into a grave. The situation is grave ' I moan. 'Gravity is pulling me down. I'm scared. Tell them to get away.'  As a young woman  I was in a psychiatric hospital on three different occasions for lengthy periods. My doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia  and gave me a prognosis of  grave.  That is  at best  I was expected to live in a board and care  and work at menial jobs. Fortunately  I did not actually enact that grave prognosis. Instead  I'm a chaired Professor of Law  Psychology and Psychiatry at the USC Gould School of Law  I have many close friends and I have a beloved husband  Will  who's here with us today. He's definitely the star of my show. I'd like to share with you how that happened  and also describe my experience of being psychotic. I hasten to add that it's my experience  because everyone becomes psychotic in his or her own way. Let's start with the definition of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a brain disease. Its defining feature is psychosis  or being out of touch with reality. Delusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of the illness. Delusions are fixed and false beliefs that aren't responsive to evidence  and hallucinations are false sensory experiences. For example  when I'm psychotic I often have the delusion that I've killed hundreds of thousands of people with my thoughts. I sometimes have the idea that nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain. Occasionally  I have hallucinations  like one time I turned around and saw a man with a raised knife. Imagine having a nightmare while you're awake. Often  speech and thinking become disorganized to the point of incoherence. Loose associations involves putting together words that may sound a lot alike but don't make sense  and if the words get jumbled up enough  it's called  word salad.  Contrary to what many people think  schizophrenia is not the same as multiple personality disorder or split personality. The schizophrenic mind is not split  but shattered. Everyone has seen a street person  unkempt  probably ill fed  standing outside of an office building muttering to himself or shouting. This person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia. But schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array of socioeconomic status  and there are people with the illness who are full time professionals with major responsibilities. Several years ago  I decided to write down my experiences and my personal journey  and I want to share some more of that story with you today to convey the inside view. So the following episode happened the seventh week of my first semester of my first year at Yale Law School. Quoting from my writings   My two classmates  Rebel and Val  and I had made the date to meet in the law school library on Friday night to work on our memo assignment together. But we didn't get far before I was talking in ways that made no sense. 'Memos are visitations ' I informed them. 'They make certain points. The point is on your head. Pat used to say that. Have you killed you anyone ' Rebel and Val looked at me as if they or I had been splashed in the face with cold water. 'What are you talking about  Elyn ' 'Oh  you know  the usual. Who's what  what's who  heaven and hell. Let's go out on the roof. It's a flat surface. It's safe.' Rebel and Val followed and they asked what had gotten into me. 'This is the real me ' I announced  waving my arms above my head. And then  late on a Friday night  on the roof of the Yale Law School  I began to sing  and not quietly either. 'Come to the Florida sunshine bush. Do you want to dance ' 'Are you on drugs ' one asked. 'Are you high ' 'High  Me  No way  no drugs. Come to the Florida sunshine bush  where there are lemons  where they make demons.' 'You're frightening me ' one of them said  and Rebel and Val headed back into the library. I shrugged and followed them. Back inside  I asked my classmates if they were having the same experience of words jumping around our cases as I was. 'I think someone's infiltrated my copies of the cases ' I said. 'We've got to case the joint. I don't believe in joints  but they do hold your body together.'     It's an example of loose associations.     Eventually I made my way back to my dorm room  and once there  I couldn't settle down. My head was too full of noise  too full of orange trees and law memos I could not write and mass murders I knew I would be responsible for. Sitting on my bed  I rocked back and forth  moaning in fear and isolation.  This episode led to my first hospitalization in America. I had two earlier in England. Continuing with the writings   The next morning I went to my professor's office to ask for an extension on the memo assignment  and I began gibbering unintelligably as I had the night before  and he eventually brought me to the emergency room. Once there  someone I'll just call 'The Doctor' and his whole team of goons swooped down  lifted me high into the air  and slammed me down on a metal bed with such force that I saw stars. Then they strapped my legs and arms to the metal bed with thick leather straps. A sound came out of my mouth that I'd never heard before  half groan  half scream  barely human and pure terror. Then the sound came again  forced from somewhere deep inside my belly and scraping my throat raw.  This incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization. One of the reasons the doctors gave for hospitalizing me against my will was that I was  gravely disabled.  To support this view  they wrote in my chart that I was unable to do my Yale Law School homework. I wondered what that meant about much of the rest of New Haven. During the next year  I would spend five months in a psychiatric hospital. At times  I spent up to    hours in mechanical restraints  arms tied  arms and legs tied down  arms and legs tied down with a net tied tightly across my chest. I never struck anyone. I never harmed anyone. I never made any direct threats. If you've never been restrained yourself  you may have a benign image of the experience. There's nothing benign about it. Every week in the United States  it's been estimated that one to three people die in restraints. They strangle  they aspirate their vomit  they suffocate  they have a heart attack. It's unclear whether using mechanical restraints is actually saving lives or costing lives. While I was preparing to write my student note for the Yale Law Journal on mechanical restraints  I consulted an eminent law professor who was also a psychiatrist  and said surely he would agree that restraints must be degrading  painful and frightening. He looked at me in a knowing way  and said   Elyn  you don't really understand  These people are psychotic. They're different from me and you. They wouldn't experience restraints as we would.  I didn't have the courage to tell him in that moment that  no  we're not that different from him. We don't like to be strapped down to a bed and left to suffer for hours any more than he would. In fact  until very recently  and I'm sure some people still hold it as a view  that restraints help psychiatric patients feel safe. I've never met a psychiatric patient who agreed with that view. Today  I'd like to say I'm very pro psychiatry but very anti force. I don't think force is effective as treatment  and I think using force is a terrible thing to do to another person with a terrible illness. Eventually  I came to Los Angeles to teach at the University of Southern California Law School. For years  I had resisted medication  making many  many efforts to get off. I felt that if I could manage without medication  I could prove that  after all  I wasn't really mentally ill  it was some terrible mistake. My motto was the less medicine  the less defective. My L.A. analyst  Dr. Kaplan  was urging me just to stay on medication and get on with my life  but I decided I wanted to make one last college try to get off. Quoting from the text   I started the reduction of my meds  and within a short time I began feeling the effects. After returning from a trip to Oxford  I marched into Kaplan's office  headed straight for the corner  crouched down  covered my face  and began shaking. All around me I sensed evil beings poised with daggers. They'd slice me up in thin slices or make me swallow hot coals. Kaplan would later describe me as 'writhing in agony.' Even in this state  what he accurately described as acutely and forwardly psychotic  I refused to take more medication. The mission is not yet complete. Immediately after the appointment with Kaplan  I went to see Dr. Marder  a schizophrenia expert who was following me for medication side effects. He was under the impression that I had a mild psychotic illness. Once in his office  I sat on his couch  folded over  and began muttering. 'Head explosions and people trying to kill. Is it okay if I totally trash your office ' 'You need to leave if you think you're going to do that ' said Marder. 'Okay. Small. Fire on ice. Tell them not to kill me. Tell them not to kill me. What have I done wrong  Hundreds of thousands with thoughts  interdiction.' 'Elyn  do you feel like you're dangerous to yourself or others  I think you need to be in the hospital. I could get you admitted right away  and the whole thing could be very discrete.' 'Ha  ha  ha. You're offering to put me in hospitals  Hospitals are bad  they're mad  they're sad. One must stay away. I'm God  or I used to be.'  At that point in the text  where I said  I'm God  or I used to be   my husband made a marginal note. He said   Did you quit or were you fired    'I give life and I take it away. Forgive me  for I know not what I do.' Eventually  I broke down in front of friends  and everybody convinced me to take more medication. I could no longer deny the truth  and I could not change it. The wall that kept me  Elyn  Professor Saks  separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past  lay smashed and in ruins.  Everything about this illness says I shouldn't be here  but I am. And I am  I think  for three reasons  First  I've had excellent treatment. Four  to five day a week psychoanalytic psychotherapy for decades and continuing  and excellent psychopharmacology. Second  I have many close family members and friends who know me and know my illness. These relationships have given my life a meaning and a depth  and they also helped me navigate my life in the face of symptoms. Third  I work at an enormously supportive workplace at USC Law School. This is a place that not only accommodates my needs but actually embraces them. It's also a very intellectually stimulating place  and occupying my mind with complex problems has been my best and most powerful and most reliable defense against my mental illness. Even with all that   excellent treatment  wonderful family and friends  supportive work environment   I did not make my illness public until relatively late in life  and that's because the stigma against mental illness is so powerful that I didn't feel safe with people knowing. If you hear nothing else today  please hear this  There are not  schizophrenics.  There are people with schizophrenia  and these people may be your spouse  they may be your child  they may be your neighbor  they may be your friend  they may be your coworker. So let me share some final thoughts. We need to invest more resources into research and treatment of mental illness. The better we understand these illnesses  the better the treatments we can provide  and the better the treatments we can provide  the more we can offer people care  and not have to use force. Also  we must stop criminalizing mental illness. It's a national tragedy and scandal that the L.A. County Jail is the biggest psychiatric facility in the United States. American prisons and jails are filled with people who suffer from severe mental illness  and many of them are there because they never received adequate treatment. I could have easily ended up there or on the streets myself. A message to the entertainment industry and to the press  On the whole  you've done a wonderful job fighting stigma and prejudice of many kinds. Please  continue to let us see characters in your movies  your plays  your columns  who suffer with severe mental illness. Portray them sympathetically  and portray them in all the richness and depth of their experience as people and not as diagnoses. Recently  a friend posed a question  If there were a pill I could take that would instantly cure me  would I take it  The poet Rainer Maria Rilke was offered psychoanalysis. He declined  saying   Don't take my devils away  because my angels may flee too.  My psychosis  on the other hand  is a waking nightmare in which my devils are so terrifying that all my angels have already fled. So would I take the pill  In an instant. That said  I don't wish to be seen as regretting the life I could have had if I'd not been mentally ill  nor am I asking anyone for their pity. What I rather wish to say is that the humanity we all share is more important than the mental illness we may not. What those of us who suffer with mental illness want is what everybody wants  in the words of Sigmund Freud   to work and to love.  Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you. You're very kind.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause
