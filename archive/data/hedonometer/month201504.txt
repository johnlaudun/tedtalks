G'day  my name's Kevin. I'm from Australia. I'm here to help. Tonight  I want to talk about a tale of two cities. One of those cities is called Washington  and the other is called Beijing. Because how these two capitals shape their future and the future of the United States and the future of China doesn't just affect those two countries  it affects all of us in ways  perhaps  we've never thought of  the air we breathe  the water we drink  the fish we eat  the quality of our oceans  the languages we speak in the future  the jobs we have  the political systems we choose  and  of course  the great questions of war and peace. You see that bloke  He's French. His name is Napoleon. A couple of hundred years ago  he made this extraordinary projection   China is a sleeping lion  and when she awakes  the world will shake.  Napoleon got a few things wrong  he got this one absolutely right. Because China is today not just woken up  China has stood up and China is on the march  and the question for us all is where will China go and how do we engage this giant of the   st century  You start looking at the numbers  they start to confront you in a big way. It's projected that China will become  by whichever measure    PPP  market exchange rates    the largest economy in the world over the course of the decade ahead. They're already the largest trading nation  already the largest exporting nation  already the largest manufacturing nation  and they're also the biggest emitters of carbon in the world. America comes second. So if China does become the world's largest economy  think about this  It'll be the first time since this guy was on the throne of England    George III  not a good friend of Napoleon's    that in the world we will have as the largest economy a non English speaking country  a non Western country  a non liberal democratic country. And if you don't think that's going to affect the way in which the world happens in the future  then personally  I think you've been smoking something  and it doesn't mean you're from Colorado. So in short  the question we have tonight is  how do we understand this mega change  which I believe to be the biggest change for the first half of the   st century  It'll affect so many things. It will go to the absolute core. It's happening quietly. It's happening persistently. It's happening in some senses under the radar  as we are all preoccupied with what's going in Ukraine  what's going on in the Middle East  what's going on with ISIS  what's going on with ISIL  what's happening with the future of our economies. This is a slow and quiet revolution. And with a mega change comes also a mega challenge  and the mega challenge is this  Can these two great countries  China and the United States    China  the Middle Kingdom  and the United States  M igu     which in Chinese  by the way  means  the beautiful country.  Think about that    that's the name that China has given this country for more than a hundred years. Whether these two great civilizations  these two great countries  can in fact carve out a common future for themselves and for the world  In short  can we carve out a future which is peaceful and mutually prosperous  or are we looking at a great challenge of war or peace  And I have    minutes to work through war or peace  which is a little less time than they gave this guy to write a book called  War and Peace.  People ask me  why is it that a kid growing up in rural Australia got interested in learning Chinese  Well  there are two reasons for that. Here's the first of them. That's Betsy the cow. Now  Betsy the cow was one of a herd of dairy cattle that I grew up with on a farm in rural Australia. See those hands there  These are not built for farming. So very early on  I discovered that in fact  working in a farm was not designed for me  and China was a very safe remove from any career in Australian farm life. Here's the second reason. That's my mom. Anyone here ever listen to what their mom told them to do  Everyone ever do what their mom told them to do  I rarely did  but what my mom said to me was  one day  she handed me a newspaper  a headline which said  here we have a huge change. And that change is China entering the United Nations.       I had just turned    years of age  and she handed me this headline. And she said   Understand this   learn this  because it's going to affect your future.  So being a very good student of history  I decided that the best thing for me to do was  in fact  to go off and learn Chinese. The great thing about learning Chinese is that your Chinese teacher gives you a new name. And so they gave me this name  K   which means to overcome or to conquer  and W n  and that's the character for literature or the arts. K  W n  Conqueror of the Classics. Any of you guys called  Kevin   It's a major lift from being called Kevin to be called Conqueror of the Classics. I've been called Kevin all my life. Have you been called Kevin all your life  Would you prefer to be called Conqueror of the Classics  And so I went off after that and joined the Australian Foreign Service  but here is where pride    before pride  there always comes a fall. So there I am in the embassy in Beijing  off to the Great Hall of the People with our ambassador  who had asked me to interpret for his first meeting in the Great Hall of the People. And so there was I. If you've been to a Chinese meeting  it's a giant horseshoe. At the head of the horsehoe are the really serious pooh bahs  and down the end of the horseshoe are the not so serious pooh bahs  the junior woodchucks like me. And so the ambassador began with this inelegant phrase. He said   China and Australia are currently enjoying a relationship of unprecedented closeness.  And I thought to myself   That sounds clumsy. That sounds odd. I will improve it.  Note to file  Never do that. It needed to be a little more elegant  a little more classical  so I rendered it as follows.  In Chinese  There was a big pause on the other side of the room. You could see the giant pooh bahs at the head of the horseshoe  the blood visibly draining from their faces  and the junior woodchucks at the other end of the horseshoe engaged in peals of  unrestrained laughter. Because when I rendered his sentence   Australia and China are  enjoying a relationship of unprecedented closeness   in fact  what I said was that Australia and China were now experiencing fantastic orgasm. That was the last time I was asked to interpret. But in that little story  there's a wisdom  which is  as soon as you think you know something about this extraordinary civilization of       years of continuing history  there's always something new to learn. History is against us when it comes to the U.S. and China forging a common future together. This guy up here  He's not Chinese and he's not American. He's Greek. His name's Thucydides. He wrote the history of the Peloponnesian Wars. And he made this extraordinary observation about Athens and Sparta.  It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this inspired in Sparta that made war inevitable.  And hence  a whole literature about something called the Thucydides Trap. This guy here  He's not American and he's not Greek. He's Chinese. His name is Sun Tzu. He wrote  The Art of War   and if you see his statement underneath  it's along these lines   Attack him where he is unprepared  appear where you are not expected.  Not looking good so far for China and the United States. This guy is an American. His name's Graham Allison. In fact  he's a teacher at the Kennedy School over there in Boston. He's working on a single project at the moment  which is  does the Thucydides Trap about the inevitably of war between rising powers and established great powers apply to the future of China U.S. relations  It's a core question. And what Graham has done is explore    cases in history since the     s to establish what the precedents are. And in    out of    of them  let me tell you  they've ended in catastrophic war. You may say   But Kevin    or Conqueror of the Classics    that was the past. We live now in a world of interdependence and globalization. It could never happen again.  Guess what  The economic historians tell us that in fact  the time which we reached the greatest point of economic integration and globalization was in       just before that happened  World War I  a sobering reflection from history. So if we are engaged in this great question of how China thinks  feels  and positions itself towards the United States  and the reverse  how do we get to the baseline of how these two countries and civilizations can possibly work together  Let me first go to  in fact  China's views of the U.S. and the rest of the West. Number one  China feels as if it's been humiliated at the hands of the West through a hundred years of history  beginning with the Opium Wars. When after that  the Western powers carved China up into little pieces  so that by the time it got to the '  s and '  s  signs like this one appeared on the streets of Shanghai.   No dogs and Chinese allowed   How would you feel if you were Chinese  in your own country   if you saw that sign appear  China also believes and feels as if  in the events of       at the Peace Conference in Paris  when Germany's colonies were given back to all sorts of countries around in the world  what about German colonies in China  They were  in fact  given to Japan. When Japan then invaded China in the     s the world looked away and was indifferent to what would happen to China. And then  on top of that  the Chinese to this day believe that the United States and the West do not accept the legitimacy of their political system because it's so radically different from those of us who come from liberal democracies  and believe that the United States to this day is seeking to undermine their political system. China also believes that it is being contained by U.S. allies and by those with strategic partnerships with the U.S. right around its periphery. And beyond all that  the Chinese have this feeling in their heart of hearts and in their gut of guts that those of us in the collective West are just too damned arrogant. That is  we don't recognize the problems in our own system  in our politics and our economics  and are very quick to point the finger elsewhere  and believe that  in fact  we in the collective West are guilty of a great bunch of hypocrisy. Of course  in international relations  it's not just the sound of one hand clapping. There's another country too  and that's called the U.S. So how does the U.S. respond to all of the above  The U.S. has a response to each of those. On the question of is the U.S. containing China  they say   No  look at the history of the Soviet Union. That was containment.  Instead  what we have done in the U.S. and the West is welcome China into the global economy  and on top of that  welcome them into the World Trade Organization. The U.S. and the West say China cheats on the question of intellectual property rights  and through cyberattacks on U.S. and global firms. Furthermore  the United States says that the Chinese political system is fundamentally wrong because it's at such fundamental variance to the human rights  democracy  and rule of law that we enjoy in the U.S. and the collective West. And on top of all the above  what does the United States say  That they fear that China will  when it has sufficient power  establish a sphere of influence in Southeast Asia and wider East Asia  boot the United States out  and in time  when it's powerful enough  unilaterally seek to change the rules of the global order. So apart from all of that  it's just fine and dandy  the U.S. China relationship. No real problems there. The challenge  though  is given those deep rooted feelings  those deep rooted emotions and thought patterns  what the Chinese call  S w i   ways of thinking  how can we craft a basis for a common future between these two  I argue simply this  We can do it on the basis on a framework of constructive realism for a common purpose. What do I mean by that  Be realistic about the things that we disagree on  and a management approach that doesn't enable any one of those differences to break into war or conflict until we've acquired the diplomatic skills to solve them. Be constructive in areas of the bilateral  regional and global engagement between the two  which will make a difference for all of humankind. Build a regional institution capable of cooperation in Asia  an Asia Pacific community. And worldwide  act further  like you've begun to do at the end of last year by striking out against climate change with hands joined together rather than fists apart. Of course  all that happens if you've got a common mechanism and political will to achieve the above. These things are deliverable. But the question is  are they deliverable alone  This is what our head tells us we need to do  but what about our heart  I have a little experience in the question back home of how you try to bring together two peoples who  frankly  haven't had a whole lot in common in the past. And that's when I apologized to Australia's indigenous peoples. This was a day of reckoning in the Australian government  the Australian parliament  and for the Australian people. After     years of unbridled abuse towards the first Australians  it was high time that we white folks said we were sorry. The important thing    The important thing that I remember is staring in the faces of all those from Aboriginal Australia as they came to listen to this apology. It was extraordinary to see  for example  old women telling me the stories of when they were five years old and literally ripped away from their parents  like this lady here. It was extraordinary for me to then be able to embrace and to kiss Aboriginal elders as they came into the parliament building  and one woman said to me  it's the first time a white fella had ever kissed her in her life  and she was over   . That's a terrible story. And then I remember this family saying to me   You know  we drove all the way from the far North down to Canberra to come to this thing  drove our way through redneck country. On the way back  stopped at a cafe after the apology for a milkshake.  And they walked into this cafe quietly  tentatively  gingerly  a little anxious. I think you know what I'm talking about. But the day after the apology  what happened  Everyone in that cafe  every one of the white folks  stood up and applauded. Something had happened in the hearts of these people in Australia. The white folks  our Aboriginal brothers and sisters  and we haven't solved all these problems together  but let me tell you  there was a new beginning because we had gone not just to the head  we'd gone also to the heart. So where does that conclude in terms of the great question that we've been asked to address this evening  which is the future of U.S. China relations  The head says there's a way forward. The head says there is a policy framework  there's a common narrative  there's a mechanism through regular summitry to do these things and to make them better. But the heart must also find a way to reimagine the possibilities of the America China relationship  and the possibilities of China's future engagement in the world. Sometimes  folks  we just need to take a leap of faith not quite knowing where we might land. In China  they now talk about the Chinese Dream. In America  we're all familiar with the term  the American Dream.  I think it's time  across the world  that we're able to think also of something we might also call a dream for all humankind. Because if we do that  we might just change the way that we think about each other.  In Chinese  That's my challenge to America. That's my challenge to China. That's my challenge to all of us  but I think where there's a will and where there is imagination we can turn this into a future driven by peace and prosperity and not once again repeat the tragedies of war. I thank you. Chris Anderson  Thanks so much for that. Thanks so much for that. It feels like you yourself have a role to play in this bridging. You  in a way  are uniquely placed to speak to both sides. Kevin Rudd  Well  what we Australians do best is organize the drinks  so you get them together in one room  and we suggest this and suggest that  then we go and get the drinks. But no  look  for all of us who are friends of these two great countries  America and China  you can do something. You can make a practical contribution  and for all you good folks here  next time you meet someone from China  sit down and have a conversation. See what you can find out about where they come from and what they think  and my challenge for all the Chinese folks who are going to watch this TED Talk at some time is do the same. Two of us seeking to change the world can actually make a huge difference. Those of us up the middle  we can make a small contribution. CA  Kevin  all power to you  my friend. Thank you. KR  Thank you. Thank you  folks. People back home call me a heckler  a troublemaker  an irritant  a rebel  an activist  the voice of the people. But that wasn't always me. Growing up  I had a nickname. They used to call me Softy  meaning the soft  harmless boy. Like every other human being  I avoided trouble. In my childhood  they taught me silence. Don't argue  do as you're told. In Sunday school  they taught me don't confront  don't argue  even if you're right  turn the other cheek. This was reinforced by the political climate of the time. Kenya is a country where you are guilty until proven rich. Kenya's poor are five times more likely to be shot dead by the police who are meant to protect them than by criminals. This was reinforced by the political climate of the day. We had a president  Moi  who was a dictator. He ruled the country with an iron fist  and anyone who dared question his authority was arrested  tortured  jailed or even killed. That meant that people were taught to be smart cowards  stay out of trouble. Being a coward was not an insult. Being a coward was a compliment. We used to be told that a coward goes home to his mother. What that meant  that if you stayed out of trouble you're going to stay alive. I used to question this advice  and eight years ago we had an election in Kenya  and the results were violently disputed. What followed that election was terrible violence  rape  and the killing of over       people. My work was to document the violence. As a photographer  I took thousands of images  and after two months  the two politicians came together  had a cup of tea  signed a peace agreement  and the country moved on. I was a very disturbed man because I saw the violence firsthand. I saw the killings. I saw the displacement. I met women who had been raped  and it disturbed me  but the country never spoke about it. We pretended. We all became smart cowards. We decided to stay out of trouble and not talk about it. Ten months later  I quit my job. I said I could not stand it anymore. After quitting my job  I decided to organize my friends to speak about the violence in the country  to speak about the state of the nation  and June         was the day that we were meant to go to the stadium and try and get the president's attention. It's a national holiday  it's broadcast across the country  and I showed up at the stadium. My friends did not show up. I found myself alone  and I didn't know what to do. I was scared  but I knew very well that that particular day  I had to make a decision. Was I able to live as a coward  like everyone else  or was I going to make a stand  And when the president stood up to speak  I found myself on my feet shouting at the president  telling him to remember the post election violence victims  to stop the corruption. And suddenly  out of nowhere  the police pounced on me like hungry lions. They held my mouth and dragged me out of the stadium  where they thoroughly beat me up and locked me up in jail. I spent that night in a cold cement floor in the jail  and that got me thinking. What was making me feel this way  My friends and family thought I was crazy because of what I did  and the images that I took were disturbing my life. The images that I took were just a number to many Kenyans. Most Kenyans did not see the violence. It was a story to them. And so I decided to actually start a street exhibition to show the images of the violence across the country and get people talking about it. We traveled the country and showed the images  and this was a journey that has started me to the activist path  where I decided to become silent no more  to talk about those things. We traveled  and our general site from our street exhibit became for political graffiti about the situation in the country  talking about corruption  bad leadership. We have even done symbolic burials. We have delivered live pigs to Kenya's parliament as a symbol of our politicians' greed. It has been done in Uganda and other countries  and what is most powerful is that the images have been picked by the media and amplified across the country  across the continent. Where I used to stand up alone seven years ago  now I belong to a community of many people who stand up with me. I am no longer alone when I stand up to speak about these things. I belong to a group of young people who are passionate about the country  who want to bring about change  and they're no longer afraid  and they're no longer smart cowards. So that was my story. That day in the stadium  I stood up as a smart coward. By that one action  I said goodbye to the    years living as a coward. There are two most powerful days in your life  the day you're born  and the day you discover why. That day standing up in that stadium shouting at the President  I discovered why I was truly born  that I would no longer be silent in the face of injustice. Do you know why you were born  Thank you. Tom Rielly  It's an amazing story. I just want to ask you a couple quick questions. So PAWA     you've created a studio  a place where young people can go and harness the power of digital media to do some of this action. What's happening now with PAWA  Boniface Mwangi  So we have  this community of filmmakers  graffiti artists  musicians  and when there's an issue in the country  we come together  we brainstorm  and take up on that issue. So our most powerful tool is art  because we live in a very busy world where people are so busy in their life  and they don't have time to read. So we package our activism and we package our message in art. So from the music  the graffiti   the art  that's what we do. Can I say one more thing  TR  Yeah  of course.  Applause  BM  In spite of being arrested  beaten up  threatened  the moment I discovered my voice  that I could actually stand up for what I really believed in  I'm no longer afraid. I used to be called softy  but I'm no longer softy  because I discovered who I really am  as in  that's what I want to do  and there's such beauty in doing that. There's nothing as powerful as that  knowing that I'm meant to do this  because you don't get scared  you just continue living your life. Thank you. When I was a kid  the disaster we worried about most  was a nuclear war. That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement  filled with cans of food and water. When the nuclear attack came  we were supposed to go downstairs  hunker down  and eat out of that barrel. Today the greatest risk  of global catastrophe doesn't look like this. Instead  it looks like this. If anything kills over    million people in the next few decades  it's most likely to be  a highly infectious virus rather than a war. Not missiles  but microbes. Now  part of the reason for this is that we've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents. But we've actually invested very little  in a system to stop an epidemic. We're not ready for the next epidemic. Let's look at Ebola. I'm sure all of you read about it  in the newspaper  lots of tough challenges. I followed it carefully  through the case analysis tools we use to track polio eradication. And as you look at what went on  the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough  the problem was that we  didn't have a system at all. In fact  there's some pretty obvious key missing pieces. We didn't have a group of epidemiologists  ready to go  who would have gone  seen what the disease was  seen how far it had spread. The case reports came in on paper. It was very delayed before they were put online and they were extremely inaccurate. We didn't have a medical team ready to go. We didn't have a way of preparing people. Now  M decins Sans Fronti res  did a great job orchestrating volunteers. But even so  we were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries. And a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers. There was no one there  to look at treatment approaches. No one to look at the diagnostics. No one to figure out  what tools should be used. As an example  we could have  taken the blood of survivors  processed it  and put that plasma back in people to protect them. But that was never tried. So there was a lot that was missing. And these things  are really a global failure. The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics  but not to do these things I talked about. Now  in the movies it's quite different. There's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go  they move in  they save the day  but that's just pure Hollywood. The failure to prepare  could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically  more devastating than Ebola Let's look at the progression  of Ebola over this year. About        people died  and nearly all were in the three West African countries. There's three reasons why it didn't spread more. The first is that there was a lot  of heroic work by the health workers. They found the people and they  prevented more infections. The second is the nature of the virus. Ebola does not spread through the air. And by the time you're contagious  most people are so sick  that they're bedridden. Third  it didn't get into many urban areas. And that was just luck. If it had gotten into a lot  more urban areas  the case numbers  would have been much larger. So next time  we might not be so lucky. You can have a virus where people  feel well enough while they're infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market. The source of the virus could be  a natural epidemic like Ebola  or it could be bioterrorism. So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse. In fact  let's look at a model of a virus spread through the air  like the Spanish Flu back in     . So here's what would happen  It would spread throughout the world very  very quickly. And you can see over    million people died from that epidemic. So this is a serious problem. We should be concerned. But in fact  we can build a really good response system. We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here. We've got cell phones to get information from the public  and get information out to them. We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they're moving. We have advances in biology that should dramatically change  the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen. So we can have tools  but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system. And we need preparedness. The best lessons  I think   on how to get prepared are again  what we do for war. For soldiers  we have full time  waiting to go. We have reserves that can scale  us up to large numbers. NATO has a mobile unit  that can deploy very rapidly. NATO does a lot of war games  to check  are people well trained  Do they understand  about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies  So they are absolutely ready to go. So those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic. What are the key pieces  First  we need strong health systems in poor countries. That's where mothers  can give birth safely  kids can get all their vaccines. But  also where we'll see  the outbreak very early on. We need a medical reserve corps  lots of people who've got  the training and background who are ready to go  with the expertise. And then we need to pair those medical people with the military. taking advantage of the military's ability to move fast  do logistics and secure areas. We need to do simulations  germ games  not war games  so that we see where the holes are. The last time a germ game  was done in the United States was back in        and it didn't go so well. So far the score is germs     people   . Finally  we need lots of advanced R D in areas of vaccines and diagnostics. There are some big breakthroughs   like the Adeno associated virus  that could work very  very quickly. Now I don't have an exact budget for what this would cost  but I'm quite sure it's very modest compared to the potential harm. The World Bank estimates that  if we have a worldwide flu epidemic  global wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars and we'd have millions and millions of deaths. These investments  offer significant benefits beyond just being ready for the epidemic. The primary healthcare  the R D  those things would reduce  global health equity and make the world more just  as well as more safe. So I think this should absolutely be a priority. There's no need to panic. We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement. But we need to get going  because time is not on our side. In fact  if there's one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic  it's that it can serve as an early  warning  a wake up call  to get ready. If we start now  we can be ready  for the next epidemic. Thank you. I dedicated the past two years  to understanding how people achieve their dreams. When we think about the dreams we have  and the dent we want to leave in the universe  it is striking to see how big  of an overlap there is between the dreams that we have  and projects that never happen. So I'm here to talk to you today about five ways how not  to follow your dreams. One  Believe in overnight success. You know the story  right  The tech guy built a mobile app  and sold it very fast for a lot of money. You know  the story may seem real  but I bet it's incomplete. If you go investigate further  the guy has done    apps before and he has done a master's on the topic  a Ph.D. He has been working on the topic for    years. This is really interesting  I myself have a story in Brazil  that people think is an overnight success. I come from a humble family  and two weeks before  the deadline to apply to MIT  I started the application process. And  voila  I got in. People may think it's  an overnight success  but that only worked because  for the    years prior to that  I took life and education seriously. Your overnight success story is always a result of everything you've done in your  life through that moment. Two  Believe someone else  has the answers for you. Constantly  people want  to help out  right  All sorts of people  your family  your friends  your business partners  they all have opinions  on which path you should take   And let me tell you   go through this pipe.  But whenever you go inside  there are  other ways you have to pick as well. And you need to make  those decisions yourself. No one else has the perfect answers for your life. And you need to keep picking those decisions  right  The pipes are infinite and  you're going to bump your head  and it's a part of the process. Three  and it's very subtle  but very important  Decide to settle when  growth is guaranteed. So when your life is going great  you have put together a great team  and you have growing revenue  and everything is set    time to settle. When I launched my first book  I worked really  really hard to  distribute it everywhere in Brazil. With that  over three million  people downloaded it  over        people  bought physical copies. When I wrote a sequel   some impact was guaranteed. Even if I did little  sales would be okay. But okay is never okay. When you're growing towards a peak  you need to work harder than ever  and find yourself another peak. Maybe if I did little  a couple hundred thousand people would read it  and that's great already. But if I work harder than ever  I can bring this number up to millions. That's why I decided  with my new book  to go to every single state of Brazil. And I can already see a higher peak. There's no time to settle down. Fourth tip  and that's really important  Believe the fault is someone else's. I constantly see people saying   Yes  I had this great idea  but no investor had the vision to invest.   Oh  I created this great product  but the market is so bad  the sales didn't go well.  Or   I can't find good talent  my team is so below expectations.  If you have dreams  it's your responsibility  to make them happen. Yes  it may be hard to find talent. Yes  the market may be bad. But if no one invested in your idea  if no one bought your product  for sure  there is something  there that is your fault. Definitely. You need to get your dreams and make them happen. And no one achieved their goals alone. But if you didn't make them happen   it's your fault and no one else's. Be responsible for your dreams. And one last tip  and this one is  really important as well  Believe that the only things that matter are the dreams themselves. Once I saw an ad   and it was a lot of friends  they were going up a mountain  it was a very high mountain  and it was a lot of work. You could see that they  were sweating and this was tough. And they were going up   and they finally made it to the peak. Of course  they decided to celebrate  right  I'm going to celebrate  so   Yes  We made it  we're at the top   Two seconds later  one looks at the other and says   Okay  let's go down.  Life is never about the goals themselves. Life is about the journey. Yes  you should enjoy  the goals themselves  but people think that you have dreams  and whenever you get to reaching one of those dreams  it's a magical place where  happiness will be all around. But achieving a dream  is a momentary sensation  and your life is not. The only way to really achieve  all of your dreams is to fully enjoy every step  of your journey. That's the best way. And your journey is simple    it's made of steps. Some steps will be right on. Sometimes you will trip. If it's right on  celebrate  because some people wait a lot to celebrate. And if you tripped  turn that into something to learn. If every step becomes something to learn or something to celebrate  you will for sure enjoy the journey. So  five tips  Believe in overnight success  believe someone else  has the answers for you  believe that when growth is guaranteed   you should settle down  believe the fault is someone else's  and believe that only  the goals themselves matter. Believe me  if you do that   you will destroy your dreams. Thank you. Imagine you're in a bar  or a club  and you start talking  and after a while  the question comes up   So  what do you do for work   And since you think your job is interesting  you say   I'm a mathematician.   Laughter  And inevitably  during that conversation one of these two phrases come up  A   I was terrible at math  but it wasn't my fault. It's because the teacher was awful.   Laughter  Or B   But what is math really for   I'll now address Case B. When someone asks you what math is for  they're not asking you about applications of mathematical science. They're asking you  why did I have to study that bullshit I never used in my life again   Laughter  That's what they're actually asking. So when mathematicians are asked what math is for  they tend to fall into two groups    .   percent of mathematicians will assume an attacking position  and   .   percent of mathematicians will take a defensive position. There's a strange  .  percent  among which I include myself. Who are the ones that attack  The attacking ones are mathematicians who would tell you this question makes no sense  because mathematics have a meaning all their own    a beautiful edifice with its own logic    and that there's no point in constantly searching for all possible applications. What's the use of poetry  What's the use of love  What's the use of life itself   What kind of question is that  Hardy  for instance  was a model of this type of attack. And those who stand in defense tell you   Even if you don't realize it  friend  math is behind everything.  Those guys  they always bring up bridges and computers.  If you don't know math  your bridge will collapse.  It's true  computers are all about math. And now these guys have also started saying that behind information security and credit cards are prime numbers. These are the answers your math teacher would give you if you asked him. He's one of the defensive ones. Okay  but who's right then  Those who say that math doesn't need to have a purpose  or those who say that math is behind everything we do  Actually  both are right. But remember I told you I belong to that strange  .  percent claiming something else  So  go ahead  ask me what math is for. Audience  What is math for  Eduardo S enz de Cabez n  Okay    .   percent of you asked the question    .   percent didn't say anything  and the  .  percent    I'm not sure what those guys are doing. Well  to my dear   .   percent    it's true that math doesn't need to serve a purpose  it's true that it's a beautiful structure  a logical one  probably one of the greatest collective efforts ever achieved in human history. But it's also true that there  where scientists and technicians are looking for mathematical theories that allow them to advance  they're within the structure of math  which permeates everything. It's true that we have to go somewhat deeper  to see what's behind science. Science operates on intuition  creativity. Math controls intuition and tames creativity. Almost everyone who hasn't heard this before is surprised when they hear that if you take a  .  millimeter thick sheet of paper  the size we normally use  and  if it were big enough  fold it    times  its thickness would extend almost the distance from the Earth to the sun. Your intuition tells you it's impossible. Do the math and you'll see it's right. That's what math is for. It's true that science  all types of science  only makes sense because it makes us better understand this beautiful world we live in. And in doing that  it helps us avoid the pitfalls of this painful world we live in. There are sciences that help us in this way quite directly. Oncological science  for example. And there are others we look at from afar  with envy sometimes  but knowing that we are what supports them. All the basic sciences support them  including math. All that makes science  science is the rigor of math. And that rigor factors in because its results are eternal. You probably said or were told at some point that diamonds are forever  right  That depends on your definition of forever  A theorem    that really is forever. The Pythagorean theorem is still true even though Pythagoras is dead  I assure you it's true.  Laughter  Even if the world collapsed the Pythagorean theorem would still be true. Wherever any two triangle sides and a good hypotenuse get together the Pythagorean theorem goes all out. It works like crazy. Well  we mathematicians devote ourselves to come up with theorems. Eternal truths. But it isn't always easy to know the difference between an eternal truth  or theorem  and a mere conjecture. You need proof. For example  let's say I have a big  enormous  infinite field. I want to cover it with equal pieces  without leaving any gaps. I could use squares  right  I could use triangles. Not circles  those leave little gaps. Which is the best shape to use  One that covers the same surface  but has a smaller border. In the year      Pappus of Alexandria said the best is to use hexagons  just like bees do. But he didn't prove it. The guy said   Hexagons  great  Let's go with hexagons   He didn't prove it  it remained a conjecture.  Hexagons   And the world  as you know  split into Pappists and anti Pappists  until      years later when in       Thomas Hales proved that Pappus and the bees were right    the best shape to use was the hexagon. And that became a theorem  the honeycomb theorem  that will be true forever and ever  for longer than any diamond you may have.  Laughter  But what happens if we go to three dimensions  If I want to fill the space with equal pieces  without leaving any gaps  I can use cubes  right  Not spheres  those leave little gaps.  Laughter  What is the best shape to use  Lord Kelvin  of the famous Kelvin degrees and all  said that the best was to use a truncated octahedron which  as you all know    is this thing here  Come on. Who doesn't have a truncated octahedron at home   Laughter  Even a plastic one.  Honey  get the truncated octahedron  we're having guests.  Everybody has one   Laughter  But Kelvin didn't prove it. It remained a conjecture    Kelvin's conjecture. The world  as you know  then split into Kelvinists and anti Kelvinists until a hundred or so years later  someone found a better structure. Weaire and Phelan found this little thing over here    this structure to which they gave the very clever name  the Weaire   Phelan structure.  It looks like a strange object  but it isn't so strange  it also exists in nature. It's very interesting that this structure  because of its geometric properties  was used to build the Aquatics Center for the Beijing Olympic Games. There  Michael Phelps won eight gold medals  and became the best swimmer of all time. Well  until someone better comes along  right  As may happen with the Weaire   Phelan structure. It's the best until something better shows up. But be careful  because this one really stands a chance that in a hundred or so years  or even if it's in      years  that someone proves it's the best possible shape for the job. It will then become a theorem  a truth  forever and ever. For longer than any diamond. So  if you want to tell someone that you will love them forever you can give them a diamond. But if you want to tell them that you'll love them forever and ever  give them a theorem  But hang on a minute  You'll have to prove it  so your love doesn't remain a conjecture. It would be nice to be objective in life  in many ways. The problem is that we have these color tinted glasses as we look at all kinds of situations. For example  think about something as simple as beer. If I gave you a few beers to taste and I asked you to rate them on intensity and bitterness  different beers would occupy different space. But what if we tried to be objective about it  In the case of beer  it would be very simple. What if we did a blind taste  Well  if we did the same thing  you tasted the same beer  now in the blind taste  things would look slightly different. Most of the beers will go into one place. You will basically not be able to distinguish them  and the exception  of course  will be Guinness. Similarly  we can think about physiology. What happens when people expect something from their physiology  For example  we sold people pain medications. Some people  we told them the medications were expensive. Some people  we told them it was cheap. And the expensive pain medication worked better. It relieved more pain from people  because expectations do change our physiology. And of course  we all know that in sports  if you are a fan of a particular team  you can't help but see the game develop from the perspective of your team. So all of those are cases in which our preconceived notions and our expectations color our world. But what happened in more important questions  What happened with questions that had to do with social justice  So we wanted to think about what is the blind tasting version for thinking about inequality  So we started looking at inequality  and we did some large scale surveys around the U.S. and other countries. So we asked two questions  Do people know what kind of level of inequality we have  And then  what level of inequality do we want to have  So let's think about the first question. Imagine I took all the people in the U.S. and I sorted them from the poorest on the right to the richest on the left  and then I divided them into five buckets  the poorest    percent  the next    percent  the next  the next  and the richest    percent. And then I asked you to tell me how much wealth do you think is concentrated in each of those buckets. So to make it simpler  imagine I ask you to tell me  how much wealth do you think is concentrated in the bottom two buckets  the bottom    percent  Take a second. Think about it and have a number. Usually we don't think. Think for a second  have a real number in your mind. You have it  Okay  here's what lots of Americans tell us. They think that the bottom    percent has about  .  percent of the wealth  the next group has  .   so together it's slightly more than nine. The next group  they say  has    percent     percent  and the richest    percent  people think has    percent of the wealth. You can see how this relates to what you thought. Now  what's reality  Reality is slightly different. The bottom    percent has  .  percent of the wealth. The next    percent has  .  percent of the wealth. Together  it's  . . The next group has  .     .   and the richest group has       percent of the wealth. So what we actually have and what we think we have are very different. What about what we want  How do we even figure this out  So to look at this  to look at what we really want  we thought about the philosopher John Rawls. If you remember John Rawls  he had this notion of what's a just society. He said a just society is a society that if you knew everything about it  you would be willing to enter it in a random place. And it's a beautiful definition  because if you're wealthy  you might want the wealthy to have more money  the poor to have less. If you're poor  you might want more equality. But if you're going to go into that society in every possible situation  and you don't know  you have to consider all the aspects. It's a little bit like blind tasting in which you don't know what the outcome will be when you make a decision  and Rawls called this the  veil of ignorance.  So  we took another group  a large group of Americans  and we asked them the question in the veil of ignorance. What are the characteristics of a country that would make you want to join it  knowing that you could end randomly at any place  And here is what we got. What did people want to give to the first group  the bottom    percent  They wanted to give them about    percent of the wealth. The next group     percent of the wealth         and   . Now  nobody in our sample wanted full equality. Nobody thought that socialism is a fantastic idea in our sample. But what does it mean  It means that we have this knowledge gap between what we have and what we think we have  but we have at least as big a gap between what we think is right to what we think we have. Now  we can ask these questions  by the way  not just about wealth. We can ask it about other things as well. So for example  we asked people from different parts of the world about this question  people who are liberals and conservatives  and they gave us basically  the same answer. We asked rich and poor  they gave us the same answer  men and women  NPR listeners and Forbes readers. We asked people in England  Australia  the U.S.    very similar answers. We even asked different departments of a university. We went to Harvard and we checked almost every department  and in fact  from Harvard Business School  where a few people wanted the wealthy to have more and the  poor  to have less  the similarity was astonishing. I know some of you went to Harvard Business School. We also asked this question about something else. We asked  what about the ratio of CEO pay to unskilled workers  So you can see what people think is the ratio  and then we can ask the question  what do they think should be the ratio  And then we can ask  what is reality  What is reality  And you could say  well  it's not that bad  right  The red and the yellow are not that different. But the fact is  it's because I didn't draw them on the same scale. It's hard to see  there's yellow and blue in there. So what about other outcomes of wealth  Wealth is not just about wealth. We asked  what about things like health  What about availability of prescription medication  What about life expectancy  What about life expectancy of infants  How do we want this to be distributed  What about education for young people  And for older people  And across all of those things  what we learned was that people don't like inequality of wealth  but there's other things where inequality  which is an outcome of wealth  is even more aversive to them  for example  inequality in health or education. We also learned that people are particularly open to changes in equality when it comes to people who have less agency    basically  young kids and babies  because we don't think of them as responsible for their situation. So what are some lessons from this  We have two gaps  We have a knowledge gap and we have a desirability gap And the knowledge gap is something that we think about  how do we educate people  How do we get people to think differently about inequality and the consequences of inequality in terms of health  education  jealousy  crime rate  and so on  Then we have the desirability gap. How do we get people to think differently about what we really want  You see  the Rawls definition  the Rawls way of looking at the world  the blind tasting approach  takes our selfish motivation out of the picture. How do we implement that to a higher degree on a more extensive scale  And finally  we also have an action gap. How do we take these things and actually do something about it  I think part of the answer is to think about people like young kids and babies that don't have much agency  because people seem to be more willing to do this. To summarize  I would say  next time you go to drink beer or wine  first of all  think about  what is it in your experience that is real  and what is it in your experience that is a placebo effect coming from expectations  And then think about what it also means for other decisions in your life  and hopefully also for policy questions that affect all of us. Thanks a lot. I'd like to take you on the epic quest of the Rosetta spacecraft. To escort and land the probe on a comet  this has been my passion for the past two years. In order to do that  I need to explain to you something about the origin of the solar system. When we go back four and a half billion years  there was a cloud of gas and dust. In the center of this cloud  our sun formed and ignited. Along with that  what we now know as planets  comets and asteroids formed. What then happened  according to theory  is that when the Earth had cooled down a bit after its formation  comets massively impacted the Earth and delivered water to Earth. They probably also delivered complex organic material to Earth  and that may have bootstrapped the emergence of life. You can compare this to having to solve a     piece puzzle and not a       piece puzzle. Afterwards  the big planets like Jupiter and Saturn  they were not in their place where they are now  and they interacted gravitationally  and they swept the whole interior of the solar system clean  and what we now know as comets ended up in something called the Kuiper Belt  which is a belt of objects beyond the orbit of Neptune. And sometimes these objects run into each other  and they gravitationally deflect  and then the gravity of Jupiter pulls them back into the solar system. And they then become the comets as we see them in the sky. The important thing here to note is that in the meantime  the four and a half billion years  these comets have been sitting on the outside of the solar system  and haven't changed    deep  frozen versions of our solar system. In the sky  they look like this. We know them for their tails. There are actually two tails. One is a dust tail  which is blown away by the solar wind. The other one is an ion tail  which is charged particles  and they follow the magnetic field in the solar system. There's the coma  and then there is the nucleus  which here is too small to see  and you have to remember that in the case of Rosetta  the spacecraft is in that center pixel. We are only            kilometers away from the comet. So what's important to remember  Comets contain the original material from which our solar system was formed  so they're ideal to study the components that were present at the time  when Earth  and life  started. Comets are also suspected of having brought the elements which may have bootstrapped life. In       ESA set up its long term Horizon      program  which contained one cornerstone  which would be a mission to a comet. In parallel  a small mission to a comet  what you see here  Giotto  was launched  and in       flew by the comet of Halley with an armada of other spacecraft. From the results of that mission  it became immediately clear that comets were ideal bodies to study to understand our solar system. And thus  the Rosetta mission was approved in       and originally it was supposed to be launched in       but a problem arose with an Ariane rocket. However  our P.R. department  in its enthusiasm  had already made       Delft Blue plates with the name of the wrong comets. So I've never had to buy any china since. That's the positive part. Once the whole problem was solved  we left Earth in      to the newly selected comet  Churyumov Gerasimenko. This comet had to be specially selected because A  you have to be able to get to it  and B  it shouldn't have been in the solar system too long. This particular comet has been  in the solar system since     . That's the first time when it was deflected by Jupiter  and it got close enough to the sun to start changing. So it's a very fresh comet. Rosetta made a few historic firsts. It's the first satellite to orbit a comet  and to escort it throughout its whole tour through the solar system    closest approach to the sun  as we will see in August  and then away again to the exterior. It's the first ever landing on a comet. We actually orbit the comet using something which is not normally done with spacecraft. Normally  you look at the sky and you know where you point and where you are. In this case  that's not enough. We navigated by looking at landmarks on the comet. We recognized features    boulders  craters    and that's how we know where we are respective to the comet. And  of course  it's the first satellite to go beyond the orbit of Jupiter on solar cells. Now  this sounds more heroic than it actually is  because the technology to use radio isotope thermal generators wasn't available in Europe at that time  so there was no choice. But these solar arrays are big. This is one wing  and these are not specially selected small people. They're just like you and me. We have two of these wings     square meters. Now later on  of course  when we got to the comet  you find out that    square meters of sail close to a body which is outgassing is not always a very handy choice. Now  how did we get to the comet  Because we had to go there for the Rosetta scientific objectives very far away    four times the distance of the Earth to the sun    and also at a much higher velocity than we could achieve with fuel  because we'd have to take six times as much fuel as the whole spacecraft weighed. So what do you do  You use gravitational flybys  slingshots  where you pass by a planet at very low altitude  a few thousand kilometers  and then you get the velocity of that planet around the sun for free. We did that a few times. We did Earth  we did Mars  we did twice Earth again  and we also flew by two asteroids  Lutetia and Steins. Then in       we got so far from the sun that if the spacecraft got into trouble  we couldn't actually save the spacecraft anymore  so we went into hibernation. Everything was switched off except for one clock. Here you see in white the trajectory  and the way this works. You see that from the circle where we started  the white line  actually you get more and more and more elliptical  and then finally we approached the comet in May       and we had to start doing the rendezvous maneuvers. On the way there  we flew by Earth and we took a few pictures to test our cameras. This is the moon rising over Earth  and this is what we now call a selfie  which at that time  by the way  that word didn't exist.  Laughter  It's at Mars. It was taken by the CIVA camera. That's one of the cameras on the lander  and it just looks under the solar arrays  and you see the planet Mars and the solar array in the distance. Now  when we got out of hibernation in January       we started arriving at a distance of two million kilometers from the comet in May. However  the velocity the spacecraft had was much too fast. We were going       kilometers an hour faster than the comet  so we had to brake. We had to do eight maneuvers  and you see here  some of them were really big. We had to brake the first one by a few hundred kilometers per hour  and actually  the duration of that was seven hours  and it used     kilos of fuel  and those were seven nerve wracking  hours  because in       there was a leak in the system of the propulsion of Rosetta  and we had to close off a branch  so the system was actually operating at a pressure which it was never designed or qualified for. Then we got in the vicinity of the comet  and these were the first pictures we saw. The true comet rotation period is    and a half hours  so this is accelerated  but you will understand that our flight dynamics engineers thought  this is not going to be an easy thing to land on. We had hoped for some kind of spud like thing where you could easily land. But we had one hope  maybe it was smooth. No. That didn't work either.  Laughter  So at that point in time  it was clearly unavoidable  we had to map this body in all the detail you could get  because we had to find an area which is     meters in diameter and flat. Why     meters  That's the error we have on landing the probe. So we went through this process  and we mapped the comet. We used a technique called photoclinometry. You use shadows thrown by the sun. What you see here is a rock sitting on the surface of the comet  and the sun shines from above. From the shadow  we  with our brain  can immediately determine roughly what the shape of that rock is. You can program that in a computer  you then cover the whole comet  and you can map the comet. For that  we flew special trajectories starting in August. First  a triangle of     kilometers on a side at     kilometers' distance  and we repeated the whole  thing at    kilometers. At that time  we had seen the comet at all kinds of angles  and we could use this technique to map the whole thing. Now  this led to a selection of landing sites. This whole process we had to do  to go from the mapping of the comet to actually finding the final landing site  was    days. We didn't have more. To give you an idea  the average Mars mission takes hundreds of scientists for years to meet about where shall we go  We had    days  and that was it. We finally selected the final landing site and the commands were prepared for Rosetta to launch Philae. The way this works is that Rosetta has to be at the right point in space  and aiming towards the comet  because the lander is passive. The lander is then pushed out and moves towards the comet. Rosetta had to turn around to get its cameras to actually look at Philae while it was departing and to be able to communicate with it. Now  the landing duration of the whole trajectory was seven hours. Now do a simple calculation  if the velocity of Rosetta is off by one centimeter per second  seven hours is        seconds. That means     meters wrong on the comet. So we had to know the velocity of Rosetta much better than one centimeter per second  and its location in space better than     meters at     million kilometers from Earth. That's no mean feat. Let me quickly take you through some of the science and the instruments. I won't bore you with all the details of all the instruments  but it's got everything. We can sniff gas  we can measure dust particles  the shape of them  the composition  there are magnetometers  everything. This is one of the results from an instrument which measures gas density at the position of Rosetta  so it's gas which has left the comet. The bottom graph is September of last year. There is a long term variation  which in itself is not surprising  but you see the sharp peaks. This is a comet day. You can see the effect of the sun on the evaporation of gas and the fact that the comet is rotating. So there is one spot  apparently  where there is a lot of stuff coming from  it gets heated in the Sun  and then cools down on the back side. And we can see the density variations of this. These are the gases and the organic compounds that we already have measured. You will see it's an impressive list  and there is much  much  much more to come  because there are more measurements. Actually  there is a conference going on in Houston at the moment where many of these results are presented. Also  we measured dust particles. Now  for you  this will not look very impressive  but the scientists were thrilled when they saw this. Two dust particles  the right one they call Boris  and they shot it with tantalum in order to be able to analyze it. Now  we found sodium and magnesium. What this tells you is this is the concentration of these two materials at the time the solar system was formed  so we learned things about which materials were there when the planet was made. Of course  one of the important elements is the imaging. This is one of the cameras of Rosetta  the OSIRIS camera  and this actually was the cover of Science magazine on January    of this year. Nobody had expected this body to look like this. Boulders  rocks    if anything  it looks more like the Half Dome in Yosemite than anything else. We also saw things like this  dunes  and what look to be  on the righthand side  wind blown shadows. Now we know these from Mars  but this comet doesn't have an atmosphere  so it's a bit difficult to create a wind blown shadow. It may be local outgassing  stuff which goes up and comes back. We don't know  so there is a lot to investigate. Here  you see the same image twice. On the left hand side  you see in the middle a pit. On the right hand side  if you carefully look  there are three jets coming out of the bottom of that pit. So this is the activity of the comet. Apparently  at the bottom of these pits is where the active regions are  and where the material evaporates into space. There is a very intriguing crack in the neck of the comet. You see it on the right hand side. It's a kilometer long  and it's two and a half meters wide. Some people suggest that actually  when we get close to the sun  the comet may split in two  and then we'll have to choose  which comet do we go for  The lander    again  lots of instruments  mostly comparable except for the things which hammer in the ground and drill  etc. But much the same as Rosetta  and that is because you want to compare what you find in space with what you find on the comet. These are called ground truth measurements. These are the landing descent images that were taken by the OSIRIS camera. You see the lander getting further and further away from Rosetta. On the top right  you see an image taken at    meters by the lander     meters above the surface of the comet. The boulder there is some    meters. So this is one of the last images we took before we landed on the comet. Here  you see the whole sequence again  but from a different perspective  and you see three blown ups from the bottom left to the middle of the lander traveling over the surface of the comet. Then  at the top  there is a before and an after image of the landing. The only problem with the after image is  there is no lander. But if you carefully look at the right hand side of this image  we saw the lander still there   but it had bounced. It had departed again. Now  on a bit of a comical note here is that originally Rosetta was designed to have a lander which would bounce. That was discarded because it was way too expensive. Now  we forgot  but the lander knew. During the first bounce  in the magnetometers  you see here the data from them  from the three axes  x  y and z. Halfway through  you see a red line. At that red line  there is a change. What happened  apparently  is during the first bounce  somewhere  we hit the edge of a crater with one of the legs of the lander  and the rotation velocity of the lander changed. So we've been rather lucky that we are where we are. This is one of the iconic images of Rosetta. It's a man made object  a leg of the lander  standing on a comet. This  for me  is one of the very best images of space science I have ever seen. One of the things we still have to do is to actually find the lander. The blue area here is where we know it must be. We haven't been able to find it yet  but the search is continuing  as are our efforts to start getting the lander to work again. We listen every day  and we hope that between now and somewhere in April  the lander will wake up again. The findings of what we found on the comet  This thing would float in water. It's half the density of water. So it looks like a very big rock  but it's not. The activity increase we saw in June  July  August last year was a four fold activity increase. By the time we will be at the sun  there will be     kilos a second leaving this comet  gas  dust  whatever. That's     million kilos a day. Then  finally  the landing day. I will never forget    absolute madness      TV crews in Germany. The BBC was interviewing me  and another TV crew who was following me all day were filming me being interviewed  and it went on like that for the whole day. The Discovery Channel crew actually caught me when leaving the control room  and they asked the right question  and man  I got into tears  and I still feel this. For a month and a half  I couldn't think about landing day without crying  and I still have the emotion in me. With this image of the comet  I would like to leave you. Thank you. I am a Hazara  and the homeland of my people is Afghanistan. Like hundreds of thousands of other Hazara kids  I was born in exile. The ongoing persecution and operation against the Hazaras forced my parents to leave Afghanistan. This persecution has had a long history going back to the late     s  and the rule of King Abdur Rahman. He killed    percent of  the Hazara population. He built minarets with their heads. Many Hazaras were sold into slavery  and many others fled the country for neighboring Iran and Pakistan. My parents also fled to Pakistan  and settled in Quetta  where I was born. After the September    attack on the Twin Towers  I got a chance to go to Afghanistan for the first time  with foreign journalists. I was only     and I got a job working as an interpreter. After four years  I felt it was safe enough to move to Afghanistan permanently  and I was working there as a documentary photographer  and I worked on many stories. One of the most important stories that I did was the dancing boys of Afghanistan. It is a tragic story about an appalling tradition. It involves young kids dancing for warlords and powerful men in the society. These boys are often abducted or bought from their poor parents  and they are put to work as sex slaves. This is Shukur. He was kidnapped from Kabul by a warlord. He was taken to another province  where he was forced to work as a sex slave for the warlord and his friends. When this story was published in the Washington Post  I started receiving death threats  and I was forced to leave Afghanistan  as my parents were. Along with my family  I returned back to Quetta. The situation in Quetta had changed dramatically since I left in     . Once a peaceful haven for the Hazaras  it had now turned into the most dangerous city in Pakistan. Hazaras are confined into two small areas  and they are marginalized socially  educationally  and financially. This is Nadir. I had known him since my childhood. He was injured when his van was ambushed by terrorists in Quetta. He later died of his injuries. Around       Hazara members had been killed in various attacks  and around       of them were injured  and many of them permanently disabled. The attacks on the Hazara community would only get worse  so it was not surprising that many wanted to flee. After Afghanistan  Iran  Pakistan  Australia is home to the fourth largest population of Hazaras in the world. When it came time to leave Pakistan  Australia seemed the obvious choice. Financially  only one of us could leave  and it was decided that I would go  in the hope that if I arrived at my destination safely  I could work to get the rest of my family to join me later. We all knew about the risks  and how terrifying the journey is  and I met many people who lost loved ones at sea. It was a desperate decision to take  to leave everything behind  and no one makes this decision easily. If I had been able to simply fly to Australia  it would have taken me less than    hours. But getting a visa was impossible. My journey was much longer  much more complicated  and certainly more dangerous  traveling to Thailand by air  and then by road and boat to Malaysia and into Indonesia  paying people and smugglers all the way and spending a lot of time hiding and a lot of time in fear of being caught. In Indonesia  I joined a group of seven asylum seekers. We all shared a bedroom in a town outside of Jakarta called Bogor. After spending a week in Bogor  three of my roommates left for the perilous journey  and we got the news two days later that a distressed boat sank in the sea en route to Christmas Island. We found out that our three roommates    Nawroz  Jaffar and Shabbir    were also among those. Only Jaffar was rescued. Shabbir and Nawroz were never seen again. It made me think  am I doing the right thing  I concluded I really had no other choice but to go on. A few weeks later  we got the call from the people smuggler to alert us that the boat is ready for us to commence our sea journey. Taken in the night towards the main vessel on a motorboat  we boarded an old fishing boat that was already overloaded. There were    of us  and we were all below deck. No one was allowed up on the top. We all paid       dollars each for this part of the trip. The first night and day went smoothly  but by the second night   the weather turned. Waves tossed the boat around  and the timbers groaned. People below deck were crying  praying  recalling their loved ones. They were screaming. It was a terrible moment. It was like a scene from doomsday  or maybe like one of those scenes from those Hollywood movies that shows that everything is breaking apart and the world is just ending. It was happening to us for real. We didn't have any hope. Our boat was floating like a matchbox on the water without any control. The waves were much higher than our boat  and the water poured in faster than the motor pumps could take it out. We all lost hope. We thought  this is the end. We were watching our deaths  and I was documenting it. The captain told us that we are not going to make it  we have to turn back the boat. We went on the deck and turned our torches on and off to attract the attention of any passing boat. We kept trying to attract their attention by waving our life jackets and whistling. Eventually  we made it to a small island. Our boat crashing onto the rocks  I slipped into the water and destroyed my camera  whatever I had documented. But luckily  the memory card survived. It was a thick forest. We all split up into many groups as we argued over what to do next. We were all scared and confused. Then  after spending the night on the beach  we found a jetty and coconuts. We hailed a boat from a nearby resort  and then were quickly handed over to Indonesian water police. At Serang Detention Center  an immigration officer came and furtively strip searched us. He took our mobile  my      cash  our shoes that we should not be able to escape  but we kept watching the guards  checking their movements  and around   a.m. when they sat around a fire  we removed two glass layers from an outside facing window and slipped through. We climbed a tree next to an outer wall that was topped with the shards of glass. We put the pillow on that and wrapped our forearms with bedsheets and climbed the wall  and we ran away with bare feet. I was free  with an uncertain future  no money. The only thing I had was the memory card with the pictures and footage. When my documentary was aired on SBS Dateline  many of my friends came to know about my situation  and they tried to help me. They did not allow me to take any other boat to risk my life. I also decided to stay in Indonesia and process my case through UNHCR  but I was really afraid that I would end up in Indonesia for many years doing nothing and unable to work  like every other asylum seeker. But it had happened to be a little bit different with me. I was lucky. My contacts worked to expedite my case through UNHCR  and I got resettled in Australia in May     . Not every asylum seeker is lucky like me. It is really difficult to live a life with an uncertain fate  in limbo. The issue of asylum seekers in Australia has been so extremely politicized that it has lost its human face. The asylum seekers have been demonized and then presented to the people. I hope my story and the story of other Hazaras could shed some light to show the people how these people are suffering in their countries of origin  and how they suffer  why they risk their lives to seek asylum. Thank you. Today  I am going to talk about anger. When I was     seeing some of my friends  leaving the school because their parents  could not afford textbooks made me angry. When I was     hearing the plight of a desperate slave father whose daughter was  about to be sold to a brothel made me angry. At the age of     lying on the street  in a pool of blood  along with my own son  made me angry. Dear friends  for centuries we were taught anger is bad. Our parents  teachers  priests    everyone taught us how to control  and suppress our anger. But I ask why  Why can't we convert our anger for the larger good of society  Why can't we use our anger to challenge and change the evils of the world  That I tried to do. Friends  most of the brightest ideas came to my mind out of anger. Like when I was    and sat  in a locked up  tiny prison. The whole night  I was angry. But it has given birth to a new idea. But I will come to that later on. Let me begin with the story of how I got a name for myself. I had been a big admirer  of Mahatma Gandhi since my childhood. Gandhi fought and lead  India's freedom movement. But more importantly  he taught us how to treat  the most vulnerable sections  the most deprived people   with dignity and respect. And so  when India was celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's  birth centenary in         at that time I was       an idea came to my mind. Why can't we celebrate it differently  I knew  as perhaps many of you might know  that in India  a large number of people are born in the lowest segment of caste. And they are treated as untouchables. These are the people    forget about allowing them  to go to the temples  they cannot even go into the houses  and shops of high caste people. So I was very impressed with  the leaders of my town who were speaking very highly against the caste system and untouchability and talking of Gandhian ideals. So inspired by that  I thought  let us set an example by inviting these people to eat food cooked and served by the untouchable community. I went to some low caste  so called untouchable  people  tried to convince them  but it was unthinkable for them. They told me   No  no. It's not possible. It never happened.  I said   Look at these leaders  they are so great   they are against untouchability. They will come. If nobody comes   we can set an example.  These people thought that I was too naive. Finally  they were convinced. My friends and I took our bicycles and invited political leaders. And I was so thrilled  rather  empowered to see that each one of them  agreed to come. I thought   Great idea. We can set an example. We can bring about change in the society.  The day has come. All these untouchables  three women and two men  they agreed to come. I could recall that they had used  the best of their clothes. They brought new utensils. They had taken baths  hundreds of times because it was unthinkable for them to do. It was the moment of change. They gathered. Food was cooked. It was   o'clock. By   o'clock  we kept on waiting  because it's not very uncommon  that the leaders become late  for an hour or so. So after   o'clock  we took our bicycles and went to these leaders' homes  just to remind them. One of the leader's wives told me   Sorry  he is having some headache  perhaps he cannot come.  I went to another leader and his wife told me    Okay  you go  he will definitely join.  So I thought that the dinner will take place  though not at that large a scale. I went back to the venue  which was a newly built Mahatma Gandhi Park. It was    o'clock. None of the leaders showed up. That made me angry. I was standing  leaning against Mahatma Gandhi's statue. I was emotionally drained  rather exhausted. Then I sat down where  the food was lying. I kept my emotions on hold. But then  when I took the first bite  I broke down in tears. And suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder. And it was the healing  motherly touch  of an untouchable woman. And she told me   Kailash  why are you crying  You have done your bit. You have eaten the food cooked by untouchables  which has never happened in our memory.  She said   You won today.  And my friends  she was right. I came back home  a little after midnight  shocked to see that several  high caste elderly people were sitting in my courtyard. I saw my mother and  elderly women were crying and they were pleading  to these elderly people because they had threatened  to outcaste my whole family. And you know  outcasting the family is the biggest social punishment one can think of. Somehow they agreed to punish only me  and the punishment was purification. That means I had to go     miles away from my hometown to the River Ganges to take a holy dip. And after that  I should organize a feast for priests      priests  wash their feet and drink that water. It was total nonsense  and I refused to accept that punishment. How did they punish me  I was barred from entering into my own  kitchen and my own dining room  my utensils were separated. But the night when I was angry  they wanted to outcaste me. But I decided to outcaste  the entire caste system. And that was possible because the beginning would have been to change the family name  or surname  because in India  most of the family names are caste names. So I decided to drop my name. And then  later on  I gave  a new name to myself  Satyarthi  that means   seeker of truth.  And that was the beginning  of my transformative anger. Friends  maybe one of you can tell me  what was I doing before becoming a children's rights activist  Does anybody know  No. I was an engineer  an electrical engineer. And then I learned how the energy of burning fire  coal  the nuclear blast inside the chambers  raging river currents  fierce winds  could be converted into the light  and lives of millions. I also learned how the most uncontrollable form of energy could be harnessed for good  and making society better. So I'll come back to the story of when I was caught in the prison  I was very happy freeing  a dozen children from slavery  handing them over to their parents. I cannot explain my joy  when I free a child. I was so happy. But when I was waiting for my train to come back to my hometown  Delhi  I saw that dozens of children  were arriving  they were being trafficked by someone. I stopped them  those people. I complained to the police. So the policemen  instead of helping me  they threw me in this small   tiny shell  like an animal. And that was the night of anger when one of the brightest  and biggest ideas was born. I thought that if I keep on freeing     children  and    more will join  that's not done. And I believed in the power of consumers  and let me tell you that this was the first time when a campaign was launched by me or anywhere in the world  to educate and sensitize the consumers to create a demand for child labor free rugs. In Europe and America   we have been successful. And it has resulted  in a fall in child labor in South Asian countries by    percent. Not only that  but this first ever  consumer's power  or consumer's campaign has grown in other countries and other industries  maybe chocolate  maybe apparel   maybe shoes    it has gone beyond. My anger at the age of     when I realized how important education is for every child  I got an idea to collect used books and help the poorest children. I created a book bank at the age of   . But I did not stop. Later on  I cofounded the world's single largest civil society campaign for education that is the Global Campaign for Education. That has helped in changing  the whole thinking towards education from the charity mode to the human rights mode  and that has concretely helped  the reduction of out of school children by half in the last    years. My anger at the age of     to free that girl who was about to be sold to a brothel  has given me an idea to go for a new strategy of raid and rescue  freeing children from slavery. And I am so lucky and proud to say that it is not one or    or     but my colleagues and I have been able to physically liberate        child slaves and hand them over back to their families and mothers. I knew that we needed global policies. We organized the worldwide marches against child labor and that has also resulted in  a new international convention to protect the children who are in the worst forms. And the concrete result was that the number of child laborers globally has gone down by one third  in the last    years. So  in each case  it began from anger  turned into an idea  and action. So anger  what next  Idea  and    Audience  Action Kailash Satyarthi  Anger  idea  action. Which I tried to do. Anger is a power  anger is an energy  and the law of nature is that energy can never be created and never  be vanished  can never be destroyed. So why can't the energy of anger be translated and harnessed to create a better and beautiful world  a more just and equitable world  Anger is within each one of you  and I will share a secret for a few seconds  that if we are confined in  the narrow shells of egos  and the circles of selfishness  then the anger will turn out to be hatred  violence  revenge  destruction. But if we are able to break the circles  then the same anger could turn  into a great power. We can break the circles  by using our inherent compassion and connect with the world through  compassion to make this world better. That same anger could be transformed into it. So dear friends  sisters and brothers  again  as a Nobel Laureate  I am urging you to become angry. I am urging you to become angry. And the angriest among us is the one who can transform his anger  into idea and action. Thank you so much. Chris Anderson  For many years   you've been an inspiration to others. Who or what inspires you and why  KS  Good question. Chris  let me tell you   and that is the truth  each time when I free a child  the child who has lost all his hope that he will ever come back to his mother  the first smile of freedom  and the mother who has lost all hope that the son or daughter  can ever come back and sit in her lap  they become so emotional and the first tear of joy  rolls down on her cheek  I see the glimpse of God in it    this is my biggest inspiration. And I am so lucky that not once  as I said before  but thousands of times  I have been able to witness my God in the faces of those children and they are my biggest inspirations. Thank you. This is a kindergarten we designed in     . We made this kindergarten  to be a circle. It's a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof. If you are a parent  you know that kids love to keep making circles. This is how the rooftop looks. And why did we design this  The principal of this kindergarten said   No  I don't want a handrail.  I said   It's impossible.  But he insisted   How about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof  So that it can catch the children falling off   I said   It's impossible.  And of course  the government official said   Of course you have to have a handrail.  But we could keep  that idea around the trees. There are three trees popping through. And we were allowed to call  this rope as a handrail. But of course  rope has nothing to do with them. They fall into the net. And you get more  and more  more. Sometimes    children  are around a tree. The boy on the branch  he loves the tree so he is eating the tree. And at the time of an event  they sit on the edge. It looks so nice from underneath. Monkeys in the zoo. Feeding time. And we made the roof as low as possible  because we wanted to see children on top of the roof  not only underneath the roof. And if the roof is too high  you see only the ceiling. And the leg washing place    there are many kinds of water taps. You see with the flexible tubes  you want to spray water to your friends  and the shower  and the one in front is quite normal. But if you look at this  the boy is not washing his boots  he's putting water into his boots. This kindergarten is completely open  most of the year. And there is no boundary between inside and outside. So it means basically this architecture is a roof. And also there is no boundary between classrooms. So there is no acoustic barrier at all. When you put many children in a quiet box  some of them get really nervous. But in this kindergarten  there is no reason they get nervous. Because there is no boundary. And the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn't want to stay in the room  we let him go. He will come back eventually  because it's a circle  it comes back. But the point is  in that kind of occasion  usually children try to hide somewhere. But here  just they leave and come back. It's a natural process. And secondly  we consider noise very important. You know that children sleep better in noise. They don't sleep in a quiet space. And in this kindergarten  these children show amazing concentration in class. And you know  our kind grew up in the jungle with noise. They need noise. And you know  you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar. You are not supposed to be in silence. And you know  these days we are trying to make everything under control. You know  it's completely open. And you should know that we can go skiing in     degrees in winter. In summer you go swimming. The sand is    degrees. And also  you should know that you are waterproof. You never melt in rain. So  children are supposed to be outside. So that is how we should treat them. This is how they divide classrooms. They are supposed to help teachers. They don't. I didn't put him in. A classroom. And a washbasin. They talk to each other around the well. And there are always  some trees in the classroom. A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above. Monkeys. And each classroom has at least one skylight. And this is where Santa Claus comes down at the time of Christmas. This is the annex building  right next to that oval shaped kindergarten. The building is only five meters tall with seven floors. And of course  the ceiling height is very low. So you have to consider safety. So  we put our children  a daughter and a son. They tried to go in. He hit his head. He's okay. His skull is quite strong. He is resilient. It's my son. And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off. And then we put other children. The traffic jam is awful in Tokyo  as you know. The driver in front  she needs to learn how to drive. Now these days  kids need a small dosage of danger. And in this kind of occasion  they learn to help each other. This is society. This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days. Now  this drawing is showing the movement of a boy between      and     . And the circumference of this building is     meters. So it's not exactly small at all. And this boy did       meters in the morning. But the surprise is yet to come. The children in this kindergarten do       meters on average. And these children have the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens. The principal says   I don't train them. We leave them on top of the roof. Just like sheep.  They keep running. My point is don't control them  don't protect them too much  and they need to tumble sometimes. They need to get some injury. And that makes them learn how to live in this world. I think architecture is capable of changing this world  and people's lives. And this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children. Thank you very much. This is a story about capitalism. It's a system I love because of the successes and opportunities it's afforded me and millions of others. I started in my   s trading commodities  cotton in particular  in the pits  and if there was ever a free market free for all  this was it  where men wearing ties  but acting like gladiators fought literally  and physically for a profit. Fortunately  I was good enough that by the time I was     I was able to move into the upstairs  world of money management  where I spent the next three decades as a global macro trader. And over that time  I've seen a lot of crazy things in the markets  and I've traded a lot of crazy manias. And unfortunately  I'm sad to report that right now  we might be in the grips of one of the most disastrous  certainly of my career  and one consistent takeaway is manias never end well. Now  over the past    years  we as a society have come to view our companies and corporations in a very narrow  almost monomaniacal fashion with regard to how we value them  and we have put so much emphasis on profits  on short term quarterly earnings and share prices  at the exclusion of all else. It's like we've ripped the humanity out of our companies. Now  we don't do that    conveniently reduce something to a set of numbers that you can play with like Lego toys    we don't do that in our individual life. We don't treat somebody or value them based on their monthly income  or their credit score  but we have this double standard when it comes to the way that we value our businesses  and you know what  It's threatening the very underpinnings of our society. And here's how you'll see. This chart is corporate profit margins going back    years as a percentage of revenues  and you can see that we're at a    year high of   .  percent. Now  hooray if you're a shareholder  but if you're the other side of that  and you're the average American worker  then you can see it's not such a good thing.   U.S. Share of Income Going to Labor vs. CEO to Worker Compensation Ratio   Now  higher profit margins do not increase societal wealth. What they actually do is they exacerbate income inequality  and that's not a good thing. But intuitively  that makes sense  right  Because if the top    percent of American families own    percent of the stocks  as they take a greater share of corporate profits  then there's less wealth left for the rest of society. Again  income inequality is not a good thing. This next chart  made by The Equality Trust  shows    countries from Austria to Japan to New Zealand. On the horizontal axis is income inequality. The further to the right you go  the greater the income inequality. On the vertical axis are nine social and health metrics. The more you go up that  the worse the problems are  and those metrics include life expectancy  teenage pregnancy  literacy  social mobility  just to name a few. Now  those of you in the audience who are Americans may wonder  well  where does the United States rank  Where does it lie on that chart  And guess what  We're literally off the chart. Yes  that's us  with the greatest income inequality and the greatest social problems  according to those metrics. Now  here's a macro forecast that's easy to make  and that's  that gap between the wealthiest and the poorest  it will get closed. History always does it. It typically happens in one of three ways  either through revolution  higher taxes  or wars. None of those are on my bucket list. Now  there's another way to do it  and that's by increasing justness in corporate behavior  but the way that we're operating right now  that would require a tremendous change in behavior  and like an addict trying to kick a habit  the first step is to acknowledge that you have a problem. And let me just say  this profits mania that we're on is so deeply entrenched that we don't even realize how we're harming society. Here's a small but startling example of exactly how we're doing that  this chart shows corporate giving as a percentage of profits   not revenues  over the last    years. Juxtapose that to the earlier chart of corporate profit margins  and I ask you  does that feel right  In all fairness  when I started writing this  I thought   Oh wow  what does my company  what does Tudor do   And I realized we give one percent of corporate profits to charity every year. And I'm supposed to be a philanthropist. When I realized that  I literally wanted to throw up. But the point is  this mania is so deeply entrenched that well intentioned people like myself don't even realize that we're part of it. Now  we're not going to change corporate behavior by simply increasing corporate philanthropy or charitable contributions. And oh  by the way  we've since quadrupled that  but     Applause     Please. But we can do it by driving more just behavior. And one way to do it is actually trusting the system that got us here in the first place  and that's the free market system. About a year ago  some friends of mine and I started a not for profit called Just Capital. Its mission is very simple  to help companies and corporations learn how to operate in a more just fashion by using the public's input to define exactly what the criteria are for just corporate behavior. Now  right now  there's no widely accepted standard that a company or corporation can follow  and that's where Just Capital comes in  because beginning this year and every year we'll be conducting a nationwide survey of a representative sample of        Americans to find out exactly what they think are the criteria for justness in corporate behavior. Now  this is a model that's going to start in the United States but can be expanded anywhere around the globe  and maybe we'll find out that the most important thing for the public is that we create living wage jobs  or make healthy products  or help  not harm  the environment. At Just Capital  we don't know  and it's not for us to decide. We're but messengers  but we have     percent confidence  and faith in the American public to get it right. So we'll release the findings this September for the first time  and then next year  we'll poll again  and we'll take the additive step this time of ranking the       largest U.S. companies from number one to number       and everything in between. We're calling it the Just Index  and remember  we're an independent not for profit with no bias  and we will be giving the American public a voice. And maybe over time  we'll find out that as people come to know which companies are the most just  human and economic resources will be driven towards them  and they'll become the most prosperous and help our country be the most prosperous. Now  capitalism has been responsible for every major innovation that's made this world a more inspiring and wonderful place to live in. Capitalism has to be based on justice. It has to be  and now more than ever  with economic divisions growing wider every day. It's estimated that    percent of American workers can be displaced in the next    years. I'm not against progress. I want the driverless car and the jet pack just like everyone else. But I'm pleading for recognition that with increased wealth and profits has to come greater corporate social responsibility.  If justice is removed   said Adam Smith  the father of capitalism   the great  the immense fabric of human society must in a moment crumble into atoms.  Now  when I was young  and there was a problem  my mama used to always sigh and shake her head and say   Have mercy  have mercy.  Now's not the time for us  for the rest of us to show them mercy. The time is now for us to show them fairness  and we can do that  you and I  by starting where we work  in the businesses that we operate in. And when we put justness on par with profits  we'll get the most wonderful thing in all the world. We'll take back our humanity. Thank you. Well  you know  sometimes the most important things come in the smallest packages. I am going to try to convince you  in the    minutes I have  that microbes have a lot to say about questions such as   Are we alone   and they can tell us more about not only life in our solar system but also maybe beyond  and this is why I am tracking them down in the most impossible places on Earth  in extreme environments where conditions are really pushing them to the brink of survival. Actually  sometimes me too  when I'm trying to follow them too close. But here's the thing  We are the only advanced civilization in the solar system  but that doesn't mean that there is no microbial life nearby. In fact  the planets and moons you see here could host life    all of them    and we know that  and it's a strong possibility. And if we were going to find life on those moons and planets  then we would answer questions such as  are we alone in the solar system  Where are we coming from  Do we have family in the neighborhood  Is there life beyond our solar system  And we can ask all those questions because there has been a revolution in our understanding of what a habitable planet is  and today  a habitable planet is a planet that has a zone where water can stay stable  but to me this is a horizontal definition of habitability  because it involves a distance to a star  but there is another dimension to habitability  and this is a vertical dimension. Think of it as conditions in the subsurface of a planet where you are very far away from a sun  but you still have water  energy  nutrients  which for some of them means food  and a protection. And when you look at the Earth  very far away from any sunlight  deep in the ocean  you have life thriving and it uses only chemistry for life processes. So when you think of it  at that point  all walls collapse. You have no limitations  basically. And if you have been looking at the headlines lately  then you will see that we have discovered a subsurface ocean on Europa  on Ganymede  on Enceladus  on Titan  and now we are finding a geyser and hot springs on Enceladus  Our solar system is turning into a giant spa. For anybody who has gone to a spa knows how much microbes like that  right  So at that point  think also about Mars. There is no life possible at the surface of Mars today  but it might still be hiding underground. So  we have been making progress in our understanding of habitability  but we also have been making progress in our understanding of what the signatures of life are on Earth. And you can have what we call organic molecules  and these are the bricks of life  and you can have fossils  and you can minerals  biominerals  which is due to the reaction between bacteria and rocks  and of course you can have gases in the atmosphere. And when you look at those tiny green algae on the right of the slide here  they are the direct descendants of those who have been pumping oxygen a billion years ago in the atmosphere of the Earth. When they did that  they poisoned    percent of the life at the surface of the Earth  but they are the reason why you are breathing this air today. But as much as our understanding grows of all of these things  there is one question we still cannot answer  and this is  where are we coming from  And you know  it's getting worse  because we won't be able to find the physical evidence of where we are coming from on this planet  and the reason being is that anything that is older than four billion years is gone. All record is gone  erased by plate tectonics and erosion. This is what I call the Earth's biological horizon. Beyond this horizon we don't know where we are coming from. So is everything lost  Well  maybe not. And we might be able to find evidence of our own origin in the most unlikely place  and this place in Mars. How is this possible  Well clearly at the beginning of the solar system  Mars and the Earth were bombarded by giant asteroids and comets  and there were ejecta from these impacts all over the place. Earth and Mars kept throwing rocks at each other for a very long time. Pieces of rocks landed on the Earth. Pieces of the Earth landed on Mars. So clearly  those two planets may have been seeded by the same material. So yeah  maybe Granddady is sitting there on the surface and waiting for us. But that also means that we can go to Mars and try to find traces of our own origin. Mars may hold that secret for us. This is why Mars is so special to us. But for that to happen  Mars needed to be habitable at the time when conditions were right. So was Mars habitable  We have a number of missions telling us exactly the same thing today. At the time when life appeared on the Earth  Mars did have an ocean  it had volcanoes  it had lakes  and it had deltas like the beautiful picture you see here. This picture was sent by the Curiosity  rover only a few weeks ago. It shows the remnants of a delta  and this picture tells us something  water was abundant and stayed founting at the surface for a very long time. This is good news for life. Life chemistry takes a long time to actually happen. So this is extremely good news  but does that mean that if we go there  life will be easy to find on Mars  Not necessarily. Here's what happened  At the time when life exploded at the surface of the Earth  then everything went south for Mars  literally. The atmosphere was stripped away by solar winds  Mars lost its magnetosphere  and then cosmic rays and U.V. bombarded the surface and water escaped to space and went underground. So if we want to be able to understand  if we want to be able to find those traces of the signatures of life at the surface of Mars  if they are there  we need to understand what was the impact of each of these events on the preservation of its record. Only then will we be able to know where those signatures are hiding  and only then will we be able to send our rover to the right places where we can sample those rocks that may be telling us something really important about who we are  or  if not  maybe telling us that somewhere  independently  life has appeared on another planet. So to do that  it's easy. You only need to go back  .  billion years ago in the past of a planet. We just need a time machine. Easy  right  Well  actually  it is. Look around you    that's planet Earth. This is our time machine. Geologists are using it to go back in the past of our own planet. I am using it a little bit differently. I use planet Earth to go in very extreme environments where conditions were similar to those of Mars at the time when the climate changed  and there I'm trying  to understand what happened. What are the signatures of life  What is left  How are we going to find it  So for one moment now I'm going to take you with me on a trip into that time machine. And now  what you see here  we are at       meters in the Andes  but in fact we are less than a billion years after the Earth and Mars formed. The Earth and Mars will have looked pretty much exactly like that    volcanoes everywhere  evaporating lakes everywhere  minerals  hot springs  and then you see those mounds on the shore of those lakes  Those are built by the descendants of the first organisms that gave us the first fossil on Earth. But if we want to understand what's  going on  we need to go a little further. And the other thing about those sites is that exactly like on Mars three and a half billion years ago  the climate is changing very fast  and water and ice are disappearing. But we need to go back to that time when everything changed on Mars  and to do that  we need to go higher. Why is that  Because when you go higher  the atmosphere is getting thinner  it's getting more unstable  the temperature is getting cooler  and you have a lot more U.V. radiation. Basically  you are getting to those conditions on Mars when everything changed. So I was not promising anything about a leisurely trip on the time machine. You are not going to be sitting in that time machine. You have to haul       pounds of equipment to the summit of this        foot volcano in the Andes here. That's about       meters. And you also have to sleep on    degree slopes and really hope that there won't be any earthquake that night. But when we get to the summit  we actually find the lake we came for. At this altitude  this lake is experiencing exactly the same conditions as those on Mars three and a half billion years ago. And now we have to change our voyage into an inner voyage inside that lake  and to do that  we have to remove our mountain gear and actually don suits and go for it. But at the time we enter that lake  at the very moment we enter that lake  we are stepping back three and a half billion years in the past of another planet  and then we are going to get the answer came for. Life is everywhere  absolutely everywhere. Everything you see in this picture is a living organism. Maybe not so the diver  but everything else. But this picture is very deceiving. Life is abundant in those lakes  but like in many places on Earth  right now and due to climate change  there is a huge loss in biodiversity. In the samples that we took back home     percent of the bacteria in those lakes were composed of three species  and those three species are the ones that have survived so far. Here's another lake  right next to the first one. The red color you see here is not due to minerals. It's actually due to the presence of a tiny algae. In this region  the U.V. radiation is really nasty. Anywhere on Earth     is considered to be extreme. During U.V. storms there  the U.V. Index reaches   . SPF    is not going to do anything  to you over there  and the water is so transparent in those lakes that the algae has nowhere to hide  really  and so they are developing their own sunscreen  and this is the red color you see. But they can adapt only so far  and then when all the water is gone from the surface  microbes have only one solution left  They go underground. And those microbes  the rocks you see in that slide here  well  they are actually living inside rocks and they are using the protection of the translucence of the rocks to get the good part of the U.V. and discard the part that could actually damage their DNA. And this is why we are taking our rover to train them to search  for life on Mars in these areas  because if there was life on Mars three and a half billion years ago  it had to use the same strategy to actually protect itself. Now  it is pretty obvious that going to extreme environments is helping us very much for the exploration of Mars  and to prepare missions. So far  it has helped us to understand the geology of Mars. It has helped to understand the past climate of Mars and its evolution  but also its habitability potential. Our most recent rover on Mars has discovered traces of organics. Yeah  there are organics at the surface of Mars. And it also discovered traces of methane. And we don't know yet if the methane in question is really from geology or biology. Regardless  what we know is that because of the discovery  the hypothesis that there is still life present on Mars today remains a viable one. So by now  I think I have convinced you that Mars is very special to us  but it would be a mistake to think that Mars is the only place in the solar system that is interesting to find potential microbial life. And the reason is because Mars and the Earth could have a common root to their tree of life  but when you go beyond Mars  it's not that easy. Celestial mechanics  is not making it so easy for an exchange of material between planets  and so if we were to discover life on those planets  it would be different from us. It would be a different type of life. But in the end  it might be just us  it might be us and Mars  or it can be many trees of life in the solar system. I don't know the answer yet  but I can tell you something  No matter what the result is  no matter what that magic number is  it is going to give us a standard by which we are going to be able  to measure the life potential  abundance and diversity beyond our own solar system. And this can be achieved by our generation. This can be our legacy  but only if we dare to explore. Now  finally  if somebody tells you that looking  for alien microbes is not cool because you cannot have a philosophical conversation with them  let me show you why and how you can tell them they're wrong. Well  organic material is going to tell you about environment  about complexity and about diversity. DNA  or any information carrier  is going to tell you about adaptation  about evolution  about survival  about planetary changes and about the transfer of information. All together  they are telling us what started as a microbial pathway  and why what started as a microbial pathway sometimes ends up as a civilization or sometimes ends up as a dead end. Look at the solar system  and look at the Earth. On Earth  there are many intelligent species  but only one has achieved technology. Right here in the journey of our own solar system  there is a very  very powerful message that says here's how we should look  for alien life  small and big. So yeah  microbes are talking and we are listening  and they are taking us  one planet at a time and one moon at a time  towards their big brothers out there. And they are telling us about diversity  they are telling us about abundance of life  and they are telling us how this life has survived thus far to reach civilization  intelligence  technology and  indeed  philosophy. Thank you. To be honest  by personality  I'm just not much of a crier. But I think in my career that's been a good thing. I'm a civil rights lawyer  and I've seen some  horrible things in the world. I began my career working  police abuse cases in the United States. And then in       I was sent to Rwanda to be the director of the U.N.'s  genocide investigation. It turns out that tears  just aren't much help when you're trying  to investigate a genocide. The things I had to see   and feel and touch were pretty unspeakable. What I can tell you is this  that the Rwandan genocide was one of the world's greatest failures of simple compassion. That word  compassion  actually  comes from two Latin words  cum passio  which simply mean   to suffer with.  And the things that I saw and experienced in Rwanda as I got up close to human suffering  it did  in moments  move me to tears. But I just wish that I   and the rest of the world  had been moved earlier. And not just to tears  but to actually stop the genocide. Now by contrast  I've also been involved with one of the world's greatest successes of compassion. And that's the fight against  global poverty. It's a cause that probably has involved all of us here. I don't know if your first introduction might have been choruses of  We Are the World   or maybe the picture of a sponsored child on your refrigerator door  or maybe the birthday you donated for fresh water. I don't really remember what my first introduction to poverty was but I do remember the most jarring. It was when I met Venus    she's a mom from Zambia. She's got three kids and she's a widow. When I met her  she had walked about    miles in the only garments she owned  to come to the capital city and to share her story. She sat down with me for hours  just ushered me in to  the world of poverty. She described what it was like  when the coals on the cooking fire finally just went completely cold. When that last drop  of cooking oil finally ran out. When the last of the food   despite her best efforts  ran out. She had to watch her youngest son  Peter  suffer from malnutrition  as his legs just slowly bowed  into uselessness. As his eyes grew cloudy and dim. And then as Peter finally grew cold. For over    years  stories like this have been moving us to compassion. We whose kids have plenty to eat. And we're moved not only  to care about global poverty  but to actually try to do our part  to stop the suffering. Now there's plenty of room for critique  that we haven't done enough  and what it is that we've done hasn't been effective enough  but the truth is this  The fight against global poverty is probably the broadest  longest running manifestation of the  human phenomenon of compassion in the history of our species. And so I'd like to share a pretty shattering insight that might forever change the way you think about that struggle. But first  let me begin with what you probably already know. Thirty five years ago  when I would have been graduating from high school  they told us that        kids every day died because of poverty. That number  today  is now  down to       . Way too many  of course  but it does mean that every year  there's eight million kids who don't have to die from poverty. Moreover  the number of  people in our world who are living in extreme poverty  which is defined as living off about a dollar and a quarter a day  that has fallen from    percent  to only    percent. This is massive progress  and this exceeds everybody's  expectations about what is possible. And I think you and I  I think  honestly  that we can  feel proud and encouraged to see the way that compassion  actually has the power to succeed in stopping  the suffering of millions. But here's the part that you  might not hear very much about. If you move that poverty mark just up to two dollars a day  it turns out that virtually  the same two billion people who were stuck in that harsh poverty when I was in high school  are still stuck there     years later. So why  why are so many billions still stuck in such harsh poverty  Well  let's think about Venus for a moment. Now for decades  my wife and I have been moved by common compassion to sponsor kids  to fund microloans  to support generous levels of foreign aid. But until I had actually talked to Venus  I would have had no idea that  none of those approaches actually addressed why she had to watch her son die.  We were doing fine   Venus told me   until Brutus started to cause trouble.  Now  Brutus is Venus' neighbor  and  cause trouble  is what happened the day after Venus' husband died  when Brutus just came and threw Venus and the kids out of the house  stole all their land  and robbed their market stall. You see  Venus was thrown  into destitution by violence. And then it occurred to me  of course  that none of my child sponsorships  none of the microloans  none of the traditional  anti poverty programs were going to stop Brutus  because they weren't meant to. This became even more clear to me when I met Griselda. She's a marvelous young girl living in a very poor community in Guatemala. And one of the things we've learned over the years is that perhaps the most powerful thing that Griselda and her family can do to get Griselda and her family  out of poverty is to make sure that she goes to school. The experts call this the Girl Effect. But when we met Griselda   she wasn't going to school. In fact  she was rarely ever  leaving her home. Days before we met her  while she was walking home from church with her family  in broad daylight  men from her community  just snatched her off the street  and violently raped her. See  Griselda had every opportunity to go to school  it just wasn't safe for her to get there. And Griselda's not the only one. Around the world  poor women and girls between the ages of    and     they are    when victims of  the everyday violence of domestic abuse and sexual violence    those two forms of violence account for more death and disability than malaria  than car accidents  than war combined. The truth is  the poor of our world are trapped in whole systems of violence. In South Asia  for instance  I could drive past this rice mill and see this man hoisting  these     pound sacks of rice upon his thin back. But I would have no idea  until later  that he was actually a slave  held by violence in that rice mill since I was in high school. Decades of anti poverty programs right in his community were never able to rescue him or any of the hundred other slaves from the beatings and the rapes and the torture of violence inside the rice mill. In fact  half a century of  anti poverty programs have left more poor people in slavery than in any other time in human history. Experts tell us that there's about    million people in slavery today. That's about the population  of the entire nation of Canada  where we're sitting today. This is why  over time  I have come to call this epidemic of violence the Locust Effect. Because in the lives of the poor  it just descends like a plague and it destroys everything. In fact  now when you survey very  very poor communities  residents will tell you that their greatest fear is violence. But notice the violence that they fear is not the violence of  genocide or the wars  it's everyday violence. So for me  as a lawyer  of course  my first reaction was to think  well  of course we've got to change all the laws. We've got to make all this violence against the poor illegal. But then I found out  it already is. The problem is not that  the poor don't get laws  it's that they don't get law enforcement. In the developing world  basic law enforcement systems are so broken that recently the U.N. issued  a report that found that  most poor people live outside the protection of the law.  Now honestly  you and I have  just about no idea of what that would mean because we have no  first hand experience of it. Functioning law enforcement for us  is just a total assumption. In fact  nothing expresses that assumption more clearly than three simple numbers         which  of course  is the number for the emergency police operator here in Canada and in the United States  where the average response time  to a police     emergency call is about    minutes. So we take this just  completely for granted. But what if there was no  law enforcement to protect you  A woman in Oregon recently experienced what this would be like. She was home alone in her  dark house on a Saturday night  when a man started to tear  his way into her home. This was her worst nightmare  because this man had actually put her in the hospital from an assault just two weeks before. So terrified  she picks up that phone and does what any of us would do  She calls        but only to learn that because  of budget cuts in her county  law enforcement wasn't available  on the weekends. Listen. Dispatcher  I don't have anybody  to send out there. Woman  OK Dispatcher  Um  obviously if he comes inside the residence and assaults you  can you ask him to go away  Or do you know if he is intoxicated or anything  Woman  I've already asked him. I've already told him I was calling you. He's broken in before  busted down my door  assaulted me. Dispatcher  Uh huh. Woman  Um  yeah  so ... Dispatcher  Is there any way you could safely leave the residence  Woman  No  I can't  because he's blocking pretty much my only way out. Dispatcher  Well  the only thing I can do  is give you some advice  and call the sheriff's office tomorrow. Obviously  if he comes in and unfortunately has a weapon or is trying to cause you physical harm  that's a different story. You know  the sheriff's office doesn't work up there. I don't have anybody to send.  Gary Haugen  Tragically  the woman  inside that house was violently assaulted  choked and raped because this is what it means to live outside the rule of law. And this is where billions of our poorest live. What does that look like  In Bolivia  for example  if a man  sexually assaults a poor child  statistically  he's at greater risk of slipping in the shower and dying than he is of ever going  to jail for that crime. In South Asia  if you  enslave a poor person  you're at greater risk of being  struck by lightning than ever being sent  to jail for that crime. And so the epidemic of everyday  violence  it just rages on. And it devastates our efforts to try to help billions of people out of their two dollar a day hell. Because the data just doesn't lie. It turns out that you can give  all manner of goods and services to the poor  but if you don't restrain the hands  of the violent bullies from taking it all away  you're going to be very disappointed in the long term impact of your efforts. So you would think that the disintegration of basic law enforcement in the developing world would be a huge priority for the global fight against poverty. But it's not. Auditors of international assistance recently couldn't find even one percent of aid going  to protect the poor from the lawless chaos  of everyday violence. And honestly  when we do talk about  violence against the poor  sometimes it's in the weirdest of ways. A fresh water organization tells a heart wrenching story of girls who are raped on the way to fetching water  and then celebrates the solution of a new well that drastically shortens their walk. End of story. But not a word about the rapists who are still right there in the community. If a young woman on one  of our college campuses was raped on her walk to the library  we would never celebrate the solution of moving the library closer to the dorm. And yet  for some reason  this is okay for poor people. Now the truth is  the traditional experts in economic development and poverty alleviation  they don't know how to fix this problem. And so what happens  They don't talk about it. But the more fundamental reason that law enforcement for the poor in the developing world is so neglected  is because the people inside the developing world  with money  don't need it. I was at the World Economic  Forum not long ago talking to corporate executives who have massive businesses in the developing world and I was just asking them   How do you guys protect all your people and property from all the violence   And they looked at each other   and they said  practically in unison   We buy it.  Indeed  private security forces  in the developing world are now  four  five and seven times larger than the public police force. In Africa  the largest employer  on the continent now is private security. But see  the rich can pay for safety and can keep getting richer  but the poor can't pay for it and they're left totally unprotected and they keep getting thrown to the ground. This is a massive and scandalous outrage. And it doesn't have to be this way. Broken law enforcement can be fixed. Violence can be stopped. Almost all criminal justice systems  they start out broken and corrupt  but they can be transformed by fierce effort and commitment. The path forward is really pretty clear. Number one  We have to start making stopping violence indispensable  to the fight against poverty. In fact  any conversation about global poverty that doesn't include the problem  of violence must be deemed not serious. And secondly  we have to begin  to seriously invest resources and share expertise to support  the developing world as they fashion new   public systems of justice  not private security  that give everybody a chance to be safe. These transformations  are actually possible and they're happening today. Recently  the Gates Foundation  funded a project in the second largest city  of the Philippines  where local advocates and local law enforcement were able to transform corrupt police and broken courts so drastically  that in just four short years  they were able to measurably reduce the commercial sexual violence  against poor kids by    percent. You know  from the hindsight of history  what's always most inexplicable and inexcusable are the simple failures of compassion. Because I think history convenes  a tribunal of our grandchildren and they just ask us   Grandma  Grandpa  where were you  Where were you  Grandpa  when  the Jews were fleeing Nazi Germany and were being rejected from our shores  Where were you  And Grandma  where were you when they were marching our Japanese American neighbors off to internment camps  And Grandpa  where were you  when they were beating our African American neighbors just because they were trying to register to vote   Likewise  when our grandchildren ask us   Grandma  Grandpa  where were you when two billion of the world's poorest were drowning in a lawless chaos of everyday violence   I hope we can say that we had compassion  that we raised our voice  and as a generation  we were moved to make the violence stop. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Really powerfully argued. Talk to us a bit about some of the things that have actually been happening to  for example  boost police training. How hard a process is that  GH  Well  one of the glorious  things that's starting to happen now is that the collapse of these systems and the consequences are becoming obvious. There's actually  now   political will to do that. But it just requires now an investment of resources and transfer of expertise. There's a political will struggle  that's going to take place as well  but those are winnable fights  because we've done some examples around the world at International Justice Mission that are very encouraging. CA  So just tell us in one country  how much it costs to make a material difference  to police  for example    I know that's only one piece of it. GH  In Guatemala  for instance  we've started a project there with the local police  and court system  prosecutors  to retrain them so that they can  actually effectively bring these cases. And we've seen prosecutions against perpetrators of sexual violence increase by more than       percent. This project has been very modestly funded at about a million dollars a year  and the kind of bang  you can get for your buck in terms of leveraging a criminal justice system that could function if it were properly trained and motivated and led  and these countries   especially a middle class that is seeing that there's  really no future with this total instability and total privatization of security I think there's an opportunity  a window for change. CA  But to make this happen  you have to look at each part in the chain    the police  who else  GH  So that's the thing  about law enforcement  it starts out with the police  they're the front end of the pipeline of justice  but they hand if off to the prosecutors  and the prosecutors  hand it off to the courts  and the survivors of violence  have to be supported by social services all the way through that. So you have to do an approach  that pulls that all together. In the past  there's been a little bit of training of the courts  but they get crappy evidence  from the police  or a little police intervention  that has to do with narcotics or terrorism but nothing to do with treating the common poor person with excellent law enforcement  so it's about pulling that all together  and you can actually have people in very poor communities experience law enforcement like us  which is imperfect in our  own experience  for sure  but boy  is it a great thing to sense that you can call     and maybe someone will protect you. CA  Gary  I think you've done  a spectacular job of bringing this to the world's attention in your book and right here today. Thanks so much. Gary Haugen. My first love was for the night sky. Love is complicated. You're looking at a fly through of the  Hubble Space Telescope Ultra Deep Field  one of the most distant images of our universe ever observed. Everything you see here is a galaxy  comprised of billions of stars each. And the farthest galaxy is  a trillion  trillion kilometers away. As an astrophysicist  I have the awesome privilege of studying some of the most exotic objects  in our universe. The objects that have captivated me  from first crush throughout my career are supermassive   hyperactive black holes. Weighing one to    billion times  the mass of our own sun  these galactic black holes  are devouring material  at a rate of upwards of        times more than your  average   supermassive black hole. These two characteristics  with a few others  make them quasars. At the same time  the objects I study are producing some of the most powerful particle streams ever observed. These narrow streams  called jets  are moving at   .   percent  of the speed of light  and are pointed directly at the Earth. These jetted  Earth pointed  hyperactive and supermassive black holes are called blazars  or blazing quasars. What makes blazars so special is that they're some of the universe's most efficient particle accelerators  transporting incredible amounts of energy throughout a galaxy. Here  I'm showing an artist's conception of a blazar. The dinner plate by which  material falls onto the black hole is called the accretion disc  shown here in blue. Some of that material is slingshotted around the black hole and accelerated to insanely high speeds in the jet  shown here in white. Although the blazar system is rare  the process by which nature pulls in material via a disk  and then flings some of it out via a jet  is more common. We'll eventually zoom out of  the blazar system to show its approximate relationship to the larger galactic context. Beyond the cosmic accounting of what goes in to what goes out  one of the hot topics in  blazar astrophysics right now is where the highest energy  jet emission comes from. In this image  I'm interested in where this white blob forms and if  as a result  there's any  relationship between the jet and the accretion disc material. Clear answers to this question were almost completely inaccessible until       when NASA launched a new telescope that better detects gamma ray light    that is  light with energies a million times higher than your standard x ray scan. I simultaneously compare variations between the gamma ray light data and the visible light data from day to day and year to year  to better localize these gamma ray blobs. My research shows that in some instances  these blobs form much closer to the black hole than we initially thought. As we more confidently localize where these gamma ray  blobs are forming  we can better understand how jets are being accelerated  and ultimately reveal  the dynamic processes by which some of the most fascinating objects in our universe are formed. This all started as a love story. And it still is. This love transformed me from  a curious  stargazing young girl to a professional astrophysicist  hot on the heels of celestial discovery. Who knew that chasing after the universe would ground me so deeply to my mission here on Earth. Then again  when do we ever know where love's first flutter will truly take us. Thank you. Virtual reality started for me in sort of an unusual place. It was the     s. I got into the field very young  I was seven years old. And the tool that I used  to access virtual reality was the Evel Knievel stunt cycle. This is a commercial for  that particular item  Evel's riding the amazing stunt cycle. That gyro power sends him  over     feet at top speed. Chris Milk  So this was my joy back then. I rode this motorcycle everywhere. And I was there with Evel Knievel  we  jumped the Snake River Canyon together. I wanted the rocket. I never got the rocket  I only got the motorcycle. I felt so connected to this world. I didn't want to be a storyteller  when I grew up  I wanted to be stuntman. I was there. Evel Knievel was my friend. I had so much empathy for him. But it didn't work out.  Laughter  I went to art school. I started making music videos. And this is one of the early music videos that I made  CM  You may notice  some slight similarities here. And I got that rocket. So  now I'm a filmmaker  or  the beginning of a filmmaker  and I started using the tools that are available to me as a filmmaker to try to tell the most compelling stories that I can to an audience. And film is this incredible medium that allows us to feel empathy for people that are very different than us and worlds completely  foreign from our own. Unfortunately  Evel Knievel did not feel the same  empathy for us that we felt for him  and he sued us for this video    shortly thereafter. On the upside  the man  that I worshipped as a child  the man that I wanted  to become as an adult  I was finally able to get his autograph. Let's talk about film now. Film  it's an incredible medium  but essentially  it's the same now as it was then. It's a group of rectangles that are played in a sequence. And we've done incredible things with those rectangles. But I started thinking about  is there a way that I can use modern and developing technologies to tell stories in different ways and tell different kinds of stories that maybe I couldn't tell using the traditional tools of filmmaking that we've been using for     years  So I started experimenting  and what I was trying to do was to build the ultimate empathy machine. And here's one of the early experiments  So this is called  The Wilderness Downtown.  It was a collaboration with Arcade Fire. It asked you to put in the address where you grew up at the beginning of it. It's a website. And out of it starts growing these little boxes with different browser windows. And you see this teenager  running down a street  and then you see Google Street View and Google Maps imagery and you realize the street he's running down is yours. And when he stops in front of a house  he stops in front of your house. And this was great  and I saw people  having an even deeper emotional reaction to this than the things that  I had made in rectangles. And I'm essentially taking  a piece of your history and putting it inside  the framing of the story. But then I started thinking  okay  well that's a part of you  but how do I put all of you inside of the frame  So to do that  I started making art installations. And this is one called   The Treachery of Sanctuary.  It's a triptych. I'm going to show you the third panel. So now I've got you inside of the frame  and I saw people having even more visceral emotional reactions to this work than the previous one. But then I started thinking about frames  and what do they represent  And a frame is just a window. I mean  all the media that we watch    television  cinema    they're these windows into  these other worlds. And I thought  well  great.  I got you in a frame. But I don't want you in the frame  I don't want you in the window  I want you through the window  I want you on the other side  in the world  inhabiting the world. So that leads me back to virtual reality. Let's talk about virtual reality. Unfortunately  talking about virtual reality is like dancing about architecture. And this is actually someone dancing about architecture in virtual reality. So  it's difficult to explain. Why is it difficult to explain  It's difficult because it's a very  experiential medium. You feel your way inside of it. It's a machine  but inside of it  it feels like real life  it feels like truth. And you feel present in the world that you're inside and you feel present with the people that you're inside of it with. So  I'm going to show you a demo of a virtual reality film  a full screen version of all the information that we capture when we shoot virtual reality. So we're shooting in every direction. This is a camera system that we built that has  D cameras that look in every direction and binaural microphones that face in every direction. We take this and we build  basically  a sphere of a world that you inhabit. So what I'm going to show you is not a view into the world  it's basically the whole world stretched into a rectangle. So this film is called   Clouds Over Sidra   and it was made in conjunction with  our virtual reality company called VRSE and the United Nations  and a co collaborator named Gabo Arora. And we went to a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan in December and shot the story of a    year old girl there named Sidra. And she and her family fled Syria through the desert into Jordan and she's been living in this camp for the last year and a half. I am    years old. I am in the fifth grade. I am from Syria  in the Daraa Province  Inkhil City. I have lived here in the Zaatari camp in Jordan for the last year and a half. I have a big family  three brothers  one is a baby. He cries a lot. I asked my father if I cried when  I was a baby and he says I did not. I think I was a stronger baby than my brother. CM  So  when you're inside  of the headset. you're not seeing it like this. You're looking around through this world. You'll notice you see full     degrees  in all directions. And when you're sitting there in her room  watching her  you're not watching it through a television screen  you're not watching it through a window  you're sitting there with her. When you look down  you're sitting on the same ground that she's sitting on. And because of that  you feel her humanity in a deeper way. You empathize with her in a deeper way. And I think that we can change minds with this machine. And we've already started to try to change a few. So we took this film to the World Economic Forum in Davos in January. And we showed it to a group of people whose decisions affect the lives of millions of people. And these are people  who might not otherwise be sitting in a tent  in a refugee camp in Jordan. But in January  one afternoon in Switzerland  they suddenly all found themselves there. And they were affected by it. So we're going to make more of them. We're working with the  United Nations right now to shoot a whole series of these films. We just finished shooting a story in Liberia. And now  we're going  to shoot a story in India. And we're taking these films  and we're showing them  at the United Nations to people that work there and people that are visiting there. And we're showing  them to the people that can actually change the lives of the people inside of the films. And that's where I think we just start to scratch the surface of the true power of virtual reality. It's not a video game peripheral. It connects humans to other humans in a profound way that I've never seen before  in any other form of media. And it can change people's perception of each other. And that's how I think virtual reality has the potential to actually change the world. So  it's a machine  but through this machine we become more compassionate  we become more empathetic  and we become more connected. And ultimately  we become more human. Thank you. Growing up  I didn't always understand why my parents made me follow the rules that they did. Like  why did I really  have to mow the lawn  Why was homework really that important  Why couldn't I put jelly beans  in my oatmeal  My childhood was abound with questions like this. Normal things about being a kid and realizing that sometimes  it was best to listen to my parents even when I didn't exactly understand why. And it's not that they didn't want me to think critically. Their parenting always sought  to reconcile the tension between having my siblings and I understand the realities of the world  while ensuring that we never accepted the status quo as inevitable. I came to realize that this  in and of itself  was a very purposeful form of education. One of my favorite educators  Brazilian author and scholar Paulo Freire  speaks quite explicitly about the need for education to be used as a tool for critical  awakening and shared humanity. In his most famous book   Pedagogy of the Oppressed   he states   No one can be  authentically human while he prevents others from being so.  I've been thinking a lot about this  lately  this idea of humanity  and specifically  who in this world is afforded the privilege of being perceived as fully human. Over the course of  the past several months  the world has watched as unarmed black men  and women  have had their lives taken at the hands of police and vigilante. These events and all that  has transpired after them have brought me back to my own childhood and the decisions that my parents made about raising a black boy in America that growing up  I didn't always understand in the way that I do now. I think of how hard it must have been  how profoundly unfair it must have felt for them to feel like they had  to strip away parts of my childhood just so that I could come home at night. For example  I think of how one night  when I was around    years old  on an overnight field trip to another city  my friends and I bought Super Soakers and turned the hotel parking lot into our own water filled battle zone. We hid behind cars  running through the darkness that lay between the streetlights  boundless laughter ubiquitous  across the pavement. But within    minutes  my father came outside   grabbed me by my forearm and led me into our room with an unfamiliar grip. Before I could say anything  tell him how foolish he had  made me look in front of my friends  he derided me for being so naive. Looked me in the eye   fear consuming his face  and said   Son  I'm sorry  but you can't act the same  as your white friends. You can't pretend to shoot guns. You can't run around in the dark. You can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth.  I know now how scared he must have been  how easily I could have fallen into the empty of the night  that some man would mistake this water for a good reason to wash all of this away. These are the sorts of messages I've been inundated with my entire life  Always keep your hands where they  can see them  don't move too quickly  take off your hood when the sun goes down. My parents raised me and my siblings in an armor of advice  an ocean of alarm bells so someone wouldn't steal the breath from our lungs  so that they wouldn't make a memory of this skin. So that we could be kids   not casket or concrete. And it's not because they thought it would make us better than anyone else it's simply because they wanted  to keep us alive. All of my black friends were raised with the same message  the talk  given to us  when we became old enough to be mistaken for a nail ready to be hammered to the ground  when people made our melanin synonymous with something to be feared. But what does it do to a child to grow up knowing that you cannot simply be a child  That the whims of adolescence are too dangerous for your breath  that you cannot simply be curious  that you are not afforded the luxury of making a mistake  that someone's implicit bias might be the reason you don't wake up in the morning. But this cannot be what defines us. Because we have parents who raised us to understand that our bodies weren't meant for the backside of a bullet  but for flying kites and jumping rope  and laughing until our stomachs burst. We had teachers who taught us  how to raise our hands in class  and not just to signal surrender  and that the only thing we should give up is the idea that we  aren't worthy of this world. So when we say that black lives matter  it's not because others don't  it's simply because we must affirm that we are worthy of existing without fear  when so many things tell us we are not. I want to live in a world where my son will not be presumed guilty the moment he is born  where a toy in his hand isn't mistaken for anything other than a toy. And I refuse to accept that we can't build this world into something new  some place where a child's name doesn't have to be written  on a t shirt  or a tombstone  where the value of someone's life isn't determined by anything other  than the fact that they had lungs  a place where every single  one of us can breathe. Thank you. These dragons from deep time are incredible creatures. They're bizzarre  they're beautiful  and there's very little we know about them. These thoughts were going through my head when I looked at the pages of my first dinosaur book. I was about five years old at the time  and I decided there and then that I would become a paleontologist. Paleontology allowed me  to combine my love for animals with my desire to travel to  far flung corners of the world. And now  a few years later  I've led several expeditions to the ultimate far flung corner  on this planet  the Sahara. I've worked in the Sahara because I've been on a quest to uncover new remains of a bizarre  giant predatory dinosaur called Spinosaurus. A few bones of this animal have been found in the deserts of Egypt and were described about     years ago by a German paleontologist. Unfortunately  all his Spinosaurus bones were destroyed in World War II. So all we're left with are just a few drawings and notes. From these drawings  we know that this creature  which lived  about     million years ago  was very big  it had tall spines on its back  forming a magnificent sail  and it had long  slender jaws   a bit like a crocodile  with conical teeth  that may have been used  to catch slippery prey  like fish. But that was pretty much  all we knew about this animal for the next     years. My fieldwork took me to the border region between Morocco and Algeria  a place called the Kem Kem. It's a difficult place to work in. You have to deal with sandstorms and snakes and scorpions  and it's very difficult to find good fossils there. But our hard work paid off. We discovered many incredible specimens. There's the largest dinosaur bone that had ever been found in this part of the Sahara. We found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs  medium sized predatory dinosaurs  and seven or eight different kinds of crocodile like hunters. These fossils were deposited in a river system. The river system was also home  to a giant  car sized coelacanth  a monster sawfish  and the skies over the river system were filled with pterosaurs  flying reptiles. It was a pretty dangerous place  not the kind of place where you'd want to travel to if you had a time machine. So we're finding all these  incredible fossils of animals that lived alongside Spinosaurus  but Spinosaurus itself proved to be very elusive. We were just finding bits and pieces and I was hoping that we'd find a partial skeleton at some point. Finally  very recently  we were able to track down a dig site where a local fossil hunter found several bones of Spinosaurus. We returned to the site  we collected more bones. And so after     years we finally had another partial skeleton of this bizarre creature. And we were able to reconstruct it. We now know that  Spinosaurus had a head a little bit like a crocodile  very different from other  predatory dinosaurs  very different from the T. rex. But the really interesting information came from the rest of the skeleton. We had long spines  the spines forming the big sail. We had leg bones  we had skull bones  we had paddle shaped feet  wide feet    again  very unusual  no other dinosaur has feet like this    and we think they may have been used to walk on soft sediment  or maybe for paddling in the water. We also looked at the fine microstructure of the bone  the inside structure of Spinosaurus bones  and it turns out that they're very dense and compact. Again  this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water  it's useful for buoyancy  control in the water. We C.T. scanned all of our bones and built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton. And when we looked  at the digital skeleton  we realized that yes  this was a dinosaur unlike any other. It's bigger than a T. rex  and yes  the head has  fish eating  written all over it  but really the entire skeleton has  water loving  written all over it    dense bone  paddle like feet  and the hind limbs are reduced in size  and again  this is something we see in animals that spend a substantial amount  of time in the water. So  as we fleshed out our Spinosaurus    I'm looking at muscle attachments and wrapping our dinosaur in skin    we realize that we're dealing with a river monster  a predatory dinosaur  bigger than T. rex  the ruler of this ancient river of giants  feeding on the many aquatic animals I showed you earlier on. So that's really what makes this an incredible discovery. It's a dinosaur like no other. And some people told me   Wow  this is a once in a lifetime discovery. There are not many things left to discover in the world.  Well  I think nothing could be  further from the truth. I think the Sahara's  still full of treasures  and when people tell me there are no places left to explore  I like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter  Roy Chapman Andrews  and he said   Always  there has been an adventure just around the corner    and the world is still full of corners.  That was true many decades ago when Roy Chapman Andrews wrote these lines. And it is still true today. Thank you. I work with a bunch of mathematicians  philosophers and computer scientists  and we sit around and think about the future of machine intelligence  among other things. Some people think that some of these things are sort of science fiction y  far out there  crazy. But I like to say  okay  let's look at the modern human condition. This is the normal way for things to be. But if we think about it  we are actually recently arrived guests on this planet  the human species. Think about if Earth was created one year ago  the human species  then   would be    minutes old. The industrial era started two seconds ago. Another way to look at this is to think of world GDP over the last        years  I've actually taken the trouble to plot this for you in a graph. It looks like this. It's a curious shape for a normal condition. I sure wouldn't want to sit on it. Let's ask ourselves  what is the cause of this current anomaly  Some people would say it's technology. Now it's true  technology has accumulated through human history  and right now  technology advances extremely rapidly    that is the proximate cause  that's why we are currently  so very productive. But I like to think back further  to the ultimate cause. Look at these two highly distinguished gentlemen  We have Kanzi    he's mastered     lexical tokens  an incredible feat. And Ed Witten unleashed the second superstring revolution. If we look under the hood   this is what we find  basically the same thing. One is a little larger  it maybe also has a few tricks in the exact way it's wired. These invisible differences cannot be too complicated  however  because there have only been         generations since our last common ancestor. We know that complicated mechanisms take a long time to evolve. So a bunch of relatively minor changes take us from Kanzi to Witten  from broken off tree branches to intercontinental ballistic missiles. So this then seems pretty obvious that everything we've achieved  and everything we care about  depends crucially on some relatively minor changes that made the human mind. And the corollary  of course  is that any further changes that could significantly change the substrate of thinking could have potentially  enormous consequences. Some of my colleagues  think we're on the verge of something that could cause a profound change in that substrate  and that is machine superintelligence. Artificial intelligence used to be about putting commands in a box. You would have human programmers that would painstakingly  handcraft knowledge items. You build up these expert systems  and they were kind of useful  for some purposes  but they were very brittle  you couldn't scale them. Basically  you got out only what you put in. But since then  a paradigm shift has taken place in the field of artificial intelligence. Today  the action is really  around machine learning. So rather than handcrafting knowledge representations and features  we create algorithms that learn  often from raw perceptual data. Basically the same thing that the human infant does. The result is A.I. that is not limited to one domain    the same system can learn to translate  between any pairs of languages  or learn to play any computer game on the Atari console. Now of course  A.I. is still nowhere near having the same powerful  cross domain ability to learn and plan as a human being has. The cortex still has some  algorithmic tricks that we don't yet know how to match in machines. So the question is  how far are we from being able to match those tricks  A couple of years ago  we did a survey of some of the world's  leading A.I. experts  to see what they think  and one of the questions we asked was   By which year do you think there is a    percent probability that we will have achieved  human level machine intelligence   We defined human level here  as the ability to perform almost any job at least as well as an adult human  so real human level  not just within some limited domain. And the median answer was      or       depending on precisely which  group of experts we asked. Now  it could happen much  much later  or sooner  the truth is nobody really knows. What we do know is that the ultimate  limit to information processing in a machine substrate lies far outside  the limits in biological tissue. This comes down to physics. A biological neuron fires  maybe   at     hertz      times a second. But even a present day transistor operates at the Gigahertz. Neurons propagate slowly in axons      meters per second  tops. But in computers  signals can travel at the speed of light. There are also size limitations  like a human brain has  to fit inside a cranium  but a computer can be the size of a warehouse or larger. So the potential for superintelligence  lies dormant in matter  much like the power of the atom  lay dormant throughout human history  patiently waiting there until     . In this century  scientists may learn to awaken the power of artificial intelligence. And I think we might then see an intelligence explosion. Now most people  when they think about what is smart and what is dumb  I think have in mind a picture roughly like this. So at one end we have the village idiot  and then far over at the other side we have Ed Witten  or Albert Einstein  or whoever your favorite guru is. But I think that from the point of view of artificial intelligence  the true picture is actually probably more like this  AI starts out at this point here  at zero intelligence  and then  after many  many  years of really hard work  maybe eventually we get to mouse level artificial intelligence  something that can navigate  cluttered environments as well as a mouse can. And then  after many  many more years of really hard work  lots of investment  maybe eventually we get to chimpanzee level artificial intelligence. And then  after even more years  of really  really hard work  we get to village idiot  artificial intelligence. And a few moments later   we are beyond Ed Witten. The train doesn't stop at Humanville Station. It's likely  rather  to swoosh right by. Now this has profound implications  particularly when it comes  to questions of power. For example  chimpanzees are strong    pound for pound  a chimpanzee is about twice as strong as a fit human male. And yet  the fate of Kanzi  and his pals depends a lot more on what we humans do than on what the chimpanzees do themselves. Once there is superintelligence  the fate of humanity may depend on what the superintelligence does. Think about it  Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make. Machines will then be better  at inventing than we are  and they'll be doing so  on digital timescales. What this means is basically a telescoping of the future. Think of all the crazy technologies  that you could have imagined maybe humans could have developed in the fullness of time  cures for aging  space colonization  self replicating nanobots or uploading of minds into computers  all kinds of science fiction y stuff that's nevertheless consistent  with the laws of physics. All of this superintelligence could  develop  and possibly quite rapidly. Now  a superintelligence with such  technological maturity would be extremely powerful  and at least in some scenarios  it would be able to get what it wants. We would then have a future that would be shaped by the preferences of this A.I. Now a good question is  what are those preferences  Here it gets trickier. To make any headway with this  we must first of all avoid anthropomorphizing. And this is ironic because  every newspaper article about the future of A.I. has a picture of this  So I think what we need to do is to conceive of the issue more abstractly  not in terms of vivid Hollywood scenarios. We need to think of intelligence  as an optimization process  a process that steers the future into a particular set of configurations. A superintelligence is a really strong optimization process. It's extremely good at using  available means to achieve a state in which its goal is realized. This means that there is no necessary conenction between being highly intelligent in this sense  and having an objective that we humans would find worthwhile or meaningful. Suppose we give an A.I. the goal  to make humans smile. When the A.I. is weak  it performs useful or amusing actions that cause its user to smile. When the A.I. becomes superintelligent  it realizes that there is a more effective way to achieve this goal  take control of the world and stick electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant  beaming grins. Another example  suppose we give A.I. the goal to solve a difficult mathematical problem. When the A.I. becomes superintelligent  it realizes that the most effective way  to get the solution to this problem is by transforming the planet into a giant computer  so as to increase its thinking capacity. And notice that this gives the A.I.s an instrumental reason to do things to us that we might not approve of. Human beings in this model are threats  we could prevent the mathematical problem from being solved. Of course  perceivably things won't  go wrong in these particular ways  these are cartoon examples. But the general point here is important  if you create a really powerful optimization process to maximize for objective x  you better make sure  that your definition of x incorporates everything you care about. This is a lesson that's also taught in many a myth. King Midas wishes that everything he touches be turned into gold. He touches his daughter   she turns into gold. He touches his food  it turns into gold. This could become practically relevant  not just as a metaphor for greed  but as an illustration of what happens if you create a powerful optimization process and give it misconceived  or poorly specified goals. Now you might say  if a computer starts sticking electrodes into people's faces  we'd just shut it off. A  this is not necessarily so easy to do if we've grown dependent on the system    like  where is the off switch  to the Internet  B  why haven't the chimpanzees flicked the off switch to humanity  or the Neanderthals  They certainly had reasons. We have an off switch   for example  right here. The reason is that we are  an intelligent adversary  we can anticipate threats  and plan around them. But so could a superintelligent agent  and it would be much better  at that than we are. The point is  we should not be confident that we have this under control here. And we could try to make our job a little bit easier by  say  putting the A.I. in a box  like a secure software environment  a virtual reality simulation from which it cannot escape. But how confident can we be that the A.I. couldn't find a bug. Given that merely human hackers find bugs all the time  I'd say  probably not very confident. So we disconnect the ethernet cable to create an air gap  but again  like merely human hackers routinely transgress air gaps using social engineering. Right now  as I speak  I'm sure there is some employee out there somewhere who has been talked into handing out  her account details by somebody claiming to be from the I.T. department. More creative scenarios are also possible  like if you're the A.I.  you can imagine wiggling electrodes around in your internal circuitry to create radio waves that you can use to communicate. Or maybe you could pretend to malfunction  and then when the programmers open you up to see what went wrong with you  they look at the source code    Bam     the manipulation can take place. Or it could output the blueprint to a really nifty technology  and when we implement it  it has some surreptitious side effect that the A.I. had planned. The point here is that we should  not be confident in our ability to keep a superintelligent genie locked up in its bottle forever. Sooner or later  it will out. I believe that the answer here is to figure out how to create superintelligent A.I. such that even if    when    it escapes  it is still safe because it is fundamentally on our side because it shares our values. I see no way around  this difficult problem. Now  I'm actually fairly optimistic that this problem can be solved. We wouldn't have to write down  a long list of everything we care about  or worse yet  spell it out  in some computer language like C   or Python  that would be a task beyond hopeless. Instead  we would create an A.I. that uses its intelligence to learn what we value  and its motivation system is constructed in such a way that it is motivated to pursue our values or to perform actions that it predicts we would approve of. We would thus leverage  its intelligence as much as possible to solve the problem of value loading. This can happen  and the outcome could be  very good for humanity. But it doesn't happen automatically. The initial conditions  for the intelligence explosion might need to be set up  in just the right way if we are to have a controlled detonation. The values that the A.I. has need to match ours  not just in the familiar context  like where we can easily check how the A.I. behaves  but also in all novel contexts that the A.I. might encounter in the indefinite future. And there are also some esoteric issues that would need to be solved  sorted out  the exact details of its decision theory  how to deal with logical uncertainty and so forth. So the technical problems that need to be solved to make this work look quite difficult    not as difficult as making  a superintelligent A.I.  but fairly difficult. Here is the worry  Making superintelligent A.I. is a really hard challenge. Making superintelligent A.I. that is safe involves some additional  challenge on top of that. The risk is that if somebody figures out how to crack the first challenge without also having cracked  the additional challenge of ensuring perfect safety. So I think that we should work out a solution to the control problem in advance  so that we have it available  by the time it is needed. Now it might be that we cannot solve the entire control problem in advance because maybe some elements can only be put in place once you know the details of the  architecture where it will be implemented. But the more of the control problem that we solve in advance  the better the odds that the transition to the machine intelligence era will go well. This to me looks like a thing that is well worth doing and I can imagine that if  things turn out okay  that people a million years from now look back at this century and it might well be that they say that the one thing we did that really mattered was to get this thing right. Thank you. The brain is an amazing and complex organ. And while many people are fascinated by the brain  they can't really tell you that much about the properties about how the brain works because we don't teach neuroscience in schools. And one of the reasons why is that the equipment is so complex and so expensive that it's really only done at major universities and large institutions. And so in order to be able to access the brain  you really need to dedicate your life and spend six and a half years as a graduate student just to become a neuroscientist to get access to these tools. And that's a shame because one out of five of us  that's    percent of the entire world  will have a neurological disorder. And there are zero cures for these diseases. And so it seems that what we should be doing is reaching back earlier in the eduction process and teaching students about neuroscience so that in the future  they may be thinking about possibly becoming a brain scientist. When I was a graduate student  my lab mate Tim Marzullo and myself  decided that what if we took this complex equipment that we have for studying the brain and made it simple enough and affordable enough that anyone that you know  an amateur or a high school student  could learn and actually participate in the discovery of neuroscience. And so we did just that. A few years ago  we started a company called Backyard Brains and we make DIY neuroscience equipment and I brought some here tonight  and I want to do some demonstrations. You guys want to see some  So I need a volunteer. So right before    what is your name   Applause  Sam Kelly  Sam. Greg Gage  All right  Sam  I'm going to record from your brain. Have you had this before  SK  No. GG  I need you to stick out your arm for science  roll up your sleeve a bit  So what I'm going to do  I'm putting electrodes on your arm  and you're probably wondering  I just said I'm going to record from your brain  what am I doing with your arm  Well  you have about    billion neurons inside your brain right now. They're sending electrical messages back and forth  and chemical messages. But some of your neurons right here in your motor cortex are going to send messages down when you move your arm like this. They're going to go down across your corpus callosum  down onto your spinal cord to your lower motor neuron out to your muscles here  and that electrical discharge is going to be picked up by these electrodes right here and we're going to be able to listen to exactly what your brain is going to be doing. So I'm going to turn this on for a second. Have you ever heard what your brain sounds like  SK  No. GG  Let's try it out. So go ahead and squeeze your hand. So what you're listening to  so this is your motor units happening right here. Let's take a look at it as well. So I'm going to stand over here  and I'm going to open up our app here. So now I want you to squeeze. So right here  these are the motor units that are happening from her spinal cord out to her muscle right here  and as she's doing it  you're seeing the electrical activity that's happening here. You can even click here and try to see one of them. So keep doing it really hard. So now we've paused on one motor action potential that's happening right now inside of your brain. Do you guys want to see some more  That's interesting  but let's get it better. I need one more volunteer. What is your name  sir  Miguel Goncalves  Miguel. GG  Miguel  all right. You're going to stand right here. So when you're moving your arm like this  your brain is sending a signal down to your muscles right here. I want you to move your arm as well. So your brain is going to send a signal down to your muscles. And so it turns out that there is a nerve that's right here that runs up here that innervates these three fingers  and it's close enough to the skin that we might be able to stimulate that so that what we can do is copy your brain signals going out to your hand and inject it into your hand  so that your hand will move when your brain tells your hand to move. So in a sense  she will take away your free will and you will no longer have any control over this hand. You with me  So I just need to hook you up. So I'm going to find your ulnar nerve  which is probably right around here. You don't know what you're signing up for when you come up. So now I'm going to move away and we're going to plug it in to our human to human interface over here. Okay  so Sam  I want you to squeeze your hand again. Do it again. Perfect. So now I'm going to hook you up over here so that you get the    It's going to feel a little bit weird at first  this is going to feel like a     Laughter  You know  when you lose your free will  and someone else becomes your agent  it does feel a bit strange. Now I want you to relax your hand. Sam  you're with me  So you're going to squeeze. I'm not going to turn it on yet  so go ahead and give it a squeeze. So now  are you ready  Miguel  MG  Ready as I'll ever be. GG  I've turned it on  so go ahead and turn your hand. Do you feel that a little bit  MG  Nope. GG  Okay  do it again  MG  A little bit. GG  A little bit   Laughter  So relax. So hit it again. Oh  perfect  perfect. So relax  do it again. All right  so right now  your brain is controlling your arm and it's also controlling his arm  so go ahead and just do it one more time. All right  so it's perfect.  Laughter  So now  what would happen if I took over my control of your hand  And so  just relax your hand. What happens  Ah  nothing. Why not  Because the brain has to do it. So you do it again. All right  that's perfect. Thank you guys for being such a good sport. This is what's happening all across the world    electrophysiology  We're going to bring on the neuro revolution. Thank you. Hi. I'm going to talk  to you today about laughter  and I just want to start  by thinking about the first time I can ever remember noticing laughter. This is when I was a little girl. I would've been about six. And I came across my parents doing something unusual  where they were laughing. They were laughing very  very hard. They were lying on the floor laughing. They were screaming with laughter. I did not know what they were  laughing at  but I wanted in. I wanted to be part of that  and I kind of sat around at the edge going   Hoo hoo    Laughter  Now  incidentally  what they were laughing at was a song which people used to sing  which was based around signs in toilets on trains telling you what you could and could not do in toilets on trains. And the thing you have to remember about the English is  of course  we do have an immensely sophisticated sense of humor. At the time  though  I didn't understand anything of that. I just cared about the laughter  and actually  as a neuroscientist  I've come to care about it again. And it is a really weird thing to do. What I'm going to do now is just play some examples of real human beings laughing  and I want you think about the sound people make and how odd that can be  and in fact how primitive laughter is as a sound. It's much more like an animal call than it is like speech. So here we've got some laughter for you. The first one is pretty joyful. Now this next guy  I need him to breathe. There's a point in there where I'm just  like  you've got to get some air in there  mate  because he just sounds like he's breathing out. This hasn't been edited  this is him. And finally we have     this is a human female laughing. And laughter can take us to some pretty odd places in terms of making noises. She actually says   Oh my God  what is that   in French. We're all kind of with her. I have no idea. Now  to understand laughter  you have to look at a part of the body that psychologists and neuroscientists don't normally spend much time looking at  which is the ribcage  and it doesn't seem terribly exciting  but actually you're all using  your ribcage all the time. What you're all doing  at the moment with your ribcage  and don't stop doing it  is breathing. So you use the intercostal muscles  the muscles between your ribs  to bring air in and out of your lungs just by expanding and contracting your ribcage  and if I was to put a strap  around the outside of your chest called a breath belt  and just look  at that movement  you see a rather gentle sinusoidal movement  so that's breathing. You're all doing it. Don't stop. As soon as you start talking  you start using your breathing completely differently. So what I'm doing now is you see something much more like this. In talking  you use very fine movements of the ribcage to squeeze the air out    and in fact  we're the only animals that can do this. It's why we can talk at all. Now  both talking and breathing has a mortal enemy  and that enemy is laughter  because what happens when you laugh is those same muscles start to contract very regularly  and you get this very marked sort of zig zagging  and that's just squeezing the air out of you. It literally is that basic a way of making a sound. You could be stamping on somebody  it's having the same effect. You're just squeezing air out  and each of those contractions    Ha     gives you a sound. And as the contractions run together  you can get these spasms  and that's when you start getting these     Wheezing     things happening. I'm brilliant at this.  Laughter  Now  in terms of the science of laughter  there isn't very much  but it does turn out that pretty much everything we think we know about laughter is wrong. So it's not at all unusual  for example  to hear people to say humans are the only animals that laugh. Nietzsche thought that humans are the only animals that laugh. In fact  you find laughter throughout the mammals. It's been well described and well observed in primates  but you also see it in rats  and wherever you find it    humans  primates  rats    you find it associated with things like tickling. That's the same for humans. You find it associated with play  and all mammals play. And wherever you find it  it's associated with interactions. So Robert Provine  who has done a lot of work on this  has pointed out that you are    times  more likely to laugh if you are with somebody else than if you're on your own  and where you find most laughter is in social interactions like conversation. So if you ask human beings   When do you laugh   they'll talk about comedy and they'll talk about humor and they'll talk about jokes. If you look at when they laugh  they're laughing with their friends. And when we laugh with people  we're hardly ever actually laughing at jokes. You are laughing to show people that you understand them  that you agree with them  that you're part of the same group as them. You're laughing to show that you like them. You might even love them. You're doing all that at the same time as talking to them  and the laughter is doing a lot of that emotional work for you. Something that Robert Provine has pointed out  as you can see here  and the reason why we were laughing when we heard those funny laughs at the start  and why I was laughing when I found my parents laughing  is that it's an enormously behaviorally contagious effect. You can catch laughter from somebody else  and you are more likely to catch laughter off somebody else if you know them. So it's still modulated by this social context. You have to put humor to one side and think about the social  meaning of laughter because that's where its origins lie. Now  something I've got very interested in is different kinds of laughter  and we have some neurobiological evidence about how human beings vocalize that suggests there might be two kinds of laughs that we have. So it seems possible that the neurobiology for helpless  involuntary laughter  like my parents lying on the floor screaming about a silly song  might have a different basis to it than some of that more polite social laughter that you encounter  which isn't horrible laughter  but it's behavior somebody is doing as part of their communicative act to you  part of their interaction with you  they are choosing to do this. In our evolution  we have developed two different ways of vocalizing. Involuntary vocalizations are part of an older system than the more voluntary vocalizations like the speech I'm doing now. So we might imagine that laughter might actually have two different roots. So I've been looking at this in more detail. To do this  we've had to make recordings of people laughing  and we've had to do whatever it takes to make people laugh  and we got those same people to produce more posed  social laughter. So imagine your friend told a joke  and you're laughing because you like your friend  but not really because the joke's all that. So I'm going to play you  a couple of those. I want you to tell me if you think this laughter is real laughter  or if you think it's posed. So is this involuntary laughter or more voluntary laughter  What does that sound like to you  Audience  Posed. Sophie Scott  Posed  Posed. How about this one  I'm the best. Not really. No  that was helpless laughter  and in fact  to record that  all they had to do was record me watching one of my friends listening to something I knew she wanted to laugh at  and I just started doing this. What you find is that people are good at telling the difference between real and posed laughter. They seem to be different things to us. Interestingly  you see something quite similar with chimpanzees. Chimpanzees laugh differently if they're being tickled than if they're playing with each other  and we might be seeing something like that here  involuntary laughter  tickling laughter  being different from social laughter. They're acoustically very different. The real laughs are longer. They're higher in pitch. When you start laughing hard  you start squeezing air out from your lungs under much higher pressures than you could ever produce voluntarily. For example  I could never pitch my voice that high to sing. Also  you start to get these sort of contractions and weird whistling sounds  all of which mean that real laughter is extremely easy  or feels extremely easy to spot. In contrast  posed laughter  we might think it sounds a bit fake. Actually  it's not  it's actually an important social cue. We use it a lot  we're choosing to laugh in a lot of situations  and it seems to be its own thing. So  for example  you find nasality in posed laughter  that kind of  ha ha ha ha ha  sound that you never get  you could not do  if you were laughing involuntarily. So they do seem to be genuinely these two different sorts of things. We took it into the scanner to see how brains respond when you hear laughter. And when you do this  this is a really boring experiment. We just played people real and posed laughs. We didn't tell them it was a study on laughter. We put other sounds in there  to distract them  and all they're doing is lying listening to sounds. We don't tell them to do anything. Nonetheless  when you hear real laughter and when you hear posed laughter  the brains are responding completely differently  significantly differently. What you see in the regions in blue  which lies in auditory cortex  are the brain areas that respond more to the real laughs  and what seems to be the case  when you hear somebody laughing involuntarily  you hear sounds you would never hear in any other context. It's very unambiguous  and it seems to be associated with greater auditory processing of these novel sounds. In contrast  when you hear somebody laughing in a posed way  what you see are these regions in pink  which are occupying brain areas associated with mentalizing  thinking about what somebody else is thinking. And I think what that means is  even if you're having your brain scanned  which is completely boring and not very interesting  when you hear somebody going   A ha ha ha ha ha   you're trying to work out why they're laughing. Laughter is always meaningful. You are always trying to understand it in context  even if  as far as you are concerned  at that point in time  it has not necessarily anything to do with you  you still want to know why those people are laughing. Now  we've had the opportunity to look  at how people hear real and posed laughter across the age range. So this is an online experiment we ran with the Royal Society  and here we just asked people two questions. First of all  they heard some laughs  and they had to say  how real  or posed do these laughs sound  The real laughs are shown in red and the posed laughs are shown in blue. What you see is there is a rapid onset. As you get older  you get better and better at spotting real laughter. So six year olds are at chance  they can't really hear the difference. By the time you are older  you get better  but interestingly  you do not hit peak performance in this dataset until you are in your late   s and early   s. You don't understand laughter fully by the time you hit puberty. You don't understand laughter fully by the time your brain has matured at the end of your teens. You're learning about laughter throughout your entire early adult life. If we turn the question around and now say not  what does the laughter sound like in terms of being real or posed  but we say  how much does this laughter make you want to laugh  how contagious is this laughter to you  we see a different profile. And here  the younger you are  the more you want to join in when you hear laughter. Remember me laughing with my parents when I had no idea what was going on. You really can see this. Now everybody  young and old  finds the real laughs more contagious than the posed laughs  but as you get older  it all becomes  less contagious to you. Now  either we're all just becoming really grumpy as we get older  or it may mean that as you understand laughter better  and you are getting better at doing that  you need more than just hearing people laugh to want to laugh. You need the social stuff there. So we've got a very interesting behavior about which a lot of our lay assumptions are incorrect  but I'm coming to see that actually there's even more to laughter than it's an important social emotion we should look at  because it turns out people are phenomenally nuanced in terms of how we use laughter. There's a really lovely set of studies coming out from Robert Levenson's lab in California  where he's doing a longitudinal study with couples. He gets married couples  men and women  into the lab  and he gives them stressful conversations to have while he wires them up to a polygraph so he can see them becoming stressed. So you've got the two of them in there  and he'll say to the husband   Tell me something that your wife does that irritates you.  And what you see is immediately    just run that one through your head briefly  you and your partner    you can imagine everybody gets a bit more stressed as soon as that starts. You can see physically  people become more stressed. What he finds is that the couples who manage that feeling of stress with laughter  positive emotions like laughter  not only immediately become less stressed  they can see them physically feeling better  they're dealing with this unpleasant situation better together  they are also the couples that report high levels of satisfaction in their relationship and they stay together for longer. So in fact  when you look at close relationships  laughter is a phenomenally useful index of how people are regulating their emotions together. We're not just emitting it at each other to show that we like each other  we're making ourselves feel better together. Now  I don't think this is going to be limited to romantic relationships. I think this is probably going to be a characteristic of close emotional relationships such as you might have with friends  which explains my next clip  which is of a YouTube video of some young men in the former East Germany on making a video to promote their heavy metal band  and it's extremely macho  and the mood is very serious  and I want you to notice what happens in terms of laughter when things go wrong and how quickly that happens  and how that changes the mood. He's cold. He's about to get wet. He's got swimming trunks on  got a towel. Ice. What might possibly happen  Video starts. Serious mood. And his friends are already laughing. They are already laughing  hard. He's not laughing yet. He's starting to go now. And now they're all off. They're on the floor. The thing I really like about that is it's all very serious until he jumps onto the ice  and as soon as he doesn't go through the ice  but also there isn't blood and bone everywhere  his friends start laughing. And imagine if that had played him out with him standing there going   No seriously  Heinrich  I think this is broken   we wouldn't enjoy watching that. That would be stressful. Or if he was running around with a visibly broken leg laughing  and his friends are going   Heinrich  I think we need to go to the hospital now   that also wouldn't be funny. The fact that the laughter works  it gets him from a painful  embarrassing  difficult situation  into a funny situation  into what we're  actually enjoying there  and I think that's  a really interesting use  and it's actually happening all the time. For example  I can remember something like this happening at my father's funeral. We weren't jumping around on the ice in our underpants. We're not Canadian. These events are always difficult  I had a relative who was being a bit difficult  my mum was not in a good place  and I can remember finding myself just before the whole thing started telling this story about something that happened in a     s sitcom  and I just thought at the time  I don't know why I'm doing this  and what I realized I was doing was I was coming up with something from somewhere I could use to make her laugh together with me. It was a very basic reaction to find some reason we can do this. We can laugh together. We're going to get through this. We're going to be okay. And in fact  all of us are doing this all the time. You do it so often  you don't even notice it. Everybody underestimates how often they laugh  and you're doing something  when you laugh with people  that's actually letting you access a really ancient evolutionary system that mammals have evolved to make and maintain social bonds  and clearly to regulate emotions  to make ourselves feel better. It's not something specific to humans    it's a really ancient behavior which really helps us regulate how we feel and makes us feel better. In other words  when it comes to laughter  you and me  baby  ain't nothing  but mammals.  Laughter  Thank you. Thank you.  Applause
