Fifty four percent of the world's population lives in our cities. In developing countries  one third of that population is living in slums. Seventy five percent of global energy consumption occurs in our cities  and    percent of gas emissions that cause global warming come from our cities. So things that you and I might think about as global problems  like climate change  the energy crisis or poverty  are really  in many ways  city problems. They will not be solved unless people who live in cities  like most of us  actually start doing a better job  because right now  we are  not doing a very good one. And that becomes very clear when we look into three aspects of city life  first  our citizens' willingness to engage with democratic institutions  second  our cities' ability to really include all of their residents  and lastly  our own ability to live fulfilling and happy lives. When it comes to engagement  the data is very clear. Voter turnout around the world peaked in the late '  s  and it has been declining at a pace that we have never seen before  and if those numbers are bad at the national level  at the level of our cities  they are just dismal. In the last two years  two of the world's most consolidated  oldest democracies  the U.S. and France  held nationwide municipal elections. In France  voter turnout hit a record low. Almost    percent of voters decided not to show up. In the U.S.  the numbers were even scarier. In some American cities  voter turnout was close to five percent. I'll let that sink in for a second. We're talking about democratic cities in which    percent of people decided that it was not important to elect their leaders. The city of L.A.  a city of four million people  elected its mayor with just a bit over         votes. That was the lowest turnout the city had seen in     years. Right here  in my city of Rio  in spite of mandatory voting  almost    percent of the voting population chose to either annul their votes or stay home and pay a fine in the last mayoral elections. When it comes to inclusiveness  our cities are not the best cases of success either  and again  you don't need to look very far in order to find proof of that. The city of Rio is incredibly unequal. This is Leblon. Leblon is the city's richest neighborhood. And this is Complexo do Alem o. This is where over        of the city's poorest residents live. Leblon has an HDI  a Human Development Index  of .   . That is higher than Norway  Switzerland or Sweden. Complexo do Alem o has an HDI of .   . It sits somewhere in between the HDI of Algeria and Gabon. So Rio  like so many cities across the global South  is a place where you can go from northern Europe to sub Saharan Africa in the space of    minutes. If you drive  that is. If you take public transit  it's about two hours. And lastly  perhaps most importantly  cities  with the incredible wealth of relations that they enable  could be the ideal places for human happiness to flourish. We like being around people. We are social animals. Instead  countries where urbanization has already peaked seem to be the very countries in which cities have stopped making us happy. The United States population has suffered from a general decrease in happiness for the past three decades  and the main reason is this. The American way of building cities has caused good quality public spaces to virtually disappear in many  many American cities  and as a result  they have seen a decline of relations  of the things that make us happy. Many studies show an increase in solitude and a decrease in solidarity  honesty  and social and civic participation. So how do we start building cities that make us care  Cities that value their most important asset  the incredible diversity of the people who live in them  Cities that make us happy  Well  I believe that if we want to change what our cities look like  then we really have to change the decision making processes that have given us the results  that we have right now. We need a participation revolution  and we need it fast. The idea of voting as our  only exercise in citizenship does not make sense anymore. People are tired of only being treated as empowered individuals every few years when it's time to delegate that power to someone else. If the protests that swept Brazil in June      have taught us anything  it's that every time we try to exercise our power outside of an electoral context  we are beaten up  humiliated or arrested. And this needs to change  because when it does  not only will people re engage with the structures of representation  but also complement these structures with direct  effective  and  collective decision making  decision making of the kind that attacks inequality by its very inclusive nature  decision making of the kind that can change our cities into better places for us to live. But there is a catch  obviously  Enabling widespread participation and redistributing power can be a logistical nightmare  and there's where technology can play an incredibly helpful role  by making it easier for people to organize  communicate and make decisions without having to be in the same room at the same time. Unfortunately for us  when it comes to fostering democratic processes  our city governments have not used technology to its full potential. So far  most city governments have been effective at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors who serve authorities with data on the city  potholes  fallen trees or broken lamps. They have also  to a lesser extent  invited people to participate in improving the outcome of decisions that were already made for them  just like my mom when I was eight and she told me that I had a choice  I had to be in bed by   p.m.  but I could choose my pink pajamas or my blue pajamas. That's not participation  and in fact  governments have not been very good at using technology to enable participation on what matters   the way we allocate our budget  the way we occupy our land  and the way we manage our natural resources. Those are the kinds of decisions that can actually impact global problems that manifest themselves in our cities. The good news is  and I do have good news to share with you  we don't need to wait for governments to do this. I have reason to believe that it's possible for citizens to build their own structures of participation. Three years ago  I cofounded an organization called Meu Rio  and we make it easier for people in the city of Rio to organize around causes and places that they care about in their own city  and have an impact on those causes and places every day. In these past three years  Meu Rio grew to a network of         citizens of Rio. About    percent of those  members are young people aged    to   . That is one in every    young people of that age in Rio today. Amongst our members is this adorable little girl  Bia  to your right  and Bia was just    years old when she started a campaign using one of our tools to save her model public school from demolition. Her school actually ranks among the best public schools in the country  and it was going to be demolished by the Rio de Janeiro state government to build  I kid you not  a parking lot for the World Cup right before the event happened. Bia started a campaign  and we even watched her school      through webcam monitoring  and many months afterwards  the government changed their minds. Bia's school stayed in place. There's also Jovita. She's an amazing woman whose daughter went missing about    years ago  and since then  she has been looking for her daughter. In that process  she found out that first  she was not alone. In the last year alone              people disappeared in the state of Rio. But she also found out that in spite of that  Rio had no centralized intelligence system for solving missing persons cases. In other Brazilian cities  those systems have helped solve up to    percent of missing persons cases. She started a campaign  and after the secretary of  security got        emails from people asking him to do this  he responded  and started to build a police unit specializing in those cases. It was open to the public at the end of last month  and Jovita was there giving interviews and being very fancy. And then  there is Leandro. Leandro is an amazing guy in a slum in Rio  and he created a recycling project in the slum. At the end of last year  December     he received an eviction order by the Rio de Janeiro state government giving him two weeks to leave the space that he had been using for two years. The plan was to hand it over to a developer  who planned to turn it into a construction site. Leandro started a campaign using one of our tools  the Pressure Cooker  the same one that Bia and Jovita used  and the state government changed their minds before Christmas Eve. These stories make me happy  but not just because they have happy endings. They make me happy because they are happy beginnings. The teacher and parent community at Bia's school is looking for other ways they could improve that space even further. Leandro has ambitious plans to take his model to other low income communities in Rio  and Jovita is volunteering at the police unit that she helped created. Bia  Jovita and Leandro are living examples of something that citizens and city  governments around the world need to know  We are ready. As citizens  we are ready to decide on our common destinies  because we know that the way we distribute power says a lot about how we actually value everyone  and because we know that enabling and participating in local politics is a sign that we truly care about our relations to one another  and we are ready to do this in cities around the world right now. With the Our Cities network  the Meu Rio team hopes to share what we have learned with other people who want to create similar initiatives in their own cities. We have already started doing it in S o Paulo with incredible results  and want to take it to cities around the world through a network of citizen centric  citizen led organizations that can inspire us  challenge us  and remind us to demand real participation in our city lives. It is up to us to decide whether we want schools or parking lots  community driven recycling projects or construction sites  loneliness or solidarity  cars or buses  and it is our responsibility to do that now  for ourselves  for our families  for the people who make our lives worth living  and for the incredible creativity  beauty  and wonder that make our cities  in spite of all of their problems  the greatest invention of our time. Obrigado. Thank you. You know  it's a big privilege for me to be working in one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world  the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. These islands   Mauritius  Rodrigues  and R union   along with the island of Madagascar  they are blessed with unique plants found nowhere else in the world. And today I will tell you  about five of them and their particular features and why these plants are so unique. Take a look at this plant. I call it benjoin in the local vernacular  and the botanical name  is Terminalia bentzoe  subspecies bentzoe. This subspecies is endemic to Mauritius  and its particular feature is its heterophylly. What do I mean by heterophylly  It's that the same plant has got leaves that are different shapes and sizes. Now  these plants have evolved very far away from the mainland  and within specific ecosystems. Often  these particular features have evolved as a response to the threat presented by the local fauna  in this case  grazing tortoises. Tortoises are known to have poor eyesight  and as such  they tend to avoid the plants they don't recognize. So this evolutionary  foil safeguards the plant against these rather cute animals  and protects it and of course  ensures its survival. Now the question you're  probably asking yourself is  why is she telling us all these stories  The reason for that is that we tend to overlook the diversity and the variety of the natural world. These particular habitats are unique and they are host to a whole lot of plants. We don't realize how valuable and how precious these resources are  and yet  through our insouciance  we keep on destroying them. We're all familiar with the macro impact of urbanization  climate change  resource exploitation  but when that one last plant   or animal for that matter   when that very last specimen has disappeared from the face of this Earth  we would have lost an entire subset of the Earth's biology  and with it  important plants  with medicinal potential or which could have ingredients that would speak to the cosmetic  nutrition  pharma  and even the ethno veterinary sectors  be gone forever. And here we have a very prime example of the iconic dodo  which comes from Mauritius  and  of course  we know is  now a symbol of extinction. We know plants have a  fundamental role to play. Well  first of all  they feed us and they also give us  the oxygen we breathe  but plants are also the source of important  biologically active ingredients that we should be studying very carefully  because human societies over the millennia  they have developed important knowledge  cultural traditions  and important plant based medicinal resources. Here's a data point   .  percent of the entire land surface is home to    percent of the species of higher plants     percent of the species of vertebrates  and this  .  percent represents the    biodiversity hotspots in the world  and this  .  percent of the entire land surface already provides for    percent of the ecosystem services that vulnerable people depend on. And as you can see  the island of Mauritius where I work and where I live  belongs to one such biodiversity hotspot  and I study the unique plants on the island for their  biomedical applications. Now  let's go back again to that first plant I showed you  the one  of course  with  different shaped leaves and different sizes  Terminalia bentzoe  subspecies bentzoe  a plant only found in Mauritius. Now  the local people  they used a decoction of the leaves against infectious diseases. Now our work  that is  the scientific validation of  this traditional information  has shown that precisely that leaf extract shows activity  potent activity  against a wide range of bacteria that could be pathogenic to humans. Now  could this plant be the answer to antibiotic resistance  You know  antibiotic resistance is proving to be a big challenge globally. While we may not be sure  one thing is certain  we will not want this plant to disappear. But the harsh reality is that this particular plant is in fact considered to be vulnerable in its natural habitat. This brings me to another example. This bush here is known as baume de l'ile plate in the local vernacular. The botanical name is Psiadia arguta. It's a plant which is rare  which is endemic to Mauritius. It used to grow on the mainland  but through the sheer  pressures of urbanization has been pushed out of the mainland  and we've managed to bring it back from the brink of extinction by developing in vitro plants which are now growing in the wild. Now  one thing I must  point out straightaway is that not all plants can be developed in vitro. While we humans  we are  happy in our comfort zone  these plants also need their ecosystem to be preserved  and they don't react   endemic plants don't react to very harsh  changes in their ecosystem  and yet we know what are the challenges that climate change  for example  is posing to these plants. Now  the local people again use the leaves in traditional medicine against respiratory problems. Now  our preliminary labwork on the leaf extract has shown that precisely these  leaves contain ingredients that are very close   in terms of structures  chemical structures  to those medicines which are sold in the chemist's shop against asthma. So who knows what humanity will benefit from should this plant decide  to reveal all its secrets. Now  I come from the developing world where we are forever being  challenged with this issue of population explosion. Africa is the continent  which is getting younger  and whenever one talks  about population explosion  one talks about the issue of food security as being the other side of the same coin. Now this plant here  the baobab  could be part of the answer. It's an underutilized  neglected food plant. It defines the landscape of West Africa  where it is known as the tree of life  and later on I will tell you why the Africans consider it to be the tree of life. Now interestingly  there are many legends which are associated with this plant. Because of its sheer size  it was meant to be lording over lesser plants  so God didn't like this arrogance  uprooted it  and planted it upside down  hence its particular shape. And if you look at this tree again within the African context  in West Africa  it's known  as the palaver tree  because it performs great social functions. Now if you have a problem in the community  meeting under the palaver tree with the chiefs or the tribesmen would be synonymous to trying to find a solution to that particular problem  and also to reinforce trust and respect among members of the community. From the scientific point of view  there are eight species of baobab in the world. There's one from Africa  one from Australia  and six are endemic to the island of Madagascar. The one I have showed you is the one from Africa  Adansonia digitata. Now  the flower  this  beautiful white flower  it opens at night  is pollinated by bats  and it gives rise to the fruit which is curiously known as the monkey apple. The monkeys are not stupid animals. They know what's good for them. Now  if you open the fruit of the baobab  you'll see a white  floury pulp  which is very rich in nutrients and has got protein  more protein than in human milk. Yes  you heard right  more protein than in human milk. And this is one of the reasons why the nutrition companies of this world  they are looking for this fruit to provide what we know as reinforced food. The seeds give an oil  a very stable oil which is sought after  by the cosmetic industry to give to produce body lotions  for example. And if you look at the trunk  the trunk  of course  safeguards water  which is often harvested by a thirsty traveler  and the leaves are used in traditional medicine against infectious disease. Now  you can see now why the Africans consider it to be the tree of life. It's a complete plant  and in fact  the sheer size of these trees is hiding a massive potential  not only for the pharma  nutrition  and the cosmetic industry. What I have showed you here is only the species from Africa  Adansonia digitata. We have six species yet in Madagascar  and we don't know what  is the potential of this plant  but one thing we know is that the flora is considered to be  threatened with extinction. Let me take you to Africa again  and introduce you to one of my very favorite  the resurrection plant. Now here you'll find that even Jesus has competition. Now  this plant here has developed remarkable tolerance to drought  which enables it to withstand up to    percent dehydration  over the period of a year without damage  and yet it can regenerate  itself almost completely overnight  over    hours  and flower. Now  us human beings  we're always on the lookout for the elixir of youth. We don't want to get old  and rightly so. Why should we  especially if you can afford it  And this gives you an indication of what the plant looks like before. Now  if you are an inexperienced gardener  the first thing you'll do  when you visit the garden is to uproot this plant because it's dead. But if you water it  this is what you get. Absolutely amazing. Now  if you look at our aging process  the aging process is in fact the loss of water from the upper epidermis  resulting in wrinkling as we know it  especially women  we are so conscious of this. And this plant  in fact  is giving  the cosmetic chemists very important ingredients that are actually finding ways to slow down the aging process and at the same time reinforce the cells against the onslaught of environmental toxins. Now  these four examples I have just given you are just a very tiny reminder as to how our health and our survival are closely linked to the health and the resilience of our ecosystem  and why we should be very careful about preserving biodiversity. Every time a forest is cut down  every time a marsh is filled in  it is a potential lab that goes with it  and which we will never  ever recover. And I know what I'm talking about  coming from Mauritius and missing the dodo. Let me finish with just one last example. Conservation issues are normally guided towards rare  endemic plants  but what we call exotic plants  that is  the ones which grow in many different habitats across the world  they also need to be considered. You know why  Because the environment plays a very important role in modifying the composition of that plant. So let's take a look at this plant here  Centella asiatica. It's a weed. We call it a weed. Now  Centella asiatica  grows across the world in many different habitats    in Africa  in Asia   and this plant has been instrumental in providing a solution  to that dreadful disease called leprosy in Madagascar in the     s. Now  while Centella  grows across the world   in Africa  in Asia    the best quality Centella comes from Madagascar  because that Centella contains the three vital ingredients which are sought after by the pharma and the cosmetic companies. And the cosmetic companies  are already using it to make regenerating cream. Now  there is an ancient saying that for every disease known to mankind  there is a plant to cure it. Now  you may not  believe in ancient sayings. You may think they're obsolete now that our science and  technology are so powerful. So you may look on Centella as being an insignificant  humble weed  which  if destroyed  won't be missed. But you know  there is no such thing as a weed. It's a plant. It's a living biological lab that may well have answers to the question that we may have  but we have to ensure that it has the right to live. Thank you. I grew up diagnosed as phobically shy  and  like at least    other people in a room of this size  I was a stutterer. Do you dare raise your hand  And it sticks with us. It really does stick with us  because when we are treated that way  we feel invisible sometimes  or talked around and at. And as I started to look at people  which is mostly all I did  I noticed that some people really wanted attention and recognition. Remember  I was young then. So what did they do  What we still do perhaps too often. We talk about ourselves. And yet there are other people I observed who had what I called a mutuality mindset. In each situation  they found a way to talk about us and create that  us  idea. So my idea to reimagine the world is to see it one where we all become greater opportunity makers with and for others. There's no greater opportunity or call for action for us now than to become opportunity makers who use best talents together more often for the greater good and accomplish things we couldn't have done on our own. And I want to talk to you about that  because even more than giving  even more than giving  is the capacity for us to do something smarter together for the greater good that lifts us both up and that can scale. That's why I'm sitting here. But I also want to point something else out  Each one of you is better than anybody else at something. That disproves that popular notion that if you're the smartest person in the room  you're in the wrong room. So let me tell you about a Hollywood party I went to a couple years back  and I met this up and coming actress  and we were soon talking about something that we both felt passionately about  public art. And she had the fervent belief that every new building in Los Angeles should have public art in it. She wanted a regulation for it  and she fervently started   who is here from Chicago    she fervently started talking about these bean shaped reflective sculptures in Millennium Park  and people would walk up to it and they'd smile in the reflection of it  and they'd pose and they'd vamp and they'd take selfies together  and they'd laugh. And as she was talking  a  thought came to my mind. I said   I know someone you ought to meet. He's getting out of San Quentin  in a couple of weeks     and he shares your fervent desire that art should engage and enable people to connect.  He spent five years in solitary  and I met him because I gave a speech at San Quentin  and he's articulate and he's rather easy on  the eyes because he's buff. He had workout regime he did every day. I think she was following me at that point. I said   He'd be an unexpected ally.  And not just that. There's James. He's an architect and he's a professor  and he loves place making  and place making is when you have those mini plazas and those urban walkways and where they're dotted with art  where people draw and  come up and talk sometimes. I think they'd make good allies. And indeed they were. They met together. They prepared. They spoke in front of the  Los Angeles City Council. And the council members not only passed the regulation  half of them came down and asked to pose with them afterwards. They were startling   compelling and credible. You can't buy that. What I'm asking you to consider is what kind of opportunity  makers we might become  because more than wealth or fancy titles or a lot of contacts  it's our capacity to connect around each other's  better side and bring it out. And I'm not saying this is easy  and I'm sure many of you have made the wrong moves too about who you wanted to connect with  but what I want to suggest is  this is an opportunity. I started thinking about it way back when I was a  Wall Street Journal reporter and I was in Europe and I was supposed to cover trends and trends that transcended business or politics or lifestyle. So I had to have contacts in different worlds very different than mine  because otherwise you couldn't spot the trends. And third  I had to write the story in a way stepping into the reader's shoes  so they could see how these  trends could affect their lives. That's what opportunity makers do. And here's a strange thing  Unlike an increasing number of Americans who are working and living  and playing with people who think exactly like them because we then become more rigid and extreme  opportunity makers are actively seeking situations with people unlike them  and they're building relationships  and because they do that  they have trusted relationships where they can bring the right team in and recruit them to solve a  problem better and faster and seize more opportunities. They're not affronted by differences  they're fascinated by them  and that is a huge shift in mindset  and once you feel it  you  want it to happen a lot more. This world is calling out for us  to have a collective mindset  and I believe in doing that. It's especially important now. Why is it important now  Because things can be devised like drones and drugs and data collection  and they can be devised by more people and cheaper ways for beneficial purposes and then  as we know from the news every day  they can be used for dangerous ones. It calls on us  each of us  to a higher calling. But here's the icing on the cake  It's not just the first opportunity that you do with somebody else that's probably your greatest  as an institution or an individual. It's after you've had that experience and you trust each other. It's the unexpected things that you devise later on you never could have predicted. For example  Marty is the husband  of that actress I mentioned  and he watched them  when they were practicing  and he was soon talking to Wally  my friend the ex con  about that exercise regime. And he thought  I have a set of racquetball courts. That guy could teach it. A lot of people who work there are members at my courts. They're frequent travelers. They could practice in their hotel room  no equipment provided. That's how Wally got hired. Not only that  years later he was also teaching racquetball. Years after that  he was teaching the racquetball teachers. What I'm suggesting is  when  you connect with people around a shared interest and action  you're accustomed to serendipitous things happening into the future  and I think that's what we're looking at. We open ourselves up to those opportunities  and in this room  are key players in technology  key players who are uniquely positioned to do this  to scale systems and projects together. So here's what I'm calling for you to do. Remember the three traits of opportunity makers. Opportunity makers keep honing their top strength and they become pattern seekers. They get involved in different  worlds than their worlds so they're trusted and they  can see those patterns  and they communicate to connect around sweet spots of shared interest. So what I'm asking you is  the world is hungry. I truly believe  in my firsthand experience  the world is hungry for us to unite together as opportunity makers and to emulate those behaviors as so many of you already do   I know that firsthand   and to reimagine a world where we use our best talents together more often to accomplish greater things together than we could on our own. Just remember  as Dave Liniger once said   You can't succeed coming to the potluck with only a fork.  Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  If there's any power in design  that's the power of synthesis. The more complex the problem  the more the need for simplicity. So allow me to share three cases where we tried to apply design's power of synthesis. Let's start with the global challenge of urbanization. It's a fact that people are moving towards cities. and even if counterintuitive  it's good news. Evidence shows that people are better off in cities. But there's a problem that I would call the   S  menace  The scale  speed  and scarcity of means with which we will have to respond to this phenomenon has no precedence in history. For you to have an idea  out of the three billion  people living in cities today  one billion are under the line of poverty. By       out of the five billion people that will be living in cities  two billion are going to  be under the line of poverty. That means that we will have to build a one million person city per week with        dollars per family during the next    years. A one million person city per week with        dollars per family. If we don't solve this equation  it is not that people  will stop coming to cities. They will come anyhow  but they will live in slums  favelas and informal settlements. So what to do  Well  an answer may come from favelas and slums themselves. A clue could be in this  question we were asked    years ago. We were asked to accommodate     families that had been occupying illegally half a hectare in the center of the city of Iquique  in the north of Chile using a         subsidy with which we had to buy the land  provide the infrastructure  and build the houses that   in the best of the cases  would be of around    square meters. And by the way  they said  the cost of the land  because it's in the center of the city  is three times more than what social housing can normally afford. Due to the difficulty of the question  we decided to include the families in the process of understanding the constraints  and we started a participatory design process  and testing what was  available there in the market. Detached houses     families could be accommodated. Row houses     families.       families   The only way to accommodate all of them was by building in height  and they threatened us to go on a hunger strike if we even dared to offer this as a solution  because they could not  make the tiny apartments expand. So the conclusion with the families   and this is important   not our conclusion   with the families  was that we had a problem. We had to innovate. So what did we do  Well  a middle class family lives reasonably well in around    square meters  but when there's no money  what the market does is to reduce the size of the house to    square meters. What we said was  what if  instead of thinking of    square meters as a small house  why don't we consider it half of a good one  When you rephrase the problem as half of a good house instead of a small one  the key question is  which half do we do  And we thought we had  to do with public money the half that families won't  be able to do individually. We identified five design conditions that belonged to the hard half of a house  and we went back to the  families to do two things  join forces and split tasks. Our design was something in between a building and a house. As a building  it could pay for expensive  well located land  and as a house  it could expand. If  in the process of not being expelled to the periphery while getting a house  families kept their  network and their jobs  we knew that the expansion  would begin right away. So we went from this initial social housing to a middle class unit achieved by families themselves within a couple of weeks. This was our first project in Iquique    years ago. This is our last project in Chile. Different designs  same principle  You provide the frame  and from then on  families take over. So the purpose of design  trying to understand and  trying to give an answer to the   S  menace  scale  speed  and scarcity  is to channel people's own building capacity. We won't solve the one million people per week equation unless we use people's own power for building. So  with the right design  slums and favelas may not be the problem but actually the only possible solution. The second case is how design can contribute to sustainability. In       we entered the competition for the Angelini Innovation Center  and the aim was to build the right environment for knowledge creation. It is accepted that for such an aim  knowledge creation  interaction among people   face to face contact  it's important  and we agreed on that. But for us  the question  of the right environment was a very literal question. We wanted to have a working space with the right light  with the right temperature  with the right air. So we asked ourselves  Does the typical office building help us in that sense  Well  how does that  building look  typically  It's a collection of floors  one on top of each other  with a core in the center with elevators  stairs   pipes  wires  everything  and then a glass skin on the outside that  due to direct sun radiation  creates a huge greenhouse effect inside. In addition to that  let's say a guy working on the seventh floor goes every single day  through the third floor  but has no idea what the guy on that floor is working on. So we thought  well  maybe  we have to turn this scheme inside out. And what we did was  let's have an open atrium  a hollowed core  the same collection of floors  but have the walls and the mass in the perimeter  so that when the sun hits  it's not impacting directly glass  but a wall. When you have an open atrium inside  you are able to see what others are doing from within the building  and you have a better way to control light  and when you place the mass and the walls in the perimeter  then you are preventing direct sun radiation. You may also open those windows and get cross ventilation. We just made those openings of such a scale that they could work as elevated squares  outdoor spaces throughout the entire height of the building. None of this is rocket science. You don't require sophisticated programming. It's not about technology. This is just archaic   primitive common sense  and by using common sense  we went from     kilowatts per square meter per year  which is the typical energy consumption for cooling a glass tower  to    kilowatts per square meter per year. So with the right design  sustainability is nothing but the rigorous use of common sense. Last case I would like  to share is how design can provide more comprehensive answers against natural disasters. You may know that Chile  in       was hit by an  .  Richter scale earthquake and tsunami  and we were called to work in the reconstruction of the Constituci n  in the southern part of the country. We were given     days  three months  to design almost everything  from public buildings to public space  street grid  transportation  housing  and mainly how to protect the city against future tsunamis. This was new in Chilean urban design  and there were in the  air a couple of alternatives. First one  Forbid installation on ground zero. Thirty million dollars spent mainly in land expropriation. This is exactly what's being discussed in Japan nowadays  and if you have a disciplined population like the Japanese  this may work  but we know that in Chile  this land is going to be  occupied illegally anyhow  so this alternative was  unrealistic and undesirable. Second alternative  build a big wall  heavy infrastructure to resist the energy of the waves. This alternative was conveniently lobbied by big building companies  because it meant    million  dollars in contracts  and was also politically preferred  because it required no land expropriation. But Japan proved that trying to resist the force of nature is useless. So this alternative was irresponsible. As in the housing process  we had to include the community in the way of finding a solution for this  and we started a participatory design process. Vote for Constituci n. Go to the Open House and express your options. Participate  Fisherman  I am a fisherman. Twenty five fishermen work for me. Where should I take them  To the forest  Man  So why can't we have a concrete defense  Done well  of course. Man    I am the history of Constituci n. And you come here to tell me that I cannot keep on living here  My whole family has lived here  I raised my children here  and my children will also  raise their children here. and my grandchildren  and everyone else will. But why are you imposing this on me  You  You are imposing this on me  In danger zone I am not authorized to build. He himself is saying that. Man    No  no  no  Nieves... Alejandro Aravena  I don't know if you were able to read the subtitles  but you can tell from the body language that participatory design is not a hippie  romantic  let's all dream together about  the future of the city kind of thing. It is actually    Applause  It is actually not even with the families trying to find the right answer. It is mainly trying to identify with precision what is the right question. There is nothing worse than answering well the wrong question. So it was pretty obvious after this process that  well  we chicken out here and go away because it's too tense  or we go even further in asking  what else is bothering you  What other problems do you have and you want us to take  care of now that the city will have to be rethought from scratch  And what they said was  look  fine to protect the city  against future tsunamis  we really appreciate  but the next one  is going to come in  what     years  But every single year  we have problems of flooding due to rain. In addition  we are in the middle of the forest region of the country  and our public space sucks. It's poor and it's scarce. And the origin of the city  our identity  is not really connected to the buildings that fell  it is connected to the river  but the river cannot be accessed publicly  because its shores are privately owned. So we thought that we had to produce a third alternative  and our approach was  against geographical threats  have geographical answers. What if  in between the city and the sea we have a forest  a forest that doesn't try to resist the energy of nature  but dissipates it by introducing friction  A forest that may be able to laminate the water and prevent the flooding  That may pay the historical debt of public space  and that may provide  finally  democratic access to the river. So as a conclusion of the participatory design  the alternative was validated politically and socially  but there was still the problem of the cost     million dollars. So what we did was a survey in the public investment system  and found out that there  were three ministries with three projects in  the exact same place  not knowing of the existence  of the other projects. The sum of them     million dollars. So design's power of synthesis is trying to make a more efficient use of the scarcest resource in cities  which is not money but coordination. By doing so  we were able to save four million dollars  and  that is why the forest is today under construction. So be it the force of self construction  the force of common sense  or the force of nature  all these forces need to be translated into form  and what that form is modeling and shaping is not cement  bricks  or wood. It is life itself. Design's power of synthesis is just an attempt to put at the innermost core of architecture the force of life. Thank you so much. Dre Urhahn  This theater  is built on Copacabana  which is the most famous  beach in the world  but    kilometers away from here in the North Zone of Rio lies a community called Vila Cruzeiro  and roughly        people live there. Now  the people here in Rio mostly know Vila Cruzeiro from the news  and unfortunately  news  from Vila Cruzeiro often is not good news. But Vila Cruzeiro is also the place where our story begins. Jeroen Koolhaas  Ten years  ago  we first came to Rio to shoot a documentary  about life in the favelas. Now  we learned that favelas  are informal communities. They emerged over the years when immigrants from the countryside came to the cities looking for work  like cities within the cities  known for problems like crime  poverty  and the violent drug war between police and the drug gangs. So what struck us was that these were communities that the people who lived there had built  with their own hands  without a master plan and like a giant work in progress. Where we're from  in Holland  everything is planned. We even have rules for  how to follow the rules. DU  So the last day of  filming  we ended up in Vila Cruzeiro  and  we were sitting down and we had a drink  and we were overlooking this hill with all these houses  and most of these houses looked unfinished  and they had walls of bare brick  but we saw some of these houses which were plastered and painted  and suddenly we had this idea  what would it look like if all these houses would be plastered and painted  And then we imagined one big design  one big work of art. Who would expect something like that in a place like this  So we thought  would that even be possible  So first we started to count the houses  but we soon lost count. But somehow the idea stuck. JK  We had a friend. He ran an NGO in Vila Cruzeiro. His name was Nanko  and he also liked the idea. He said   You know  everybody here would pretty much love  to have their houses plastered and painted. It's when a house is finished.  So he introduced us to the right people  and Vitor and Maurinho became our crew. We picked three houses in the center of the community and we start here. We made a few designs  and everybody liked this design of a boy flying a kite the best. So we started painting   and the first thing we did was to paint everything blue  and we thought that looked  already pretty good. But they hated it. The people who lived there really hated it. They said   What did you do  You painted our house in  exactly the same color as the police station.  In a favela  that is not a good thing. Also the same color as the prison cell. So we quickly went ahead  and we painted the boy  and then we thought we were finished  we were really happy  but still  it wasn't good because the little kids started coming up to us  and they said   You know   there's a boy flying the kite  but where is his kite   We said   Uh  it's art. You know  you have to imagine the kite.  And they said   No  no  no   we want to see the kite.  So we quickly installed a kite way up high on the hill  so that you could see  the boy flying the kite and you could actually see a kite. So the local news started writing about it  which was great  and then even The Guardian wrote about it   Notorious slum becomes open air gallery.  JK  So  encouraged by this success  we went back to Rio for a second project  and we stumbled upon this street. It was covered in concrete  to prevent mudslides  and somehow we saw a sort of river in it  and we imagined this river to be a river in Japanese style with koi carp swimming upstream. So we decided to paint that river  and we invited Rob Admiraal  who is a tattoo artist  and he specialized in the Japanese style. So little did we know that we would spend almost an entire year painting that river  together with Geovani and Robinho and Vitor  who lived nearby. And we even moved into the neighborhood when one of the guys that  lived on the street  Elias  told us that we could come  and live in his house  together with his family  which was fantastic. Unfortunately  during that time  another war broke out between the police and the drug gangs. We learned that during those times  people in communities  really stick together during these times of hardship  but we also learned a  very important element  the importance of barbecues.   Laughter  Because  when you throw a barbecue  it turns you from a guest into a host  so we decided to throw one almost every other week  and we got to know everybody  in the neighborhood. JK  We still had this  idea of the hill  though. DU  Yeah  yeah  we were talking about the scale of this  because this painting was incredibly big  and it was insanely detailed  and this process almost drove us completely insane ourselves. But we figured that maybe   during this process  all the time that we had  spent in the neighborhood was maybe actually even more important than the painting itself. JK  So after all that time  this hill  this idea was still there  and we started to make sketches  models  and we figured something out. We figured that our ideas  our designs had to be a little bit more simple than that last project so that we could paint with more people and cover more houses at the same time. And we had an opportunity to try that out in a community in the central part of Rio  which is called Santa Marta  and we made a design for this place which looked like this  and then we got people to go along with it because turns out that if  your idea is ridiculously big  it's easier to get people to  go along with this.  Laughter  And the people of Santa Marta got together and in a little over a month they turned that square into this. And this image somehow  went all over the world. DU  So then we received  an unexpected phone call from the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program  and they had this question if this idea  our approach  if this would actually  work in North Philly  which is one of the poorest neighborhoods in the United States. So we immediately said yes. We had no idea how  but it seemed like a very  interesting challenge  so we did exactly the  same as we did in Rio  and we moved into the neighborhood and started barbecuing. So the project took almost two years to complete  and we made individual designs for every single house on  the avenue that we painted  and we made these designs together with the local store owners   the building owners  and a team of about a dozen  young men and women. They were hired  and then they were trained as painters  and together they transformed their own neighborhood  the whole street  into a  giant patchwork of color. And at the end  the city of Philadelphia thanked every single one of them and gave them a merit for their accomplishment. JK  So now we had painted a whole street. How about we do this whole hill now  We started looking for funding  but instead  we just ran into questions  like  how many houses  are you going to paint  How many square meters is that  How much paint are you going to use  and how many people are you going to employ  And we did try for years to write plans for the funding and answer  all those questions  but then we thought  in order to answer all those questions  you have to know exactly  what you're going to do before you actually get there and start. And maybe it's a mistake  to think like that. It would lose some of the  magic that we had learned about that if you go somewhere and you spend time there  you can let the project grow organically and have a life of its own. DU  So what we did is we decided to take this  plan and strip it away from all the numbers and all the ideas and presumptions and just go back to the base idea  which was to transform this hill into a giant work of art. And instead of looking for funding  we started a crowdfunding campaign  and in a little over a month  more than       people put together and donated over         dollars. So for us  this was an amazing  moment  because now   because now we finally had the freedom to use all the lessons that we had learned and create a project that was built the same way that the favela was built  from the ground on up  bottom up  with no master plan. JK  So we went back   and we employed Angelo  and he's a local artist from Vila Cruzeiro  very talented guy  and he knows almost everybody there  and then we employed Elias  our former landlord who invited us into his house  and he's a master of construction. Together with them  we decided where to start. We picked this spot in Vila Cruzeiro  and houses are being plastered as we speak. And the good thing about them is that they are deciding which houses go next. They're even printing t shirts  they're putting up banners explaining everything to everybody  and talking to the press. This article about Angelo appeared. DU  So while this is happening  we are bringing this  idea all over the world. So  like the project we  did in Philadelphia  we are also invited to do workshops  for instance in Cura ao  and right now we're planning  a huge project in Haiti. JK  So the favela was not only the place where this idea started  it was also the place that made it possible to work without a master plan  because these communities are informal   this was the inspiration   and in a communal effort   together with the people  you can almost work like in an orchestra  where you can have a hundred instruments playing together to create a symphony. DU  So we want to thank everybody who wanted to become part of this dream and supported us along the way  and we are looking at continuing. JK  Yeah. And so one day pretty soon  when the colors start  going up on these walls  we hope more people will join us  and join this big dream  and maybe one day  the  whole of Vila Cruzeiro will be painted. DU  Thank you. The first patient to ever be  treated with an antibiotic was a policeman in Oxford. On his day off from work  he was scratched by a rose thorn while working in the garden. That small scratch became infected. Over the next few days   his head was swollen with abscesses  and in fact his eye was so infected that they had to take it out  and by February of       this poor man was on the verge of dying. He was at Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford  and fortunately for him  a small team of doctors led by a Dr. Howard Florey had managed to synthesize a very small amount of penicillin  a drug that had been discovered    years before by Alexander Fleming but had never actually been  used to treat a human  and indeed no one even  knew if the drug would work  if it was full of impurities  that would kill the patient  but Florey and his team figured if they had to use it   they might as well use it on someone who was going to die anyway. So they gave Albert Alexander  this Oxford policeman  the drug  and within    hours  he started getting better. His fever went down   his appetite came back. Second day  he was doing much better. They were starting to  run out of penicillin  so what they would do  was run with his urine across the road to re synthesize  the penicillin from his urine and give it back to him  and that worked. Day four  well on the way to recovery. This was a miracle. Day five  they ran out of penicillin  and the poor man died. So that story didn't end that well  but fortunately for  millions of other people  like this child who was treated  again in the early     s  who was again dying of a sepsis  and within just six days  you can see  recovered thanks to this  wonder drug  penicillin. Millions have lived  and global health has been transformed. Now  antibiotics have been used for patients like this  but they've also been  used rather frivolously in some instances  for treating someone  with just a cold or the flu  which they might not have  responded to an antibiotic  and they've also been  used in large quantities sub therapeutically  which means in small concentrations  to make chicken and hogs grow faster. Just to save a few pennies on the price of meat  we've spent a lot of  antibiotics on animals  not for treatment  not for sick animals  but primarily for growth promotion. Now  what did that lead us to  Basically  the massive use of antibiotics around the world has imposed such large selection pressure on bacteria that resistance is now a problem  because we've now selected for just the resistant bacteria. And I'm sure you've all read about this in the newspapers  you've seen this in every magazine that you come across  but I really want you to appreciate the significance of this problem. This is serious. The next slide I'm about to show you is  of carbapenem resistance in acinetobacter. Acinetobacter is a nasty hospital bug  and carbapenem is pretty much the strongest class of antibiotics that we can throw at this bug. And you can see in      this is the pattern of resistance  mostly under about    percent across the United States. Now watch what happens  when we play the video. So I don't know where you live  but wherever it is  it certainly is a lot worse now than it was in       and that is the problem of antibiotic resistance. It's a global issue affecting both rich and poor countries  and at the heart of it   you might say  well  isn't this really just a medical issue  If we taught doctors how not  to use antibiotics as much  if we taught patients how  not to demand antibiotics  perhaps this really wouldn't be an issue  and maybe the pharmaceutical companies should be working harder to develop more antibiotics. Now  it turns out that there's something  fundamental about antibiotics which makes it different from other drugs  which is that if I misuse antibiotics or I use antibiotics  not only am I affected but  others are affected as well  in the same way as if I  choose to drive to work or take a plane to go somewhere  that the costs I impose on others through global climate change go everywhere  and I don't necessarily take these costs into consideration. This is what economists might  call a problem of the commons  and the problem of the commons is exactly what we face in the case  of antibiotics as well  that we don't consider   and we  including individuals  patients  hospitals  entire health systems   do not consider the costs  that they impose on others by the way antibiotics are actually used. Now  that's a problem that's similar to another area that we all know about  which is of fuel use and energy  and of course energy use both depletes energy as well as leads to local pollution  and climate change. And typically  in the case of energy  there are two ways in which you can deal with the problem. One is  we can make better use of the oil that we have  and that's analogous to making better use of existing antibiotics  and we can do this in a number of ways that we'll talk about in a second  but the other option is the   drill  baby  drill  option  which in the case of antibiotics  is to go find new antibiotics. Now  these are not separate. They're related  because if we invest heavily in new oil wells  we reduce the incentives  for conservation of oil in the same way that's going  to happen for antibiotics. The reverse is also going  to happen  which is that if we use our antibiotics appropriately  we don't necessarily have  to make the investments in new drug development. And if you thought that these two were entirely  fully balanced between these two options  you might consider the fact that this is really a game that we're playing. The game is really one of coevolution  and coevolution is  in  this particular picture  between cheetahs and gazelles. Cheetahs have evolved to run faster  because if they didn't run faster  they wouldn't get any lunch. Gazelles have evolved to run faster because if they don't run faster  they would be lunch. Now  this is the game we're playing against the bacteria  except we're not the cheetahs  we're the gazelles  and the bacteria would  just in the course of this little talk  would have had kids and grandkids and figured out how to be resistant just by selection and trial and error  trying it over and over again. Whereas how do we stay  ahead of the bacteria  We have drug discovery processes  screening molecules  we have clinical trials  and then  when we think we have a drug  then we have the FDA regulatory process. And once we go through all of that  then we try to stay one step ahead of the bacteria. Now  this is clearly not a  game that can be sustained  or one that we can win by simply innovating to stay ahead. We've got to slow the pace of coevolution down  and there are ideas that we  can borrow from energy that are helpful in thinking about how we might want to do this in the case of antibiotics as well. Now  if you think about how we deal with energy pricing  for instance  we consider emissions taxes  which means we're imposing  the costs of pollution on people who actually use that energy. We might consider doing that for antibiotics as well  and perhaps that would make sure that antibiotics actually get used appropriately. There are clean energy subsidies  which are to switch to fuels which don't pollute as much or perhaps don't need fossil fuels. Now  the analogy here is  perhaps we need to move away from using antibiotics  and if you think about it  what are  good substitutes for antibiotics  Well  turns out that anything that reduces the need for the antibiotic would really work  so that could include improving hospital infection control or vaccinating people  particularly against  the seasonal influenza. And the seasonal flu is probably the biggest driver of antibiotic use  both in this country as well as in many other countries  and that could really help. A third option might include something like tradeable permits. And these seem like faraway scenarios  but if you consider the  fact that we might not have antibiotics for many  people who have infections  we might consider the fact that we might want to allocate who actually gets to use some of these antibiotics over others  and some of these might have to be on the basis of clinical need  but also on the basis of pricing. And certainly consumer education works. Very often  people overuse antibiotics or prescribe too much without necessarily knowing that they do so  and feedback mechanisms have been found to be useful  both on energy   When you tell someone that they're using a lot of energy during peak hour  they tend to cut back  and the same sort of example has been performed even in the case of antibiotics. A hospital in St. Louis basically would put up on a chart the names of surgeons in the ordering of how much antibiotics they'd used in the previous month  and this was purely an  informational feedback  there was no shaming  but essentially that provided  some information back to surgeons that maybe they could rethink how they were using antibiotics. Now  there's a lot that can be done on the supply side as well. If you look at the price of penicillin  the cost per day is about    cents. It's a fairly cheap drug. If you take drugs that have been introduced since then   linezolid or daptomycin   those are significantly more expensive  so to a world that has been used to paying    cents a day for antibiotics  the idea of paying     dollars per day seems like a lot. But what is that really telling us  That price is telling us that we should no longer take cheap  effective  antibiotics as a given into the foreseeable future  and that price is a signal to us that perhaps we need to be paying much more attention to conservation. That price is also a signal that maybe we need to start looking at other technologies  in the same way that  gasoline prices are a signal and an impetus  to  say  the development of electric cars. Prices are important signals and we need to pay attention  but we also need to consider the fact that although these high prices seem unusual for antibiotics  they're nothing compared to the price per day of some cancer drugs  which might save a patient's life only for a few months or perhaps a year  whereas antibiotics would potentially save a patient's life forever. So this is going to involve a whole new paradigm shift  and it's also a scary shift because in many parts of this country  in many parts of the world  the idea of paying     dollars for a day of antibiotic treatment is simply unimaginable. So we need to think about that. Now  there are backstop options  which is other alternative technologies that people are working on. It includes bacteriophages  probiotics  quorum sensing  synbiotics. Now  all of these are useful avenues to pursue  and they will become even more lucrative when the price of new  antibiotics starts going higher  and we've seen that the market does actually respond  and the government is now considering ways of subsidizing new  antibiotics and development. But there are challenges here. We don't want to just throw money at a problem. What we want to be able to do is invest in new antibiotics in ways that actually encourage appropriate use and sales of those antibiotics  and that really is the challenge here. Now  going back to these technologies  you all remember the line from that famous dinosaur film   Nature will find a way.  So it's not as if these are  permanent solutions. We really have to remember that  whatever the technology might be  that nature will find some  way to work around it. You might think  well   this is just a problem just with antibiotics and with bacteria  but it turns out that we  have the exact same identical problem in  many other fields as well  with multidrug resistant tuberculosis  which is a serious problem  in India and South Africa. Thousands of patients are dying because the second line drugs are so expensive  and in some instances  even those don't work and you have XDR TB. Viruses are becoming resistant. Agricultural pests. Malaria parasites. Right now  much of the world depends on one drug  artemisinin drugs  essentially to treat malaria. Resistance to artemisinin has already emerged  and if this were to become widespread  that puts at risk the single drug that we have to  treat malaria around the world in a way that's currently  safe and efficacious. Mosquitos develop resistance. If you have kids  you probably  know about head lice  and if you're from New York City  I understand that the  specialty there is bedbugs. So those are also resistant. And we have to bring an example from across the pond. Turns out that rats are  also resistant to poisons. Now  what's common  to all of these things is the idea that we've had these technologies to control nature only for  the last        or     years and essentially in a blink  we have squandered our ability to control  because we have not recognized that natural selection and  evolution was going to find a way to get back  and we need to completely rethink how we're going to use measures to control biological organisms  and rethink how we incentivize the development  introduction  in the case of antibiotics prescription  and use of these valuable resources. And we really now need to  start thinking about them as natural resources. And so we stand at a crossroads. An option is to go through that rethinking and carefully consider incentives to change how we do business. The alternative is a world in which even a blade of grass is a potentially lethal weapon. Thank you. On January          a young man delivered a report to the United States Congress that    years on  still shapes the lives of everyone in this room today  still shapes the lives of everyone on this planet. That young man wasn't a politician  he wasn't a businessman  a civil rights activist or a faith leader. He was that most unlikely of heroes  an economist. His name was Simon Kuznets and the report that  he delivered was called  National Income           .  Now  you might think this is a rather dry and dull report. And you're absolutely right. It's dry as a bone. But this report is the foundation of how  today  we judge the  success of countries  what we know best as Gross Domestic Product  GDP. GDP has defined and shaped our lives for the last    years. And today I want to talk about a different way to measure the success of countries  a different way to define  and shape our lives for the next    years. But first  we have to understand how GDP came to dominate our lives. Kuznets' report was delivered at a moment of crisis. The U.S. economy was plummeting into the Great Depression and policy makers were  struggling to respond. Struggling because they didn't know what was going on. They didn't have data and statistics. So what Kuznet's report gave them was reliable data on what  the U.S. economy was producing  updated year by year. And armed with this information  policy makers were  eventually  able to find a way out  of the slump. And because Kuznets' invention was found to be so useful  it spread around the world. And now today  every country produces GDP statistics. But  in that first report  Kuznets himself delivered a warning. It's in the introductory chapter. On page seven he says   The welfare of a nation can  therefore  scarcely be inferred from a measurement of  national income as defined above.  It's not the greatest sound  bite in the world  and it's dressed up in the cautious  language of the economist. But his message was clear  GDP is a tool to help us measure economic performance. It's not a measure of our well being. And it shouldn't be a guide  to all decision making. But we have ignored Kuznets' warning. We live in a world where GDP is the benchmark of success in a global economy. Our politicians boast when GDP goes up. Markets move and trillions of dollars of capital move around the world based on which countries are going up and which countries  are going down  all measured in GDP. Our societies have become engines to create more GDP. But we know that GDP is flawed. It ignores the environment. It counts bombs and prisons as progress. It can't count happiness or community. And it has nothing to say  about fairness or justice. Is it any surprise that our world  marching to the drumbeat of GDP  is teetering on the brink of environmental disaster and filled with anger and conflict  We need a better way to measure our societies  a measure based on the real  things that matter to real people. Do I have enough to eat  Can I read and write  Am I safe  Do I have rights  Do I live in a society where I'm not discriminated against  Is my future and the future of my children  prevented from environmental destruction  These are questions that GDP does not and cannot answer. There have  of course  been efforts in the past to move beyond GDP. But I believe that we're living in a moment when we are ready for a measurement revolution. We're ready because we've seen  in the financial crisis of       how our fetish for economic growth led us so far astray. We've seen  in the Arab Spring  how countries like Tunisia were supposedly economic superstars  but they were societies that were seething with discontentment. We're ready  because today we have the technology to gather and analyze data in ways that would have been unimaginable to Kuznets. Today  I'd like to introduce you  to the Social Progress Index. It's a measure of the  well being of society  completely separate from GDP. It's a whole new way of looking at the world. The Social Progress Index begins by defining what it means to be a good society based around three dimensions. The first is  does everyone have the basic needs for survival  food  water  shelter  safety  Secondly  does everyone have access to the building blocks  to improve their lives  education  information  health and sustainable environment  And then third  does every  individual have access to a chance to pursue their goals and dreams and ambitions free from obstacles  Do they have rights  freedom of choice  freedom from discrimination and access to the the world's most advanced knowledge  Together  these    components form the Social Progress framework. And for each of these    components  we have indicators to measure  how countries are performing. Not indicators of effort or intention  but real achievement. We don't measure how much a country spends on healthcare  we measure the length and  quality of people's lives. We don't measure whether governments pass laws against discrimination  we measure whether people  experience discrimination. But what you want to know is who's top  don't you   Laughter  I knew that  I knew that  I knew that. Okay  I'm going to show you. I'm going to show you on this chart. So here we are  what I've done here is put on the  vertical axis social progress. Higher is better. And then  just for comparison  just for fun  on the horizontal axis is GDP per capita. Further to the right is more. So the country in the world with the highest social progress  the number one country on social progress is New Zealand. Well done  Never been  must go. The country with the least social progress  I'm sorry to say  is Chad. I've never been  maybe next year. Or maybe the year after. Now  I know what you're thinking. You're thinking   Aha  but New Zealand has a higher GDP than Chad   It's a good point  well made. But let me show you two other countries. Here's the United States   considerably richer than New Zealand  but with a lower level of social progress. And then here's Senegal   it's got a higher level of  social progress than Chad  but the same level of GDP. So what's going on  Well  look. Let me bring in the rest of  the countries of the world  the     we've been able to measure  each one represented by a dot. There we go. Lots of dots. Now  obviously I can't do all of them  so a few highlights for you  The highest ranked G  country is Canada. My country  the United Kingdom  is sort of middling  sort of dull  but who cares   at least we beat the French. And then looking at the  emerging economies  top of the BRICS   pleased to say  is Brazil. Come on  cheer  Go  Brazil  Beating South Africa  then Russia  then China and then India. Tucked away on the right hand side  you will see a dot of a  country with a lot of GDP but not a huge amount  of social progress   that's Kuwait. Just above Brazil is a social progress superpower   that's Costa Rica. It's got a level of social progress the same  as some Western European countries  with a much lower GDP. Now  my slide is getting  a little cluttered and I'd like to step back a bit. So let me take away these countries  and then pop in the regression line. So this shows the average relationship between GDP and social progress. The first thing to notice  is that there's lots of noise around the trend line. And what this shows  what this empirically demonstrates  is that GDP is not destiny. At every level of GDP per capita  there are opportunities for more social progress  risks of less. The second thing to notice is that for poor countries  the curve is really steep. So what this tells us is that if poor countries can get a little bit of extra GDP  and if they reinvest that in doctors  nurses  water supplies  sanitation  etc.  there's a lot of social progress bang for your GDP buck. And that's good news  and that's what  we've seen over the last        years  with a lot of people lifted out of poverty by economic growth and good policies in poorer countries. But go on a bit further up the curve  and then we see it flattening out. Each extra dollar of GDP is buying less and less social progress. And with more and more of the world's population living on this part of the curve  it means GDP is becoming less and less useful as a guide to our development. I'll show you an example of Brazil. Here's Brazil  social progress of about    out of      GDP per capita about         dollars a year. And look  Brazil's above the line. Brazil is doing a reasonably good job of turning GDP into social progress. But where does Brazil go next  Let's say that Brazil adopts a bold economic plan to double GDP in the next decade. But that is only half a plan. It's less than half a plan  because where does Brazil want to go on social progress  Brazil  it's possible to increase your growth  increase your GDP  while stagnating or going backwards on social progress. We don't want Brazil to become like Russia. What you really want is for Brazil to get ever more efficient at creating  social progress from its GDP  so it becomes more like New Zealand. And what that means is that Brazil needs to prioritize social progress in its development plan and see that it's not just growth alone  it's growth with social progress. And that's what the Social  Progress Index does  It reframes the debate about development  not just about GDP alone  but inclusive  sustainable growth that brings real improvements  in people's lives. And it's not just about countries. Earlier this year  with our friends from the Imazon  nonprofit here in Brazil  we launched the first subnational  Social Progress Index. We did it for the Amazon region. It's an area the size of  Europe     million people  one of the most deprived  parts of the country. And here are the results  and this is broken down into nearly     different municipalities. And with this detailed information about the real quality of life in this part of the country  Imazon and other partners from government   business and civil society can work together to construct a development plan that will help really improve people's lives  while protecting that  precious global asset that is the Amazon Rainforest. And this is just the beginning  You can create a Social Progress Index for any state  region   city or municipality. We all know and love TEDx  this is Social Pogress x. This is a tool for anyone to come and use. Contrary to the way we  sometimes talk about it  GDP was not handed down from  God on tablets of stone.  Laughter  It's a measurement tool invented in the   th century to address the challenges of the   th century. In the   st century  we face new challenges  aging  obesity  climate change  and so on. To face those challenges  we need new tools of measurement  new ways of valuing progress. Imagine if we could measure what nonprofits  charities  volunteers  civil society organizations really contribute to our society. Imagine if businesses competed not just on the basis of their economic contribution  but on their contribution  to social progress. Imagine if we could hold  politicians to account for really improving people's lives. Imagine if we could work together   government  business   civil society  me  you   and make this century the  century of social progress. Thank you. What has the War on Drugs  done to the world  Look at the murder and mayhem in Mexico  Central America  so many  other parts of the planet  the global black market estimated at     billion dollars a year  prisons packed in the  United States and elsewhere  police and military drawn  into an unwinnable war that violates basic rights   and ordinary citizens just hope they don't get  caught in the crossfire  and meanwhile  more people using more drugs than ever. It's my country's history  with alcohol prohibition and Al Capone  times   . Which is why it's  particularly galling to me as an American that we've  been the driving force behind this global drug war. Ask why so many countries criminalize drugs they'd never heard of  why the U.N. drug treaties emphasize criminalization over health  even why most of the money worldwide for dealing with drug abuse goes not to helping agencies but those that punish  and you'll find the good old U.S. of A. Why did we do this  Some people  especially in Latin America  think it's not really about drugs. It's just a subterfuge for advancing the realpolitik interests of the U.S. But by and large  that's not it. We don't want gangsters and guerrillas funded with illegal drug money terrorizing and taking over other nations. No  the fact is  America really is crazy when it comes to drugs. I mean  don't forget  we're  the ones who thought that we could prohibit alcohol. So think about our global drug war not as any sort of rational policy  but as the international projection of a domestic psychosis. But here's the good news. Now it's the Russians leading the Drug War and not us. Most politicians in my country want to roll back the Drug War now  put fewer people behind bars  not more  and I'm proud to say as an American that we now lead the world in reforming marijuana policies. It's now legal for medical purposes in almost half our    states  millions of people can  purchase their marijuana  their medicine  in government  licensed dispensaries  and over half my fellow  citizens now say it's time to legally regulate and tax marijuana more or less like alcohol. That's what Colorado and  Washington are doing  and Uruguay  and others  are sure to follow. So that's what I do  work to end the Drug War. I think it all started growing up in a fairly religious  moral family  eldest son of a rabbi  going off to university where I smoked some marijuana and I liked it.  Laughter  And I liked drinking too  but it was obvious that alcohol was really the more dangerous of the two  but my friends and I could get busted for smoking a joint. Now  that hypocrisy kept bugging me  so I wrote my Ph.D dissertation on international drug control. I talked my way into the State Department. I got a security clearance. I interviewed hundreds of DEA and other law enforcement agents all around Europe and the Americas  and I'd ask them   What do you think the answer is   Well  in Latin America  they'd say to me   You can't really cut off the supply. The answer lies back in the U.S.  in cutting off the demand.  So then I go back home and I talk to people involved in anti drug efforts there  and they'd say   You know  Ethan  you can't  really cut off the demand. The answer lies over there. You've got to cut off the supply.  Then I'd go and talk  to the guys in customs trying to stop drugs at the borders  and they'd say   You're  not going to stop it here. The answer lies over there  in cutting off supply and demand.  And it hit me  Everybody involved in this thought the answer lay in that area about which they knew the least. So that's when I started  reading everything I could about psychoactive drugs   the history  the science  the politics  all of it  and the more one read  the more it hit you how a thoughtful  enlightened  intelligent  approach took you over here  whereas the politics and laws of my country were taking you over here. And that disparity struck me as this incredible intellectual and moral puzzle. There's probably never been a drug free society. Virtually every society has ingested psychoactive substances to deal with pain  increase  our energy  socialize  even commune with God. Our desire to alter our consciousness may be as fundamental as our desires for food  companionship and sex. So our true challenge is to learn how to live with drugs so they cause the least possible harm and in some cases the  greatest possible benefit. I'll tell you something else I learned  that the reason some drugs  are legal and others not has almost nothing to do  with science or health or the relative risk of drugs  and almost everything to do with who uses and who is perceived  to use particular drugs. In the late   th century  when most of the drugs that are now illegal were legal  the principal consumers  of opiates in my country and others were middle aged white women  using them to alleviate aches and pains when few other analgesics were available. And nobody thought about  criminalizing it back then because nobody wanted to  put Grandma behind bars. But when hundreds of thousands of Chinese started showing up in my country  working hard on the railroads and the mines and then kicking back in the evening just like they had in the old country with a few puffs on that opium pipe  that's when you saw the  first drug prohibition laws in California and Nevada  driven by racist fears of Chinese transforming white women into opium addicted sex slaves. The first cocaine prohibition  laws  similarly prompted by racist fears of black men  sniffing that white powder and forgetting their proper place in Southern society. And the first marijuana prohibition laws  all about fears of Mexican migrants in the West and the Southwest. And what was true in my country  is true in so many others as well  with both the origins of these laws and their implementation. Put it this way  and I exaggerate only slightly  If the principal smokers of cocaine were affluent older white men and the principal consumers of Viagra were poor young black men  then smokable cocaine would be easy to get with a prescription from your doctor and selling Viagra would get you  five to    years behind bars. I used to be a professor teaching about this. Now I'm an activist  a human rights activist  and what drives me is my shame at living in an otherwise great nation that has less than five percent of the world's population but almost    percent of the world's incarcerated population. It's the people I meet  who have lost someone they love to drug related  violence or prison or overdose or AIDS because our drug policies emphasize criminalization over health. It's good people who have lost their jobs  their homes  their freedom   even their children to the state  not because they hurt anyone but solely because they chose to use one drug instead of another. So is legalization the answer  On that  I'm torn  three days a week I think yes  three days a week I think no  and on Sundays I'm agnostic. But since today is Tuesday  let me just say that legally  regulating and taxing most of the drugs that  are now criminalized would radically reduce  the crime  violence  corruption and black markets  and the problems of adulterated and unregulated drugs  and improve public safety  and allow taxpayer resources to be developed to more useful purposes. I mean  look  the markets  in marijuana  cocaine  heroin and methamphetamine are global commodities markets just like the global markets  in alcohol  tobacco  coffee  sugar  and so many other things. Where there is a demand  there will be a supply. Knock out one source and another inevitably emerges. People tend to think of prohibition as the ultimate form of regulation when in fact it represents  the abdication of regulation with criminals filling the void. Which is why putting criminal laws and police front and center in trying to control a dynamic global commodities market is a recipe for disaster. And what we really need to do is to bring the underground drug markets as much as possible aboveground and regulate them as  intelligently as we can to minimize both the harms of drugs and the harms of prohibitionist policies. Now  with marijuana  that obviously means legally regulating and  taxing it like alcohol. The benefits of doing so are enormous  the risks minimal. Will more people use marijuana  Maybe  but it's not  going to be young people  because it's not going to  be legalized for them  and quite frankly  they already have the best access to marijuana. I think it's going to be older people. It's going to be people in their   s and   s and   s who find they prefer a little marijuana to that drink in the evening or the sleeping pill or that it helps with  their arthritis or diabetes or maybe helps spice up a  long term marriage.  Laughter  And that just might be a  net public health benefit. As for the other drugs  look at Portugal  where  nobody goes to jail for possessing drugs  and the government's made  a serious commitment to treating addiction as a health issue. Look at Switzerland   Germany  the Netherlands  Denmark  England  where people who have been addicted to heroin for many years and repeatedly tried to quit and failed can get pharmaceutical  heroin and helping services in medical clinics  and  the results are in  Illegal drug abuse and disease and overdoses and crime  and arrests all go down  health and well being improve  taxpayers benefit  and many drug users even put their addictions behind them. Look at New Zealand  which  recently enacted a law allowing certain recreational  drugs to be sold legally provided their safety had been established. Look here in Brazil  and some other countries  where a remarkable psychoactive substance  ayahuasca  can be legally  bought and consumed provided it's done so  within a religious context. Look in Bolivia and Peru  where all sorts of products  made from the coca leaf  the source of cocaine  are sold legally over the counter with no apparent harm to people's public health. I mean  don't forget  Coca Cola had cocaine in it until       and so far as we know was no more addictive than Coca Cola is today. Conversely  think about cigarettes  Nothing can both hook you  and kill you like cigarettes. When researchers ask heroin addicts what's the toughest drug to  quit  most say cigarettes. Yet in my country and many others  half of all the people who  were ever addicted to cigarettes have quit without anyone being  arrested or put in jail or sent to a  treatment program  by a prosecutor or a judge. What did it were higher taxes and time and place  restrictions on sale and use and effective anti smoking campaigns. Now  could we reduce smoking even more by making it totally illegal  Probably. But just imagine the drug war nightmare that would result. So the challenges we face today are twofold. The first is the policy challenge of designing and implementing alternatives to ineffective prohibitionist policies  even as we need to get  better at regulating and living with the drugs  that are now legal. But the second challenge is tougher  because it's about us. The obstacles to reform  lie not just out there in the power of the  prison industrial complex or other vested interests  that want to keep things the way they are  but within each and every one of us. It's our fears and our lack of knowledge and imagination that stands  in the way of real reform. And ultimately  I think that  boils down to the kids  and to every parent's desire to put our baby in a bubble  and the fear that somehow drugs will pierce that bubble and put our young ones at risk. In fact  sometimes it  seems like the entire War on Drugs gets justified as one great big child protection act  which any young person  can tell you it's not. So here's what I say to teenagers. First  don't do drugs. Second  don't do drugs. Third  if you do do drugs  there's some things I want you to know  because my bottom line as your parent is  come home safely at the end of the night and grow up and lead a  healthy and good adulthood. That's my drug education  mantra  Safety first. So this is what I've dedicated my life to  to building an organization and a movement of people who believe we  need to turn our backs on the failed prohibitions of the past and embrace new drug  policies grounded in science  compassion  health and human rights  where people who come from across the political spectrum and every other spectrum as well  where people who love our drugs  people who hate drugs  and people who don't give  a damn about drugs  but every one of us believes  that this War on Drugs  this backward  heartless   disastrous War on Drugs  has got to end. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Ethan  congrats   quite the reaction. That was a powerful talk. Not quite a complete standing O  though  and I'm guessing that some people here and maybe a few watching online  maybe someone knows a teenager or a friend or whatever who got sick  maybe died from some drug overdose. I'm sure you've had these people approach you before. What do you say to them  Ethan Nadelmann  Chris  the most amazing thing that's happened of late is that I've met a growing number of people who have actually  lost a sibling or a child to a drug overdose  and    years ago  those  people just wanted to say  let's line up all the drug  dealers and shoot them and that will solve it. And what they've come to understand is that the Drug War did  nothing to protect their kids. If anything  it made it more likely that those kids were put at risk. And so they're now becoming part of this drug policy reform movement. There's other people who have kids  one's addicted to alcohol  the other one's addicted to cocaine or heroin  and they ask themselves the question  Why does this kid get to  take one step at a time and try to get better and that one's got to deal with jail and police and criminals all the time  So everybody's understanding  the Drug War's not protecting anybody. CA  Certainly in the U.S.   you've got political gridlock on most issues. Is there any realistic chance of anything actually shifting on this  issue in the next five years  EN  I'd say it's quite remarkable.  I'm getting all these calls from journalists now who are saying to me   Ethan  it seems like the only two issues advancing politically in America right now are marijuana law reform and gay marriage. What are you doing right   And then you're looking at  bipartisanship breaking out with  actually  Republicans in the Congress and state legislatures  allowing bills to be enacted with majority Democratic support  so we've gone from being sort of the third rail  the most fearful issue of American politics  to becoming one of the most successful. CA  Ethan  thank you so much for coming to TEDGlobal. EN  Chris  thanks so much. CA  Thank you. EN  Thank you.  Applause  They told me that I'm a traitor to my own profession  that I should be fired  have my medical license taken away  that I should go back to my own country. My email got hacked. In a discussion forum for other doctors  someone took credit for  Twitter bombing  my account. Now  I didn't know if this was a good or bad thing  but then came the response   Too bad it wasn't a real bomb.  I never thought that I would do something that would provoke this level of anger among other doctors. Becoming a doctor was my dream. I grew up in China  and my earliest memories are of being rushed to the hospital because I had such bad asthma that I was there nearly every week. I had this one doctor  Dr. Sam  who always took care of me. She was about the same age as my mother. She had this wild  curly hair  and she always wore these bright yellow flowery dresses. She was one of those doctors who  if you fell and you broke your arm  she would ask you why you weren't laughing because it's your humerus. Get it  See  you'd groan  but she'd always make you feel better after having seen her. Well  we all have that childhood hero that we want to grow up to be just like  right  Well  I wanted to be just like Dr. Sam. When I was eight  my parents and I moved to the U.S.  and ours became the typical immigrant narrative. My parents cleaned hotel rooms and washed dishes and pumped gas so that I could pursue my dream. Well  eventually I learned enough English  and my parents were so happy the day that I got into medical school and took my oath of healing and service. But then one day  everything changed. My mother called me to tell me that she wasn't feeling well  she had a cough that wouldn't go away  she was short of breath and tired. Well  I knew that my mother was someone who never complained about anything. For her to tell me that something was the matter  I knew something had to be really wrong. And it was  We found out that she had stage IV breast cancer  cancer that by then had spread to her lungs  her bones  and her brain. My mother was brave  though  and she had hope. She went through surgery and radiation  and was on her third round of chemotherapy when she lost her address book. She tried to look up her oncologist's phone number on the Internet and she found it  but she found something else too. On several websites  he was listed as a highly paid speaker to a drug company  and in fact often spoke on behalf of the same chemo regimen that he had prescribed her. She called me in a panic  and I didn't know what to believe. Maybe this was the right chemo regimen for her  but maybe it wasn't. It made her scared and it made her doubt. When it comes to medicine  having that trust is a must  and when that trust is gone  then all that's left is fear. There's another side to this fear. As a medical student  I was taking care of this    year old who was biking back to his dorm when he got struck and hit  run over by an SUV. He had seven broken ribs  shattered hip bones  and he was bleeding inside his belly and inside his brain. Now  imagine being his parents who flew in from Seattle        miles away  to find their son in a coma. I mean  you'd want to find out what's going on with him  right  They asked to attend our bedside rounds where we discussed his condition and his plan  which I thought was a reasonable request  and also would give us a chance to show them how much we were trying and how much we cared. The head doctor  though  said no. He gave all kinds of reasons. Maybe they'll get in the nurse's way. Maybe they'll stop students from asking questions. He even said   What if they see mistakes and sue us   What I saw behind every excuse was deep fear  and what I learned was that to become a doctor  we have to put on our white coats  put up a wall  and hide behind it. There's a hidden epidemic in medicine. Of course  patients are scared when they come to the doctor. Imagine you wake up with this terrible bellyache  you go to the hospital  you're lying in this strange place  you're on this hospital gurney  you're wearing this flimsy gown  strangers are coming to poke and prod at you. You don't know what's going to happen. You don't even know if you're going to get the blanket you asked for    minutes ago. But it's not just patients who are scared  doctors are scared too. We're scared of patients finding out who we are and what medicine is all about. And so what do we do  We put on our white coats and we hide behind them. Of course  the more we hide  the more people want to know what it is that we're hiding. The more fear then spirals into mistrust and poor medical care. We don't just have a fear of sickness  we have a sickness of fear. Can we bridge this disconnect between what patients need and what doctors do  Can we overcome the sickness of fear  Let me ask you differently  If hiding isn't the answer  what if we did the opposite  What if doctors were to become totally transparent with their patients  Last fall  I conducted a research study to find out what it is that people want to know about their healthcare. I didn't just want to study patients in a hospital  but everyday people. So my two medical students  Suhavi Tucker and Laura Johns  literally took their research to the streets. They went to banks  coffee shops  senior centers  Chinese restaurants and train stations. What did they find  Well  when we asked people   What do you want to know about your healthcare   people responded with what they want to know about their doctors  because people understand health care to be the individual interaction between them and their doctors. When we asked   What do you want to know about your doctors   people gave three different answers. Some want to know that their doctor is competent and certified to practice medicine. Some want to be sure that their doctor is unbiased and is making decisions based on evidence and science  not on who pays them. Surprisingly to us  many people want to know something else about their doctors. Jonathan  a    year old law student  says he wants to find someone who is comfortable with LGBTQ patients and specializes in LGBT health. Serena  a    year old accountant  says that it's important to her for her doctor to share her values when it comes to reproductive choice and women's rights. Frank  a    year old hardware store owner  doesn't even like going to the doctor and wants to find someone who believes in prevention first  but who is comfortable with alternative treatments. One after another  our respondents told us that that doctor patient relationship is a deeply intimate one   that to show their doctors their bodies and tell them their deepest secrets  they want to first understand their doctor's values. Just because doctors have to see every patient doesn't mean that patients have to see every doctor. People want to know about their doctors first so that they can make an informed choice. As a result of this  I formed a campaign  Who's My Doctor  that calls for total transparency in medicine. Participating doctors voluntarily disclose on a public website not just information about where we went to medical school and what specialty we're in  but also our conflicts of interest. We go beyond the Government in the Sunshine Act about drug company affiliations  and we talk about how we're paid. Incentives matter. If you go to your doctor because of back pain  you might want to know he's getting paid       dollars to perform spine surgery versus    dollars to refer you to see a physical therapist  or if he's getting paid the same thing no matter what he recommends. Then  we go one step further. We add our values when it comes to women's health  LGBT health  alternative medicine  preventive health  and end of life decisions. We pledge to our patients that we are here to serve you  so you have a right to know who we are. We believe that transparency can be the cure for fear. I thought some doctors would sign on and others wouldn't  but I had no idea of the huge backlash that would ensue. Within one week of starting Who's My Doctor  Medscape's public forum and several online doctors' communities had thousands of posts about this topic. Here are a few. From a gastroenterologist in Portland   I devoted    years of my life to being a slave. I have loans and mortgages. I depend on lunches from drug companies to serve patients.  Well  times may be hard for everyone  but try telling your patient making        dollars a year to serve a family of four that you need the free lunch. From an orthopedic surgeon in Charlotte   I find it an invasion of my privacy to disclose where my income comes from. My patients don't disclose their incomes to me.  But your patients' sources of income don't affect your health. From a psychiatrist in New York City   Pretty soon we will have to disclose whether we prefer cats to dogs  what model of car we drive  and what toilet paper we use.  Well  how you feel about Toyotas or Cottonelle won't affect your patients' health  but your views on a woman's right to choose and preventive medicine and end of life decisions just might. And my favorite  from a Kansas City cardiologist   More government mandated stuff  Dr. Wen needs to move back to her own country.  Well  two pieces of good news. First of all  this is meant to be voluntary and not mandatory  and second of all  I'm American and I'm already here. Within a month  my employers were getting calls asking for me to be fired. I received mail at my undisclosed home address with threats to contact the medical board to sanction me. My friends and family urged me to quit this campaign. After the bomb threat  I was done. But then I heard from patients. Over social media  a TweetChat  which I'd learned what that was by then  generated  .  million impressions  and thousands of people wrote to encourage me to continue. They wrote with things like   If doctors are doing something they're that ashamed of  they shouldn't be doing it.   Elected officials have to disclose campaign contributions. Lawyers have to disclose conflicts of interests. Why shouldn't doctors   And finally  many people wrote and said   Let us patients decide what's important when we're choosing a doctor.  In our initial trial  over     doctors have taken the total transparency pledge. What a crazy new idea  right  But actually  this is not that new of a concept at all. Remember Dr. Sam  my doctor in China  with the goofy jokes and the wild hair  Well  she was my doctor  but she was also our neighbor who lived in the building across the street. I went to the same school as her daughter. My parents and I trusted her because we knew who she was and what she stood for  and she had no need to hide from us. Just one generation ago  this was the norm in the U.S. as well. You knew that your family doctor was the father of two teenage boys  that he quit smoking a few years ago  that he says he's a regular churchgoer  but you see him twice a year  once at Easter and once when his mother in law comes to town. You knew what he was about  and he had no need to hide from you. But the sickness of fear has taken over  and patients suffer the consequences. I know this firsthand. My mother fought her cancer for eight years. She was a planner  and she thought a lot about how she wanted to live and how she wanted to die. Not only did she sign advance directives  she wrote a    page document about how she had suffered enough  how it was time for her to go. One day  when I was a resident physician  I got a call to say that she was in the intensive care unit. By the time I got there  she was about to be intubated and put on a breathing machine.  But this is not what she wants   I said   and we have documents.  The ICU doctor looked at me in the eye  pointed at my then    year old sister  and said   Do you remember when you were that age  How would you have liked to grow up without your mother   Her oncologist was there too  and said   This is your mother. Can you really face yourself for the rest of your life if you don't do everything for her   I knew my mother so well. I understood what her directives meant so well  but I was a physician. That was the single hardest decision I ever made  to let her die in peace  and I carry those words of those doctors with me every single day. We can bridge the disconnect between what doctors do and what patients need. We can get there  because we've been there before  and we know that transparency gets us to that trust. Research has shown us that openness also helps doctors  that having open medical records  being willing to talk about medical errors  will increase patient trust  improve health outcomes  and reduce malpractice. That openness  that trust  is only going to be more important as we move from the infectious to the behavioral model of disease. Bacteria may not care so much about trust and intimacy  but for people to tackle the hard lifestyle choices  to address issues like smoking cessation  blood pressure management and diabetes control  well  that requires us to establish trust. Here's what other transparent doctors have said. Brandon Combs  an internist in Denver   This has brought me closer to my patients. The type of relationship I've developed   that's why I entered medicine.  Aaron Stupple  an internist in Denver   I tell my patients that I am totally open with them. I don't hide anything from them. This is me. Now tell me about you. We're in this together.  May Nguyen  a family physician in Houston   My colleagues are astounded by what I'm doing. They ask me how I could be so brave. I said  I'm not being brave  it's my job.  I leave you today with a final thought. Being totally transparent is scary. You feel naked  exposed and vulnerable  but that vulnerability  that humility  it can be an extraordinary benefit to the practice of medicine. When doctors are willing to step off our pedestals  take off our white coats  and show our patients who we are and what medicine is all about  that's when we begin to overcome the sickness of fear. That's when we establish trust. That's when we change the paradigm of medicine from one of secrecy and hiding to one that is fully open and engaged for our patients. Thank you. Vincent Moon  How can we use computers  cameras  microphones to represent the world in an alternative way  as much as possible  How  maybe  is it possible to use the Internet to create a new form of cinema  And actually  why do we record  Well  it is with such simple questions in mind that I started to make films    years ago  first with a friend  Christophe Abric. He had a website  La Blogoth que  dedicated to independent music. We were crazy about music. We wanted to represent  music in a different way  to film the music we love  the musicians we admired  as much as possible  far  from the music industry and far from the cliches attached to it. We started to publish every week sessions on the Internet. We are going to see a few extracts now. From Grizzly Bear in the shower to Sigur Ros playing in a Parisian cafe. From Phoenix playing by the Eiffel Tower to Tom Jones in his  hotel room in New York. From Arcade Fire in an elevator in the Olympia to Beirut going down a staircase in Brooklyn. From R.E.M. in a car to The National around a table at night in the south of France. From Bon Iver playing with some friends in an apartment in Montmartre to Yeasayer having a long night  and many  many  many more unknown or very famous bands. We published all those films for free on the Internet  and we wanted to share all those films and represent music in a different way. We wanted to create  another type of intimacy using all those new technologies. At the time     years ago actually  there was no such project on the Internet  and I guess that's why the project we  were making  the Take Away Shows  got quite successful  reaching millions of viewers. After a while  I got a bit   I wanted to go somewhere else. I felt the need to travel and to discover some other music  to explore the world  going to other corners  and actually it was also this idea of nomadic cinema  sort of  that I had in mind. How could the use of new technologies  and the road fit together  How could I edit my films in a bus crossing the Andes  So I went on five year travels around the globe. I started at the time in the digital film  and music label collection Petites Plan tes  which was also an homage to French filmmaker Chris Marker. We're going to see now a few more extracts of those new films. From the tecno brega diva of northern Brazil  Gaby Amarantos to a female ensemble in Chechnya. From experimental electronic music  in Singapore with One Man Nation to Brazilian icon Tom Z  singing on his rooftop in S o Paolo. From The Bambir  the great  rock band from Armenia to some traditional songs in a restaurant in Tbilisi  Georgia. From White Shoes  a great retro  pop band from Jakarta  Indonesia to DakhaBrakha  the revolutionary  band from Kiev  Ukraine. From Tomi Lebrero and his bandoneon and his friends in Buenos Aires  Argentina  to many other places and musicians around the world. My desire was to make it as a trek. To do all those films  it would have been impossible with a big company behind me  with a structure or anything. I was traveling alone with a backpack   computer  camera  microphones in it. Alone  actually  but  just with local people  meeting my team  which was absolutely not professional people  on the spot there  going from one place to another and to make cinema as a trek. I really believed that cinema could be this very simple thing  I want to make a film and you're going  to give me a place to stay for the night. I give you a moment of cinema and you offer me a capirinha. Well  or other drinks  depending on where you are. In Peru  they drink pisco sour. Well  when I arrived in Peru  actually  I had no idea about what I would do there. And I just had one phone number  actually  of one person. Three months later  after traveling all around the  country  I had recorded    films  only with the help of local people  only with the help of people that I was asking all the  time the same question  What is important to record here today  By living in such a way  by working without any structure  I was able to react to the moment and to decide  oh  this is  important to make now. This is important to  record that whole person. This is important to create this exchange. When I went to Chechnya  the first person I met looked at me and was like   What are you doing here  Are you a journalist  NGO  Politics  What kind of problems  are you going to study   Well  I was there to research on Sufi rituals in Chechnya  actually   incredible culture of Sufism in Chechnya  which is absolutely unknown  outside of the region. As soon as people understood that I would give them those films   I would publish them online for free under a Creative Commons license  but I would also really  give them to the people and I would let them do  what they want with it. I just want to represent  them in a beautiful light. I just want to portray them in a way that their grandchildren are going to look at their grandfather  and they're going to be like   Whoa  my grandfather is as  cool as Beyonc .   Laughter  It's a really important thing. It's really important  because that's the way people are going to look differently at  their own culture  at their own land. They're going to think about it differently. It may be a way to maintain  a certain diversity. Why you will record  Hmm. There's a really good quote by American thinker Hakim Bey which says   Every recording is a tombstone of a live performance.  It's a really good  sentence to keep in mind nowadays in an era saturated by images. What's the point of that  Where do we go with it  I was researching. I was still  keeping this idea in mind  What's the point  I was researching on music  trying to pull  trying to get closer to a certain origin of it. Where is this all coming from  I am French. I had no idea about what I would discover   which is a very simple thing  Everything was sacred  at first  and music was spiritual healing. How could I use my camera  my little tool  to get closer and maybe not only capture the trance but find an equivalent   a cine trance  maybe  something in complete harmony with the people  That is now my new research I'm doing on spirituality  on new  spirits around the world. Maybe a few more extracts now. From the Tana Toraja  funeral ritual in Indonesia to an Easter ceremony  in the north of Ethiopia. From jathilan  a popular trance ritual on the island of Java  to Umbanda in the north of Brazil. The Sufi rituals of Chechnya to a mass in the holiest  church of Armenia. Some Sufi songs in Harar  the holy city of Ethiopia  to an ayahuasca ceremony deep in the Amazon of  Peru with the Shipibo. Then to my new project   the one I'm doing now here in Brazil  named  H bridos.  I'm doing it with Priscilla Telmon. It's research on the new  spiritualities all around the country. This is my quest  my own little quest  of what I call experimental ethnography  trying to hybrid all  those different genres  trying to regain a certain complexity. Why do we record  I was still there. I really believe cinema teaches us to see. The way we show the world is going to change the  way we see this world  and we live in a moment where the mass media are doing a terrible  terrible job at representing the world  violence  extremists  only spectacular events  only simplifications of everyday life. I think we are recording to regain a certain complexity. To reinvent life today  we have to make new forms of images. And it's very simple. Muito obrigado. Bruno Giussani  Vincent  Vincent  Vincent. Merci. We have to prepare for the following performance  and I have a question for you  and the question is this  You show up in places like the  ones you just have shown us  and you are carrying a camera and I assume that you are welcome but you are not always absolutely welcome. You walk into sacred rituals  private moments in a village  a town  a group of people. How do you break the barrier when you show up with a lens  VM  I think you break it with your body  more than with your knowledge. That's what it taught me to travel  to trust the memory of the body more than the memory of the brain. The respect is stepping forward  not stepping backward  and I really think that by engaging your body in the moment  in the ceremony  in the places  people welcome you and understand your energy. BG  You told me that most of the videos you have made are  actually one single shot. You don't do much editing. I mean  you edited the ones for us at the beginning of the sessions because of the length  etc. Otherwise  you just go in and capture whatever happens in front of your eyes without much planning  and so is that the case  It's correct  VM  My idea is that I think that as long as we don't cut  in a way  as long as we let the viewer watch  more and more viewers  are going to feel closer  are going to get closer to the moment  to that moment and to that place. I really think of that as a matter  of respecting the viewer  to not cut all the time from one place to another  to just let the time go. BG  Tell me in a few words  about your new project   H bridos   here in Brazil. Just before coming to  TEDGlobal  you have actually been traveling around  the country for that. Tell us a couple of things. VM   H bridos  is    I really believe Brazil  far from the cliches  is the greatest religious country in the world  the greatest country  in terms of spirituality and in experimentations in spiritualities. And it's a big project I'm  doing over this year  which is researching in very different regions of Brazil  in very different forms of cults  and trying to understand  how people live together with spirituality nowadays. BG  The man who is going to  appear onstage momentarily  and Vincent's going to introduce him  is one of the subjects of  one of his past videos. When did you do a video with him  VM  I guess four years ago  four years in my first travel. BG  So it was one of  your first ones in Brazil. VM  It was amongst the  first ones in Brazil  yeah. I shot the film in Recife  in the place where he is from. BG  So let's introduce him.  Who are we waiting for  VM  I'll just make it very short. It's a very great honor for  me to welcome onstage one of the greatest Brazilian  musicians of all time. Please welcome Nan  Vasconcelos. BG  Nan  Vasconcelos  Nan  Vasconcelos  Let's go to the jungle. Picture this  It's Monday morning  you're at the office  you're settling in for the day at work  and this guy that you sort of  recognize from down the hall  walks right into your cubicle and he steals your chair. Doesn't say a word   just rolls away with it. Doesn't give you any information about why he took your chair out of all the other chairs  that are out there. Doesn't acknowledge the fact  that you might need your chair to get some work done today. You wouldn't stand for  it. You'd make a stink. You'd follow that guy back to his cubicle and you'd say   Why my chair   Okay  so now it's Tuesday morning and you're at the office  and a meeting invitation pops  up in your calendar. And it's from this woman who you  kind of know from down the hall  and the subject line references some  project that you heard a little bit about. But there's no agenda. There's no information about why you were invited to the meeting. And yet you accept the  meeting invitation  and you go. And when this highly  unproductive session is over  you go back to your desk  and you stand at your  desk and you say   Boy  I wish I had those two hours back  like I wish I had my chair back.  Every day  we allow our coworkers  who are otherwise very   very nice people  to steal from us. And I'm talking about something far  more valuable than office furniture. I'm talking about time. Your time. In fact  I believe that we are in the middle of a global epidemic of a terrible new illness known as MAS  Mindless Accept Syndrome. The primary symptom of  Mindless Accept Syndrome is just accepting a meeting invitation the minute it pops up in your calendar. It's an involuntary reflex   ding   click  bing   it's in your calendar   Gotta go  I'm already late  for a meeting.   Laughter  Meetings are important  right  And collaboration is key to  the success of any enterprise. And a well run meeting can yield  really positive  actionable results. But between globalization and pervasive information technology  the way that we work has really changed dramatically  over the last few years. And we're miserable.  Laughter  And we're miserable not because the  other guy can't run a good meeting  it's because of MAS  our  Mindless Accept Syndrome  which is a self inflicted wound. Actually  I have evidence to prove that MAS is a global epidemic. Let me tell you why. A couple of years ago  I put a video  on Youtube  and in the video  I acted out every terrible  conference call you've ever been on. It goes on for about five minutes  and it has all the things that we  hate about really bad meetings. There's the moderator who has  no idea how to run the meeting. There are the participants who  have no idea why they're there. The whole thing kind of collapses into this collaborative train wreck. And everybody leaves very angry. It's kind of funny. Let's take a quick look. As a group  we need to decide if   bloop bloop   Hi  who just joined  Hi  it's Joe. I'm working from home today. Hi  Joe. Thanks for  joining us today  great. I was just saying  we have a lot of people  on the call we'd like to get through  so let's skip the roll call and I'm gonna dive right in. Our goal today is to come to an  agreement on a very important proposal. As a group  we need to decide if   bloop bloop   Hi  who just joined  No  I thought I heard a beep.  Laughter  Sound familiar  Yeah  it sounds familiar  to me  too. A couple of weeks after I put that online          people in dozens of countries  I mean dozens of countries  watched this video. And three years later  it's still getting  thousands of views every month. It's close to about a million right now. And in fact  some of the biggest companies in the world  companies that you've  heard of but I won't name  have asked for my permission to use  this video in their new hire training to teach their new employees how  not to run a meeting at their company. And if the numbers   there are a million views and it's being used by all these companies   aren't enough proof that we have  a global problem with meetings  there are the many  many thousands of comments posted online after the video went up. Thousands of people wrote things like   OMG  that was my day today    That was my day every day    This is my life.  One guy wrote   It's funny because it's true. Eerily  sadly  depressingly true. It made me laugh until I cried. And cried. And I cried some more.  This poor guy said   My daily life until  retirement or death  sigh.  These are real quotes and it's real sad. A common theme running through all of these comments online is this fundamental belief  that we are powerless to do anything other  than go to meetings and suffer through these  poorly run meetings and live to meet another day. But the truth is  we're  not powerless at all. In fact  the cure for MAS is right here in our hands. It's right at our fingertips  literally. It's something that I call  No MAS  Which  if I remember my  high school Spanish  means something like    Enough already  make it stop   Here's how No MAS  works. It's very simple. First of all  the next time you  get a meeting invitation that doesn't have a lot  of information in it at all  click the tentative button  It's okay  you're allowed   that's why it's there. It's right next to the accept button. Or the maybe button  or whatever button  is there for you not to accept immediately. Then  get in touch with the person who asked you to the meeting. Tell them you're very excited  to support their work  ask them what the goal  of the meeting is  and tell them you're interested in learning  how you can help them achieve their goal. And if we do this often enough  and we do it respectfully  people might start to be  a little bit more thoughtful about the way they put together meeting invitations. And you can make more thoughtful  decisions about accepting it. People might actually start  sending out agendas. Imagine  Or they might not have a conference call with    people to talk about a status when they could just do a quick email and get it done with. People just might start to change their  behavior because you changed yours. And they just might bring your chair back  too.  Laughter  No MAS  Thank you. The Earth needs no introduction. It needs no introduction in part  because the Apollo    astronauts  when they were hurtling  around the moon in       took this iconic image. It galvanized a whole  generation of human beings to realize that we're on  Spaceship Earth  fragile and finite as it is  and that we need  to take care of it. But while this picture is beautiful  it's static  and the Earth is constantly changing. It's changing on days' time scales with human activity. And the satellite imagery we  have of it today is old. Typically  years old. And that's important because you can't fix what you can't see. What we'd ideally want is images of the whole planet every day. So  what's standing in our way  What's the problem  This is the problem  Satellites are big  expensive  and they're slow. This one weighs three tons. It's six meters tall  four meters wide. It took up the entire fairing of a rocket just to launch it. One satellite  one rocket. It cost     million dollars. Satellites like these have  done an amazing job at helping us to understand our planet. But if we want to understand  it much more regularly  we need lots of satellites  and this model isn't scalable. So me and my friends   we started Planet Labs to make satellites ultra compact and small and highly capable. I'm going to show you what  our satellite looks like  This is our satellite. This is not a scale model  this is the real size. It's    by    by    centimeters  it weighs four kilograms  and we've stuffed the latest  and greatest electronics and sensor systems into  this little package so that even though this is really small  this can take pictures    times the resolution of the big satellite here  even though it weighs one  thousandth of the mass. And we call this satellite   Dove    Thank you. We call this satellite  Dove   and we call it  Dove  because  satellites are typically named after birds  but normally birds of prey  like Eagle  Hawk  Swoop   Kill  I don't know  Kestrel  these sort of things. But ours have a  humanitarian mission  so we wanted to call them Doves. And we haven't just  built them  though. We've launched them. And not just one  but many. It all started in our garage. Yes  we built our first satellite prototype in our garage. Now  this is pretty normal for a Silicon Valley company that we are  but we believe it's the first time  for a space company. And that's not the only trick we learned from Silicon Valley. We rapidly prototype our satellites. We use  release early   release often  on our software. And we take a different  risk approach. We take them outside and test them. We even put satellites in space just to test the satellites  and we've learned to manufacture our satellites at scale. We've used modern production techniques so we can build large numbers of them  I think for the first time. We call it agile aerospace  and that's what's enabled us to put so much capability into this little box. Now  what has bonded  our team over the years is the idea of democratizing access to satellite information. In fact  the founders of our  company  Chris  Robbie and I  we met over    years ago  at the United Nations when they were hosting a conference  about exactly that question  How do you use satellites  to help humanity  How do you use satellites to help  people in developing countries or with climate change  And this is what has bonded us. Our entire team is passionate about using satellites to help humanity. You could say  we're space geeks  but not only do we care  about what's up there  we care about what's down here  too. I'm going to show you a video from just four weeks ago  of two of our satellites being launched from the International Space Station. This is not an animation  this is a video taken by the astronaut  looking out of the window. It gives you a bit of a sense of  scale of our two satellites. It's like some of the  smallest satellites ever are being launched from  the biggest satellite ever. And right at the end  the solar array glints in the sun. It's really cool. Wait for it. Boom  Yeah. It's the money shot. So we didn't just launch  two of them like this  we launched    of them. It's the largest constellation of Earth imaging satellites in human history  and it's going to provide a completely radical new data set about our changing planet. But that's just the beginning. You see  we're going to launch more than     of these satellites like these over the  course of the next year. It's going to be the largest constellation of satellites in human history. And this is what it's going to do  Acting in a single orbit plane that  stays fixed with respect to the sun  the Earth rotates underneath. They're all cameras pointed down  and they slowly scan across as  the Earth rotates underneath. The Earth rotates every    hours  so we scan every point on the  planet every    hours. It's a line scanner for the planet. We don't take a picture of  anywhere on the planet every day  we take a picture of every single place on the planet every day. Even though we launched these just a couple of weeks ago  we've already got some initial imagery from the satellites and I'm going to show it publicly for the first time right now. This is the very first picture taken by our satellite. It happened to be over  UC Davis' campus in California when we  turned the camera on. But what's even cooler is when we compare it to the previous latest image of that area  which was taken many months ago. And the image on the left  is from our satellite  and we see buildings are being built. The general point is that we will be able to track urban growth as it happens around the whole world in all cities  every day. Water as well. Thank you. We'll be able to see  the extent of all water bodies around the whole world every day and help water security. From water security  to food security. We'll see crops as they  grow in all the fields in every farmer's field around the planet every day. and help them to improve crop yield. This is a beautiful image that was taken just a few hours ago when the  satellite was flying over Argentina. The general point is there are probably hundreds and  thousands of applications of this data  I've mentioned a few  but there's others  deforestation  the ice caps melting. We can track all of these things  every tree on the planet every day. If you took the difference between today's image and yesterday's image  you'd see much of the world news   you'd see floods and fires and earthquakes. And we have decided  therefore  that the  best thing that we could do with our data is to ensure universal access to it. We want to ensure everyone can see it. Thank you.  Applause  We want to empower NGOs and  companies and scientists and journalists to be able to answer the questions that they have about the planet. We want to enable the developer community to run their apps on our data. In short  we want to democratize access to information about our planet. Which brings me back to this. You see  this will be an entirely new global data set. And we believe that together  we can help to take care  of our Spaceship Earth. And what I would like to leave you with is the following question  If you had access to imagery of the whole planet every single day  what would you do with that data  What problems would you solve  What exploration would you do  Well  I invite you to come and explore with us. Thank you very much. Well  good afternoon. How many of you took the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge  Woo hoo  Well  I have to tell you  from  the bottom of our hearts  thank you so very  very much. Do you know to date the ALS Association has raised     million dollars  Woo hoo   Applause  It takes me back to the summer of     . My family  my kids had all grown up. We were officially empty nesters  and we decided  let's  go on a family vacation. Jenn  my daughter  and my son in law came down from New York. My youngest  Andrew  he came down from his home in Charlestown where he was working in Boston  and my son Pete  who had played at  Boston College  baseball  had played baseball  professionally in Europe  and had now come home and was selling group insurance  he also joined us. And one night  I found myself having a beer with Pete  and Pete was looking at  me and he just said   You know  Mom  I don't know  selling group insurance  is just not my passion.  He said   I just don't feel  I'm living up to my potential. I don't feel this is my mission in life.  And he said   You know   oh by the way  Mom  I have to leave early from vacation because my inter city league team  that I play for made the playoffs  and I have to get back to Boston  because I can't let my team down. I'm just not as passionate about my job as I am about baseball.  So off Pete went  and  left the family vacation   break a mother's heart   and he went  and we  followed four days later to see the next playoff game. We're at the playoff game   Pete's at the plate  and a fastball's coming in  and it hits him on the wrist. Oh  Pete. His wrist went completely limp  like this. So for the next six months  Pete went back to his home in Southie  kept working that unpassionate job  and was going to doctors to see what was wrong with this wrist that never came back. Six months later  in March  he called my husband  and me  and he said   Oh  Mom and Dad  we have a doctor that found a diagnosis for that wrist. Do you want to come with the doctor's appointment with me   I said   Sure  we'll come in.  That morning  Pete  John and I all got up  got dressed  got in our cars   three separate cars because we were going to go to work after the doctor's appointment to find out what happened to the wrist. We walked into the  neurologist's office  sat down  four doctors walk in  and the head neurologist sits down. And he says   Well  Pete  we've been looking at all the tests  and I have to tell you   it's not a sprained wrist  it's not a broken wrist  it's not nerve damage in the wrist  it's not an infection  it's not Lyme disease.  And there was this deliberate  elimination going up  and I was thinking to myself  where is he going with this  Then he put his hands on his knees  he looked right at my     year old kid  and said   I don't know how to  tell a    year old this  Pete  you have ALS.  ALS  I had had a friend whose     year old father had ALS. I looked at my husband  he looked at me  and then we looked at the  doctor  and we said   ALS  Okay  what treatment  Let's go. What do we do  Let's go.  And he looked at us  and he said   Mr. and Mrs. Frates  I'm sorry to tell you this  but there's no treatment  and there's no cure.  We were the worst culprits. We didn't even understand that it had been    years since Lou Gehrig and nothing had been done  in the progress against ALS. So we all went home  and Jenn and Dan flew home from Wall Street  Andrew came home from Charlestown  and Pete went to B.C. to pick up his then girlfriend Julie  and brought her home  and six hours later after diagnosis  we're sitting around  having a family dinner  and we're having small chat. I don't even remember  cooking dinner that night. But then our leader  Pete  set the vision  and talked to us just like  we were his new team. He said   There will be  no wallowing  people.  He goes   We're not looking back  we're looking forward. What an amazing opportunity  we have to change the world. I'm going to change the face of this unacceptable situation of ALS. We're going to move the needle  and I'm going to get it in front of philanthropists like Bill Gates.  And that was it. We  were given our directive. So in the days and months that followed  within a week  we had  our brothers and sisters and our family come to us  that they were already  creating Team Frate Train. Uncle Dave  he was the webmaster  Uncle Artie  he was the accountant  Auntie Dana  she was the graphic artist  and my youngest son  Andrew  quit his job  left his  apartment in Charlestown and says   I'm going to take care  of Pete and be his caregiver.  Then all those people   classmates  teammates  coworkers that Pete had inspired throughout his whole life  the circles of Pete all started intersecting with one another  and made Team Frate Train. Six months after diagnosis  Pete was given an award at a  research summit for advocacy. He got up and gave a very eloquent speech  and at the end of the  speech  there was a panel  and on the panel were these pharmaceutical executives and biochemists and clinicians and I'm sitting there and  I'm listening to them and most of the content  went straight over my head. I avoided every science  class I ever could. But I was watching these people  and I was listening to them  and they were saying    I  I do this  I do that   and there was a real  unfamiliarity between them. So at the end of their talk  the panel  they had questions and answers  and boom  my hand went right up  and I get the microphone  and I look at them and I say   Thank you. Thank you so much for working in ALS. It means so very much to us.  I said   But I do have to tell you that I'm watching your body language and I'm listening to what you're saying. It just doesn't seem like there's a whole  lot of collaboration going on here. And not only that  where's the flip chart with the action items and the  follow up and the accountability  What are you going to do  after you leave this room   And then I turned around and there was about     pairs  of eyes just staring at me. And it was that point that I realized that I had talked about  the elephant in the room. Thus my mission had begun. So over the next couple of years  Pete   we've had our highs and our lows. Pete was put on a compassionate use drug. It was hope in a bottle for  the whole ALS community. It was in a phase III trial. Then six months later  the  data comes back  no efficacy. We were supposed to  have therapies overseas  and the rug was  pulled out from under us. So for the next two years  we just watched my son  be taken away from me  little by little every day. Two and a half years ago  Pete was hitting home  runs at baseball fields. Today  Pete's completely paralyzed. He can't hold his head up any longer. He's confined to a motorized wheelchair. He can no longer swallow or eat. He has a feeding tube. He can't speak. He talks with eye gaze technology and a speech generating device  and we're watching his lungs  because his diaphragm  eventually is going to give out and then the decision will be made to put him on a ventilator or not. ALS robs the human of all their physical  parts  but the brain stays intact. So July  th          th year of Lou Gehrig's  inspirational speech comes  and Pete is asked by MLB.com to write an article in the Bleacher Report. And it was very significant  because he  wrote it using his eye gaze technology. Twenty days later   the ice started to fall. On July   th  Pete's  roommate in New York City  wearing a Quinn For The Win shirt  signifying Pat Quinn  another  ALS patient known in New York  and B.C. shorts said   I'm taking the ALS  Ice Bucket Challenge   picked up the ice  put it over his head.  And I'm nominating ...   And he sent it up to Boston. And that was on July   th. Over the next couple  of days  our news feed was full of family and friends. If you haven't gone back  the nice thing about Facebook is that you have the dates  you can go back. You've got to see Uncle Artie's  human Bloody Mary. I'm telling you  it's one of the best ones  and that was probably in day two. By about day four  Uncle  Dave  the webmaster  he isn't on Facebook  and I get a text from him   and it says   Nancy  what the hell is going on   Uncle Dave gets a hit  every time Pete's website is gone onto  and his  phone was blowing up. So we all sat down and we realized  money is coming in   how amazing. So we knew awareness  would lead to funding  we just didn't know it would only take a couple of days. So we got together  put our best      c    s on Pete's website  and off we went. So week one  Boston media. Week two  national media. It was during week two  that our neighbor next door opened up our door and threw a pizza across the kitchen floor  saying   I think you people might  need food in there.  Week three  celebrities    Entertainment Tonight  Access Hollywood. Week four  global   BBC  Irish Radio. Did anyone see  Lost In Translation   My husband did Japanese television. It was interesting. And those videos  the popular ones. Paul Bissonnette's  glacier video  incredible. How about the redemption nuns of Dublin  Who's seen that one  It's absolutely fantastic. J.T.  Justin Timberlake. That's when we knew  that  was a real A list celebrity. I go back on my texts  and I can see  JT  JT   My sister texting me. Angela Merkel  the chancellor of Germany. Incredible. And the ALS patients  you know what their favorite ones are  and their families'  All of them. Because this misunderstood and  underfunded  rare  disease  they just sat and watched people  saying it over and over   ALS  ALS.  It was unbelievable. And those naysayers  let's just talk a couple  of stats  shall we  Okay  so the ALS Association  they think by year end  it'll be     million dollars. ALS TDI in Cambridge  they raised three million dollars. Well  guess what  They had a clinical trial for a drug that they've been developing. It was on a three year track for funding. Two months. It's coming out starting in two months. And YouTube has reported that over     countries have posted Ice Bucket Challenges for ALS. And Facebook   .  million videos  and I had the awesome adventure visiting the Facebook campus last week  and I said to them   I know what it was like in my house. I can't imagine what it  was like around here.  All she said was   Jaw dropping.  And my family's favorite video  Bill Gates. Because the night Pete was diagnosed  he told us that he was going to get ALS in front of philanthropists like Bill Gates  and he did it. Goal number one  check. Now on to the treatment and cure. So okay  after all of this ice  we know that it was much more than just pouring buckets of  ice water over your head  and I really would like to leave you with a couple of things that  I'd like you to remember. The first thing is  every morning when you wake up  you can choose to live your day in positivity. Would any of you blame me if I just was in the fetal position and pulled the covers  over my head every day  No  I don't think anybody would blame me  but Pete has inspired us to wake up every morning and be  positive and proactive. I actually had to ditch support groups because everybody was in there saying that spraying their lawns with chemicals  that's why they got ALS  and I was like   I don't think so   but I had to get away from the negativity. The second thing I want to leave you with is the person at the  middle of the challenge has to be willing to have  the mental toughness to put themselves out there. Pete still goes to baseball games and he still sits with his  teammates in the dugout  and he hangs his gravity feed bag right on the cages. You'll see the kids  they're  up there hanging it up.  Pete  is that okay    Yup.  And then they put it  right into his stomach. Because he wants them to see what the reality of this is  and how he's never  ever going to give up. And the third thing I  want to leave you with  If you ever come across a situation that you see as so unacceptable  I want you to dig down as deep as you can and find your best mother bear and go after it. Thank you. I know that I'm running over  but I've got to leave you with this  the gifts that my son has given me. I have had    years of having the honor of being the mother of Pete Frates. Pete Frates has been inspiring  and leading his whole life. He's thrown out kindness  and all that kindness  has come back to him. He walks the face of the Earth  right now and knows why he's here. What a gift. The second thing that my son has given me is he's given me my mission in life. Now I know why I'm here. I'm going to save my son  and if it doesn't happen in time for him  I'm going to work so that no other mother has to go through what I'm going through. And the third thing   and last but not least gift that my son has given me  as an exclamation point to the miraculous month of August       That girlfriend that he went to get on  the night of diagnosis is now his wife  and Pete and Julie have given me my  granddaughter  Lucy Fitzgerald Frates. Lucy Fitzgerald Frates came two weeks early as the exclamation point on August   st      . And so   And so let me leave you with  Pete's words of inspiration that he would use to classmates  coworkers and teammates. Be passionate. Be genuine. Be hardworking. And don't forget to be great. Thank you.  Applause  I want you guys to imagine  that you're a soldier running through the battlefield. Now  you're shot in the leg with a bullet  which severs your femoral artery. Now  this bleed is extremely traumatic and can kill you in less  than three minutes. Unfortunately  by the time that a medic actually gets to you  what the medic has on his or her belt can take five minutes or more  with the application of pressure  to stop that type of bleed. Now  this problem is  not only a huge problem for the military  but it's  also a huge problem that's epidemic throughout  the entire medical field  which is how do we actually look at wounds and how do we stop them quickly in a way that can work with the body  So now  what I've been working on for the last four years is to develop smart biomaterials  which are actually materials that will work with the body  helping it to heal and helping it to allow the  wounds to heal normally. So now  before we do this  we  have to take a much closer look at actually how does the body work. So now  everybody here knows that the body is made up of cells. So the cell is the most basic unit of life. But not many people know what else. But it actually turns out that your cells sit in this mesh of complicated fibers  proteins and sugars known as the extracellular matrix. So now  the ECM is actually this mesh that  holds the cells in place  provides structure for your tissues  but it also gives the cells a home. It allows them to feel what they're doing  where they are  and tells them how to act and how to behave. And it actually turns out that  the extracellular matrix is different from every  single part of the body. So the ECM in my skin is different than the ECM in my liver  and the ECM in different  parts of the same organ actually vary  so it's very difficult to be able to have a product that will react to the  local extracellular matrix  which is exactly what we're trying to do. So now  for example   think of the rainforest. You have the canopy   you have the understory  and you have the forest floor. Now  all of these parts of the forest are made up of different plants  and different animals call them home. So just like that  the extracellular matrix is incredibly diverse in three dimensions. On top of that  the extracellular matrix is responsible for all wound healing  so if you imagine cutting the body  you actually have to rebuild this very complex ECM in order to get it to form again  and a scar  in fact  is actually poorly formed extracellular matrix. So now  behind me is an animation of the extracellular matrix. So as you see  your cells sit  in this complicated mesh and as you move throughout the tissue  the extracellular matrix changes. So now every other piece  of technology on the market can only manage a two  dimensional approximation of the extracellular matrix  which means that it doesn't fit in with the tissue itself. So when I was a freshman at NYU  what I discovered was  you could actually take small pieces of plant derived polymers and reassemble them onto the wound. So if you have a bleeding  wound like the one behind me  you can actually put  our material onto this  and just like Lego blocks  it'll reassemble into the local tissue. So that means if you put it onto liver  it turns into something  that looks like liver  and if you put it onto skin  it turns into something  that looks just like skin. So when you put the gel on  it actually reassembles  into this local tissue. So now  this has a whole  bunch of applications  but basically the idea is  wherever you put this product  you're able to reassemble  into it immediately. Now  this is a simulated arterial bleed   blood warning   at twice human artery pressure. So now  this type of bleed  is incredibly traumatic  and like I said before   would actually take five minutes or more with pressure to be able to stop. Now  in the time that it takes me to introduce the bleed itself  our material is able to stop that bleed  and it's because it actually  goes on and works with the body to heal  so it reassembles into this piece of meat  and then the blood actually recognizes that that's happening   and produces fibrin  producing a very fast clot in less than    seconds. So now this technology   Thank you. So now this technology  by January  will be in the hands of veterinarians  and we're working very diligently to  try to get it into the hands of doctors  hopefully within the next year. But really  once again  I  want you guys to imagine that you are a soldier running  through a battlefield. Now  you get hit in the leg with a bullet  and instead of bleeding  out in three minutes  you pull a small pack  of gel out of your belt  and with the press of a button  you're able to stop your own bleed and you're on your way to recovery. Thank you very much. I haven't told many people this  but in my head  I've got thousands of secret worlds all going on all at the same time. I am also autistic. People tend to diagnose autism with really specific  check box descriptions  but in reality  it's a whole variation as to what we're like. For instance  my little brother  he's very severely autistic. He's nonverbal. He can't talk at all. But I love to talk. People often associate autism with liking maths and  science and nothing else  but I know so many autistic people who love being creative. But that is a stereotype  and the stereotypes of things are often  if not always  wrong. For instance  a lot of people think autism and think   Rain Man  immediately. That's the common belief  that every single autistic  person is Dustin Hoffman  and that's not true. But that's not just with  autistic people  either. I've seen it with LGBTQ people  with women  with POC people. People are so afraid of variety that they try to fit everything  into a tiny little box with really specific labels. This is something that actually happened to me in real life  I googled  autistic people are ...  and it comes up with suggestions as to what you're going to type. I googled  autistic people are ...  and the top result was  demons.  That is the first thing that people think when they think autism. They know. One of the things I can do  because I'm autistic   it's an ability rather than a disability   is I've got a very  very vivid imagination. Let me explain it to you a bit. It's like I'm walking in two  worlds most of the time. There's the real world   the world that we all share  and there's the world in my mind  and the world in my mind  is often so much more real than the real world. Like  it's very easy for  me to let my mind loose because I don't try and fit  myself into a tiny little box. That's one of the best  things about being autistic. You don't have the urge to do that. You find what you want to do  you find a way to do it   and you get on with it. If I was trying to fit myself into a box  I wouldn't be here  I  wouldn't have achieved half the things that I have now. There are problems  though. There are problems with being autistic  and there are problems with having too much imagination. School can be a problem in general  but having also to explain to a teacher on a daily basis that their lesson is inexplicably dull and you are secretly taking refuge in a world inside your head in  which you are not in that lesson  that adds to your list of problems. Also  when my imagination takes hold  my body takes on a life of its own. When something very exciting happens in my inner world  I've just got to run. I've got to rock backwards and forwards  or sometimes scream. This gives me so much energy  and I've got to have an  outlet for all that energy. But I've done that ever  since I was a child  ever since I was a tiny little girl. And my parents thought it was  cute  so they didn't bring it up  but when I got into school  they didn't really agree that it was cute. It can be that people  don't want to be friends with the girl that starts  screaming in an algebra lesson. And this doesn't normally  happen in this day and age  but it can be that people don't want  to be friends with the autistic girl. It can be that people  don't want to associate with anyone who won't  or can't fit themselves into a box that's labeled normal. But that's fine with me  because it sorts the wheat from the chaff  and I can find which people  are genuine and true and I can pick these people as my friends. But if you think about it  what is normal  What does it mean  Imagine if that was the best  compliment you ever received.  Wow  you are really normal.  But compliments are   you are extraordinary  or  you step outside the box.  It's  you're amazing.  So if people want to be these things  why are so many people  striving to be normal  Why are people pouring their  brilliant individual light into a mold  People are so afraid of variety  that they try and force everyone  even people who don't want  to or can't  to become normal. There are camps for LGBTQ people or autistic people to try and  make them this  normal   and that's terrifying that people  would do that in this day and age. All in all  I wouldn't trade my autism and my imagination for the world. Because I am autistic  I've presented documentaries to the BBC  I'm in the midst of writing a book  I'm doing this   this is fantastic   and one of the best  things that I've achieved  that I consider to have achieved  is I've found ways of communicating with my little brother and sister  who as I've said are nonverbal.  They can't speak. And people would often write off someone who's nonverbal  but that's silly  because  my little brother and sister are the best siblings that  you could ever hope for. They're just the best   and I love them so much and I care about them  more than anything else. I'm going to leave you with one question  If we can't get inside the person's minds  no matter if they're autistic or not  instead of punishing anything that strays from normal  why not celebrate uniqueness and cheer every time someone unleashes their imagination  Thank you. Now  I'm an ethnobotanist. That's a scientist who  works in the rainforest to document how people use local plants. I've been doing this for a long time  and I want to tell you  these people know these forests and these medicinal treasures better than we do and better than we ever will. But also  these cultures  these indigenous cultures  are disappearing much faster than the forests themselves. And the greatest and most endangered species in the Amazon Rainforest is not the jaguar  it's not the harpy eagle  it's the isolated and uncontacted tribes. Now four years ago  I injured my  foot in a climbing accident and I went to the doctor. She gave me heat  she gave me cold  aspirin  narcotic painkillers  anti inflammatories  cortisone shots. It didn't work. Several months later  I was in the northeast Amazon  walked into a village  and the shaman said   You're limping.  And I'll never forget this as long as I live. He looked me in the face and he said   Take off your shoe and give  me your machete.  He walked over to a palm tree and carved off a fern  threw it in the fire  applied it to my foot  threw it in a pot of water  and had me drink the tea. The pain disappeared for seven months. When it came back  I went to see the shaman again. He gave me the same treatment  and I've been cured for three years now. Who would you rather be treated by  Now  make no mistake   Western medicine is the most successful system of healing ever devised  but there's plenty of holes in it. Where's the cure for breast cancer  Where's the cure for schizophrenia  Where's the cure for acid reflux  Where's the cure for insomnia  The fact is that these people can sometimes  sometimes  sometimes cure things we cannot. Here you see a medicine man in the northeast Amazon treating leishmaniasis  a really nasty protozoal disease that afflicts    million people around the world. Western treatment are injections of antimony. They're painful  they're expensive  and they're probably not good for your heart  it's a heavy metal. This man cures it with three plants from the Amazon Rainforest. This is the magic frog. My colleague  the late great Loren McIntyre  discoverer of the source  lake of the Amazon  Laguna McIntyre in the Peruvian Andes  was lost on the Peru Brazil border about    years ago. He was rescued by a group of  isolated Indians called the Mats s. They beckoned for him to follow them into the forest  which he did. There  they took out palm leaf baskets. There  they took out these green monkey frogs   these are big suckers  they're like this   and they began licking them. It turns out  they're highly hallucinogenic. McIntyre wrote about this and it was read  by the editor of High Times magazine. You see that ethnobotanists have  friends in all sorts of strange cultures. This guy decided he would go down to the Amazon and give it a whirl  or give it a lick  and  he did  and he wrote   My blood pressure went through the roof  I lost full control of my bodily functions  I passed out in a heap  I woke up in a hammock six hours later  felt like God for two days.  An Italian chemist read this and said   I'm not really interested in the theological  aspects of the green monkey frog. What's this about the change in blood pressure   Now  this is an Italian chemist who's working on a new treatment for high blood pressure based on peptides in the skin of the green monkey frog  and other scientists are looking at a cure for drug resistant Staph aureus. How ironic if these isolated  Indians and their magic frog prove to be one of the cures. Here's an ayahuasca shaman in the northwest Amazon  in the middle of a yage ceremony. I took him to Los Angeles to meet a foundation officer looking for support for monies to protect their culture. This fellow looked at the medicine man  and he said   You didn't go to  medical school  did you   The shaman said   No  I did not.  He said   Well  then what can you know about healing   The shaman looked at him and he said   You know what  If you have  an infection  go to a doctor. But many human afflictions are diseases  of the heart  the mind and the spirit. Western medicine can't  touch those. I cure them.  But all is not rosy in learning from nature about new medicines. This is a viper from Brazil  the venom of which was studied at the Universidade de S o Paulo here. It was later developed into ACE inhibitors. This is a frontline treatment for hypertension. Hypertension causes over    percent of all deaths on the planet every day. This is a    billion industry based on venom from a Brazilian snake  and the Brazilians did not get a nickel. This is not an acceptable way of doing business. The rainforest has been called the  greatest expression of life on Earth. There's a saying in Suriname that I dearly love   The rainforests hold answers to questions we have yet to ask.  But as you all know  it's rapidly disappearing. Here in Brazil  in the Amazon  around the world. I took this picture from a small plane flying over the eastern border of the Xingu indigenous reserve in the state of Mato Grosso to the northwest of here. The top half of the picture  you see where the Indians live. The line through the middle is the eastern border of the reserve. Top half Indians  bottom half white guys. Top half wonder drugs  bottom half just a bunch of skinny ass cows. Top half carbon sequestered in the forest where it belongs  bottom half carbon in the atmosphere where it's driving climate change. In fact  the number two cause of carbon being released into the atmosphere is forest destruction. But in talking about destruction  it's important to keep in mind that the Amazon is the mightiest landscape of all. It's a place of beauty and wonder. The biggest anteater in the world lives in the rain forest  tips the scale at    pounds. The goliath bird eating spider is the world's largest spider. It's found in the Amazon as well. The harpy eagle wingspan is over seven feet. And the black cayman   these monsters can tip the scale at over half a ton. They're known to be man eaters. The anaconda  the largest snake  the capybara  the largest rodent. A specimen from here in Brazil tipped the scale at     pounds. Let's visit where these creatures live  the northeast Amazon  home to the Akuriyo tribe. Uncontacted peoples hold a  mystical and iconic role in our imagination. These are the people who  know nature best. These are the people who truly live in total harmony with nature. By our standards  some would dismiss these people as primitive.  They don't know how to make fire  or they didn't when they were first contacted.  But they know the forest far better than we do. The Akuriyos have    words for honey  and other Indians look up to them as being the true masters of the emerald realm. Here you see the face of my friend Pohnay. When I was a teenager rocking out to the Rolling Stones in my hometown of New Orleans  Pohnay was a forest nomad roaming the jungles of the northeast Amazon in a small band  looking for game  looking for medicinal plants  looking for a wife  in other small nomadic bands. But it's people like these that know things that we don't  and they have lots of  lessons to teach us. However  if you go into most of the forests of the Amazon  there are no indigenous peoples. This is what you find  rock carvings which indigenous peoples  uncontacted peoples  used to sharpen the edge of the stone axe. These cultures that once danced  made love  sang to the gods  worshipped the forest  all that's left is an imprint in stone  as you see here. Let's move to the western Amazon  which is really the epicenter of isolated peoples. Each of these dots represents a small  uncontacted tribe  and the big reveal today is we believe there are    or    isolated groups in the Colombian Amazon alone. Why are these people isolated  They know we exist  they know there's an outside world. This is a form of resistance. They have chosen to remain isolated  and I think it is their human right to remain so. Why are these the tribes that hide from man  Here's why. Obviously  some of this  was set off in     . But at the turn of the last century was the rubber trade. The demand for natural rubber  which came from the Amazon  set off the botanical equivalent of a gold rush. Rubber for bicycle tires  rubber for automobile tires  rubber for zeppelins. It was a mad race to get that rubber  and the man on the left  Julio Arana  is one of the true thugs of the story. His people  his company  and other companies like them killed  massacred  tortured  butchered Indians like the Witotos you see on the right hand side of the slide. Even today  when people come out of the forest  the story seldom has a happy ending. These are Nukaks. They were contacted in the '  s. Within a year  everybody over    was dead. And remember  these are preliterate societies. The elders are the libraries. Every time a shaman dies  it's as if a library has burned down. They have been forced off their lands. The drug traffickers have taken over the Nukak lands  and the Nukaks live as beggars in public parks in eastern Colombia. From the Nukak lands  I want to  take you to the southwest  to the most spectacular  landscape in the world  Chiribiquete National Park. It was surrounded by three isolated tribes and thanks to the Colombian government and Colombian colleagues  it has now expanded. It's bigger than the state of Maryland. It is a treasure trove of botanical diversity. It was first explored botanically in      by my mentor  Richard Schultes  seen here atop the Bell Mountain  the sacred mountains of the Karijonas. And let me show you what it looks like today. Flying over Chiribiquete  realize that these lost world mountains are still lost. No scientist has been atop them. In fact  nobody has been atop the Bell Mountain since Schultes in '  . And we'll end up here with the Bell Mountain just to the east of the picture. Let me show you what it looks like today. Not only is this a treasure trove of botanical diversity  not only is it home to three isolated tribes  but it's the greatest treasure trove of pre Colombian art in the world  over         paintings. The Dutch scientist Thomas van der Hammen described this as the Sistine Chapel of the Amazon Rainforest. But move from Chiribiquete down to the southeast  again in the Colombian Amazon. Remember  the Colombian Amazon is bigger than New England. The Amazon's a big forest  and Brazil's got a big part of it  but not all of it. Moving down to these two national parks  Cahuinari and Pur  in the Colombian Amazon   that's the Brazilian border to the right   it's home to several groups of isolated and uncontacted peoples. To the trained eye  you can look at the roofs of these malocas  these longhouses  and see that there's cultural diversity. These are  in fact  different tribes. As isolated as these areas are  let me show you how the  outside world is crowding in. Here we see trade and transport increased in Putumayo. With the diminishment of the Civil War in Colombia  the outside world is showing up. To the north  we have illegal gold mining  also from the east  from Brazil. There's increased hunting and fishing for commercial purposes. We see illegal logging coming from the south  and drug runners are trying to move through the park and get into Brazil. This  in the past  is why you didn't mess with isolated Indians. And if it looks like this picture is out of focus because it was taken in a hurry  here's why. This looks like    Applause  This looks like a hangar from the Brazilian Amazon. This is an art exhibit in Havana  Cuba. A group called Los Carpinteros. This is their perception of why you  shouldn't mess with uncontacted Indians. But the world is changing. These are Mashco Piros on the Brazil Peru border who stumbled out of the jungle because they were essentially chased out by drug runners and timber people. And in Peru  there's a very nasty business. It's called human safaris. They will take you in to isolated groups to take their picture. Of course  when you give them  clothes  when you give them tools  you also give them diseases. We call these  inhuman safaris.  These are Indians again  on the Peru border  who were overflown by flights sponsored by missionaries. They want to get in there and turn them into Christians. We know how that turns out. What's to be done  Introduce technology to the contacted tribes  not the uncontacted tribes  in a culturally sensitive way. This is the perfect marriage of  ancient shamanic wisdom and   st century technology. We've done this now with over    tribes  mapped  managed and increased protection of over    million acres of ancestral rainforest. So this allows the Indians to take control of their environmental and cultural destiny. They also then set up guard houses to keep outsiders out. These are Indians  trained as indigenous park rangers  patrolling the borders and keeping the outside world at bay. This is a picture of actual contact. These are Chitonahua Indians on the Brazil Peru border. They've come out of the jungle asking for help. They were shot at  their malocas  their  longhouses  were burned. Some of them were massacred. Using automatic weapons to  slaughter uncontacted peoples is the single most despicable and  disgusting human rights abuse on our planet today  and it has to stop. But let me conclude by saying  this work can be spiritually rewarding  but it's difficult and it can be dangerous. Two colleagues of mine passed away recently in the crash of a small plane. They were serving the forest to protect those uncontacted tribes. So the question is  in conclusion  is what the future holds. These are the Uray people in Brazil. What does the future hold for them  and what does the future hold for us  Let's think differently. Let's make a better world. If the climate's going to change  let's have a climate that changes for the better rather than the worse. Let's live on a planet full of luxuriant vegetation  in which isolated peoples can remain in isolation  can maintain that mystery and that knowledge if they so choose. Let's live in a world where the shamans live in these forests and heal themselves and us with their mystical plants and their sacred frogs. Thanks again. Vision is the most important and prioritized sense that we have. We are constantly looking at the world around us  and quickly we identify and make sense of what it is that we see. Let's just start with an example of that very fact. I'm going to show you a photograph of a person  just for a second or two  and I'd like for you to identify what emotion is on his face. Ready  Here you go. Go with your gut reaction. Okay. What did you see  Well  we actually surveyed over     individuals  and the results were mixed. People did not agree on what emotion they saw on his face. Maybe you saw discomfort. That was the most frequent response that we received. But if you asked the person on your left  they might have said regret or skepticism  and if you asked somebody on your right  they might have said something entirely different  like hope or empathy. So we are all looking at the very same face again. We might see something entirely different  because perception is subjective. What we think we see is actually filtered through our own mind's eye. Of course  there are many other examples of how we see the world through own mind's eye. I'm going to give you just a few. So dieters  for instance  see apples as larger than people who are not counting calories. Softball players see the ball as smaller if they've just come out of a slump  compared to people who  had a hot night at the plate. And actually  our political beliefs also can affect the way we see other people  including politicians. So my research team and I decided to test this question. In       Barack Obama was running for president for the very first time  and we surveyed hundreds of Americans one month before the election. What we found in this survey was that some people  some Americans  think photographs like these best reflect how Obama really looks. Of these people     percent voted for Obama in the actual election. Other people  though  thought photographs like these best reflect how Obama really looks.    percent of these people voted for McCain. We presented many photographs of Obama one at a time  so people did not realize that what we were changing from one photograph to the next was whether we had artificially lightened or darkened his skin tone. So how is that possible  How could it be that when I look at a person  an object  or an event  I see something very different than somebody else does  Well  the reasons are many  but one reason requires that we understand a little bit more about how our eyes work. So vision scientists know that the amount of information that we can see at any given point in time  what we can focus on  is actually relatively small. What we can see with great sharpness and clarity and accuracy is the equivalent of the surface area of our thumb on our outstretched arm. Everything else around that is blurry  rendering much of what is presented to our eyes as ambiguous. But we have to clarify and make sense of what it is that we see  and it's our mind that helps us fill in that gap. As a result  perception is a subjective experience  and that's how we end up seeing through our own mind's eye. So  I'm a social psychologist  and it's questions like these that really intrigue me. I am fascinated by those times when people do not see eye to eye. Why is it that somebody might literally see the glass as half full  and somebody literally sees it as half empty  What is it about what one person is thinking and feeling that leads them to see the world in an entirely different way  And does that even matter  So to begin to tackle these questions  my research team and I decided to delve deeply into an issue that has received international attention  our health and fitness. Across the world  people are struggling to manage their weight  and there is a variety of strategies that we have to help us keep the pounds off. For instance  we set the best of intentions to exercise after the holidays  but actually  the majority of Americans find that their New Year's resolutions are broken by Valentine's Day. We talk to ourselves in very encouraging ways  telling ourselves this is our year to get back into shape  but that is not enough to bring us back to our ideal weight. So why  Of course  there is no simple answer  but one reason  I argue  is that our mind's eye might work against us. Some people may literally see exercise as more difficult  and some people might literally see exercise as easier. So  as a first step to testing these questions  we gathered objective measurements of individuals' physical fitness. We measured the  circumference of their waist  compared to the  circumference of their hips. A higher waist to hip ratio is an indicator of being less physically fit than a lower waist to hip ratio. After gathering these measurements  we told our participants that they would walk to a finish line while carrying extra weight in a sort of race. But before they did that  we asked them to estimate the distance to the finish line. We thought that the physical states of their body might change how they perceived the distance. So what did we find  Well  waist to hip ratio predicted perceptions of distance. People who were out of shape and unfit actually saw the distance to the finish line as significantly greater than people who were in better shape. People's states of their own body changed how they perceived the environment. But so too can our mind. In fact  our bodies and our minds work in tandem to change how we see the world around us. That led us to think that maybe people with strong motivations and strong goals to exercise might actually see the finish line as closer than people who have weaker motivations. So to test whether motivations affect our perceptual experiences in this way  we conducted a second study. Again  we gathered objective measurements of people's physical fitness  measuring the circumference of their waist and the circumference of their hips  and we had them do a  few other tests of fitness. Based on feedback that we gave them  some of our participants told us they're not motivated to exercise any more. They felt like they already met their fitness goals and they weren't going to do anything else. These people were not motivated. Other people  though   based on our feedback  told us they were highly  motivated to exercise. They had a strong goal to make it to the finish line. But again  before we had them walk to the finish line  we had them estimate the distance. How far away was the finish line  And again  like the previous study  we found that waist to hip ratio predicted perceptions of distance. Unfit individuals saw the distance as farther  saw the finish line as farther away  than people who were in better shape. Importantly  though  this only happened for people who were not motivated to exercise. On the other hand  people who were highly motivated to exercise saw the distance as short. Even the most out of shape individuals saw the finish line as just as close  if not slightly closer  than people who were in better shape. So our bodies can change how far away that finish line looks  but people who had committed to a manageable goal that they could accomplish in the near future and who believed that they were capable of meeting that goal actually saw the exercise as easier. That led us to wonder  is there a strategy that we could use and teach people that would help change their perceptions of the distance  help them make exercise look easier  So we turned to the vision science literature to figure out what should we do  and based on what we read  we came up with a strategy that we called   Keep  your eyes on the prize.  So this is not the slogan from an inspirational poster. It's an actual directive for how to look around your environment. People that we trained in this strategy  we told them to focus their attention on the finish line  to avoid looking around  to imagine a spotlight was shining on that goal  and that everything around it was blurry and perhaps difficult to see. We thought that this strategy would help make the exercise look easier. We compared this group to a baseline group. To this group we said  just look around the environment as you naturally would. You will notice the finish line  but you might also notice the garbage can off to the right  or the people and the  lamp post off to the left. We thought that people who used this strategy would see the distance as farther. So what did we find  When we had them estimate the distance  was this strategy successful for changing their perceptual experience  Yes. People who kept their eyes on the prize saw the finish line as    percent closer than people who looked around as they naturally would. We thought this was great. We were really excited because it meant that this strategy helped make the exercise look easier  but the big question was  could this help make exercise actually better  Could it improve the quality of exercise as well  So next  we told our participants  you are going to walk to the finish line while wearing extra weight. We added weights to their ankles that amounted to    percent of their body weight. We told them to lift their knees up high and walk to the finish line quickly. We designed this exercise in particular to be moderately challenging but not impossible  like most exercises that actually improve our fitness. So the big question  then  Did keeping your eyes on the prize and narrowly focusing on the finish line change their experience of the exercise  It did. People who kept their eyes on the prize told us afterward that it required    percent less exertion for them to do this exercise than people who looked around naturally. It changed their subjective experience of the exercise. It also changed the objective nature of their exercise. People who kept their eyes on the prize actually moved    percent faster than people who looked around naturally. To put that in perspective  a    percent increase is like trading in your      Chevy Citation for a      Chevrolet Corvette. We were so excited by this  because this meant that a strategy that costs nothing  that is easy for people to use  regardless of whether they're in shape or struggling to get there  had a big effect. Keeping your eyes on the prize made the exercise look and feel easier even when people were working harder because they were moving faster. Now  I know there's more to good health than walking a little bit faster  but keeping your eyes on the prize might be one additional strategy that you can use to help promote a healthy lifestyle. If you're not convinced yet that we all see the world through our own mind's eye  let me leave you with one final example. Here's a photograph of a beautiful  street in Stockholm  with two cars. The car in the back looks much larger than the car in the front. However  in reality  these cars are the same size  but that's not how we see it. So does this mean that our eyes have gone haywire and that our brains are a mess  No  it doesn't mean that at all. It's just how our eyes work. We might see the world in a different way  and sometimes that might not line up with reality  but it doesn't mean that one of us is right and one of us is wrong. We all see the world through our mind's eye  but we can teach ourselves to see it differently. So I can think of days that have gone horribly wrong for me. I'm fed up  I'm grumpy  I'm tired  and I'm so behind  and there's a big black cloud hanging over my head  and on days like these  it looks like everyone around me is down in the dumps too. My colleague at work looks annoyed when I ask for an extension on a deadline  and my friend looks frustrated when I show up late for lunch because a meeting ran long  and at the end of the day  my husband looks disappointed because I'd rather go to  bed than go to the movies. And on days like these  when everybody looks upset and angry to me  I try to remind myself that there are other ways of seeing them. Perhaps my colleague was confused  perhaps my friend was concerned  and perhaps my husband was  feeling empathy instead. So we all see the world through our own mind's eye  and on some days  it might look like the world is a dangerous and challenging and insurmountable place  but it doesn't have to look that way all the time. We can teach ourselves to see it differently  and when we find a way to make the world look nicer and easier  it might actually become so. Thank you. I'm a lifelong traveler. Even as a little kid  I was actually working out that it would be cheaper to go to boarding school in England than just to the best school down the road from my parents' house in California. So  from the time I was nine years old I was flying alone several times a year over the North Pole  just to go to school. And of course the more I flew the more I came to love to fly  so the very week after I graduated from high school  I got a job mopping tables so that I could spend every season of my   th year on a different continent. And then  almost inevitably  I became a travel writer so my job and my joy could become one. And I really began to feel that if you were lucky enough to walk around the candlelit temples of Tibet or to wander along the seafronts in Havana with music passing all around you  you could bring those sounds  and the high cobalt skies and the flash of the blue ocean back to your friends at home  and really bring some magic and clarity to your own life. Except  as you all know  one of the first things you learn when you travel is that nowhere is magical unless you can bring the right eyes to it. You take an angry man to the Himalayas  he just starts complaining about the food. And I found that the best way that I could develop more attentive and more appreciative eyes was  oddly  by going nowhere  just by sitting still. And of course sitting still is how many of us get what we most crave and need in our accelerated lives  a break. But it was also the only way that I could find to sift through the slideshow of my experience and make sense of the future and the past. And so  to my great surprise  I found that going nowhere was at least as exciting as going to Tibet or to Cuba. And by going nowhere  I mean nothing more intimidating than taking a few minutes out of every day or a few days out of every season  or even  as some people do  a few years out of a life in order to sit still long enough to find out what moves you most  to recall where your truest happiness lies and to remember that sometimes making a living and making a life point in opposite directions. And of course  this is what wise beings through the centuries from every tradition have been telling us. It's an old idea. More than       years ago   the Stoics were reminding us it's not our experience that makes our lives  it's what we do with it. Imagine a hurricane suddenly  sweeps through your town and reduces every last thing to rubble. One man is traumatized for life. But another  maybe even his brother  almost feels liberated  and decides this is a great chance to start his life anew. It's exactly the same event  but radically different responses. There is nothing either good or bad  as Shakespeare told us in  Hamlet   but thinking makes it so. And this has certainly been my experience as a traveler. Twenty four years ago I took  the most mind bending trip across North Korea. But the trip lasted a few days. What I've done with it sitting still  going back to it in my head  trying to understand it  finding a place for it in my thinking  that's lasted    years already and will probably last a lifetime. The trip  in other words  gave me some amazing sights  but it's only sitting still that allows me to turn those into lasting insights. And I sometimes think that so much of our life takes place inside our heads  in memory or imagination or interpretation or speculation  that if I really want to change my life I might best begin by changing my mind. Again  none of this is new  that's why Shakespeare and the Stoics were telling us this centuries ago  but Shakespeare never had to face     emails in a day. The Stoics  as far as I know  were not on Facebook. We all know that in our on demand lives  one of the things that's most on demand is ourselves. Wherever we are  any time of night or day  our bosses  junk mailers  our parents can get to us. Sociologists have actually found that in recent years Americans are working fewer hours than    years ago  but we feel as if we're working more. We have more and more time saving devices  but sometimes  it seems  less and less time. We can more and more easily  make contact with people on the furthest corners of the planet  but sometimes in that process we lose contact with ourselves. And one of my biggest surprises  as a traveler has been to find that often it's exactly the people who have most enabled us to get anywhere who are intent on going nowhere. In other words  precisely those beings who have created the technologies that override so many of the limits of old  are the ones wisest about the need for limits  even when it comes to technology. I once went to the Google headquarters and I saw all the things many of you have heard about  the indoor tree houses  the trampolines  workers at that time enjoying    percent of their paid time free so that they could just let their imaginations go wandering. But what impressed me even more was that as I was waiting for my digital I.D.  one Googler was telling me about the program that he was about to start to teach the many  many Googlers who practice yoga to become trainers in it  and the other Googler was telling me about the book that he was about to write on the inner search engine  and the ways in which science has empirically shown that sitting still  or meditation  can lead not just to better  health or to clearer thinking  but even to emotional intelligence. I have another friend in Silicon Valley who is really one  of the most eloquent spokesmen for the latest technologies  and in fact was one of the founders of Wired magazine  Kevin Kelly. And Kevin wrote his last book on fresh technologies without a smartphone or a laptop or a TV in his home. And like many in Silicon Valley  he tries really hard to observe what they call an Internet sabbath  whereby for    or    hours every week they go completely offline in order to gather the sense of direction and proportion they'll need  when they go online again. The one thing perhaps that technology hasn't always given us is a sense of how to make the wisest use of technology. And when you speak of the sabbath  look at the Ten Commandments    there's only one word there for which the adjective  holy  is used  and that's the Sabbath. I pick up the Jewish holy book of the Torah    its longest chapter  it's on the Sabbath. And we all know that it's really one of our greatest luxuries  the empty space. In many a piece of music   it's the pause or the rest that gives the piece its beauty and its shape. And I know I as a writer will often try to include a lot of empty space on the page so that the reader can complete my thoughts and sentences and so that her imagination has room to breathe. Now  in the physical domain   of course  many people  if they have the resources  will try to get a place in the country  a second home. I've never begun to have those resources  but I sometimes remember that any time I want  I can get a second home in time  if not in space  just by taking a day off. And it's never easy because  of course   whenever I do I spend much of it worried about all the extra stuff that's going to crash down on me the following day. I sometimes think I'd rather give up meat or sex or wine than the chance to check on my emails. And every season I do try to take three days off on retreat but a part of me still feels guilty to be leaving my poor wife behind and to be ignoring all those seemingly urgent emails from my bosses and maybe to be missing a friend's birthday party. But as soon as I get to a place of real quiet  I realize that it's only by going there that I'll have anything fresh or creative or joyful to share with my wife or bosses or friends. Otherwise  really  I'm just foisting on them my exhaustion or my distractedness  which is no blessing at all. And so when I was     I decided to remake my entire life in the light of going nowhere. One evening I was coming back from the office  it was after midnight  I was in a taxi driving through Times Square  and I suddenly realized that I was racing around so much I could never catch up with my life. And my life then  as it happened  was pretty much the one I might have dreamed of as a little boy. I had really interesting friends and colleagues  I had a nice apartment on Park Avenue and   th Street. I had  to me  a fascinating job  writing about world affairs  but I could never separate myself enough from them to hear myself think    or really  to understand if I was truly happy. And so  I abandoned my dream life for a single room on the backstreets of Kyoto  Japan  which was the place that had long exerted a strong  really mysterious gravitational pull on me. Even as a child I would just look at a painting of Kyoto and feel I recognized it  I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it. But it's also  as you all know  a beautiful city encircled by hills  filled with more than       temples and shrines  where people have been sitting still for     years or more. And quite soon after I moved there  I ended up where I still am with my wife  formerly our kids  in a two room apartment in the middle of nowhere where we have no bicycle  no car  no TV I can understand  and I still have to support my loved ones as a travel writer and a journalist  so clearly this is not ideal for job advancement or for cultural excitement or for social diversion. But I realized that it gives me what I prize most  which is days and hours. I have never once had to use a cell phone there. I almost never have to look at the time  and every morning when I wake up  really the day stretches in front of me like an open meadow. And when life throws up one of its nasty surprises  as it will  more than once  when a doctor comes into my room wearing a grave expression  or a car suddenly veers in front of mine on the freeway  I know  in my bones  that it's the time I've spent going nowhere that is going to sustain me much more than all the time I've spent racing around to Bhutan or Easter Island. I'll always be a traveler    my livelihood depends on it    but one of the beauties of travel is that it allows you to bring stillness into the motion and the commotion of the world. I once got on a plane in Frankfurt  Germany  and a young German woman  came down and sat next to me and engaged me in a very friendly conversation for about    minutes  and then she just turned around and sat still for    hours. She didn't once turn on her video monitor  she never pulled out a book  she didn't even go to sleep  she just sat still  and something of her clarity and calm really imparted itself to me. I've noticed more and more people taking conscious measures these days to try to open up a space inside their lives. Some people go to black hole resorts where they'll spend hundreds of dollars a night in order to hand over their cell phone and their laptop to the front desk on arrival. Some people I know  just before they go to sleep  instead of scrolling through their messages or checking out YouTube  just turn out the lights and listen to some music  and notice that they sleep much better and wake up much refreshed. I was once fortunate enough to drive into the high  dark mountains behind Los Angeles  where the great poet and singer and international heartthrob Leonard Cohen was living and working for many years as a full time monk in the Mount Baldy Zen Center. And I wasn't entirely surprised when the record that he released at the age of     to which he gave the deliberately  unsexy title of  Old Ideas   went to number one in the charts  in    nations in the world  hit the top five in nine others. Something in us  I think  is crying out for the sense of intimacy and depth that we get from people like that. who take the time and trouble to sit still. And I think many of us have the sensation  I certainly do  that we're standing about two inches away from a huge screen  and it's noisy and it's crowded and it's changing with every second  and that screen is our lives. And it's only by stepping back  and then further back  and holding still  that we can begin to see what the canvas means and to catch the larger picture. And a few people do that for us by going nowhere. So  in an age of acceleration  nothing can be more exhilarating than going slow. And in an age of distraction  nothing is so luxurious as paying attention. And in an age of constant movement  nothing is so urgent as sitting still. So you can go on your next vacation to Paris or Hawaii  or New Orleans  I bet you'll have a wonderful time. But  if you want to come back home alive and full of fresh hope  in love with the world  I think you might want to try considering going nowhere. Thank you.
