I have never  ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in her exile   Son  resist Gaddafi. Fight him. But don't you ever turn into a Gaddafi like revolutionary.  Almost two years have passed since the Libyan Revolution broke out  inspired by the waves of mass mobilization in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions. I joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya to call for a day of rage and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi. And there it was  a great revolution. Young Libyan women and men were at the forefront calling for the fall of the regime  raising slogans of freedom  dignity  social justice. They have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi. They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south. Eventually  after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost        dead  we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant. However  Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden  a legacy of tyranny  corruption and seeds of diversions. For four decades Gaddafi's tyrannical regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society. Aware of the devastation and the challenges  I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society  calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation. Almost     organizations were established in Benghazi during and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi    almost     in Tripoli. After a period of    years in exile  I went back to Libya  and with unique enthusiasm  I started organizing workshops on capacity building  on human development of leadership skills. With an amazing group of women  I co founded the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace  a movement of women  leaders  from different walks of life  to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace. I met a very difficult environment in the pre elections  an environment which was increasingly polarized  an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion. I led an initiative by the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law  a law that would give every citizen  no matter what your background  the right to vote and run  and most importantly to stipulate on political parties the alternation of male and female candidates vertically and horizontally in their lists  creating the zipper list. Eventually  our initiative was adopted and successful. Women won   .  percent of the National Congress in the first elections ever in    years. However  bit by bit  the euphoria of the elections  and of the revolution as a whole  was fading out    for every day we were waking up to the news of violence. One day we wake up to the news of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs. On another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate. On another day we wake up to the news of the assassination of army officers. And every day  every day we wake up with the rule of the militias and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners and their disrespect of the rule of law. Our society  shaped by a revolutionary mindset  became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles    freedom  dignity  social justice    that we first held. Intolerance  exclusion and revenge became the icons of the  aftermath  of the revolution. I am here today not at all to inspire you with our success story of the zipper list and the elections. I'm rather here today to confess that we as a nation took the wrong choice  made the wrong decision. We did not prioritize right. For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya. Did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates bring peace and national reconciliation  No  it didn't. What is it  then  Why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion  by both men and women  Maybe what was missing was not the women only  but the feminine values of compassion  mercy and inclusion. Our society needs national dialogue and consensus building more than it needed the elections  which only reinforced polarization and division. Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical  quantitative representation of the feminine. We need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage. We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy. We need to develop a feminine discourse that not only honors but also implements mercy instead of revenge  collaboration instead of competition  inclusion instead of exclusion. These are the ideals that a war torn Libya needs desperately in order to achieve peace. For peace has an alchemy  and this alchemy is about the intertwining  the alternation between the feminine and masculine perspectives. That's the real zipper. And we need to establish that existentially before we do so sociopolitically. According to a Quranic verse  Salam     peace     is the word of the all merciful God  raheem.  In turn  the word  raheem   which is known in all Abrahamic traditions  has the same root in Arabic as the word  rahem     womb    symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity from which the male and the female  from which all tribes  all peoples  have emanated from. And so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo  which grows within it  the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence. Thus we are told that  My mercy encompasses all things.  Thus we are told that  My mercy takes precedence over my anger.  May we all be granted a grace of mercy. Thank you. Let me tell you a story. It's my first year as a new high school science teacher  and I'm so eager. I'm so excited  I'm pouring myself into my lesson plans. But I'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization that my students just might not be learning anything. This happens one day  I'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology  viruses and how they attack. And so I'm so excited to discuss this with them  and I come in and I say   Can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool   There's silence. Finally  my favorite student  she looks me straight in the eye  and she says   The reading sucked.  And then she clarified. She said   You know what  I don't mean that it sucks. It means that I didn't understand a word of it. It's boring. Um  who cares  and it sucks.  These sympathetic smiles spread all throughout the room now  and I realize that all of my other students are in the same boat  that maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook  but not one of them really understood the main ideas. Not one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool  why it's so important. I'm totally clueless. I have no idea what to do next. So the only thing I can think of is say   Listen. Let me tell you a story. The main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses. These guys are blown up a couple million times. The real bacteria and viruses are so small we can't see them without a microscope  and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick. But what a lot of people don't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick.  Now  the story that I start telling my kids  it starts out like a horror story. Once upon a time there's this happy little bacterium. Don't get too attached to him. Maybe he's floating around in your stomach or in some spoiled food somewhere  and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good. Maybe he ate something bad for lunch  and then things get really horrible  as his skin rips apart  and he sees a virus coming out from his insides. And then it gets horrible when he bursts open and an army of viruses floods out from his insides. If    Ouch is right     If you see this  and you're a bacterium  this is like your worst nightmare. But if you're a virus and you see this  you cross those little legs of yours and you think   We rock.  Because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium. Here's what had to happen. A virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its DNA into it. The next thing is  that virus DNA made stuff that chopped up the bacteria DNA. And now that we've gotten rid of the bacteria DNA  the virus DNA takes control of the cell and it tells it to start making more viruses. Because  you see  DNA is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make. So this is kind of like going into a car factory and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer robots. The workers still come the next day  they do their job  but they're following different instructions. So replacing the bacteria DNA with virus DNA turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses    that is  until it's so filled with viruses that it bursts. But that's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria. Some are much more crafty. When a secret agent virus infects a bacterium  they do a little espionage. Here  this cloaked  secret agent virus is slipping his DNA into the bacterial cell  but here's the kicker  It doesn't do anything harmful    not at first. Instead  it silently slips into the bacteria's own DNA  and it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell  waiting for instructions. And what's interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies  the babies also have the virus DNA in them. So now we have a whole extended bacteria family  filled with virus sleeper cells. They're just happily living together until a signal happens and    BAM     all of the DNA pops out. It takes control of these cells  turns them into virus making factories  and they all burst  a huge  extended bacteria family  all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts  the viruses taking over the bacterium. So now you understand how viruses can attack cells. There are two ways  On the left is what we call the lytic way  where the viruses go right in and take over the cells. On the  right  is the lysogenic way that uses secret agent viruses. So this stuff is not that hard  right  And now all of you understand it. But if you've graduated from high school  I can almost guarantee you've seen this information before. But I bet it was presented in a way that it didn't exactly stick in your mind. So when my students were first learning this  why did they hate it so much  Well  there were a couple of reasons. First of all  I can guarantee you that their textbooks didn't have secret agent viruses  and they didn't have horror stories. You know  in the communication of science there is this obsession with seriousness. It kills me. I'm not kidding. I used to work for an educational publisher  and as a writer  I was always told never to use stories or fun  engaging language  because then my work might not be viewed as  serious  and  scientific.  Right  I mean  because God forbid somebody have fun when they're learning science. So we have this field of science that's all about slime  and color changes. Check this out. And then we have  of course  as any good scientist has to have  explosions  But if a textbook seems too much fun  it's somehow unscientific. Now another problem was that the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible. If we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier  we could start by saying something like   These viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their DNA into a bacterium.  The way this showed up in the textbook  it looked like this   Bacteriophage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a bacterium.  That's great  perfect for    year olds. But here's the thing. There are plenty of people in science education who would look at this and say there's no way that we could ever give that to students  because it contains some language that isn't completely accurate. For example  I told you that viruses have DNA. Well  a very tiny fraction of them don't. They have something called RNA instead. So a professional science writer would circle that and say   That has to go. We have to change it to something much more technical.  And after a team of professional science editors went over this really simple explanation  they'd find fault with almost every word I've used  and they'd have to change anything that wasn't serious enough  and they'd have to change everything that wasn't     percent perfect. Then it would be accurate  but it would be completely impossible to understand. This is horrifying. You know  I keep talking about this idea of telling a story  and it's like science communication has taken on this idea of what I call the tyranny of precision  where you can't just tell a story. It's like science has become that horrible storyteller that we all know  who gives us all the details nobody cares about  where you're like   Oh  I met my friend for lunch the other day  and she was wearing these ugly jeans. I mean  they weren't really jeans  they were more kind of  like  leggings  but  like  I guess they're actually kind of more like jeggings  like  but I think     and you're just like   Oh my God. What is the point   Or even worse  science education is becoming like that guy who always says   Actually.  Right  You want to be like   Oh  dude  we had to get up in the middle of the night and drive a hundred miles in total darkness.  And that guy's like   Actually  it was   .  miles.  And you're like   Actually  shut up  I'm just trying to tell a story.  Because good storytelling is all about emotional connection. We have to convince our audience that what we're talking about matters. But just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across. I'm reminded of what the architect Mies van der Rohe said  and I paraphrase  when he said that sometimes you have to lie in order to tell the truth. I think this sentiment is particularly relevant to science education. Now  finally  I am often so disappointed when people think that I'm advocating a dumbing down of science. That's not true at all. I'm currently a Ph.D. student at MIT  and I absolutely understand the importance of detailed  specific scientific communication between experts  but not when we're trying to teach    year olds. If a young learner thinks that all viruses have DNA  that's not going to ruin their chances of success in science. But if a young learner can't understand anything in science and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this  that will ruin their chances of success. This needs to stop  and I wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems  and I beg them  I beseech them to just stop it. But I think that's unlikely. So we are so lucky that we have resources like the Internet  where we can circumvent these institutions from the bottom up. There's a growing number of online resources that are dedicated to just explaining science in simple  understandable ways. I dream of a Wikipedia like website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of in simple language any middle schooler can understand. And I myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that I put on YouTube. I explain chemical equilibrium using analogies to awkward middle school dances  and I talk about fuel cells with stories about boys and girls at a summer camp. The feedback that I get is sometimes misspelled and it's often written in LOLcats  but nonetheless it's so appreciative  so thankful that I know this is the right way we should be communicating science. There's still so much work left to be done  though  and if you're involved with science in any way I urge you to join me. Pick up a camera  start to write a blog  whatever  but leave out the seriousness  leave out the jargon. Make me laugh. Make me care. Leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get to the point. How should you start  Why don't you say   Listen  let me tell you a story   Thank you. So  I'm an artist. I live in New York  and I've been working in advertising for    ever since I left school  so about seven  eight years now  and it was draining. I worked a lot of late nights. I worked a lot of weekends  and I found myself never having time for all the projects that I wanted to work on on my own. And one day I was at work and I saw a talk by Stefan Sagmeister on TED  and it was called  The power of time off   and he spoke about how every seven years  he takes a year off from work so he could do his own creative projects  and I was instantly inspired  and I just said   I have to do that. I have to take a year off. I need to take time to travel and spend time with my family and start my own creative ideas.  So the first of those projects ended up being something I called  One Second Every Day.  Basically I'm recording one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life  chronologically compiling these one second tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video until  you know  I can't record them anymore. The purpose of this project is  one  I hate not remembering things that I've done in the past. There's all these things that I've done with my life that I have no recollection of unless someone brings it up  and sometimes I think   Oh yeah  that's something that I did.  And something that I realized early on in the project was that if I wasn't doing anything interesting  I would probably forget to record the video. So the day    the first time that I forgot  it really hurt me  because it's something that I really wanted to    from the moment that I turned     I wanted to keep this project going until forever  and having missed that one second  I realized  it just kind of created this thing in my head where I never forgot ever again. So if I live to see    years of age  I'm going to have a five hour video that encapsulates    years of my life. When I turn     I'll have a one hour video that includes just my   s. This has really invigorated me day to day  when I wake up  to try and do something interesting with my day. Now  one of the things that I have issues with is that  as the days and weeks and months go by  time just seems to start blurring and blending into each other and  you know  I hated that  and visualization is the way to trigger memory. You know  this project for me is a way for me to bridge that gap and remember everything that I've done. Even just this one second allows me to remember everything else I did that one day. It's difficult  sometimes  to pick that one second. On a good day  I'll have maybe three or four seconds that I really want to choose  but I'll just have to narrow it down to one  but even narrowing it down to that one allows me to remember the other three anyway. It's also kind of a protest  a personal protest  against the culture we have now where people just are at concerts with their cell phones out recording the whole concert  and they're disturbing you. They're not even enjoying the show. They're watching the concert through their cell phone. I hate that. I admittedly used to be that guy a little bit  back in the day  and I've decided that the best way for me to still capture and keep a visual memory of my life and not be that person  is to just record that one second that will allow me to trigger that memory of   Yeah  that concert was amazing. I really loved that concert.  And it just takes a quick  quick second. I was on a three month road trip this summer. It was something that I've been dreaming about doing my whole life  just driving around the U.S. and Canada and just figuring out where to go the next day  and it was kind of outstanding. I actually ran out  I spent too much money on my road trip for the savings that I had to take my year off  so I had to  I went to Seattle and I spent some time with friends working on a really neat project. One of the reasons that I took my year off was to spend more time with my family  and this really tragic thing happened where my sister in law  her intestine suddenly strangled one day  and we took her to the emergency room  and she was  she was in really bad shape. We almost lost her a couple of times  and I was there with my brother every day. It helped me realize something else during this project  is that recording that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult. It's not    we tend to take our cameras out when we're doing awesome things. Or we're   Oh  yeah  this party  let me take a picture.  But we rarely do that when we're having a bad day  and something horrible is happening. And I found that it's actually been very  very important to record even just that one second of a really bad moment. It really helps you appreciate the good times. It's not always a good day  so when you have a bad one  I think it's important to remember it  just as much as it is important to remember the  good  days. Now one of the things that I do is I don't use any filters  I don't use anything to    I try to capture the moment as much as possible as the way that I saw it with my own eyes. I started a rule of first person perspective. Early on  I think I had a couple of videos where you would see me in it  but I realized that wasn't the way to go. The way to really remember what I saw was to record it as I actually saw it. Now a couple of things that I have in my head about this project are  wouldn't it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this  I turned    last week  which is there. I think it would be interesting to see what everyone did with a project like this. I think everyone would have a different interpretation of it. I think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day. Personally  I'm tired of forgetting  and this is a really easy thing to do. I mean  we all have HD capable cameras in our pockets right now    most people in this room  I bet    and it's something that's    I never want to forget another day that I've ever lived  and this is my way of doing that  and it'd be really interesting also to see  if you could just type in on a website   June            and you would just see a stream of people's lives on that particular day from all over the world. And I don't know  I think this project has a lot of possibilities  and I encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day  so you can never forget that that day  you lived. Thank you. Organic chemists make molecules  very complicated molecules  by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules and reverse engineering. And as a chemist  one of the things I wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is  could we make a really cool universal chemistry set  In essence  could we  app  chemistry  Now what would this mean  and how would we do it  Well to start to do this  we took a  D printer and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side and combine them together in what we call reactionware. And so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time  we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry. Now what could this mean  Well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine  so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill  if you have this embedded in your device at the same time  and you do the chemistry  you may be able to make drugs in a new way. So how are we doing this in the lab  Well it requires software  it requires hardware and it requires chemical inks. And so the really cool bit is  the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks that we put out with the printer  and you download the blueprint  the organic chemistry for that molecule and you make it in the device. And so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software. So what could this mean  Well  ultimately  it could mean that you could print your own medicine. And this is what we're doing in the lab at the moment. But to take baby steps to get there  first of all we want to look at drug design and production  or drug discovery and manufacturing. Because if we can manufacture it after we've discovered it  we could deploy it anywhere. You don't need to go to the chemist anymore. We can print drugs at point of need. We can download new diagnostics. Say a new super bug has emerged. You put it in your search engine  and you create the drug to treat the threat. So this allows you on the fly molecular assembly. But perhaps for me the core bit going into the future is this idea of taking your own stem cells  with your genes and your environment  and you print your own personal medicine. And if that doesn't seem fanciful enough  where do you think we're going to go  Well  you're going to have your own personal matter fabricator. Beam me up  Scotty. In my previous life  I was an artist. I still paint. I love art. I love the joy that color can give to our lives and to our communities  and I try to bring something of the artist in me in my politics  and I see part of my job today  the reason for being here  not just to campaign for my party  but for politics  and the role it can play for the better in our lives. For    years  I was mayor of Tirana  our capital. We faced many challenges. Art was part of the answer  and my name  in the very beginning  was linked with two things  demolition of illegal constructions in order to get public space back  and use of colors in order to revive the hope that had been lost in my city. But this use of colors was not just an artistic act. Rather  it was a form of political action in a context when the city budget I had available after being elected amounted to zero comma something. When we painted the first building  by splashing a radiant orange on the somber gray of a facade  something unimaginable happened. There was a traffic jam and a crowd of people gathered as if it were the location of some spectacular accident  or the sudden sighting of a visiting pop star. The French E.U. official in charge of the funding rushed to block the painting. He screeched that he would block the financing.  But why   I asked him.  Because the colors you have ordered do not meet European standards   he replied.  Well   I told him   the surroundings do not meet European standards  even though this is not what we want  but we will choose the colors ourselves  because this is exactly what we want. And if you do not let us continue with our work  I will hold a press conference here  right now  right in this road  and we will tell people that you look to me just like the censors of the socialist realism era.  Then he was kind of troubled  and asked me for a compromise. But I told him no  I'm sorry  compromise in colors is gray  and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime. So it's time for change. The rehabilitation of public spaces revived the feeling of belonging to a city that people lost. The pride of people about their own place of living  and there were feelings that had been buried deep for years under the fury of the illegal  barbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space. And when colors came out everywhere  a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people. Big noise raised up   What is this  What is happening  What are colors doing to us   And we made a poll  the most fascinating poll I've seen in my life. We asked people   Do you want this action  and to have buildings painted like that   And then the second question was   Do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue   To the first question     percent of people said yes  we like it. Thirty seven said no  we don't like it. But to the second question  half of them that didn't like it  they wanted it to continue.  Laughter  So we noticed change. People started to drop less litter in the streets  for example  started to pay taxes  started to feel something they had forgotten  and beauty was acting as a guardsman where municipal police  or the state itself  were missing. One day I remember walking along a street that had just been colored  and where we were in the process of planting trees  when I saw a shopkeeper and his wife putting a glass facade to their shop. They had thrown the old shutter in the garbage collection place.  Why did you throw away the shutters   I asked him.  Well  because the street is safer now   they answered.  Safer  Why  They have posted more policemen here    Come on  man  What policemen  You can see it for yourself. There are colors  streetlights  new pavement with no potholes  trees. So it's beautiful  it's safe.  And indeed  it was beauty that was giving people this feeling of being protected. And this was not a misplaced feeling. Crime did fall. The freedom that was won in      brought about a state of anarchy in the city  while the barbarism of the '  s brought about a loss of hope for the city. The paint on the walls did not feed children  nor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant  but it gave hope and light  and helped to make people see there could be a different way of doing things  a different spirit  a different feel to our lives  and that if we brought the same energy and hope to our politics  we could build a better life for each other and for our country. We removed         tons of concrete only from the riverbanks. We demolished more than       illegal buildings all over the city  up to eight stories high  the tallest of them. We planted        trees and bushes in the streets. We established a green tax  and then everybody accepted it and all businessmen paid it regularly. By means of open competitions  we managed to recruit in our administration many young people  and we thus managed to build a de politicized public institution where men and women were equally represented. International organizations have invested a lot in Albania during these    years  not all of it well spent. When I told the World Bank directors that I wanted them to finance a project to build a model reception hall for citizens precisely in order to fight endemic daily corruption  they did not understand me. But people were waiting in long queues under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks. They were paying in order to skip the queue  the long queue. The reply to their requests was met by a voice coming from this dark hole  and  on the other hand  a mysterious hand coming out to take their documents while searching through old documents for the bribe. We could change the invisible clerks within the kiosks  every week  but we could not change this corrupt practice.  I'm convinced   I told a German official with the World Bank   that it would be impossible for them to be bribed if they worked in Germany  in a German administration  just as I am convinced that if you put German officials from the German administration in those holes  they would be bribed just the same.  It's not about genes. It's not about some being with a high conscience and some others having not a conscience. It's about system  it's about organization. It's also about environment and respect. We removed the kiosks. We built the bright new reception hall that made people  Tirana citizens  think they had traveled abroad when they entered to make their requests. We created an online system of control and so speeded up all the processes. We put the citizen first  and not the clerks. The corruption in the state administration of countries like Albania    it's not up to me to say also like Greece    can be fought only by modernization. Reinventing the government by reinventing politics itself is the answer  and not reinventing people based on a ready made formula that the developed world often tries in vain to impose to people like us. Things have come to this point because politicians in general  but especially in our countries  let's face it  think people are stupid. They take it for granted that  come what may  people have to follow them  while politics  more and more  fails to offer answers for their public concerns or the exigencies of the common people. Politics has come to resemble a cynical team game played by politicians  while the public has been pushed aside as if sitting on the seats of a stadium in which passion for politics is gradually making room for blindness and desperation. Seen from those stairs  all politicians today seem the same  and politics has come to resemble a sport that inspires more aggressiveness and pessimism than social cohesion and the desire for civic protaganism. Barack Obama won    Applause    because he mobilized people as never before through the use of social networks. He did not know each and every one of them  but with an admirable ingenuity  he managed to transform them into activists by giving them all the possibility to hold in their hands the arguments and the instruments that each would need to campaign in his name by making his own campaign. I tweet. I love it. I love it because it lets me get the message out  but it also lets people get their messages to me. This is politics  not from top down  but from the bottom up  and sideways  and allowing everybody's voice to be heard is exactly what we need. Politics is not just about leaders. It's not just about politicians and laws. It is about how people think  how they view the world around them  how they use their time and their energy. When people say all politicians are the same  ask yourself if Obama was the same as Bush  if Fran ois Hollande is the same as Sarkozy. They are not. They are human beings with different views and different visions for the world. When people say nothing can change  just stop and think what the world was like                 years ago. Our world is defined by the pace of change. We can all change the world. I gave you a very small example of how one thing  the use of color  can make change happen. I want to make more change as Prime Minister of my country  but every single one of you can make change happen if you want to. President Roosevelt  he said   Believe you can  and you are halfway there.  Efharisto and kalinihta. When I was     I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house. My father was listening to BBC News on his small  gray radio. There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then  because the news mostly depressed him.  The Taliban are gone   my father shouted. I didn't know what it meant  but I could see that my father was very  very happy.  You can go to a real school now   he said. A morning that I will never forget. A real school. You see  I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school. So for the next five years  I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister  who was no longer allowed to be outside alone  to a secret school. It was the only way we both could be educated. Each day  we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going. We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping. The school was in a house  more than     of us packed in one small living room. It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer. We all knew we were risking our lives    the teacher  the students and our parents. From time to time  the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious. We always wondered what they knew about us. Were we being followed  Do they know where we live  We were scared  but still  school was where we wanted to be. I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured. My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time. A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan  he insisted that his daughter  my mom  go to school  and for that he was disowned by his father. But my educated mother became a teacher. There she is. She retired two years ago  only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood. And my father    that's him    he was the first ever in his family to receive an education. There was no question that his children would receive an education  including his daughters  despite the Taliban  despite the risks. To him  there was greater risk in not educating his children. During Taliban years  I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future. I would want to quit  but my father  he would say   Listen  my daughter  you can lose everything you own in your life. Your money can be stolen. You can be forced to leave your home during a war. But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here  and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees  we will. So do you still not want to continue   Today I am   . I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war. Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school  and had my family not been so committed to my education  I would be one of them. Instead  I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College. When I returned to Afghanistan  my grandfather  the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters  was among the first to congratulate me. He not only brags about my college degree  but also that I was the first woman  and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul. My family believes in me. I dream big  but my family dreams even bigger for me. That's why I am a global ambassador for   x    a global campaign to educate women. That's why I cofounded SOLA  the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan  a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school. The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity. And I see their parents and their fathers who  like my own  advocate for them  despite and even in the face of daunting opposition. Like Ahmed. That's not his real name  and I cannot show you his face  but Ahmed is the father of one of my students. Less than a month ago  he and his daughter were on their way from SOLA to their village  and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes. As he arrived home  the phone rang  a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school  they would try again.  Kill me now  if you wish   he said   but I will not ruin my daughter's future because of your old and backward ideas.  What I've come to realize about Afghanistan  and this is something that is often dismissed in the West  that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success. It's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success. In fact  they're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters  but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan  we must have the support of men. Under the Taliban  girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds    remember  it was illegal. But today  more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan. Afghanistan looks so different from here in America. I find that Americans see the fragility in changes. I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops' withdrawal. But when I am back in Afghanistan  when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them  who encourage them  I see a promising future and lasting change. To me  Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities  and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that. Like me  they are dreaming big. Thank you. You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road. It's made of asphalt  and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on  but not always  especially not on these days as today  when it's raining a lot. Then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt. And especially if you then ride with your bicycle  and pass these cars  then that's not very nice. Also  asphalt can create a lot of noise. It's a noisy material  and if we produce roads like in the Netherlands  very close to cities  then we would like a silent road. The solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt. Porous asphalt  a material that we use now in most of the highways in the Netherlands  it has pores and water can just rain through it  so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides  and you have a road that's easy to drive on  so no splash water anymore. Also the noise will disappear in these pores. Because it's very hollow  all the noise will disappear  so it's a very silent road. It also has disadvantages  of course  and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur. What is raveling  You see that in this road that the stones at the surface come off. First you get one stone  then several more  and more and more and more and more  and then they    well  I will not do that.  Laughter  But they can damage your windshield  so you're not happy with that. And finally  this raveling can also lead to more and more damage. Sometimes you can create potholes with that. Ha. He's ready. Potholes  of course  that can become a problem  but we have a solution. Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material. It's a porous asphalt  like I said  so you have only a small amount of binder between the stones. Due to weathering  due to U.V. light  due to oxidation  this binder  this bitumen  the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink  and if it shrinks  it gets micro cracks  and it delaminates from the aggregates. Then if you drive over the road  you take out the aggregates    what we just saw here. To solve this problem  we thought of self healing materials. If we can make this material self healing  then probably we have a solution. So what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans  and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces  and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen. So then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it. Then you need a machine  like you see here  that you can use for cooking    an induction machine. Induction can heat  especially steel  it's very good at that. Then what you do is you heat up the steel  you melt the bitumen  and the bitumen will flow into these micro cracks  and the stones are again fixed to the surface. Today I use a microwave because I cannot take the big induction machine here onstage. So a microwave is a similar system. So I put the specimen in  which I'm now going to take out to see what happened. So this is the specimen coming out now. So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the specimens. We tested a lot of specimens there  and then the government  they actually saw our results  and they thought   Well  that's very interesting. We have to try that.  So they donated to us a piece of highway      meters of the A    where we had to make a test track to test this material. So that's what we did here. You see where we were making the test road  and then of course this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know from practice. So we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab. So we did aging on the samples  did a lot of loading on it  healed them with our induction machine  and healed them and tested them again. Several times we can repeat that. So actually  the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine    this is the big version we have made to go on the real road    if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road  which of course saves a lot of money. Well  to conclude  I can say that we made a material using steel fibers  the addition of steel fibers  using induction energy to really increase the surface life of the road  double the surface life you can even do  so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks. And now you're of course curious if it also worked. So we still have the specimen here. It's quite warm. Actually  it still has to cool down first before I can show you that the healing works. But I will do a trial. Let's see. Yeah  it worked. Thank you.  When the crisis came  the serious limitations of existing economic and financial models immediately became apparent.   There is also a strong belief  which I share  that bad or oversimplistic and overconfident economics helped create the crisis.  Now  you've probably all heard of similar criticism coming from people who are skeptical of capitalism. But this is different. This is coming from the heart of finance. The first quote is from Jean Claude Trichet when he was governor of the European Central Bank. The second quote is from the head of the U.K. Financial Services Authority. Are these people implying that we don't understand the economic systems that drive our modern societies  It gets worse.  We spend billions of dollars trying to understand the origins of the universe while we still don't understand the conditions for a stable society  a functioning economy  or peace.  What's happening here  How can this be possible  Do we really understand more about the fabric of reality than we do about the fabric which emerges from our human interactions  Unfortunately  the answer is yes. But there's an intriguing solution which is coming from what is known as the science of complexity. To explain what this means and what this thing is  please let me quickly take a couple of steps back. I ended up in physics by accident. It was a random encounter when I was young  and since then  I've often wondered about the amazing success of physics in describing the reality we wake up in every day. In a nutshell  you can think of physics as follows. So you take a chunk of reality you want to understand and you translate it into mathematics. You encode it into equations. Then predictions can be made and tested. We're actually really lucky that this works  because no one really knows why the thoughts in our heads should actually relate to the fundamental workings of the universe. Despite the success  physics has its limits. As Dirk Helbing pointed out in the last quote  we don't really understand the complexity that relates to us  that surrounds us. This paradox is what got me interested in complex systems. So these are systems which are made up of many interconnected or interacting parts  swarms of birds or fish  ant colonies  ecosystems  brains  financial markets. These are just a few examples. Interestingly  complex systems are very hard to map into mathematical equations  so the usual physics approach doesn't really work here. So what do we know about complex systems  Well  it turns out that what looks like complex behavior from the outside is actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction. This means you can forget about the equations and just start to understand the system by looking at the interactions  so you can actually forget about the equations and you just start to look at the interactions. And it gets even better  because most complex systems have this amazing property called emergence. So this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior which cannot be understood or predicted by looking at the components of the system. So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts. And all of this also means that you can forget about the individual parts of the system  how complex they are. So if it's a cell or a termite or a bird  you just focus on the rules of interaction. As a result  networks are ideal representations of complex systems. The nodes in the network are the system's components and the links are given by the interactions. So what equations are for physics  complex networks are for the study of complex systems. This approach has been very successfully applied to many complex systems in physics  biology  computer science  the social sciences  but what about economics  Where are economic networks  This is a surprising and prominent gap in the literature. The study we published last year called  The Network of Global Corporate Control  was the first extensive analysis of economic networks. The study went viral on the Internet and it attracted a lot of attention from the international media. This is quite remarkable  because  again  why did no one look at this before  Similar data has been around for quite some time. What we looked at in detail was ownership networks. So here the nodes are companies  people  governments  foundations  etc. And the links represent the shareholding relations  so Shareholder A has x percent of the shares in Company B. And we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue. So ownership networks reveal the patterns of shareholding relations. In this little example  you can see a few financial institutions with some of the many links highlighted. Now you may think that no one's looked at this before because ownership networks are really  really boring to study. Well  as ownership is related to control  as I shall explain later  looking at ownership networks actually can give you answers to questions like  who are the key players  How are they organized  Are they isolated  Are they interconnected  And what is the overall distribution of control  In other words  who controls the world  I think this is an interesting question. And it has implications for systemic risk. This is a measure of how vulnerable a system is overall. A high degree of interconnectivity can be bad for stability  because then the stress can spread through the system like an epidemic. Scientists have sometimes criticized economists who believe ideas and concepts are more important than empirical data  because a foundational guideline in science is  Let the data speak. Okay. Let's do that. So we started with a database containing    million ownership relations from     . This is a lot of data  and because we wanted to find out who rules the world  we decided to focus on transnational corporations  or TNCs for short. These are companies that operate in more than one country  and we found       . In the next step  we built the network around these companies  so we took all the TNCs' shareholders  and the shareholders' shareholders  etc.  all the way upstream  and we did the same downstream  and ended up with a network containing         nodes and one million links. This is the TNC network which we analyzed. And it turns out to be structured as follows. So you have a periphery and a center which contains about    percent of all the players  and in the center there's this tiny but dominant core which is made up of highly interconnected companies. To give you a better picture  think about a metropolitan area. So you have the suburbs and the periphery  you have a center like a financial district  then the core will be something like the tallest high rise building in the center. And we already see signs of organization going on here. Thirty six percent of the TNCs are in the core only  but they make up    percent of the total operating revenue of all TNCs. Okay  so now we analyzed the structure  so how does this relate to the control  Well  ownership gives voting rights to shareholders. This is the normal notion of control. And there are different models which allow you to compute the control you get from ownership. If you have more than    percent of the shares in a company  you get control  but usually it depends on the relative distribution of shares. And the network really matters. About    years ago  Mr. Tronchetti Provera had ownership and control in a small company  which had ownership and control in a bigger company. You get the idea. This ended up giving him control in Telecom Italia with a leverage of   . So this means that  with each euro he invested  he was able to move    euros of market value through the chain of ownership relations. Now what we actually computed in our study was the control over the TNCs' value. This allowed us to assign a degree of influence to each shareholder. This is very much in the sense of Max Weber's idea of potential power  which is the probability of imposing one's own will despite the opposition of others. If you want to compute the flow in an ownership network  this is what you have to do. It's actually not that hard to understand. Let me explain by giving you this analogy. So think about water flowing in pipes where the pipes have different thickness. So similarly  the control is flowing in the ownership networks and is accumulating at the nodes. So what did we find after computing all this network control  Well  it turns out that the     top shareholders have the potential to collectively control    percent of the TNCs' value. Now remember  we started out with         nodes  so these     top players make up a bit more than  .  percent. They're mostly financial institutions in the U.S. and the U.K. And it gets even more extreme. There are     top players in the core  and they together have the potential to collectively control    percent of the TNCs' value. What should you take home from all of this  Well  the high degree of control you saw is very extreme by any standard. The high degree of interconnectivity of the top players in the core could pose a significant systemic risk to the global economy and we could easily reproduce the TNC network with a few simple rules. This means that its structure is probably the result of self organization. It's an emergent property which depends on the rules of interaction in the system  so it's probably not the result of a top down approach like a global conspiracy. Our study  is an impression of the moon's surface. It's not a street map.  So you should take the exact numbers in our study with a grain of salt  yet it  gave us a tantalizing glimpse of a brave new world of finance.  We hope to have opened the door for more such research in this direction  so the remaining unknown terrain will be charted in the future. And this is slowly starting. We're seeing the emergence of long term and highly funded programs which aim at understanding our networked world from a complexity point of view. But this journey has only just begun  so we will have to wait before we see the first results. Now there is still a big problem  in my opinion. Ideas relating to finance  economics  politics  society  are very often tainted by people's personal ideologies. I really hope that this complexity perspective allows for some common ground to be found. It would be really great if it has the power to help end the gridlock created by conflicting ideas  which appears to be paralyzing our globalized world. Reality is so complex  we need to move away from dogma. But this is just my own personal ideology. Thank you. So  why does good sex so often fade  even for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever  And why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex  contrary to popular belief  Or  the next question would be  can we want what we already have  That's the million dollar question  right  And why is the forbidden so erotic  What is it about transgression that makes desire so potent  And why does sex make babies  and babies spell erotic disaster in couples  It's kind of the fatal erotic blow  isn't it  And when you love  how does it feel  And when you desire  how is it different  These are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire and its concomitant dilemmas in modern love. So I travel the globe  and what I'm noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered  there seems to be a crisis of desire. A crisis of desire  as in owning the wanting    desire as an expression of our individuality  of our free choice  of our preferences  of our identity    desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies. You know  this is the first time in the history of humankind where we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term not because we want    children  for which we need to have even more because many of them won't make it  and not because it is exclusively a woman's marital duty. This is the first time that we want sex over time about pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire. So what sustains desire  and why is it so difficult  And at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship  I think  is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs. On the one hand  our need for security  for predictability  for safety  for dependability  for reliability  for permanence. All these anchoring  grounding experiences of our lives that we call home. But we also have an equally strong need    men and women    for adventure  for novelty  for mystery  for risk  for danger  for the unknown  for the unexpected  surprise    you get the gist. For journey  for travel. So reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship  or what we today like to call a passionate marriage  used to be a contradiction in terms. Marriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship. But now we want our partner to still give us all these things  but in addition I want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot  and we live twice as long. So we come to one person  and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide. Give me belonging  give me identity  give me continuity  but give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one. Give me comfort  give me edge. Give me novelty  give me familiarity. Give me predictability  give me surprise. And we think it's a given  and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that. So now we get to the existential reality of the story  right  Because I think  in some way    and I'll come back to that    but the crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination. So why does good sex so often fade  What is the relationship between love and desire  How do they relate  and how do they conflict  Because therein lies the mystery of eroticism. So if there is a verb  for me  that comes with love  it's  to have.  And if there is a verb that comes with desire  it is  to want.  In love  we want to have  we want to know the beloved. We want to minimize the distance. We want to contract that gap. We want to neutralize the tensions. We want closeness. But in desire  we tend to not really want to go back to the places we've already gone. Forgone conclusion does not keep our interest. In desire  we want an Other  somebody on the other side that we can go visit  that we can go spend some time with  that we can go see what goes on in their red light district. You know  In desire  we want a bridge to cross. Or in other words  I sometimes say  fire needs air. Desire needs space. And when it's said like that  it's often quite abstract. But then I took a question with me. And I've gone to more than    countries in the last few years with  Mating in Captivity   and I asked people  when do you find yourself most drawn to your partner  Not attracted sexually  per Se  but most drawn. And across culture  across religion  and across gender    except for one    there are a few answers that just keep coming back. So the first group is  I am most drawn to my partner when she is away  when we are apart  when we reunite. Basically  when I get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner  when my imagination comes back in the picture  and when I can root it in absence and in longing  which is a major component of desire. But then the second group is even more interesting. I am most drawn to my partner when I see him in the studio  when she is onstage  when he is in his element  when she's doing something she's passionate about  when I see him at a party and other people are really drawn to him  when I see her hold court. Basically  when I look at my partner radiant and confident. Probably the biggest turn on across the board. Radiant  as in self sustaining. I look at this person    by the way  in desire people rarely talk about it  when we are blended into one  five centimeters from each other. I don't know in inches how much that is. But it's also not when the other person is that far apart that you no longer see them. It's when I'm looking at my partner from a comfortable distance  where this person that is already so familiar  so known  is momentarily once again somewhat mysterious  somewhat elusive. And in this space between me and the other lies the erotic  lan  lies that movement toward the other. Because sometimes  as Proust says  mystery is not about traveling to new places  but it's about looking with new eyes. And so  when I see my partner on his own or her own  doing something in which they are enveloped  I look at this person and I momentarily get a shift in perception  and I stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me. And then  more importantly  in this description about the other or myself    it's the same    what is most interesting is that there is no neediness in desire. Nobody needs anybody. There is no caretaking in desire. Caretaking is mightily loving. It's a powerful anti aphrodisiac. I have yet to see somebody who is so turned on by somebody who needs them. Wanting them is one thing. Needing them is a shot down and women have known that forever  because anything that will bring up parenthood will usually decrease the erotic charge. For good reasons  right  And then the third group of answers usually would be  when I'm surprised  when we laugh together  as somebody said to me in the office today  when he's in his tux  so I said  you know  it's either the tux or the cowboy boots. But basically it's when there is novelty. But novelty isn't about new positions. It isn't a repertoire of techniques. Novelty is  what parts of you do you bring out  What parts of you are just being seen  Because in some way one could say sex isn't something you do  eh  Sex is a place you go. It's a space you enter inside yourself and with another  or others. So where do you go in sex  What parts of you do you connect to  What do you seek to express there  Is it a place for transcendence and spiritual union  Is it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive  Is it a place where you can finally surrender and not have to take responsibility for everything  Is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes  What comes out there  It's a language. It isn't just a behavior. And it's the poetic of that language that I'm interested in  which is why I began to explore this concept of erotic intelligence. You know  animals have sex. It's the pivot  it's biology  it's the natural instinct. We are the only ones who have an erotic life  which means that it's sexuality transformed by the human imagination. We are the only ones who can make love for hours  have a blissful time  multiple orgasms  and touch nobody  just because we can imagine it. We can hint at it. We don't even have to do it. We can experience that powerful thing called anticipation  which is a mortar to desire. The ability to imagine it  as if it's happening  to experience it as if it's happening  while nothing is happening and everything is happening  at the same time. So when I began to think about eroticism  I began to think about the poetics of sex. And if I look at it as an intelligence  then it's something that you cultivate. What are the ingredients  Imagination  playfulness  novelty  curiosity  mystery. But the central agent is really that piece called the imagination. But more importantly  for me to begin to understand who are the couples who have an erotic spark  what sustains desire  I had to go back to the original definition of eroticism  the mystical definition  and I went through it through a bifurcation by looking  actually  at trauma  which is the other side. And I looked at it  looking at the community that I had grown up in  which was a community in Belgium  all Holocaust survivors  and in my community  there were two groups  those who didn't die  and those who came back to life. And those who didn't die lived often very tethered to the ground  could not experience pleasure  could not trust  because when you're vigilant  worried  anxious  and insecure  you can't lift your head to go and take off in space and be playful and safe and imaginative. Those who came back to life were those who understood the erotic as an antidote to death. They knew how to keep themselves alive. And when I began to listen to the sexlessness of the couples that I work with  I sometimes would hear people say   I want more sex   but generally  people want better sex  and better is to reconnect with that quality of aliveness  of vibrancy  of renewal  of vitality  of Eros  of energy that sex used to afford them  or that they've hoped it would afford them. And so I began to ask a different question.  I shut myself off when ...  began to be the question.  I turn off my desires when ...  Which is not the same question as   What turns me off is ...  and  You turn me off when ...  And people began to say   I turn myself off when I feel dead inside  when I don't like my body  when I feel old  when I haven't had time for myself  when I haven't had a chance to even check in with you  when I don't perform well at work  when I feel low self esteem  when I don't have a sense of self worth  when I don't feel like I have a right to want  to take  to receive pleasure.  And then I began to ask the reverse question.  I turn myself on when ...  Because most of the time  people like to ask the question   You turn me on  what turns me on   and I'm out of the question  you know  Now  if you are dead inside  the other person can do a lot of things for Valentine's. It won't make a dent. There is nobody at the reception desk. So I turn myself on when  I turn on my desires  I wake up when ... Now  in this paradox between love and desire  what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients that nurture love    mutuality  reciprocity  protection  worry  responsibility for the other    are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire. Because desire comes with a host of feelings that are not always such favorites of love  jealousy  possessiveness  aggression  power  dominance  naughtiness  mischief. Basically most of us will get turned on at night by the very same things that we will demonstrate against during the day. You know  the erotic mind is not very politically correct. If everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses  we wouldn't be having such interesting talks about this. But no  in our mind up there are a host of things going on that we don't always know how to bring to the person that we love  because we think love comes with selflessness and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word  the ability to stay connected to one's self in the presence of another. So I want to draw that little image for you  because this need to reconcile these two sets of needs  we are born with that. Our need for connection  our need for separateness  or our need for security and adventure  or our need for togetherness and for autonomy  and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable  and at some point all of us need to go out into the world to discover and to explore. That's the beginning of desire  that exploratory need  curiosity  discovery. And then at some point they turn around and they look at you. And if you tell them   Hey kiddo  the world's a great place. Go for it. There's so much fun out there   then they can turn away and they can experience connection and separateness at the same time. They can go off in their imagination  off in their body  off in their playfulness  all the while knowing that there's somebody when they come back. But if on this side there is somebody who says   I'm worried. I'm anxious. I'm depressed. My partner hasn't taken care of me in so long. What's so good out there  Don't we have everything you need together  you and I   then there are a few little reactions that all of us can pretty much recognize. Some of us will come back  came back a long time ago  and that little child who comes back is the child who will forgo a part of himself in order not to lose the other. I will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection. And I will learn to love in a certain way that will become burdened with extra worry and extra responsibility and extra protection  and I won't know how to leave you in order to go play  in order to go experience pleasure  in order to discover  to enter inside myself. Translate this into adult language. It starts very young. It continues into our sex lives up to the end. Child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time.  Are you going to be there  Are you going to curse me  scold me  Are you going to be angry with me   And they may be gone  but they're never really away. And those are often the people that will tell you   In the beginning  it was super hot.  Because in the beginning  the growing intimacy wasn't yet so strong that it actually led to the decrease of desire. The more connected I became  the more responsible I felt  the less I was able to let go in your presence. The third child doesn't really come back. So what happens  if you want to sustain desire  it's that real dialectic piece. On the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go. On the other hand if you can't go  you can't have pleasure  you can't culminate  you don't have an orgasm  you don't get excited because you spend your time in the body and the head of the other and not in your own. So in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs  there are a few things that I've come to understand erotic couples do. One  they have a lot of sexual privacy. They understand that there is an erotic space that belongs to each of them. They also understand that foreplay is not something you do five minutes before the real thing. Foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm. They also understand that an erotic space isn't about  you begin to stroke the other. It's about you create a space where you leave Management Inc.  maybe where you leave the Agile program    And you actually just enter that place where you stop being the good citizen who is taking care of things and being responsible. Responsibility and desire just butt heads. They don't really do well together. Erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes. It's pretty much like the moon. It has intermittent eclipses. But what they know is they know how to resurrect it. They know how to bring it back. And they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth  which is the myth of spontaneity  which is that it's just going to fall from heaven while you're folding the laundry like a deus ex machina  and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long term relationship  already has. Committed sex is premeditated sex. It's willful. It's intentional. It's focus and presence. Merry Valentine's. The theme of my talk today is   Be an artist  right now.  Most people  when this subject is brought up  get tense and resist it   Art doesn't feed me  and right now I'm busy. I have to go to school  get a job  send my kids to lessons ...   You think   I'm too busy. I don't have time for art.  There are hundreds of reasons why we can't be artists right now. Don't they just pop into your head  There are so many reasons why we can't be  indeed  we're not sure why we should be. We don't know why we should be artists  but we have many reasons why we can't be. Why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art  Perhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted or for the thoroughly and professionally trained. And some of you may think you've strayed too far from art. Well you might have  but I don't think so. This is the theme of my talk today. We are all born artists. If you have kids  you know what I mean. Almost everything kids do is art. They draw with crayons on the wall. They dance to Son Dam Bi's dance on TV  but you can't even call it Son Dam Bi's dance    it becomes the kids' own dance. So they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone. Perhaps their art is something only their parents can bear  and because they practice such art all day long  people honestly get a little tired around kids. Kids will sometimes perform monodramas    playing house is indeed a monodrama or a play. And some kids  when they get a bit older  start to lie. Usually parents remember the very first time their kid lies. They're shocked.  Now you're showing your true colors   Mom says. She thinks   Why does he take after his dad   She questions him   What kind of a person are you going to be   But you shouldn't worry. The moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins. They are talking about things they didn't see. It's amazing. It's a wonderful moment. Parents should celebrate.  Hurray  My boy finally started to lie   All right  It calls for celebration. For example  a kid says   Mom  guess what  I met an alien on my way home.  Then a typical mom responds   Stop that nonsense.  Now  an ideal parent is someone who responds like this   Really  An alien  huh  What did it look like  Did it say anything  Where did you meet it    Um  in front of the supermarket.  When you have a conversation like this  the kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started. Soon  a story develops. Of course this is an infantile story  but thinking up one sentence after the next is the same thing a professional writer like me does. In essence  they are not different. Roland Barthes once said of Flaubert's novels   Flaubert did not write a novel. He merely connected one sentence after another. The eros between sentences  that is the essence of Flaubert's novel.  That's right    a novel  basically  is writing one sentence  then  without violating the scope of the first one  writing the next sentence. And you continue to make connections. Take a look at this sentence   One morning  as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams  he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug.  Yes  it's the first sentence of Franz Kafka's  The Metamorphosis.  Writing such an unjustifiable sentence and continuing in order to justify it  Kafka's work became the masterpiece of contemporary literature. Kafka did not show his work to his father. He was not on good terms with his father. On his own  he wrote these sentences. Had he shown his father   My boy has finally lost it   he would've thought. And that's right. Art is about going a little nuts and justifying the next sentence  which is not much different from what a kid does. A kid who has just started to lie is taking the first step as a storyteller. Kids do art. They don't get tired and they have fun doing it. I was in Jeju Island a few days ago. When kids are on the beach  most of them love playing in the water. But some of them spend a lot of time in the sand  making mountains and seas    well  not seas  but different things    people and dogs  etc. But parents tell them   It will all be washed away by the waves.  In other words  it's useless. There's no need. But kids don't mind. They have fun in the moment and they keep playing in the sand. Kids don't do it because someone told them to. They aren't told by their boss or anyone  they just do it. When you were little  I bet you spent time enjoying the pleasure of primitive art. When I ask my students to write about their happiest moment  many write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid. Learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend  or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots    things like that. Or the moment you developed the first film you shot with an old camera. They talk about these kinds of experiences. You must have had such a moment. In that moment  art makes you happy because it's not work. Work doesn't make you happy  does it  Mostly it's tough. The French writer Michel Tournier has a famous saying. It's a bit mischievous  actually.  Work is against human nature. The proof is that it makes us tired.  Right  Why would work tire us if it's in our nature  Playing doesn't tire us. We can play all night long. If we work overnight  we should be paid for overtime. Why  Because it's tiring and we feel fatigue. But kids  usually they do art for fun. It's playing. They don't draw to sell the work to a client or play the piano to earn money for the family. Of course  there were kids who had to. You know this gentleman  right  He had to tour around Europe to support his family    Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart    but that was centuries ago  so we can make him an exception. Unfortunately  at some point our art    such a joyful pastime    ends. Kids have to go to lessons  to school  do homework and of course they take piano or ballet lessons  but they aren't fun anymore. You're told to do it and there's competition. How can it be fun  If you're in elementary school and you still draw on the wall  you'll surely get in trouble with your mom. Besides  if you continue to act like an artist as you get older  you'll increasingly feel pressure    people will question your actions and ask you to act properly. Here's my story  I was an eighth grader and I entered a drawing contest at school in Gyeongbokgung. I was trying my best  and my teacher came around and asked me   What are you doing    I'm drawing diligently   I said.  Why are you using only black   Indeed  I was eagerly coloring the sketchbook in black. And I explained   It's a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch.  Then my teacher said   Really  Well  Young ha  you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling.  Or so I wished.  Now you'll get it  you rascal   was the response.  Laughter   You'll get it   he said. You were supposed to draw the palace  the Gyeonghoeru  etc.  but I was coloring everything in black  so he dragged me out of the group. There were a lot of girls there as well  so I was utterly mortified. None of my explanations or excuses were heard  and I really got it big time. If he was an ideal teacher  he would have responded like I said before   Young ha may not have a talent for drawing  but he has a gift for making up stories   and he would have encouraged me. But such a teacher is seldom found. Later  I grew up and went to Europe's galleries    I was a university student    and I thought this was really unfair. Look what I found.  Laughter  Works like this were hung in Basel while I was punished and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth. Look at this. Doesn't it look just like wallpaper  Contemporary art  I later discovered  isn't explained by a lame story like mine. No crows are brought up. Most of the works have no title  Untitled. Anyways  contemporary art in the   th century is about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation    essentially the same as I did. Of course  my work was very amateur  but let's turn to more famous examples. This is Picasso's. He stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it  Bull's Head.  Sounds convincing  right  Next  a urinal was placed on its side and called  Fountain . That was Duchamp. So filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories    that's indeed what contemporary art is all about. Picasso even made the statement   I draw not what I see but what I think.  Yes  it means I didn't have to draw Gyeonghoeru. I wish I knew what Picasso said back then. I could have argued better with my teacher. Unfortunately  the little artists within us are choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art. They get locked in. That's our tragedy. So what happens when little artists get locked in  banished or even killed  Our artistic desire doesn't go away. We want to express  to reveal ourselves  but with the artist dead  the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form. In karaoke bars  there are always people who sing  She's Gone  or  Hotel California   miming the guitar riffs. Usually they sound awful. Awful indeed. Some people turn into rockers like this. Or some people dance in clubs. People who would have enjoyed telling stories end up trolling on the Internet all night long. That's how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side. Sometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids playing with Legos or putting together plastic robots. They go   Don't touch it. Daddy will do it for you.  The kid has already lost interest and is doing something else  but the dad alone builds castles. This shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed  not gone. But they can often reveal themselves negatively  in the form of jealousy. You know the song  I would love to be on TV   Why would we love it  TV is full of people who do what we wished to do  but never got to. They dance  they act    and the more they do  they are praised. So we start to envy them. We become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on TV.  He just can't act.   You call that singing  She can't hit the notes.  We easily say these sorts of things. We get jealous  not because we're evil  but because we have little artists pent up inside us. That's what I think. What should we do then  Yes  that's right. Right now  we need to start our own art. Right this minute  we can turn off TV  log off the Internet  get up and start to do something. Where I teach students in drama school  there's a course called Dramatics. In this course  all students must put on a play. However  acting majors are not supposed to act. They can write the play  for example  and the writers may work on stage art. Likewise  stage art majors may become actors  and in this way you put on a show. Students at first wonder whether they can actually do it  but later they have so much fun. I rarely see anyone who is miserable doing a play. In school  the military or even in a mental institution  once you make people do it  they enjoy it. I saw this happen in the army    many people had fun doing plays. I have another experience  In my writing class  I give students a special assignment. I have students like you in the class    many who don't major in writing. Some major in art or music and think they can't write. So I give them blank sheets of paper and a theme. It can be a simple theme  Write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood. There's one condition  You must write like crazy. Like crazy  I walk around and encourage them   Come on  come on   They have to write like crazy for an hour or two. They only get to think for the first five minutes. The reason I make them write like crazy is because when you write slowly and lots of thoughts cross your mind  the artistic devil creeps in. This devil will tell you hundreds of reasons why you can't write   People will laugh at you. This is not good writing  What kind of sentence is this  Look at your handwriting   It will say a lot of things. You have to run fast so the devil can't catch up. The really good writing I've seen in my class was not from the assignments with a long deadline  but from the     to    minute crazy writing students did in front of me with a pencil. The students go into a kind of trance. After    or    minutes  they write without knowing what they're writing. And in this moment  the nagging devil disappears. So I can say this  It's not the hundreds of reasons why one can't be an artist  but rather  the one reason one must be that makes us artists. Why we cannot be something is not important. Most artists became artists because of the one reason. When we put the devil in our heart to sleep and start our own art  enemies appear on the outside. Mostly  they have the faces of our parents.  Laughter  Sometimes they look like our spouses  but they are not your parents or spouses. They are devils. Devils. They came to Earth briefly transformed to stop you from being artistic  from becoming artists. And they have a magic question. When we say   I think I'll try acting. There's a drama school in the community center   or  I'd like to learn Italian songs   they ask   Oh  yeah  A play  What for   The magic question is   What for   But art is not for anything. Art is the ultimate goal. It saves our souls and makes us live happily. It helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs. So in response to such a pragmatic question  we need to be bold.  Well  just for the fun of it. Sorry for having fun without you   is what you should say.  I'll just go ahead and do it anyway.  The ideal future I imagine is where we all have multiple identities  at least one of which is an artist. Once I was in New York and got in a cab. I took the backseat  and in front of me I saw something related to a play. So I asked the driver   What is this   He said it was his profile.  Then what are you   I asked.  An actor   he said. He was a cabby and an actor. I asked   What roles do you usually play   He proudly said he played King Lear. King Lear.  Who is it that can tell me who I am      a great line from King Lear. That's the world I dream of. Someone is a golfer by day and writer by night. Or a cabby and an actor  a banker and a painter  secretly or publicly performing their own arts. In       Martha Graham  the legend of modern dance  came to Korea. The great artist  then in her   s  arrived at Gimpo Airport and a reporter asked her a typical question   What do you have to do to become a great dancer  Any advice for aspiring Korean dancers   Now  she was the master. This photo was taken in      and she was already a celebrated artist. In       she was asked this question. And here's what she answered   Just do it.  Wow. I was touched. Only those three words and she left the airport. That's it. So what should we do now  Let's be artists  right now. Right away. How  Just do it  Thank you. The kind of neuroscience that I do and my colleagues do is almost like the weatherman. We are always chasing storms. We want to see and measure storms    brainstorms  that is. And we all talk about brainstorms in our daily lives  but we rarely see or listen to one. So I always like to start these talks by actually introducing you to one of them. Actually  the first time we recorded more than one neuron    a hundred brain cells simultaneously    we could measure the electrical sparks of a hundred cells in the same animal  this is the first image we got  the first    seconds of this recording. So we got a little snippet of a thought  and we could see it in front of us. I always tell the students that we could also call neuroscientists some sort of astronomer  because we are dealing with a system that is only comparable in terms of number of cells to the number of galaxies that we have in the universe. And here we are  out of billions of neurons  just recording     years ago  a hundred. We are doing a thousand now. And we hope to understand something fundamental about our human nature. Because  if you don't know yet  everything that we use to define what human nature is comes from these storms  comes from these storms that roll over the hills and valleys of our brains and define our memories  our beliefs  our feelings  our plans for the future. Everything that we ever do  everything that every human has ever done  do or will do  requires the toil of populations of neurons producing these kinds of storms. And the sound of a brainstorm  if you've never heard one  is somewhat like this. You can put it louder if you can. My son calls this  making popcorn while listening to a badly tuned A.M. station.  This is a brain. This is what happens when you route these electrical storms to a loudspeaker and you listen to a hundred brain cells firing  your brain will sound like this    my brain  any brain. And what we want to do as neuroscientists in this time is to actually listen to these symphonies  these brain symphonies  and try to extract from them the messages they carry. In particular  about    years ago we created a preparation that we named brain machine interfaces. And you have a scheme here that describes how it works. The idea is  let's have some sensors that listen to these storms  this electrical firing  and see if you can  in the same time that it takes for this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal    about half a second    let's see if we can read these signals  extract the motor messages that are embedded in it  translate it into digital commands and send it to an artificial device that will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain in real time. And see if we can measure how well we can translate that message when we compare to the way the body does that. And if we can actually provide feedback  sensory signals that go back from this robotic  mechanical  computational actuator that is now under the control of the brain  back to the brain  how the brain deals with that  of receiving messages from an artificial piece of machinery. And that's exactly what we did    years ago. We started with a superstar monkey called Aurora that became one of the superstars of this field. And Aurora liked to play video games. As you can see here  she likes to use a joystick  like any one of us  any of our kids  to play this game. And as a good primate  she even tries to cheat before she gets the right answer. So even before a target appears that she's supposed to cross with the cursor that she's controlling with this joystick  Aurora is trying to find the target  no matter where it is. And if she's doing that  because every time she crosses that target with the little cursor  she gets a drop of Brazilian orange juice. And I can tell you  any monkey will do anything for you if you get a little drop of Brazilian orange juice. Actually any primate will do that. Think about that. Well  while Aurora was playing this game  as you saw  and doing a thousand trials a day and getting    percent correct and     milliliters of orange juice  we are recording the brainstorms that are produced in her head and sending them to a robotic arm that was learning to reproduce the movements that Aurora was making. Because the idea was to actually turn on this brain machine interface and have Aurora play the game just by thinking  without interference of her body. Her brainstorms would control an arm that would move the cursor and cross the target. And to our shock  that's exactly what Aurora did. She played the game without moving her body. So every trajectory that you see of the cursor now  this is the exact first moment she got that. That's the exact first moment a brain intention was liberated from the physical domains of a body of a primate and could act outside  in that outside world  just by controlling an artificial device. And Aurora kept playing the game  kept finding the little target and getting the orange juice that she wanted to get  that she craved for. Well  she did that because she  at that time  had acquired a new arm. The robotic arm that you see moving here    days later  after the first video that I showed to you  is under the control of Aurora's brain and is moving the cursor to get to the target. And Aurora now knows that she can play the game with this robotic arm  but she has not lost the ability to use her biological arms to do what she pleases. She can scratch her back  she can scratch one of us  she can play another game. By all purposes and means  Aurora's brain has incorporated that artificial device as an extension of her body. The model of the self that Aurora had in her mind has been expanded to get one more arm. Well  we did that    years ago. Just fast forward    years. Just last year we realized that you don't even need to have a robotic device. You can just build a computational body  an avatar  a monkey avatar. And you can actually use it for our monkeys to either interact with them  or you can train them to assume in a virtual world the first person perspective of that avatar and use her brain activity to control the movements of the avatar's arms or legs. And what we did basically was to train the animals to learn how to control these avatars and explore objects that appear in the virtual world. And these objects are visually identical  but when the avatar crosses the surface of these objects  they send an electrical message that is proportional to the microtactile texture of the object that goes back directly to the monkey's brain  informing the brain what it is the avatar is touching. And in just four weeks  the brain learns to process this new sensation and acquires a new sensory pathway    like a new sense. And you truly liberate the brain now because you are allowing the brain to send motor commands to move this avatar. And the feedback that comes from the avatar is being processed directly by the brain without the interference of the skin. So what you see here is this is the design of the task. You're going to see an animal basically touching these three targets. And he has to select one because only one carries the reward  the orange juice that they want to get. And he has to select it by touch using a virtual arm  an arm that doesn't exist. And that's exactly what they do. This is a complete liberation of the brain from the physical constraints of the body and the motor in a perceptual task. The animal is controlling the avatar to touch the targets. And he's sensing the texture by receiving an electrical message directly in the brain. And the brain is deciding what is the texture associated with the reward. The legends that you see in the movie don't appear for the monkey. And by the way  they don't read English anyway  so they are here just for you to know that the correct target is shifting position. And yet  they can find them by tactile discrimination  and they can press it and select it. So when we look at the brains of these animals  on the top panel you see the alignment of     cells showing what happens with the brain activity  the electrical storms  of this sample of neurons in the brain when the animal is using a joystick. And that's a picture that every neurophysiologist knows. The basic alignment shows that these cells are coding for all possible directions. The bottom picture is what happens when the body stops moving and the animal starts controlling either a robotic device or a computational avatar. As fast as we can reset our computers  the brain activity shifts to start representing this new tool  as if this too was a part of that primate's body. The brain is assimilating that too  as fast as we can measure. So that suggests to us that our sense of self does not end at the last layer of the epithelium of our bodies  but it ends at the last layer of electrons of the tools that we're commanding with our brains. Our violins  our cars  our bicycles  our soccer balls  our clothing    they all become assimilated by this voracious  amazing  dynamic system called the brain. How far can we take it  Well  in an experiment that we ran a few years ago  we took this to the limit. We had an animal running on a treadmill at Duke University on the East Coast of the United States  producing the brainstorms necessary to move. And we had a robotic device  a humanoid robot  in Kyoto  Japan at ATR Laboratories that was dreaming its entire life to be controlled by a brain  a human brain  or a primate brain. What happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the monkey was transmitted to Japan and made this robot walk while footage of this walking was sent back to Duke  so that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her. So she could be rewarded  not by what her body was doing but for every correct step of the robot on the other side of the planet controlled by her brain activity. Funny thing  that round trip around the globe took    milliseconds less than it takes for that brainstorm to leave its head  the head of the monkey  and reach its own muscle. The monkey was moving a robot that was six times bigger  across the planet. This is one of the experiments in which that robot was able to walk autonomously. This is CB  fulfilling its dream in Japan under the control of the brain activity of a primate. So where are we taking all this  What are we going to do with all this research  besides studying the properties of this dynamic universe that we have between our ears  Well the idea is to take all this knowledge and technology and try to restore one of the most severe neurological problems that we have in the world. Millions of people have lost the ability to translate these brainstorms into action  into movement. Although their brains continue to produce those storms and code for movements  they cannot cross a barrier that was created by a lesion on the spinal cord. So our idea is to create a bypass  is to use these brain machine interfaces to read these signals  larger scale brainstorms that contain the desire to move again  bypass the lesion using computational microengineering and send it to a new body  a whole body called an exoskeleton  a whole robotic suit that will become the new body of these patients. And you can see an image produced by this consortium. This is a nonprofit consortium called the Walk Again Project that is putting together scientists from Europe  from here in the United States  and in Brazil together to work to actually get this new body built    a body that we believe  through the same plastic mechanisms that allow Aurora and other monkeys to use these tools through a brain machine interface and that allows us to incorporate the tools that we produce and use in our daily life. This same mechanism  we hope  will allow these patients  not only to imagine again the movements that they want to make and translate them into movements of this new body  but for this body to be assimilated as the new body that the brain controls. So I was told about    years ago that this would never happen  that this was close to impossible. And I can only tell you that as a scientist  I grew up in southern Brazil in the mid '  s watching a few crazy guys telling  us  that they would go to the Moon. And I was five years old  and I never understood why NASA didn't hire Captain Kirk and Spock to do the job  after all  they were very proficient    but just seeing that as a kid made me believe  as my grandmother used to tell me  that  impossible is just the possible that someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true.  So they told me that it's impossible to make someone walk. I think I'm going to follow my grandmother's advice. Thank you. The global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest in something that's actually one of the oldest questions in economics  dating back to at least before Adam Smith. And that is  why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions can display radically different savings behavior  Now  many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question  and as a field we've made a tremendous amount of headway and we understand a lot about this. What I'm here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis and some surprisingly powerful new findings that I've been working on about the link between the structure of the language you speak and how you find yourself with the propensity to save. Let me tell you a little bit about savings rates  a little bit about language  and then I'll draw that connection. Let's start by thinking about the member countries of the OECD  or the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. OECD countries  by and large  you should think about these as the richest  most industrialized countries in the world. And by joining the OECD  they were affirming a common commitment to democracy  open markets and free trade. Despite all of these similarities  we see huge differences in savings behavior. So all the way over on the left of this graph  what you see is many OECD countries saving over a quarter of their GDP every year  and some OECD countries saving over a third of their GDP per year. Holding down the right flank of the OECD  all the way on the other side  is Greece. And what you can see is that over the last    years  Greece has barely managed to save more than    percent of their GDP. It should be noted  of course  that the United States and the U.K. are the next in line. Now that we see these huge differences in savings rates  how is it possible that language might have something to do with these differences  Let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ. Linguists and cognitive scientists have been exploring this question for many years now. And then I'll draw the connection between these two behaviors. Many of you have probably already noticed that I'm Chinese. I grew up in the Midwest of the United States. And something I realized quite early on was that the Chinese language forced me to speak about and    in fact  more fundamentally than that    ever so slightly forced me to think about family in very different ways. Now  how might that be  Let me give you an example. Suppose I were talking with you and I was introducing you to my uncle. You understood exactly what I just said in English. If we were speaking Mandarin Chinese with each other  though  I wouldn't have that luxury. I wouldn't have been able to convey so little information. What my language would have forced me to do  instead of just telling you   This is my uncle   is to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information. My language would force me to tell you whether or not this was an uncle on my mother's side or my father's side  whether this was an uncle by marriage or by birth  and if this man was my father's brother  whether he was older than or younger than my father. All of this information is obligatory. Chinese doesn't let me ignore it. And in fact  if I want to speak correctly  Chinese forces me to constantly think about it. Now  that fascinated me endlessly as a child  but what fascinates me even more today as an economist is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time. So for example  if I'm speaking in English  I have to speak grammatically differently if I'm talking about past rain   It rained yesterday   current rain   It is raining now   or future rain   It will rain tomorrow.  Notice that English requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events. Why  Because I have to consider that and I have to modify what I'm saying to say   It will rain   or  It's going to rain.  It's simply not permissible in English to say   It rain tomorrow.  In contrast to that  that's almost exactly what you would say in Chinese. A Chinese speaker can basically say something that sounds very strange to an English speaker's ears. They can say   Yesterday it rain    Now it rain    Tomorrow it rain.  In some deep sense  Chinese doesn't divide up the time spectrum in the same way that English forces us to constantly do in order to speak correctly. Is this difference in languages only between very  very distantly related languages  like English and Chinese  Actually  no. So many of you know  in this room  that English is a Germanic language. What you may not have realized is that English is actually an outlier. It is the only Germanic language that requires this. For example  most other Germanic language speakers feel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow by saying   Morgen regnet es   quite literally to an English ear   It rain tomorrow.  This led me  as a behavioral economist  to an intriguing hypothesis. Could how you speak about time  could how your language forces you to think about time  affect your propensity to behave across time  You speak English  a futured language. And what that means is that every time you discuss the future  or any kind of a future event  grammatically you're forced to cleave that from the present and treat it as if it's something viscerally different. Now suppose that that visceral difference makes you subtly dissociate the future from the present every time you speak. If that's true and it makes the future feel like something more distant and more different from the present  that's going to make it harder to save. If  on the other hand  you speak a futureless language  the present and the future  you speak about them identically. If that subtly nudges you to feel about them identically  that's going to make it easier to save. Now this is a fanciful theory. I'm a professor  I get paid to have fanciful theories. But how would you actually go about testing such a theory  Well  what I did with that was to access the linguistics literature. And interestingly enough  there are pockets of futureless language speakers situated all over the world. This is a pocket of futureless language speakers in Northern Europe. Interestingly enough  when you start to crank the data  these pockets of futureless language speakers all around the world turn out to be  by and large  some of the world's best savers. Just to give you a hint of that  let's look back at that OECD graph that we were talking about. What you see is that these bars are systematically taller and systematically shifted to the left compared to these bars which are the members of the OECD that speak futured languages. What is the average difference here  Five percentage points of your GDP saved per year. Over    years that has huge long run effects on the wealth of your nation. Now while these findings are suggestive  countries can be different in so many different ways that it's very  very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences. What I'm going to show you  though  is something that I've been engaging in for a year  which is trying to gather all of the largest datasets that we have access to as economists  and I'm going to try and strip away all of those possible differences  hoping to get this relationship to break. And just in summary  no matter how far I push this  I can't get it to break. Let me show you how far you can do that. One way to imagine that is I gather large datasets from around the world. So for example  there is the Survey of Health   Aging  and Retirement in Europe. From this dataset you actually learn that retired European families are extremely patient with survey takers. So imagine that you're a retired household in Belgium and someone comes to your front door.  Excuse me  would you mind if I peruse your stock portfolio  Do you happen to know how much your house is worth  Do you mind telling me  Would you happen to have a hallway that's more than    meters long  If you do  would you mind if I timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway  Would you mind squeezing as hard as you can  in your dominant hand  this device so I can measure your grip strength  How about blowing into this tube so I can measure your lung capacity   The survey takes over a day. Combine that with a Demographic and Health Survey collected by USAID in developing countries in Africa  for example  which that survey actually can go so far as to directly measure the HIV status of families living in  for example  rural Nigeria. Combine that with a world value survey  which measures the political opinions and  fortunately for me  the savings behaviors of millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world. Take all of that data  combine it  and this map is what you get. What you find is nine countries around the world that have significant native populations which speak both futureless and futured languages. And what I'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that I can measure  and then I'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds even after controlling for all of these levels. What are the characteristics we can control for  Well I'm going to match families on country of birth and residence  the demographics    what sex  their age    their income level within their own country  their educational achievement  a lot about their family structure. It turns out there are six different ways to be married in Europe. And most granularly  I break them down by religion where there are    categories of religions in the world    so an extreme level of granularity. There are  .  billion different ways that a family can find itself. Now effectively everything I'm going to tell you from now on is only comparing these basically nearly identical families. It's getting as close as possible to the thought experiment of finding two families both of whom live in Brussels who are identical on every single one of these dimensions  but one of whom speaks Flemish and one of whom speaks French  or two families that live in a rural district in Nigeria  one of whom speaks Hausa and one of whom speaks Igbo. Now even after all of this granular level of control  do futureless language speakers seem to save more  Yes  futureless language speakers  even after this level of control  are    percent more likely to report having saved in any given year. Does this have cumulative effects  Yes  by the time they retire  futureless language speakers  holding constant their income  are going to retire with    percent more in savings. Can we push this data even further  Yes  because I just told you  we actually collect a lot of health data as economists. Now how can we think about health behaviors to think about savings  Well  think about smoking  for example. Smoking is in some deep sense negative savings. If savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure  smoking is just the opposite. It's current pleasure in exchange for future pain. What we should expect then is the opposite effect. And that's exactly what we find. Futureless language speakers are    to    percent less likely to be smoking at any given point in time compared to identical families  and they're going to be    to    percent less likely to be obese by the time they retire  and they're going to report being    percent more likely to have used a condom in their last sexual encounter. I could go on and on with the list of differences that you can find. It's almost impossible not to find a savings behavior for which this strong effect isn't present. My linguistics and economics colleagues at Yale and I are just starting to do this work and really explore and understand the ways that these subtle nudges cause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak. Ultimately  the goal  once we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making  we want to be able to provide people tools so that they can consciously make themselves better savers and more conscious investors in their own future. Thank you very much. Okay  this morning I'm speaking on the question of corruption. And corruption is defined as the abuse of a position of trust for the benefit of yourself    or  in the case of our context  your friends  your family or your financiers. Okay  Friends  family and financiers. But we need to understand what we understand about corruption  and we need to understand that we have been miseducated about it  and we have to admit that. We have to have the courage to admit that to start changing how we deal with it. The first thing is that the big myth  number one  is that in fact it's not really a crime. When we get together with friends and family and we discuss crime in our country  crime in Belmont or crime in Diego or crime in Marabella  nobody's speaking about corruption. That's the honest truth. When the Commissioner of Police comes on TV to talk about crime  he isn't speaking about corruption. And we know for sure when the Minister of National Security is speaking about crime  he's not talking about corruption either. The point I'm making is that it is a crime. It is an economic crime  because we're involving the looting of taxpayers' money. Public and private corruption is a reality. As somebody who comes from the private sector  I can tell you there's a massive amount of corruption in the private sector that has nothing to do with government. The same bribes and backhanders and things that take place under the table  it all takes place in the private sector. Today  I'm focusing on public sector corruption  which the private sector also participates in. The second important myth to understand    because we have to destroy these myths  dismantle them and destroy them and ridicule them    the second important myth to understand is the one that says that in fact corruption is only a small problem    if it is a problem  it's only a small problem  that in fact it's only a little    or    percent  it's been going on forever  it probably will continue forever  and there's no point passing any laws  because there's little we can do about it. And I want to demonstrate that that  too  is a dangerous myth  very dangerous. It's a piece of public mischief. And I want to speak a little bit  take us back about    years. We're coming out today from Trinidad and Tobago  a resource rich  small Caribbean country  and in the early     s we had a massive increase in the country's wealth  and that increase was caused by the increase in world oil prices. We call them petrodollars. The treasury was bursting with money. And it's ironic  because we're standing today in the Central Bank. You see  history's rich in irony. We're standing today in the Central Bank  and the Central Bank is responsible for a lot of the things I'm going to be speaking about. Okay  We're talking about irresponsibility in public office. We're speaking about the fact that across the terrace  the next tower is the Ministry of Finance  and there's a lot of connection with us today  so we're speaking within your temple today. Okay  The first thing I want to talk about is that when all of this money flowed into our country about    years ago  we embarked  the government of the day embarked on a series of government to government arrangements to have rapidly develop the country. And some of the largest projects in the country were being constructed through government to government arrangements with some of the leading countries in the world  the United States and Britain and France and so on and so on. As I said  even this building we're standing in    that's one of the ironies    this building was part of that series of complexes  what they called the Twin Towers. It became so outrageous  the whole situation  that in fact a commission of inquiry was appointed  and it reported in          years ago it reported    the Ballah Report       years ago  and immediately the government to government arrangements were stopped. The then Prime Minister went to Parliament to give a budget speech  and he said some things that I'll never forget. They went right in here. I was a young man at the time. It went right into my heart. And he said that  in fact   Let me see if this thing works. Are we getting a  yeah   That's what he told us. He told us that  in fact  two out of every three dollars of our petrodollars that we spent  the taxpayers' money  was wasted or stolen. So the    or    percent is pure mischief. As we say  it's a nancy story. Forget it. That's for little children. We are big people  and we're trying to deal with what's happening in our society. Okay  This is the size of the problem. Okay  Two thirds of the money stolen or wasted. That was    years ago.      was Ballah. So what has changed  I don't like to bring up embarrassing secrets to an international audience  but I have to. Four months ago  we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country. We call it the Section    fiasco  the Section    fiasco  a suspicious piece of law  and I'm going to say it like it is  a suspicious piece of law was passed at a suspicious time to free some suspects.  Laughter  And it was called  those people are called the Piarco Airport accused. I'm going to have my own lexicon speaking here today. They are the Piarco Airport accused. It was a constitutional outrage of the first order  and I have labeled it the Plot to Pervert Parliament. Our highest institution in our country was perverted. We are dealing with perverts here of an economic and financial nature. Do you get how serious this problem is  There was massive protest. A lot of us in this room took part in the protest in different forms. Most importantly  the American embassy complained  so Parliament was swiftly reconvened  and the law was reversed  it was repealed. That's the word lawyers use. It was repealed. But the point is that Parliament was outwitted in the whole course of events  because what really happened is that  because of the suspicious passage of that law  the law was actually passed into effect on the weekend we celebrated our   th anniversary of independence  our jubilee of independence. So that is the kind of outrage of the thing. It was kind of a nasty way to get maturation  but we got it  because we all understood it  and for the first time that I could remember  there were mass protests against this corruption. And that gave me a lot of hope. Okay  Those of us who are  sometimes you feel like you're a little bit on your own doing some of this work. That passage of the law and the repeal of the law fortified the case of the Piarco Airport accused. So it was one of those really superior double bluff kind of things that took place. But what were they accused of  What was it that they were accused of  I'm being a bit mysterious for those of you out there. What were they accused of  We were trying to build  or reconstruct largely  an airport that had grown outdated. The entire project cost about  .  billion dollars  Trinidad and Tobago dollars  and in fact  we had a lot of bid rigging and suspicious activity  corrupt activity took place. And to get an idea of what it consisted of  and to put it in context in relationship to this whole second myth about it being no big thing  we can look at this second slide here. And what we have here    I am not saying so  this is the Director of Public Prosecutions in a written statement. He said so. And he's telling us that for the   .  billion cost of the project  one billion dollars has been traced to offshore bank accounts. One billion dollars of our taxpayers' money has been located in offshore bank accounts. Being the kind of suspicious person I am  I am outraged at that  and I'm going to pause here  I'm going to pause now and again and bring in different things. I'm going to pause here and bring in something I saw in November last year at Wall Street. I was at Zuccotti Park. It was autumn. It was cool. It was damp. It was getting dark. And I was walking around with the protesters looking at the One Wall Street  Occupy Wall Street movement walking around. And there was a lady with a sign  a very simple sign  a kind of battered looking blonde lady  and the sign was made out of Bristol board  as we say in these parts  and it was made with a marker. And what it said on that sign hit me right in the center. It said   If you're not outraged  you haven't been paying attention.  If you're not outraged by all of this  you haven't been paying attention. So listen up  because we're getting into even deeper waters. My brain started thinking. Well  what if    because I'm suspicious like that. I read a lot of spy novels and stuff. What if     Laughter  But to make it in these wrongs  you have to read a lot of spy novels and follow some of that stuff  right   Laughter  But what if this wasn't the first time  What if this is just the first time that the so and sos had been caught  What if it had happened before  How would I find out  Now  the previous two examples I gave were to do with construction sector corruption  okay  And I have the privilege at this time to lead the Joint Consultative Council  which is a not for profit. We're at jcc.org.tt  and we have the    we are the leaders in the struggle to produce a new public procurement system about how public money is transacted. So those of you interested in finding out more about it  or joining us or signing up on any of our petitions  please get involved. But I'm going to segue to another thing that relates  because one of my private campaigns I've been conducting for over three and a half years is for transparency and accountability around the bailout of CL Financial. CL Financial is the Caribbean's largest ever conglomerate  okay  And without getting into all of the details  it is said to have collapsed   I'm using my words very carefully   it's said to have collapsed in January of '    which is just coming up to nearly four years. In an unprecedented fit of generosity    and you have to be very suspicious about these people    in an unprecedented   and I'm using that word carefully   unprecedented fit of generosity  the government of the day signed  made a written commitment  to repay all of the creditors. And I can tell you without fear of contradiction that hasn't happened anywhere else on the planet. Let's understand  because we lack context. People are telling us it's just like Wall Street. It's not just like Wall Street. Trinidad and Tobago is like a place with different laws of physics or biology or something. It's not just like anywhere.  Applause  It's not just like anywhere. It's not just like anywhere. Here is here  and out there is out there. Okay  I'm serious now. Listen. They've had bailouts on Wall Street. They've had bailouts in London. They've had bailouts in Europe. In Africa  they've had bailouts. In Nigeria  six of the major commercial banks collapsed at the same time as ours  eh  It's interesting to parallel how the Nigerian experience has    how they've treated it  and they've treated it very well compared to us. Nowhere on the planet have all the creditors been bailed out in excess of what their statutory entitlements were. Only here. So what was the reason for the generosity  Is our government that generous  And maybe they are. Let's look at it. Let's look into it. So I started digging and writing and so and so on  and that work can be found  my personal work can be found at AfraRaymond.com  which is my name. It's a not for profit blog that I run. Not as popular as some of the other people  but there you go. But the point is that the bitter experience of Section     that plot to pervert Parliament  that bitter experience that took place in August  when we were supposed to be celebrating our independence  going into September  forced me to check myself and recalculate my bearings  and to go back into some of the work  some of the stuff I'd written and some of the exchanges I'd had with the officials to see what was really what. As we say in Trinidad and Tobago  who is who and what is what  Okay  We want to try to recalculate. And I made a Freedom of Information application in May this year to the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance is the next tower over. This is the other context. The Ministry of Finance  we are told  is subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. I'm going to take you through a worked example of whether that's really so. The Central Bank in which we stand this morning is immune from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. So in fact  you can't ask them anything  and they don't have to answer anything. That is the law since     . So I plunged into this struggle  and I asked four questions. And I'll relate the questions to you in the short form with the reply  so you could understand  as I said  where we are. Here is not like anywhere else. Question number one  I asked to see the accounts of CL Financial  and if you can't show me the accounts    the Minister of Finance is making statements  passing new laws and giving speeches and so on. What are the figures he's relying on  It's like that joke  I want whatever he's drinking. And they wrote back and said to me  well what do you really mean  So they hit my question with a question. Second point  I want to see who are the creditors of the group who have been repaid  Let me pause here to point out to you all that    billion dollars of our money has been spent on this. That is about three and a half billion U.S. dollars coming out of a small    we used to be resource rich    Caribbean country. Okay  And I asked the question  who was getting that three and a half billion dollars  And I want to pause again to bring up context  because context helps us to get clarity understanding this thing. There's a particular individual who is in the government now. The name of the person doesn't matter. And that person made a career out of using the Freedom of Information Act to advance his political cause. Okay  His name isn't important. I wouldn't dignify it. I'm on a point. The point is  that person made a career out of using the Freedom of Information Act to advance his cause. And the most famous case was what we came to call the Secret Scholarship Scandal  where in fact there was about    million dollars in government money that had been dispersed in a series of scholarships  and the scholarships hadn't been advertised  and so and so on and so on. And he was able to get the court  using that act of Parliament  Freedom of Information Act  to release the information  and I thought that was excellent. Fantastic. But you see  the question is this  If it's right and proper for us to use the Freedom of Information Act and to use the court to force a disclosure about    million dollars in public money  it must be right and proper for us to force a disclosure about    billion dollars. You see  But the Ministry of Finance  the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance  wrote me and said to me  that information is exempt too. You see  This is what we're dealing with  okay  The third thing I will tell you is that I also asked for the directors of CL Financial  whether in fact they were making filings under our Integrity in Public Life Act. We have an Integrity in Public Life Act as part of our framework supposed to safeguard the nation's interest. And public officials are supposed to file to say what it is they have in terms of assets and liabilities. And of course I've since discovered that they're not filing  and in fact the Minister of Finance has not even asked them to file. So here we have it. We have a situation where the basic safeguards of integrity and accountability and transparency have all been discarded. I've asked the question in the legal and required fashion. It's been ignored. The sort of thing that motivated us around Section     we need to continue to work on that. We can't forget it. I have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country's history. It's also the single largest example of public corruption according to this equation. And this is my reality check. Where you have an expenditure of public money and it is without accountability and it's without transparency  it will always be equal to corruption  whether you're in Russia or Nigeria or Alaska  it will always be equal to corruption  and that is what we are dealing with here. I'm going to continue the work to press on  to get some resolution of those matters at the Ministry of Finance. If it is I have to go to court personally  I will do that. We will continue to press on. We will continue to work within JCC. But I want to step back from the Trinidad and Tobago context and bring something new to the table in terms of an international example. We had the journalist  Heather  Brooke speaking about her battle against government corruption  and she introduced me to this website  Alaveteli.com. And Alaveteli.com is a way for us to have an open database for Freedom of Information applications  and speak with each other. I could see what you're applying for. You could see what I applied for and what replies I got. We can work on it together. We need to build a collective database and a collective understanding of where we are to go to the next point. We need to increase the consciousness. The final thing I want to say is in relation to this one  which is a lovely website from India called IPaidABribe.com. They have international branches  and it's important for us to tune into this one. IPaidABribe.com is really important  a good one to log on to and see. I'm going to pause there. I'm going to ask you for your courage. Discard the first myth  it is a crime. Discard the second myth  it is a big thing. It's a huge problem. It's an economic crime. And let us continue working together to betterment in this situation  stability and sustainability in our society. Thank you. Radical openness is still a distant future in the field of school education. We have such a hard time figuring out that learning is not a place but an activity. But I want to tell you the story of PISA  OECD's test to measure the knowledge and skills of    year olds around the world  and it's really a story of how international comparisons have globalized the field of education that we usually treat as an affair of domestic policy. Look at how the world looked in the     s  in terms of the proportion of people who had completed high school. You can see the United States ahead of everyone else  and much of the economic success of the United States draws on its long standing advantage as the first mover in education. But in the     s  some countries caught up. In the     s  the global expansion of the talent pool continued. And the world didn't stop in the     s. So in the '  s  the U.S. was first. In the '  s  it was   th  and not because standards had fallen  but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere. Korea shows you what's possible in education. Two generations ago  Korea had the standard of living of Afghanistan today  and was one of the lowest education performers. Today  every young Korean finishes high school. So this tells us that  in a global economy  it is no longer national improvement that's the benchmark for success  but the best performing education systems internationally. The trouble is that measuring how much time people spend in school or what degree they have got is not always a good way of seeing what they can actually do. Look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets  while employers say they cannot find the people with the skills they need. And that tells you that better degrees don't automatically translate into better skills and better jobs and better lives. So with PISA  we try to change this by measuring the knowledge and skills of people directly. And we took a very special angle to this. We were less interested in whether students can simply reproduce what they have learned in school  but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge in novel situations. Now  some people have criticized us for this. They say  you know  such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people  because we test students with problems they haven't seen before. But if you take that logic  you know  you should consider life unfair  because the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school  but whether we are prepared for change  whether we are prepared for jobs that haven't been created  to use technologies that haven't been invented  to solve problems we just can't anticipate today. And once hotly contested  our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard. In our latest assessment in       we measured    school systems that together cover    percent of the economy. This chart shows you the performance of countries. In red  sort of below OECD average. Yellow is so so  and in green are the countries doing really well. You can see Shanghai  Korea  Singapore in Asia  Finland in Europe  Canada in North America doing really well. You can also see that there is a gap of almost three and a half school years between    year olds in Shanghai and    year olds in Chile  and the gap grows to seven school years when you include the countries with really poor performance. There's a world of difference in the way in which young people are prepared for today's economy. But I want to introduce a second important dimension into this picture. Educators like to talk about equity. With PISA  we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity  in terms of ensuring that people from different social backgrounds have equal chances. And we see that in some countries  the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very  very strong. Opportunities are unequally distributed. A lot of potential of young children is wasted. We see in other countries that it matters much less into which social context you're born. We all want to be there  in the upper right quadrant  where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed. Nobody  and no country  can afford to be there  where performance is poor and there are large social disparities. And then we can debate  you know  is it better to be there  where performance is strong at the price of large disparities  Or do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity  But actually  if you look at how countries come out on this picture  you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity. In fact  one of the most important lessons from this comparison is that you don't have to compromise equity to achieve excellence. These countries have moved on from providing excellence for just some to providing excellence for all  a very important lesson. And that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems that believe they are mainly there to sort people. And ever since those results came out  policymakers  educators  researchers from around the world have tried to figure out what's behind the success of those systems. But let's step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started PISA  and I'm giving them a colored bubble now. And I'm making the size of the bubble proportional to the amount of money that countries spent on students. If money would tell you everything about the quality of learning outcomes  you would find all the large bubbles at the top  no  But that's not what you see. Spending per student only explains about  well  less than    percent of the performance variation among countries  and Luxembourg  for example  the most expensive system  doesn't do particularly well. What you see is that two countries with similar spending achieve very different results. You also see    and I think that's one of the most encouraging findings    that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well educated countries  and poor and badly educated ones  a very  very important lesson. Let's look at this in greater detail. The red dot shows you spending per student relative to a country's wealth. One way you can spend money is by paying teachers well  and you can see Korea investing a lot in attracting the best people into the teaching profession. And Korea also invests into long school days  which drives up costs further. Last but not least  Koreans want their teachers not only to teach but also to develop. They invest in professional development and collaboration and many other things. All that costs money. How can Korea afford all of this  The answer is  students in Korea learn in large classes. This is the blue bar which is driving costs down. You go to the next country on the list  Luxembourg  and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for Korea  so Luxembourg spends the same per student as Korea does. But  you know  parents and teachers and policymakers in Luxembourg all like small classes. You know  it's very pleasant to walk into a small class. So they have invested all their money into there  and the blue bar  class size  is driving costs up. But even Luxembourg can spend its money only once  and the price for this is that teachers are not paid particularly well. Students don't have long hours of learning. And basically  teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching. So you can see two countries spent their money very differently  and actually how they spent their money matters a lot more than how much they invest in education. Let's go back to the year     . Remember  that was the year before the iPod was invented. This is how the world looked then in terms of PISA performance. The first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller  no  We spent a lot less on education  about    percent less on education. So you ask yourself  if education has become so much more expensive  has it become so much better  And the bitter truth really is that  you know  not in many countries. But there are some countries which have seen impressive improvements. Germany  my own country  in the year       featured in the lower quadrant  below average performance  large social disparities. And remember  Germany  we used to be one of those countries that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees. Very disappointing results. People were stunned by the results. And for the very first time  the public debate in Germany was dominated for months by education  not tax  not other kinds of issues  but education was the center of the public debate. And then policymakers began to respond to this. The federal government dramatically raised its investment in education. A lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage. And what's really interesting is that this wasn't just about optimizing existing policies  but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms underlying German education. For example  traditionally  the education of the very young children was seen as the business of families  and you would have cases where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities when they sent their children to kindergarten. PISA has transformed that debate  and pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in Germany. Or traditionally  the German education divides children at the age of     very young children  between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers  and that mainly along socioeconomic lines  and that paradigm is being challenged now too. A lot of change. And the good news is  nine years later  you can see improvements in quality and equity. People have taken up the challenge  done something about it. Or take Korea  at the other end of the spectrum. In the year       Korea did already very well  but the Koreans were concerned that only a small share of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence. They took up the challenge  and Korea was able to double the proportion of students achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading. Well  if you only focus on your brightest students  you know what happens is disparities grow  and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction  but still  an impressive improvement. A major overhaul of Poland's education helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools  turn around many of the lowest performing schools  and raise performance by over half a school year. And you can see other countries as well. Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system  raise quality and improve equity  and so did Hungary. So what you can actually see  there's been a lot of change. And even those people who complain and say that the relative standing of countries on something like PISA is just an artifact of culture  of economic factors  of social issues  of homogeneity of societies  and so on  these people must now concede that education improvement is possible. You know  Poland hasn't changed its culture. It didn't change its economy. It didn't change the compositions of its population. It didn't fire its teachers. It changed its education policies and practice. Very impressive. And all that raises  of course  the question  What can we learn from those countries in the green quadrant who have achieved high levels of equity  high levels of performance  and raised outcomes  And  of course  the question is  can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere  Of course  you can't copy and paste education systems wholesale  but these comparisons have identified a range of factors that high performing systems share. Everybody agrees that education is important. Everybody says that. But the test of truth is  how do you weigh that priority against other priorities  How do countries pay their teachers relative to other highly skilled workers  Would you want your child to become a teacher rather than a lawyer  How do the media talk about schools and teachers  Those are the critical questions  and what we have learned from PISA is that  in high performing education systems  the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education  their future  more than consumption today. And you know what's interesting  You won't believe it  but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school. Those things really exist. But placing a high value on education is just part of the picture. The other part is the belief that all children are capable of success. You have some countries where students are segregated early in their ages. You know  students are divided up  reflecting the belief that only some children can achieve world class standards. But usually that is linked to very strong social disparities. If you go to Japan in Asia  or Finland in Europe  parents and teachers in those countries expect every student to succeed  and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior. When we asked students what counts for success in mathematics  students in North America would typically tell us  you know  it's all about talent. If I'm not born as a genius in math  I'd better study something else. Nine out of    Japanese students say that it depends on my own investment  on my own effort  and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them. In the past  different students were taught in similar ways. High performers on PISA embrace diversity with differentiated pedagogical practices. They realize that ordinary students have extraordinary talents  and they personalize learning opportunities. High performing systems also share clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum. Every student knows what matters. Every student knows what's required to be successful. And nowhere does the quality of an education system exceed the quality of its teachers. High performing systems are very careful in how they recruit and select their teachers and how they train them. They watch how they improve the performances of teachers in difficulties who are struggling  and how they structure teacher pay. They provide an environment also in which teachers work together to frame good practice. And they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers. In bureaucratic school systems  teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching. High performing systems are very clear what good performance is. They set very ambitious standards  but then they enable their teachers to figure out  what do I need to teach to my students today  The past was about delivered wisdom in education. Now the challenge is to enable user generated wisdom. High performers have moved on from professional or from administrative forms of accountability and control    sort of  how do you check whether people do what they're supposed to do in education    to professional forms of work organization. They enable their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy. They provide them with the kind of development they need to develop stronger pedagogical practices. The goal of the past was standardization and compliance. High performing systems have made teachers and school principals inventive. In the past  the policy focus was on outcomes  on provision. The high performing systems have helped teachers and school principals to look outwards to the next teacher  the next school around their lives. And the most impressive outcomes of world class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system. You've seen Finland doing so well on PISA  but what makes Finland so impressive is that only five percent of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools. Every school succeeds. This is where success is systemic. And how do they do that  They invest resources where they can make the most difference. They attract the strongest principals into the toughest schools  and the most talented teachers into the most challenging classroom. Last but not least  those countries align policies across all areas of public policy. They make them coherent over sustained periods of time  and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented. Now  knowing what successful systems are doing doesn't yet tell us how to improve. That's also clear  and that's where some of the limits of international comparisons of PISA are. That's where other forms of research need to kick in  and that's also why PISA doesn't venture into telling countries what they should be doing. But its strength lies in telling them what everybody else has been doing. And the example of PISA shows that data can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy through which we usually run education systems. You know  some people argue that changing educational administration is like moving graveyards. You just can't rely on the people out there to help you with this.  Laughter  But PISA has shown what's possible in education. It has helped countries to see that improvement is possible. It has taken away excuses from those who are complacent. And it has helped countries to set meaningful targets in terms of measurable goals achieved by the world's leaders. If we can help every child  every teacher  every school  every principal  every parent see what improvement is possible  that only the sky is the limit to education improvement  we have laid the foundations for better policies and better lives. Thank you. I grew up watching Star Trek. I love Star Trek. Star Trek made me want to see alien creatures  creatures from a far distant world. But basically  I figured out that I could find those alien creatures right on Earth. And what I do is I study insects. I'm obsessed with insects  particularly insect flight. I think the evolution of insect flight is perhaps one of the most important events in the history of life. Without insects  there'd be no flowering plants. Without flowering plants  there would be no clever  fruit eating primates giving TED Talks. Now  David and Hidehiko and Ketaki gave a very compelling story about the similarities between fruit flies and humans  and there are many similarities  and so you might think that if humans are similar to fruit flies  the favorite behavior of a fruit fly might be this  for example    but in my talk  I don't want to emphasize on the similarities between humans and fruit flies  but rather the differences  and focus on the behaviors that I think fruit flies excel at doing. And so I want to show you a high speed video sequence of a fly shot at       frames per second in infrared lighting  and to the right  off screen  is an electronic looming predator that is going to go at the fly. The fly is going to sense this predator. It is going to extend its legs out. It's going to sashay away to live to fly another day. Now I have carefully cropped this sequence to be exactly the duration of a human eye blink  so in the time that it would take you to blink your eye  the fly has seen this looming predator  estimated its position  initiated a motor pattern to fly it away  beating its wings at     times a second as it does so. I think this is a fascinating behavior that shows how fast the fly's brain can process information. Now  flight    what does it take to fly  Well  in order to fly  just as in a human aircraft  you need wings that can generate sufficient aerodynamic forces  you need an engine sufficient to generate the power required for flight  and you need a controller  and in the first human aircraft  the controller was basically the brain of Orville and Wilbur sitting in the cockpit. Now  how does this compare to a fly  Well  I spent a lot of my early career trying to figure out how insect wings generate enough force to keep the flies in the air. And you might have heard how engineers proved that bumblebees couldn't fly. Well  the problem was in thinking that the insect wings function in the way that aircraft wings work. But they don't. And we tackle this problem by building giant  dynamically scaled model robot insects that would flap in giant pools of mineral oil where we could study the aerodynamic forces. And it turns out that the insects flap their wings in a very clever way  at a very high angle of attack that creates a structure at the leading edge of the wing  a little tornado like structure called a leading edge vortex  and it's that vortex that actually enables the wings to make enough force for the animal to stay in the air. But the thing that's actually most    so  what's fascinating is not so much that the wing has some interesting morphology. What's clever is the way the fly flaps it  which of course ultimately is controlled by the nervous system  and this is what enables flies to perform these remarkable aerial maneuvers. Now  what about the engine  The engine of the fly is absolutely fascinating. They have two types of flight muscle  so called power muscle  which is stretch activated  which means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled on a contraction by contraction basis by the nervous system. It's specialized to generate the enormous power required for flight  and it fills the middle portion of the fly  so when a fly hits your windshield  it's basically the power muscle that you're looking at. But attached to the base of the wing is a set of little  tiny control muscles that are not very powerful at all  but they're very fast  and they're able to reconfigure the hinge of the wing on a stroke by stroke basis  and this is what enables the fly to change its wing and generate the changes in aerodynamic forces which change its flight trajectory. And of course  the role of the nervous system is to control all this. So let's look at the controller. Now flies excel in the sorts of sensors that they carry to this problem. They have antennae that sense odors and detect wind detection. They have a sophisticated eye which is the fastest visual system on the planet. They have another set of eyes on the top of their head. We have no idea what they do. They have sensors on their wing. Their wing is covered with sensors  including sensors that sense deformation of the wing. They can even taste with their wings. One of the most sophisticated sensors a fly has is a structure called the halteres. The halteres are actually gyroscopes. These devices beat back and forth about     hertz during flight  and the animal can use them to sense its body rotation and initiate very  very fast corrective maneuvers. But all of this sensory information has to be processed by a brain  and yes  indeed  flies have a brain  a brain of about         neurons. Now several people at this conference have already suggested that fruit flies could serve neuroscience because they're a simple model of brain function. And the basic punchline of my talk is  I'd like to turn that over on its head. I don't think they're a simple model of anything. And I think that flies are a great model. They're a great model for flies. And let's explore this notion of simplicity. So I think  unfortunately  a lot of neuroscientists  we're all somewhat narcissistic. When we think of brain  we of course imagine our own brain. But remember that this kind of brain  which is much  much smaller   instead of     billion neurons  it has         neurons   but this is the most common form of brain on the planet and has been for     million years. And is it fair to say that it's simple  Well  it's simple in the sense that it has fewer neurons  but is that a fair metric  And I would propose it's not a fair metric. So let's sort of think about this. I think we have to compare    we have to compare the size of the brain with what the brain can do. So I propose we have a Trump number  and the Trump number is the ratio of this man's behavioral repertoire to the number of neurons in his brain. We'll calculate the Trump number for the fruit fly. Now  how many people here think the Trump number is higher for the fruit fly  It's a very smart  smart audience. Yes  the inequality goes in this direction  or I would posit it. Now I realize that it is a little bit absurd to compare the behavioral repertoire of a human to a fly. But let's take another animal just as an example. Here's a mouse. A mouse has about       times as many neurons as a fly. I used to study mice. When I studied mice  I used to talk really slowly. And then something happened when I started to work on flies. And I think if you compare the natural history of flies and mice  it's really comparable. They have to forage for food. They have to engage in courtship. They have sex. They hide from predators. They do a lot of the similar things. But I would argue that flies do more. So for example  I'm going to show you a sequence  and I have to say  some of my funding comes from the military  so I'm showing this classified sequence and you cannot discuss it outside of this room. Okay  So I want you to look at the payload at the tail of the fruit fly. Watch it very closely  and you'll see why my six year old son now wants to be a neuroscientist. Wait for it. Pshhew. So at least you'll admit that if fruit flies are not as clever as mice  they're at least as clever as pigeons.  Laughter  Now  I want to get across that it's not just a matter of numbers but also the challenge for a fly to compute everything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons. So this is a beautiful image of a visual interneuron from a mouse that came from Jeff Lichtman's lab  and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk. But up in the corner  in the right corner  you'll see  at the same scale  a visual interneuron from a fly. And I'll expand this up. And it's a beautifully complex neuron. It's just very  very tiny  and there's lots of biophysical challenges with trying to compute information with tiny  tiny neurons. How small can neurons get  Well  look at this interesting insect. It looks sort of like a fly. It has wings  it has eyes  it has antennae  its legs  complicated life history  it's a parasite  it has to fly around and find caterpillars to parasatize  but not only is its brain the size of a salt grain  which is comparable for a fruit fly  it is the size of a salt grain. So here's some other organisms at the similar scale. This animal is the size of a paramecium and an amoeba  and it has a brain of       neurons that's so small    you know these things called cell bodies you've been hearing about  where the nucleus of the neuron is  This animal gets rid of them because they take up too much space. So this is a session on frontiers in neuroscience. I would posit that one frontier in neuroscience is to figure out how the brain of that thing works. But let's think about this. How can you make a small number of neurons do a lot  And I think  from an engineering perspective  you think of multiplexing. You can take a hardware and have that hardware do different things at different times  or have different parts of the hardware doing different things. And these are the two concepts I'd like to explore. And they're not concepts that I've come up with  but concepts that have been proposed by others in the past. And one idea comes from lessons from chewing crabs. And I don't mean chewing the crabs. I grew up in Baltimore  and I chew crabs very  very well. But I'm talking about the crabs actually doing the chewing. Crab chewing is actually really fascinating. Crabs have this complicated structure under their carapace called the gastric mill that grinds their food in a variety of different ways. And here's an endoscopic movie of this structure. The amazing thing about this is that it's controlled by a really tiny set of neurons  about two dozen neurons that can produce a vast variety of different motor patterns  and the reason it can do this is that this little tiny ganglion in the crab is actually inundated by many  many neuromodulators. You heard about neuromodulators earlier. There are more neuromodulators that alter  that innervate this structure than actually neurons in the structure  and they're able to generate a complicated set of patterns. And this is the work by Eve Marder and her many colleagues who've been studying this fascinating system that show how a smaller cluster of neurons can do many  many  many things because of neuromodulation that can take place on a moment by moment basis. So this is basically multiplexing in time. Imagine a network of neurons with one neuromodulator. You select one set of cells to perform one sort of behavior  another neuromodulator  another set of cells  a different pattern  and you can imagine you could extrapolate to a very  very complicated system. Is there any evidence that flies do this  Well  for many years in my laboratory and other laboratories around the world  we've been studying fly behaviors in little flight simulators. You can tether a fly to a little stick. You can measure the aerodynamic forces it's creating. You can let the fly play a little video game by letting it fly around in a visual display. So let me show you a little tiny sequence of this. Here's a fly and a large infrared view of the fly in the flight simulator  and this is a game the flies love to play. You allow them to steer towards the little stripe  and they'll just steer towards that stripe forever. It's part of their visual guidance system. But very  very recently  it's been possible to modify these sorts of behavioral arenas for physiologies. So this is the preparation that one of my former post docs  Gaby Maimon  who's now at Rockefeller  developed  and it's basically a flight simulator but under conditions where you actually can stick an electrode in the brain of the fly and record from a genetically identified neuron in the fly's brain. And this is what one of these experiments looks like. It was a sequence taken from another post doc in the lab  Bettina Schnell. The green trace at the bottom is the membrane potential of a neuron in the fly's brain  and you'll see the fly start to fly  and the fly is actually controlling the rotation of that visual pattern itself by its own wing motion  and you can see this visual interneuron respond to the pattern of wing motion as the fly flies. So for the first time we've actually been able to record from neurons in the fly's brain while the fly is performing sophisticated behaviors such as flight. And one of the lessons we've been learning is that the physiology of cells that we've been studying for many years in quiescent flies is not the same as the physiology of those cells when the flies actually engage in active behaviors like flying and walking and so forth. And why is the physiology different  Well it turns out it's these neuromodulators  just like the neuromodulators in that little tiny ganglion in the crabs. So here's a picture of the octopamine system. Octopamine is a neuromodulator that seems to play an important role in flight and other behaviors. But this is just one of many neuromodulators that's in the fly's brain. So I really think that  as we learn more  it's going to turn out that the whole fly brain is just like a large version of this stomatogastric ganglion  and that's one of the reasons why it can do so much with so few neurons. Now  another idea  another way of multiplexing is multiplexing in space  having different parts of a neuron do different things at the same time. So here's two sort of canonical neurons from a vertebrate and an invertebrate  a human pyramidal neuron from Ramon y Cajal  and another cell to the right  a non spiking interneuron  and this is the work of Alan Watson and Malcolm Burrows many years ago  and Malcolm Burrows came up with a pretty interesting idea based on the fact that this neuron from a locust does not fire action potentials. It's a non spiking cell. So a typical cell  like the neurons in our brain  has a region called the dendrites that receives input  and that input sums together and will produce action potentials that run down the axon and then activate all the output regions of the neuron. But non spiking neurons are actually quite complicated because they can have input synapses and output synapses all interdigitated  and there's no single action potential that drives all the outputs at the same time. So there's a possibility that you have computational compartments that allow the different parts of the neuron to do different things at the same time. So these basic concepts of multitasking in time and multitasking in space  I think these are things that are true in our brains as well  but I think the insects are the true masters of this. So I hope you think of insects a little bit differently next time  and as I say up here  please think before you swat. So here's the good news about families. The last    years have seen a revolution in what it means to be a family. We have blended families  adopted families  we have nuclear families living in separate houses and divorced families living in the same house. But through it all  the family has grown stronger. Eight in    say the family they have today is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in. Now  here's the bad news. Nearly everyone is completely overwhelmed by the chaos of family life. Every parent I know  myself included  feels like we're constantly playing defense. Just when our kids stop teething  they start having tantrums. Just when they stop needing our help taking a bath  they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying. And here's the worst news of all. Our children sense we're out of control. Ellen Galinsky of the Families and Work Institute asked       children   If you were granted one wish about your parents  what would it be   The parents predicted the kids would say  spending more time with them. They were wrong. The kids' number one wish  That their parents be less tired and less stressed. So how can we change this dynamic  Are there concrete things we can do to reduce stress  draw our family closer  and generally prepare our children to enter the world  I spent the last few years trying to answer that question  traveling around  meeting families  talking to scholars  experts ranging from elite peace negotiators to Warren Buffett's bankers to the Green Berets. I was trying to figure out  what do happy families do right and what can I learn from them to make my family happier  I want to tell you about one family that I met  and why I think they offer clues. At   p.m. on a Sunday in Hidden Springs  Idaho  where the six members of the Starr family are sitting down to the highlight of their week  the family meeting. The Starrs are a regular American family with their share of regular American family problems. David is a software engineer. Eleanor takes care of their four children  ages    to   . One of those kids tutors math on the far side of town. One has lacrosse on the near side of town. One has Asperger syndrome. One has ADHD.  We were living in complete chaos   Eleanor said. What the Starrs did next  though  was surprising. Instead of turning to friends or relatives  they looked to David's workplace. They turned to a cutting edge program called agile development that was just spreading from manufacturers in Japan to startups in Silicon Valley. In agile  workers are organized into small groups and do things in very short spans of time. So instead of having executives issue grand proclamations  the team in effect manages itself. You have constant feedback. You have daily update sessions. You have weekly reviews. You're constantly changing. David said when they brought this system into their home  the family meetings in particular increased communication  decreased stress  and made everybody happier to be part of the family team. When my wife and I adopted these family meetings and other techniques into the lives of our then five year old twin daughters  it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born. And these meetings had this effect while taking under    minutes. So what is Agile  and why can it help with something that seems so different  like families  In       Jeff Sutherland was a technologist at a financial firm in New England. He was very frustrated with how software got designed. Companies followed the waterfall method  right  in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down to programmers below  and no one had ever consulted the programmers. Eighty three percent of projects failed. They were too bloated or too out of date by the time they were done. Sutherland wanted to create a system where ideas didn't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom and be adjusted in real time. He read    years of Harvard Business Review before stumbling upon an article in      called  The New New Product Development Game.  It said that the pace of business was quickening    and by the way  this was in         and the most successful companies were flexible. It highlighted Toyota and Canon and likened their adaptable  tight knit teams to rugby scrums. As Sutherland told me  we got to that article  and said   That's it.  In Sutherland's system  companies don't use large  massive projects that take two years. They do things in small chunks. Nothing takes longer than two weeks. So instead of saying   You guys go off into that bunker and come back with a cell phone or a social network   you say   You go off and come up with one element  then bring it back. Let's talk about it. Let's adapt.  You succeed or fail quickly. Today  agile is used in a hundred countries  and it's sweeping into management suites. Inevitably  people began taking some of these techniques and applying it to their families. You had blogs pop up  and some manuals were written. Even the Sutherlands told me that they had an Agile Thanksgiving  where you had one group of people working on the food  one setting the table  and one greeting visitors at the door. Sutherland said it was the best Thanksgiving ever. So let's take one problem that families face  crazy mornings  and talk about how agile can help. A key plank is accountability  so teams use information radiators  these large boards in which everybody is accountable. So the Starrs  in adapting this to their home  created a morning checklist in which each child is expected to tick off chores. So on the morning I visited  Eleanor came downstairs  poured herself a cup of coffee  sat in a reclining chair  and she sat there  kind of amiably talking to each of her children as one after the other they came downstairs  checked the list  made themselves breakfast  checked the list again  put the dishes in the dishwasher  rechecked the list  fed the pets or whatever chores they had  checked the list once more  gathered their belongings  and made their way to the bus. It was one of the most astonishing family dynamics I have ever seen. And when I strenuously objected this would never work in our house  our kids needed way too much monitoring  Eleanor looked at me.  That's what I thought   she said.  I told David  'keep your work out of my kitchen.' But I was wrong.  So I turned to David   So why does it work   He said   You can't underestimate the power of doing this.  And he made a checkmark. He said   In the workplace  adults love it. With kids  it's heaven.  The week we introduced a morning checklist into our house  it cut parental screaming in half.  Laughter  But the real change didn't come until we had these family meetings. So following the agile model  we ask three questions  What worked well in our family this week  what didn't work well  and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead  Everyone throws out suggestions and then we pick two to focus on. And suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters' mouths. What worked well this week  Getting over our fear of riding bikes. Making our beds. What didn't work well  Our math sheets  or greeting visitors at the door. Like a lot of parents  our kids are something like Bermuda Triangles. Like  thoughts and ideas go in  but none ever comes out  I mean at least not that are revealing. This gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts. But the most surprising part was when we turned to  what are we going to work on in the week ahead  You know  the key idea of agile is that teams essentially manage themselves  and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids. Our kids love this process. So they would come up with all these ideas. You know  greet five visitors at the door this week  get an extra    minutes of reading before bed. Kick someone  lose desserts for a month. It turns out  by the way  our girls are little Stalins. We constantly have to kind of dial them back. Now look  naturally there's a gap between their kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week  but the truth is it didn't really bother us. It felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables that wouldn't light up their world for many years to come. Three years later    our girls are almost eight now    We're still holding these meetings. My wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom. So what did we learn  The word  agile  entered the lexicon in      when Jeff Sutherland and a group of designers met in Utah and wrote a    point Agile Manifesto. I think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto. I've taken some ideas from the Starrs and from many other families I met. I'm proposing three planks. Plank number one  Adapt all the time. When I became a parent  I figured  you know what  We'll set a few rules and we'll stick to them. That assumes  as parents  we can anticipate every problem that's going to arise. We can't. What's great about the agile system is you build in a system of change so that you can react to what's happening to you in real time. It's like they say in the Internet world  if you're doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago  you're doing the wrong thing. Parents can learn a lot from that. But to me   adapt all the time  means something deeper  too. We have to break parents out of this straitjacket that the only ideas we can try at home are ones that come from shrinks or self help gurus or other family experts. The truth is  their ideas are stale  whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas to make groups and teams work effectively. Let's just take a few examples. Let's take the biggest issue of all  family dinner. Everybody knows that having family dinner with your children is good for the kids. But for so many of us  it doesn't work in our lives. I met a celebrity chef in New Orleans who said   No problem  I'll just time shift family dinner. I'm not home  can't make family dinner  We'll have family breakfast. We'll meet for a bedtime snack. We'll make Sunday meals more important.  And the truth is  recent research backs him up. It turns out there's only    minutes of productive time in any family meal. The rest of it's taken up with  take your elbows off the table  and  pass the ketchup.  You can take that    minutes and move it to any part of the day and have the same benefit. So time shift family dinner. That's adaptability. An environmental psychologist told me   If you're sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface  you'll be more rigid. If you're sitting on a cushioned chair  you'll be more open.  She told me   When you're discipling your children  sit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface. The conversation will go better.  My wife and I actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations because I was sitting above in the power position. So move where you sit. That's adaptability. The point is there are all these new ideas out there. We've got to hook them up with parents. So plank number one  Adapt all the time. Be flexible  be open minded  let the best ideas win. Plank number two  Empower your children. Our instinct as parents is to order our kids around. It's easier  and frankly  we're usually right. There's a reason that few systems have been more waterfall over time than the family. But the single biggest lesson we learned is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible. Enlist the children in their own upbringing. Just yesterday  we were having our family meeting  and we had voted to work on overreacting. So we said   Okay  give us a reward and give us a punishment. Okay   So one of my daughters threw out  you get five minutes of overreacting time all week. So we kind of liked that. But then her sister started working the system. She said   Do I get one five minute overreaction or can I get       second overreactions   I loved that. Spend the time however you want. Now give us a punishment. Okay. If we get    minutes of overreaction time  that's the limit. Every minute above that  we have to do one pushup. So you see  this is working. Now look  this system isn't lax. There's plenty of parental authority going on. But we're giving them practice becoming independent  which of course is our ultimate goal. Just as I was leaving to come here tonight  one of my daughters started screaming. The other one said   Overreaction  Overreaction   and started counting  and within    seconds it had ended. To me that is a certified agile miracle. And by the way  research backs this up too. Children who plan their own goals  set weekly schedules  evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex and take more control over their lives. The point is  we have to let our children succeed on their own terms  and yes  on occasion  fail on their own terms. I was talking to Warren Buffett's banker  and he was chiding me for not letting my children make mistakes with their allowance. And I said   But what if they drive into a ditch   He said   It's much better to drive into a ditch with a    allowance than a         a year salary or a    million inheritance.  So the bottom line is  empower your children. Plank number three  Tell your story. Adaptability is fine  but we also need bedrock. Jim Collins  the author of  Good To Great   told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common  they preserve the core  they stimulate progress. So agile is great for stimulating progress  but I kept hearing time and again  you need to preserve the core. So how do you do that  Collins coached us on doing something that businesses do  which is define your mission and identify your core values. So he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement. We did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat. We had a pajama party. I made popcorn. Actually  I burned one  so I made two. My wife bought a flip chart. And we had this great conversation  like  what's important to us  What values do we most uphold  And we ended up with    statements. We are travelers  not tourists. We don't like dilemmas. We like solutions. Again  research shows that parents should spend less time worrying about what they do wrong and more time focusing on what they do right  worry less about the bad times and build up the good times. This family mission statement is a great way to identify what it is that you do right. A few weeks later  we got a call from the school. One of our daughters had gotten into a spat. And suddenly we were worried  like  do we have a mean girl on our hands  And we didn't really know what to do  so we called her into my office. The family mission statement was on the wall  and my wife said   So  anything up there seem to apply   And she kind of looked down the list  and she said   Bring people together   Suddenly we had a way into the conversation. Another great way to tell your story is to tell your children where they came from. Researchers at Emory gave children a simple  what do you know  test. Do you know where your grandparents were born  Do you know where your parents went to high school  Do you know anybody in your family who had a difficult situation  an illness  and they overcame it  The children who scored highest on this  do you know  scale had the highest self esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives. The  do you know  test was the single biggest predictor of emotional health and happiness. As the author of the study told me  children who have a sense of    they're part of a larger narrative have greater self confidence. So my final plank is  tell your story. Spend time retelling the story of your family's positive moments and how you overcame the negative ones. If you give children this happy narrative  you give them the tools to make themselves happier. I was a teenager when I first read  Anna Karenina  and its famous opening sentence   All happy families are alike. Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.  When I first read that  I thought   That sentence is inane. Of course all happy families aren't alike.  But as I began working on this project  I began changing my mind. Recent scholarship has allowed us  for the first time  to identify the building blocks that successful families have. I've mentioned just three here today  Adapt all the time  empower the children  tell your story. Is it possible  all these years later  to say Tolstoy was right  The answer  I believe  is yes. When Leo Tolstoy was five years old  his brother Nikolay came to him and said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness on a little green stick  which he had hidden in a ravine on the family's estate in Russia. If the stick were ever found  all humankind would be happy. Tolstoy became consumed with that stick  but he never found it. In fact  he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden. He still lies there today  covered in a layer of green grass. That story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that I learned  Happiness is not something we find  it's something we make. Almost anybody who's looked at well run organizations has come to pretty much the same conclusion. Greatness is not a matter of circumstance. It's a matter of choice. You don't need some grand plan. You don't need a waterfall. You just need to take small steps  accumulate small wins  keep reaching for that green stick. In the end  this may be the greatest lesson of all. What's the secret to a happy family  Try. What is going to be the future of learning  I do have a plan  but in order for me to tell you what that plan is  I need to tell you a little story  which kind of sets the stage. I tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools  where did it come from  And you can look far back into the past  but if you look at present day schooling the way it is  it's quite easy to figure out where it came from. It came from about     years ago  and it came from the last and the biggest of the empires on this planet.   The British Empire   Imagine trying to run the show  trying to run the entire planet  without computers  without telephones  with data handwritten on pieces of paper  and traveling by ships. But the Victorians actually did it. What they did was amazing. They created a global computer made up of people. It's still with us today. It's called the bureaucratic administrative machine. In order to have that machine running  you need lots and lots of people. They made another machine to produce those people  the school. The schools would produce the people who would then become parts of the bureaucratic administrative machine. They must be identical to each other. They must know three things  They must have good handwriting  because the data is handwritten  they must be able to read  and they must be able to do multiplication  division  addition and subtraction in their head. They must be so identical that you could pick one up from New Zealand and ship them to Canada and he would be instantly functional. The Victorians were great engineers. They engineered a system that was so robust that it's still with us today  continuously producing identical people for a machine that no longer exists. The empire is gone  so what are we doing with that design that produces these identical people  and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it    Schools as we know them are obsolete   So that's a pretty strong comment there. I said schools as we know them now  they're obsolete. I'm not saying they're broken. It's quite fashionable to say that the education system's broken. It's not broken. It's wonderfully constructed. It's just that we don't need it anymore. It's outdated. What are the kind of jobs that we have today  Well  the clerks are the computers. They're there in thousands in every office. And you have people who guide those computers to do their clerical jobs. Those people don't need to be able to write beautifully by hand. They don't need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads. They do need to be able to read. In fact  they need to be able to read discerningly. Well  that's today  but we don't even know what the jobs of the future are going to look like. We know that people will work from wherever they want  whenever they want  in whatever way they want. How is present day schooling going to prepare them for that world  Well  I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident. I used to teach people how to write computer programs in New Delhi     years ago. And right next to where I used to work  there was a slum. And I used to think  how on Earth are those kids ever going to learn to write computer programs  Or should they not  At the same time  we also had lots of parents  rich people  who had computers  and who used to tell me   You know  my son  I think he's gifted  because he does wonderful things with computers. And my daughter    oh  surely she is extra intelligent.  And so on. So I suddenly figured that  how come all the rich people are having these extraordinarily gifted children  What did the poor do wrong  I made a hole in the boundary wall of the slum next to my office  and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen if I gave a computer to children who never would have one  didn't know any English  didn't know what the Internet was. The children came running in. It was three feet off the ground  and they said   What is this   And I said   Yeah  it's  I don't know.  They said   Why have you put it there   I said   Just like that.  And they said   Can we touch it  I said   If you wish to.  And I went away. About eight hours later  we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse. So I said   Well that's impossible  because    How is it possible  They don't know anything.  My colleagues said   No  it's a simple solution. One of your students must have been passing by  showed them how to use the mouse.  So I said   Yeah  that's possible.  So I repeated the experiment. I went     miles out of Delhi into a really remote village where the chances of a passing software development engineer was very little.  Laughter  I repeated the experiment there. There was no place to stay  so I stuck my computer in  I went away  came back after a couple of months  found kids playing games on it. When they saw me  they said   We want a faster processor and a better mouse.  So I said   How on Earth do you know all this   And they said something very interesting to me. In an irritated voice  they said   You've given us a machine that works only in English  so we had to teach ourselves English in order to use it.   Laughter  That's the first time  as a teacher  that I had heard the word  teach ourselves  said so casually. Here's a short glimpse from those years. That's the first day at the Hole in the Wall. On your right is an eight year old. To his left is his student. She's six. And he's teaching her how to browse. Then onto other parts of the country  I repeated this over and over again  getting exactly the same results that we were.   Hole in the wall film          An eight year old telling his elder sister what to do. And finally a girl explaining in Marathi what it is  and said   There's a processor inside.  So I started publishing. I published everywhere. I wrote down and measured everything  and I said  in nine months  a group of children left alone with a computer in any language will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the West. I'd seen it happen over and over and over again. But I was curious to know  what else would they do if they could do this much  I started experimenting with other subjects  among them  for example  pronunciation. There's one community of children in southern India whose English pronunciation is really bad  and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs. I gave them a speech to text engine in a computer  and I said   Keep talking into it until it types what you say.  They did that  and watch a little bit of this. Computer  Nice to meet you.Child  Nice to meet you. Sugata Mitra  The reason I ended with the face of this young lady over there is because I suspect many of you know her. She has now joined a call center in Hyderabad and may have tortured you about your credit card bills in a very clear English accent. So then people said  well  how far will it go  Where does it stop  I decided I would destroy my own argument by creating an absurd proposition. I made a hypothesis  a ridiculous hypothesis. Tamil is a south Indian language  and I said  can Tamil speaking children in a south Indian village learn the biotechnology of DNA replication in English from a streetside computer  And I said  I'll measure them. They'll get a zero. I'll spend a couple of months  I'll leave it for a couple of months  I'll go back  they'll get another zero. I'll go back to the lab and say  we need teachers. I found a village. It was called Kallikuppam in southern India. I put in Hole in the Wall computers there  downloaded all kinds of stuff from the Internet about DNA replication  most of which I didn't understand. The children came rushing  said   What's all this   So I said   It's very topical  very important. But it's all in English.  So they said   How can we understand such big English words and diagrams and chemistry   So by now  I had developed a new pedagogical method  so I applied that. I said   I haven't the foggiest idea.   And anyway  I am going away.  So I left them for a couple of months. They'd got a zero. I gave them a test. I came back after two months and the children trooped in and said   We've understood nothing.  So I said   Well  what did I expect   So I said   Okay  but how long did it take you before you decided that you can't understand anything   So they said   We haven't given up. We look at it every single day.  So I said   What  You don't understand these screens and you keep staring at it for two months  What for   So a little girl who you see just now  she raised her hand  and she says to me in broken Tamil and English  she said   Well  apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease  we haven't understood anything else.  So I tested them. I got an educational impossibility  zero to    percent in two months in the tropical heat with a computer under the tree in a language they didn't know doing something that's a decade ahead of their time. Absurd. But I had to follow the Victorian norm. Thirty percent is a fail. How do I get them to pass  I have to get them    more marks. I couldn't find a teacher. What I did find was a friend that they had  a    year old girl who was an accountant and she played with them all the time. So I asked this girl   Can you help them   So she says   Absolutely not. I didn't have science in school. I have no idea what they're doing under that tree all day long. I can't help you.  I said   I'll tell you what. Use the method of the grandmother.  So she says   What's that   I said   Stand behind them. Whenever they do anything  you just say  'Well  wow  I mean  how did you do that  What's the next page  Gosh  when I was your age  I could have never done that.' You know what grannies do.  So she did that for two more months. The scores jumped to    percent. Kallikuppam had caught up with my control school in New Delhi  a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher. When I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the playing field. Here's Kallikuppam. I got the camera angle wrong. That one is just amateur stuff  but what she was saying  as you could make out  was about neurons  with her hands were like that  and she was saying neurons communicate. At   . So what are jobs going to be like  Well  we know what they're like today. What's learning going to be like  We know what it's like today  children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand. What will it be tomorrow  Could it be that we don't need to go to school at all  Could it be that  at the point in time when you need to know something  you can find out in two minutes  Could it be    a devastating question  a question that was framed for me by Nicholas Negroponte    could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in a future where knowing is obsolete  But that's terrible. We are homo sapiens. Knowing  that's what distinguishes us from the apes. But look at it this way. It took nature     million years to make the ape stand up and become Homo sapiens. It took us only        to make knowing obsolete. What an achievement that is. But we have to integrate that into our own future. Encouragement seems to be the key. If you look at Kuppam  if you look at all of the experiments that I did  it was simply saying   Wow   saluting learning. There is evidence from neuroscience. The reptilian part of our brain  which sits in the center of our brain  when it's threatened  it shuts down everything else  it shuts down the prefrontal cortex  the parts which learn  it shuts all of that down. Punishment and examinations are seen as threats. We take our children  we make them shut their brains down  and then we say   Perform.  Why did they create a system like that  Because it was needed. There was an age in the Age of Empires when you needed those people who can survive under threat. When you're standing in a trench all alone  if you could have survived  you're okay  you've passed. If you didn't  you failed. But the Age of Empires is gone. What happens to creativity in our age  We need to shift that balance back from threat to pleasure. I came back to England looking for British grandmothers. I put out notices in papers saying  if you are a British grandmother  if you have broadband and a web camera  can you give me one hour of your time per week for free  I got     in the first two weeks. I know more British grandmothers than anyone in the universe.  Laughter  They're called the Granny Cloud. The Granny Cloud sits on the Internet. If there's a child in trouble  we beam a Gran. She goes on over Skype and she sorts things out. I've seen them do it from a village called Diggles in northwestern England  deep inside a village in Tamil Nadu  India        miles away. She does it with only one age old gesture.  Shhh.  Okay  Watch this. Grandmother  You can't catch me. You say it. You can't catch me. Children  You can't catch me. Grandmother  I'm the Gingerbread Man.Children  I'm the Gingerbread Man. Grandmother  Well done  Very good. SM  So what's happening here  I think what we need to look at is we need to look at learning as the product of educational self organization. If you allow the educational process to self organize  then learning emerges. It's not about making learning happen. It's about letting it happen. The teacher sets the process in motion and then she stands back in awe and watches as learning happens. I think that's what all this is pointing at. But how will we know  How will we come to know  Well  I intend to build these Self Organized Learning Environments. They are basically broadband  collaboration and encouragement put together. I've tried this in many  many schools. It's been tried all over the world  and teachers sort of stand back and say   It just happens by itself   And I said   Yeah  it happens by itself.  How did you know that   I said   You won't believe the children who told me and where they're from.  Here's a SOLE in action. This one is in England. He maintains law and order  because remember  there's no teacher around. Girl  The total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons    SM  Australia Girl     giving it a net positive or negative electrical charge. The net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons. SM  A decade ahead of her time. So SOLEs  I think we need a curriculum of big questions. You already heard about that. You know what that means. There was a time when Stone Age men and women used to sit and look up at the sky and say   What are those twinkling lights   They built the first curriculum  but we've lost sight of those wondrous questions. We've brought it down to the tangent of an angle. But that's not sexy enough. The way you would put it to a nine year old is to say   If a meteorite was coming to hit the Earth  how would you figure out if it was going to or not   And if he says   Well  what  how   you say   There's a magic word. It's called the tangent of an angle   and leave him alone. He'll figure it out. So here are a couple of images from SOLEs. I've tried incredible  incredible questions     When did the world begin  How will it end     to nine year olds. This one is about what happens to the air we breathe. This is done by children without the help of any teacher. The teacher only raises the question  and then stands back and admires the answer. So what's my wish  My wish is that we design the future of learning. We don't want to be spare parts for a great human computer  do we  So we need to design a future for learning. And I've got to    hang on  I've got to get this wording exactly right  because  you know  it's very important. My wish is to help design a future of learning by supporting children all over the world to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together. Help me build this school. It will be called the School in the Cloud. It will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures driven by the big questions which their mediators put in. The way I want to do this is to build a facility where I can study this. It's a facility which is practically unmanned. There's only one granny who manages health and safety. The rest of it's from the cloud. The lights are turned on and off by the cloud  etc.  etc.  everything's done from the cloud. But I want you for another purpose. You can do Self Organized Learning Environments at home  in the school  outside of school  in clubs. It's very easy to do. There's a great document produced by TED which tells you how to do it. If you would please  please do it across all five continents and send me the data  then I'll put it all together  move it into the School of Clouds  and create the future of learning. That's my wish. And just one last thing. I'll take you to the top of the Himalayas. At        feet  where the air is thin  I once built two Hole in the Wall computers  and the children flocked there. And there was this little girl who was following me around. And I said to her   You know  I want to give a computer to everybody  every child. I don't know  what should I do   And I was trying to take a picture of her quietly. She suddenly raised her hand like this  and said to me   Get on with it.  I think it was good advice. I'll follow her advice. I'll stop talking. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you very much. Wow.  Applause  Well  I was introduced as the former Governor of Michigan  but actually I'm a scientist. All right  a political scientist  it doesn't really count  but my laboratory was the laboratory of democracy that is Michigan  and  like any good scientist  I was experimenting with policy about what would achieve the greatest good for the greatest number. But there were three problems  three enigmas that I could not solve  and I want to share with you those problems  but most importantly  I think I figured out a proposal for a solution. The first problem that not just Michigan  but every state  faces is  how do you create good jobs in America in a global economy  So let me share with you some empirical data from my lab. I was elected in      and  at the end of my first year in office in       I got a call from one of my staff members  who said   Gov  we have a big problem. We have a little tiny community called Greenville  Michigan  population        and they are about to lose their major employer  which is a refrigerator factory that's operated by Electrolux.  And I said   Well  how many people work at Electrolux   And he said         of the       people in Greenville.  So it is a one company town. And Electrolux was going to go to Mexico. So I said   Forget that. I'm the new Governor. We can fix this. We're going to go to Greenville with my whole cabinet and we will just make Electrolux an offer they can't refuse.  So I brought my whole cabinet  and we met with all of the pooh bahs of little Greenville    the mayor  the city manager  the head of the community college    and we basically emptied our pockets and put all of our chips on the table  incentives  you name it  to convince Electrolux to stay  and as we made our pile of chips  we slid them across the table to the management of Electrolux. And in the pile were things like zero taxes for    years  or that we'd help to build a new factory for the company  we'd help to finance it. The UAW  who represented the workers  said they would offer unprecedented concessions  sacrifices to just keep those jobs in Greenville. So the management of Electrolux took our pile  our list of incentives  and they went outside the room for    minutes  and they came back in and they said   Wow  this is the most generous any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here. But there's nothing you can do to compensate for the fact that we can pay   .   an hour in Juarez  Mexico. So we're leaving.  And they did. And when they did  it was like a nuclear bomb went off in little Greenville. In fact  they did implode the factory. That's a guy that is walking on his last day of work. And on the month that the last refrigerator rolled off the assembly line  the employees of Electrolux in Greenville  Michigan  had a gathering for themselves that they called the last supper. It was in a big pavilion in Greenville  an indoor pavilion  and I went to it because I was so frustrated as Governor that I couldn't stop the outflow of these jobs  and I wanted to grieve with them  and as I went into the room   there's thousands of people there. It was a just big thing. People were eating boxed lunches on roundtop tables  and there was a sad band playing music  or a band playing sad music  probably both.  Laughter  And this guy comes up to me  and he's got tattoos and his ponytail and his baseball cap on  and he had his two daughters with him  and he said   Gov  these are my two daughters.  He said   I'm    years old  and I have worked at this factory for    years. I went from high school to factory. My father worked at this factory   he said.  My grandfather worked at this factory. All I know is how to make refrigerators.  And he looked at his daughters  and he puts his hand on his chest  and he says   So  Gov  tell me  who is ever going to hire me  Who is ever going to hire me   And that was asked not just by that guy but by everyone in the pavilion  and frankly  by every worker at one of the        factories that closed in the first decade of this century. Enigma number one  How do you create jobs in America in a global economy  Number two  very quickly  How do you solve global climate change when we don't even have a national energy policy in this country and when gridlock in Congress seems to be the norm  In fact  there was a poll that was done recently and the pollster compared Congress's approval ratings to a number of other unpleasant things  and it was found  in fact  that Congress's approval rating is worse than cockroaches  lice  Nickelback the band  root canals and Donald Trump.  Laughter  But wait  the good news is it's at least better than meth labs and gonorrhea.  Laughter  We got a problem  folks. So it got me thinking  what is it  What in the laboratory that I see out there  the laboratories of democracy  what has happened  What policy prescriptions have happened that actually cause changes to occur and that have been accepted in a bipartisan way  So if I asked you  for example  what was the Obama Administration policy that caused massive changes across the country  what would you say  You might say Obamacare  except for those were not voluntary changes. As we know  only half the states have opted in. We might say the Recovery Act  but those didn't require policy changes. The thing that caused massive policy changes to occur was Race to the Top for education. Why  The government put a   .  billion pot and said to the governors across the country  compete for it. Forty eight governors competed  convincing    state legislatures to essentially raise standards for high schoolers so that they all take a college prep curriculum. Forty eight states opted in  creating a national  education  policy from the bottom up. So I thought  well  why can't we do something like that and create a clean energy jobs race to the top  Because after all  if you look at the context   .  trillion dollars has been invested in the past eight years from the private sector globally  and every dollar represents a job  and where are those jobs going  Well  they're going to places that have policy  like China. In fact  I was in China to see what they were doing  and they were putting on a dog and pony show for the group that I was with  and I was standing in the back of the room during one of the demonstrations and standing next to one of the Chinese officials  and we were watching  and he says   So  Gov  when do you think the U.S. is going to get national energy policy   And I said   Oh my God    Congress  gridlock  who knows   And this is what he did  he goes  he says   Take your time.  Because they see our passivity as their opportunity. So what if we decided to create a challenge to the governors of the country  and the price to entry into this competition used the same amount that the bipartisan group approved in Congress for the Race to the Top for education   .  billion  which sounds like a lot  but actually it's less than one tenth of one percent of federal spending. It's a rounding error on the federal side. But price to entry into that competition would be  you could just  say  use the President's goal. He wants Congress to adopt a clean energy standard of    percent by       in other words  that you'd have to get    percent of your energy from clean sources by the year     . Why not ask all of the states to do that instead  And imagine what might happen  because every region has something to offer. You might take states like Iowa and Ohio    two very important political states  by the way    those two governors  and they would say  we're going to lead the nation in producing the wind turbines and the wind energy. You might say the solar states  the sun belt  we're going to be the states that produce solar energy for the country  and maybe Jerry Brown says   Well  I'm going to create an industry cluster in California to be able to produce the solar panels so that we're not buying them from China but we're buying them from the U.S.  In fact  every region of the country could do this. You see  you've got solar and wind opportunity all across the nation. In fact  if you look just at the upper and northern states in the West  they could do geothermal  or you could look at Texas and say  we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid. In the middle eastern states which have access to forests and to agricultural waste  they might say  we're going to lead the nation in biofuels. In the upper northeast  we're going to lead the nation in energy efficiency solutions. Along the eastern seaboard  we're going to lead the nation in offshore wind. You might look at Michigan and say  we're going to lead the nation in producing the guts for the electric vehicle  like the lithium ion battery. Every region has something to offer  and if you created a competition  it respects the states and it respects federalism. It's opt in. You might even get Texas and South Carolina  who didn't opt into the education Race to the Top  you might even get them to opt in. Why  Because Republican and Democratic governors love to cut ribbons. We want to bring jobs. I'm just saying. And it fosters innovation at the state level in these laboratories of democracy. Now  any of you who are watching anything about politics lately might say   Okay  great idea  but really  Congress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table  They can't agree to anything.  So you could wait and go through Congress  although you should be very impatient. Or  you renegades  we could go around Congress. Go around Congress. What if we created a private sector challenge to the governors  What if several of the high net worth companies and individuals who are here at TED decided that they would create  band together  just a couple of them  and create a national competition to the governors to have a race to the top and see how the governors respond  What if it all started here at TED  What if you were here when we figured out how to crack the code to create good paying jobs in America     Applause     and get national energy policy and we created a national energy strategy from the bottom up  Because  dear TEDsters  if you are impatient like I am  you know that our economic competitors  our other nations  are in the game and are eating us for lunch. And we can get in the game or not. We can be at the table or we can be on the table. And I don't know about you  but I prefer to dine. Thank you all so much.  Applause
