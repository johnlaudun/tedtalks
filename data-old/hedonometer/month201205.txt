America's public energy conversation boils down to this question  Would you rather die of A  oil wars  or B  climate change  or C  nuclear holocaust  or D  all of the above  Oh  I missed one  or E  none of the above  That's the one we're not normally offered. What if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing  Could we have fuel without fear  Could we reinvent fire  You see  fire made us human  fossil fuels made us modern. But now we need a new fire that makes us safe  secure  healthy and durable. Let's see how. Four fifths of the world's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo. Those fossil fuels have built our civilization. They've created our wealth. They've enriched the lives of billions. But they also have rising costs to our security  economy  health and environment that are starting to erode  if not outweigh their benefits. So we need a new fire. And switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity  each of which puts two fifths of the fossil carbon in the air. But they're really quite distinct. Less than one percent of our electricity is made from oil    although almost half is made from coal. Their uses are quite concentrated. Three fourths of our oil fuel is transportation. Three fourths of our electricity powers buildings. And the rest of both runs factories. So very efficient vehicles  buildings and factories save oil and coal  and also natural gas that can displace both of them. But today's energy system is not just inefficient  it is also disconnected  aging  dirty and insecure. So it needs refurbishment. By      though  it could become efficient  connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos  factories and buildings all relying on a modern  secure and resilient electricity system. We can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by      and use one third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply. This could cost  by       five trillion dollars less in net present value  that is expressed as a lump sum today  than business as usual    assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero    a conservatively low estimate. Yet this cheaper energy system could support     percent bigger U.S. economy all without needing oil or coal  or for that matter nuclear energy. Moreover  this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of Congress and no new federal taxes  mandate subsidies or laws and running Washington gridlock. Let me say that again. I'm going to tell you how to get the United States completely off oil and coal  five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of Congress led by business for profit. In other words  we're going to use our most effective institutions    private enterprise co evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions. And whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security  or environmental stewardship and climate protection and public health  reinventing fire makes sense and makes money. General Eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies. So in reinventing fire  we integrated all four sectors that use energy    transportation  buildings  industry and electricity    and we integrated four kinds of innovation  not just technology and policy  but also design and business strategy. Those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts  especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities. Oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day  plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs  raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP. Our mobility fuel goes three fifths to automobiles. So let's start by making autos oil free. Two thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight. And every unit of energy you save at the wheels  by taking out weight or drag  saves seven units in the tank  because you don't have to waste six units getting the energy to the wheels. Unfortunately  over the past quarter century  epidemic obesity has made our two ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have. But today  ultralight  ultrastrong materials  like carbon fiber composites  can make dramatic weight savings snowball and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build. Lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them  so their engines get smaller. Indeed  that sort of vehicle fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells also get smaller and lighter and cheaper. So sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today  while the driving cost  even from the start  is very much lower. So these innovations together can transform automakers from wringing tiny savings out of Victorian engine and seal stamping technologies to the steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other    namely ultralight materials  making them into structures and electric propulsion. The sales can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary feebates  that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on inefficient ones. And just in the first two years the biggest of Europe's five feebate programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency. The resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers. Of course  computers and electronics are now America's biggest industry  while typewriter makers have vanished. So vehicle fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next    years  but then also make electrification affordable  and that displaces the rest of the oil. America could lead this next automotive revolution. Currently the leader is Germany. Last year  Volkswagen announced that by next year they'll be producing this carbon fiber plugin hybrid getting     miles a gallon. Also last year  BMW announced this carbon fiber electric car  they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries. And they said   We do not intend to be a typewriter maker.  Audi claimed it's going to beat them both by a year. Seven years ago  an even faster and cheaper American manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part  which doubles as a carbon cap. In one minute    and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is. Don't worry about dropping it  it's tougher than titanium. Tom Friedman actually whacked it as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it. But such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance. They can save four fifths of the capital needed to make autos. They can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to    times as much crash energy per pound as steel. If we made all of our autos this way  it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half Saudi Arabias  or half an OPEC  by drilling in the Detroit formation  a very prospective play. And all those mega barrels under Detroit cost an average of    bucks a barrel. They are all American  carbon free and inexhaustible. The same physics and the same business logic also apply to big vehicles. In the five years ending with       Walmart saved    percent of the fuel per ton mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design. But just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two thirds. And combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes  now on the drawing board  can save close to a trillion dollars. Also today's military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military R D has given us the Internet  the Global Positioning System and the jet engine and microchip industries. As we design and build vehicles better  we can also use them smarter by harnessing four powerful techniques for eliminating needless driving. Instead of just seeing the travel grow  we can use innovative pricing  charging for road infrastructure by the mile  not by the gallon. We can use some smart IT to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride sharing. We can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be  so they don't need to go somewhere else. And we can use smart IT to make traffic free flowing. Together  those things can give us the same or better access with    to    percent less driving  saving another  .  trillion dollars  plus  .  trillion dollars from using trucks more productively. So    years hence  when you add it all up  a far more mobile U.S. economy can use no oil. Saving or displacing barrels for    bucks rather than buying them for over a hundred  adds up to a    trillion net saving counting all the hidden costs at zero. So to get mobility without oil  to phase out the oil  we can get efficient and then switch fuels. Those     to     mile per gallon equivalent autos can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells  electricity and advanced biofuels. The trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels. The trucks could even use natural gas. But no vehicles will need oil. And the most biofuel we might need  just three million barrels a day  can be made two thirds from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate. Our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call  institutional acupuncture.  We figure out where the business logic is congested and not flowing properly  we stick little needles in it to get it flowing  working with partners like Ford and Walmart and the Pentagon. And the long transition is already well under way. In fact  three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil  not in supply  but in demand. And Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peak around     . In other words  oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices. But the electrified vehicles don't need to burden the electricity grid. Rather  when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids  they're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage that help the grid integrate varying solar and wind power. So the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately. And they also converge the oil story with our second big story  saving electricity and then making it differently. And those twin revolutions in electricity will bring to that sector more numerous and profound and diverse disruptions than any other sector  because we've got   st century technology and speed colliding head on with   th and   th century institutions  rules and cultures. Changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it. Most of it now is wasted and the technologies for saving it keep improving faster than we're installing them. So the unbought efficiency resource keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper. But as efficiency in buildings and industry starts to grow faster than the economy  America's electricity use could actually shrink  even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos. And we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends. Over the next    years  buildings  which use three quarters of the electricity  can triple or quadruple their energy productivity  saving  .  trillion dollars  net present value  with a    percent internal rate of return or in English  the savings are worth four times what they cost. And industry can accelerate too  doubling its energy productivity with a    percent internal rate of return. The key is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings. That is  it can give you expanding returns  not diminishing returns. That is how our      retrofit is saving over two fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building    remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site into super windows that pass light  but reflect heat. plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third. And then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved    million dollars of capital cost  which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years. Integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry. Dow's billion dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars. But industry as a whole has another half trillion dollars of energy still to save. For example  three fifths of the world's electricity runs motors. Half of that runs pumps and fans. And those can all be made more efficient  and the motors that turn them can have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating    improvements  paying back in about a year. But first we ought to be capturing bigger  cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks. For example  pumps  the biggest use of motors  move liquid through pipes. But a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least    percent less energy  not by getting better pumps  but just by replacing long  thin  crooked pipes with fat  short  straight pipes. This is not about new technology  it's just rearranging our metal furniture. Of course  it also shrinks the pumping equipment and its capital costs. So what do such savings mean for the electricity that is three fifths used in motors  Well  from the coal burned at the power plant through all these compounding losses  only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe as flow. But now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards  and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves    units of fuel cost  pollution and what Hunter Lovins calls  global weirding  back at the power plant. And of course  as you go back upstream  the components get smaller and therefore cheaper. Our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than    billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns    everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries. Typically our retrofit designs save about    to    percent of the energy and pay back in a few years  while the new facility designs save    to    odd percent with generally lower capital cost. Now needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity  chiefly renewables. China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost. In fact  these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart. And Germany now has more solar workers than America has steel workers. Already in about    states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill. Such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company. And this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee jeebees and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams. Renewables are no longer a fringe activity. For each of the past four years half of the world's new generating capacity has been renewable  mainly lately in developing countries. In       renewables other than big hydro  particularly wind and solar cells  got     billion dollars of private investment  and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding    billion watts in that one year. That happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year    a number that goes up    or    percent a year. In contrast  the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity and the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk. In fact in this country  no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital  despite seven years of     plus percent subsidies. So how else could we replace the coal fired power plants  Well efficiency and gas can displace them all at just below their operating cost and  combined with renewables  can displace them more than    times at less than their replacement cost. But we only need to replace them once. We're often told though that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on  because they're       whereas wind and solar power are variable  and hence supposedly unreliable. Actually no generator is     . They all break. And when a big plant goes down  you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds  often for weeks or months  often without warning. That is exactly why we've designed the grid to back up failed plants with working plants. And in exactly the same way  the grid can handle wind and solar power's forecastable variations. Hourly simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they're forecasted  integrated and diversified by both type and location. And that's true both for continental areas like the U.S. or Europe and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid. That is how  for example  four German states in      were    to    percent wind powered. Portugal was    percent renewable powered  Denmark   . And it's how all of Europe can shift to renewable electricity. In America  our aging  dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by     . And whatever we replace it with is going to cost about the same  about six trillion dollars at present value    whether we buy more of what we've got or new nuclear and so called clean coal  or renewables that are more or less centralized. But those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks  around national security  fuel  water  finance  technology  climate and health. For example  our over centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or a terrorist attack. But that blackout risk disappears  and all of the other risks are best managed  with distributed renewables organized into local micro grids that normally interconnect  but can stand alone at need. That is  they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly. That approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting for its own power supply. They think they need that  how about the rest of us that they're defending  We want our stuff to work too. At about the same cost as business as usual  this would maximize national security  customer choice  entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation. Together  efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector. Traditionally utilities build a lot of giant coal and nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables. And those utilities were rewarded  as they still are in    states  for selling you more electricity. However  especially where regulators are now instead rewarding cutting your bills  the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency  demand response  cogeneration  renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no bulk electricity storage. So our energy future is not fate  but choice  and that choice is very flexible. In       for example  government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP could never go down. And I heretically suggested it could go down several fold. Well that's what's actually happened so far. It's fallen by half. But with today's much better technologies  more mature delivery channels and integrative design  we can do far more and even cheaper. So to solve the energy problem  we just needed to enlarge it. And the results may at first seem incredible  but as Marshall McLuhan said   Only puny secrets need protection. Big discoveries are protected by public incredulity.  Now combine the electricity and oil revolutions  both driven by modern efficiency  and you get the really big story  reinventing fire  where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by       saving   trillion dollars  growing the economy  .  fold  strengthening out national security  oh  and by the way  by getting rid of the oil and coal  reducing the fossil carbon emissions by    to    percent. Now if you like any of those outcomes  you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important. So focusing on outcomes  not motives  can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to America's energy challenge. This also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges    climate change  nuclear proliferation  energy insecurity  energy poverty    all of which make us less safe. Now our team at RMI helps smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives  with some more hatching. Of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there too. Former oil man Maurice Strong said   Not all the fossils are in the fuel.  But as Edgar Woolard  who used to chair Dupont  reminds us   Companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem because   he said   they simply won't be around long term.  I've described not just a once in a civilization business opportunity  but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species. We humans are inventing a new fire  not dug from below  but flowing from above  not scarce  but bountiful  not local  but everywhere  not transient  but permanent  not costly  but free. And but for a little transitional tail of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure  this new fire is flameless. Efficiently used  it really can do our work without working our undoing. Each of you owns a piece of that    trillion prize. And our new book  Reinventing Fire  describes how you can capture it. So with the conversation just begun at ReinventingFire.com  let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other  with everyone around you  to help make the world richer  fairer  cooler and safer by together reinventing fire. Thank you. Usually I like working in my shop  but when it's raining and the driveway outside turns into a river  then I just love it. And I'll cut some wood and drill some holes and watch the water  and maybe I'll have to walk around and look for washers. You have no idea how much time I spend. This is the  Double Raindrop.  Of all my sculptures  it's the most talkative. It adds together the interference pattern from two raindrops that land near each other. Instead of expanding circles  they're expanding hexagons. All the sculptures move by mechanical means. Do you see how there's three peaks to the yellow sine wave  Right here I'm adding a sine wave with four peaks and turning it on. Eight hundred two liter soda bottles    oh yea. Four hundred aluminum cans. Tule is a reed that's native to California  and the best thing about working with it is that it smells just delicious. A single drop of rain increasing amplitude. The spiral eddy that trails a paddle on a rafting trip. This adds together four different waves. And here I'm going to pull out the double wavelengths and increase the single. The mechanism that drives it has nine motors and about       pulleys. Four hundred and forty five strings in a three dimensional weave. Transferred to a larger scale    actually a lot larger  with a lot of help           bicycle reflectors    a    day install.  Connected  is a collaboration with choreographer Gideon Obarzanek. Strings attached to dancers. This is very early rehearsal footage  but the finished work's on tour and is actually coming through L.A. in a couple weeks. A pair of helices and    wooden slats. Take your finger and draw this line. Summer  fall  winter  spring  noon  dusk  dark  dawn. Have you ever seen those stratus clouds that go in parallel stripes across the sky  Did you know that's a continuous sheet of cloud that's dipping in and out of the condensation layer  What if every seemingly isolated object was actually just where the continuous wave of that object poked through into our world  The Earth is neither flat nor round. It's wavy. It sounds good  but I'll bet you know in your gut that it's not the whole truth  and I'll tell you why. I have a two year old daughter who's the best thing ever. And I'm just going to come out and say it  My daughter is not a wave. And you might say   Surely  Rueben  if you took even just the slightest step back  the cycles of hunger and eating  waking and sleeping  laughing and crying would emerge as pattern.  But I would say   If I did that  too much would be lost.  This tension between the need to look deeper and the beauty and immediacy of the world  where if you even try to look deeper you've already missed what you're looking for  this tension is what makes the sculptures move. And for me  the path between these two extremes takes the shape of a wave. Let me show you one more. Thank you very much. Thanks. Thanks. June Cohen  Looking at each of your sculptures  they evoke so many different images. Some of them are like the wind and some are like waves  and sometimes they look alive and sometimes they seem like math. Is there an actual inspiration behind each one  Are you thinking of something physical or somthing tangible as you design it  RM  Well some of them definitely have a direct observation    like literally two raindrops falling  and just watching that pattern is so stunning. And then just trying to figure out how to make that using stuff. I like working with my hands. There's nothing better than cutting a piece of wood and trying to make it move. JC  And does it ever change  Do you think you're designing one thing  and then when it's produced it looks like something else  RM  The  Double Raindrop  I worked on for nine months  and when I finally turned it on  I actually hated it. The very moment I turned it on  I hated it. It was like a really deep down gut reaction  and I wanted to throw it out. And I happened to have a friend who was over  and he said   Why don't you just wait.  And I waited  and the next day I liked it a bit better  the next day I liked it a bit better  and now I really love it. And so I guess  one  the gut reactions a little bit wrong sometimes  and two  it does not look like as expected. JC  The relationship evolves over time. Well thank you so much. That was a gorgeous treat for us. RM  Thanks.  JC  Thank you  Reuben.  I don't know why  but I'm continually amazed to think that two and a half billion of us around the world are connected to each other through the Internet and that at any point in time more than    percent of the world's population can go online to learn  to create and to share. And the amount of time each of us is spending doing all of this is also continuing to go grow. A recent study showed that the young generation alone is spending over eight hours a day online. As the parent of a nine year old girl  that number seems awfully low. But just as the Internet has opened up the world for each and every one of us  it has also opened up each and every one of us to the world. And increasingly  the price we're being asked to pay for all of this connectedness is our privacy. Today  what many of us would love to believe is that the Internet is a private place  it's not. And with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen  we are like Hansel and Gretel leaving breadcrumbs of our personal information everywhere we travel through the digital woods. We are leaving our birthdays  our places of residence  our interests and preferences  our relationships  our financial histories  and on and on it goes. Now don't get me wrong  I'm not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing. In fact  when I know the data that's being shared and I'm asked explicitly for my consent  I want some sites to understand my habits. It helps them suggest books for me to read or movies for my family to watch or friends for us to connect with. But when I don't know and when I haven't been asked  that's when the problem arises. It's a phenomenon on the Internet today called behavioral tracking  and it is very big business. In fact  there's an entire industry formed around following us through the digital woods and compiling a profile on each of us. And when all of that data is held  they can do almost whatever they want with it. This is an area today that has very few regulations and even fewer rules. Except for some of the recent announcements here in the United States and in Europe  it's an area of consumer protection that's almost entirely naked. So let me expose this lurking industry a little bit further. The visualization you see forming behind me is called Collusion and it's an experimental browser add on that you can install in your Firefox browser that helps you see where your Web data is going and who's tracking you. The red dots you see up there are sites that are behavioral tracking that I have not navigated to  but are following me. The blue dots are the sites that I've actually navigated directly to. And the gray dots are sites that are also tracking me  but I have no idea who they are. All of them are connected  as you can see  to form a picture of me on the Web. And this is my profile. So let me go from an example to something very specific and personal. I installed Collusion in my own laptop two weeks ago and I let it follow me around for what was a pretty typical day. Now like most of you  I actually start my day going online and checking email. I then go to a news site  look for some headlines. And in this particular case I happened to like one of them on the merits of music literacy in schools and I shared it over a social network. Our daughter then joined us at the breakfast table  and I asked her   Is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school   And she  of course  naturally as a nine year old  looked at me and said quizzically   What's literacy   So I sent her online  of course  to look it up. Now let me stop here. We are not even two bites into breakfast and there are already nearly    sites that are tracking me. I have navigated to a total of four. So let me fast forward through the rest of my day. I go to work  I check email  I log onto a few more social sites  I blog  I check more news reports  I share some of those news reports  I go look at some videos  pretty typical day    in this case  actually fairly pedantic    and at the end of the day  as my day winds down  look at my profile. The red dots have exploded. The gray dots have grown exponentially. All in all  there's over     sites that are now tracking my personal information  most all of them without my consent. I look at this picture and it freaks me out. This is nothing. I am being stalked across the Web. And why is this happening  Pretty simple    it's huge business. The revenue of the top handful of companies in this space is over    billion dollars today. And as adults  we're certainly not alone. At the same time I installed my own Collusion profile  I installed one for my daughter. And on one single Saturday morning  over two hours on the Internet  here's her Collusion profile. This is a nine year old girl navigating to principally children's sites. I move from this  from freaked out to enraged. This is no longer me being a tech pioneer or a privacy advocate  this is me being a parent. Imagine in the physical world if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook and recorded their every movement. I can tell you  there isn't a person in this room that would sit idly by. We'd take action. It may not be good action  but we would take action. We can't sit idly by here either. This is happening today. Privacy is not an option  and it shouldn't be the price we accept for just getting on the Internet. Our voices matter and our actions matter even more. Today we've launched Collusion. You can download it  install it in Firefox  to see who is tracking you across the Web and following you through the digital woods. Going forward  all of our voices need to be heard. Because what we don't know can actually hurt us. Because the memory of the Internet is forever. We are being watched. It's now time for us to watch the watchers. Thank you. What you have here is an electronic cigarette. It's something that's  since it was invented a year or two ago  has given me untold happiness. A little bit of it  I think  is the nicotine  but there's something much bigger than that. Which is ever since  in the U.K.  they banned smoking in public places  I've never enjoyed a drinks party ever again. And the reason  I only worked out just the other day  which is when you go to a drinks party and you stand up and you hold a glass of red wine and you talk endlessly to people  you don't actually want to spend all the time talking. It's really  really tiring. Sometimes you just want to stand there silently  alone with your thoughts. Sometimes you just want to stand in the corner and stare out of the window. Now the problem is  when you can't smoke  if you stand and stare out of the window on your own  you're an antisocial  friendless idiot. If you stand and stare out of the window on your own with a cigarette  you're a fucking philosopher. So the power of reframing things cannot be overstated. What we have is exactly the same thing  the same activity  but one of them makes you feel great and the other one  with just a small change of posture  makes you feel terrible. And I think one of the problems with classical economics is it's absolutely preoccupied with reality. And reality isn't a particularly good guide to human happiness. Why  for example  are pensioners much happier than the young unemployed  Both of them  after all  are in exactly the same stage of life. You both have too much time on your hands and not much money. But pensioners are reportedly very  very happy  whereas the unemployed are extraordinarily unhappy and depressed. The reason  I think  is that the pensioners believe they've chosen to be pensioners  whereas the young unemployed feel it's been thrust upon them. In England the upper middle classes have actually solved this problem perfectly  because they've re branded unemployment. If you're an upper middle class English person  you call unemployment  a year off.  And that's because having a son who's unemployed in Manchester is really quite embarrassing  but having a son who's unemployed in Thailand is really viewed as quite an accomplishment. But actually the power to re brand things    to understand that actually our experiences  costs  things don't actually much depend on what they really are  but on how we view them    I genuinely think can't be overstated. There's an experiment I think Daniel Pink refers to where you put two dogs in a box and the box has an electric floor. Every now and then an electric shock is applied to the floor  which pains the dogs. The only difference is one of the dogs has a small button in its half of the box. And when it nuzzles the button  the electric shock stops. The other dog doesn't have the button. It's exposed to exactly the same level of pain as the dog in the first box  but it has no control over the circumstances. Generally the first dog can be relatively content. The second dog lapses into complete depression. The circumstances of our lives may actually matter less to our happiness than the sense of control we feel over our lives. It's an interesting question. We ask the question    the whole debate in the Western world is about the level of taxation. But I think there's another debate to be asked  which is the level of control we have over our tax money. That what costs us    pounds in one context can be a curse. What costs us    pounds in a different context we may actually welcome. You know  pay        pounds in tax toward health and you're merely feeling a mug. Pay        pounds to endow a hospital ward and you're called a philanthropist. I'm probably in the wrong country to talk about willingness to pay tax. So I'll give you one in return. How you frame things really matters. Do you call it the bailout of Greece or the bailout of a load of stupid banks which lent to Greece  Because they are actually the same thing. What you call them actually affects how you react to them  viscerally and morally. I think psychological value is great to be absolutely honest. One of my great friends  a professor called Nick Chater  who's the Professor of Decision Sciences in London  believes that we should spend far less time looking into humanity's hidden depths and spend much more time exploring the hidden shallows. I think that's true actually. I think impressions have an insane effect on what we think and what we do. But what we don't have is a really good model of human psychology. At least pre Kahneman perhaps  we didn't have a really good model of human psychology to put alongside models of engineering  of neoclassical economics. So people who believed in psychological solutions didn't have a model. We didn't have a framework. This is what Warren Buffett's business partner Charlie Munger calls  a latticework on which to hang your ideas.  Engineers  economists  classical economists all had a very  very robust existing latticework on which practically every idea could be hung. We merely have a collection of random individual insights without an overall model. And what that means is that in looking at solutions  we've probably given too much priority to what I call technical engineering solutions  Newtonian solutions  and not nearly enough to the psychological ones. You know my example of the Eurostar. Six million pounds spent to reduce the journey time between Paris and London by about    minutes. For  .   percent of this money you could have put WiFi on the trains  which wouldn't have reduced the duration of the journey  but would have improved its enjoyment and its usefullness far more. For maybe    percent of the money  you could have paid all of the world's top male and female supermodels to walk up and down the train handing out free Chateau Petrus to all the passengers. You'd still have five  million  pounds in change  and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down. Why were we not given the chance to solve that problem psychologically  I think it's because there's an imbalance  an asymmetry  in the way we treat creative  emotionally driven psychological ideas versus the way we treat rational  numerical  spreadsheet driven ideas. If you're a creative person  I think quite rightly  you have to share all your ideas for approval with people much more rational than you. You have to go in and you have to have a cost benefit analysis  a feasibility study  an ROI study and so forth. And I think that's probably right. But this does not apply the other way around. People who have an existing framework  an economic framework  an engineering framework  feel that actually logic is its own answer. What they don't say is   Well the numbers all seem to add up  but before I present this idea  I'll go and show it to some really crazy people to see if they can come up with something better.  And so we  artificially I think  prioritize what I'd call mechanistic ideas over psychological ideas. An example of a great psychological idea  The single best improvement in passenger satisfaction on the London Underground per pound spent came when they didn't add any extra trains nor change the frequency of the trains  they put dot matrix display board on the platforms. Because the nature of a wait is not just dependent on its numerical quality  its duration  but on the level of uncertainty you experience during that wait. Waiting seven minutes for a train with a countdown clock is less frustrating and irritating than waiting four minutes  knuckle biting going   When's this train going to damn well arrive   Here's a beautiful example of a psychological solution deployed in Korea. Red traffic lights have a countdown delay. It's proven to reduce the accident rate in experiments. Why  Because road rage  impatience and general irritation are massively reduced when you can actually see the time you have to wait. In China  not really understanding the principle behind this  they applied the same principle to green traffic lights. Which isn't a great idea. You're     yards away  you realize you've got five seconds to go  you floor it. The Koreans  very assiduously  did test both. The accident rate goes down when you apply this to red traffic lights  it goes up when you apply it to green traffic lights. This is all I'm asking for really in human decision making  is the consideration of these three things. I'm not asking for the complete primacy of one over the other. I'm merely saying that when you solve problems  you should look at all three of these equally and you should seek as far as possible to find solutions which sit in the sweet spot in the middle. If you actually look at a great business  you'll nearly always see all of these three things coming into play. Really  really successful businesses    Google is great  great technological success  but it's also based on a very good psychological insight  People believe something that only does one thing is better at that thing than something that does that thing and something else. It's an innate thing called goal dilution. Ayelet Fishbach has written a paper about this. Everybody else at the time of Google  more or less  was trying to be a portal. Yes  there's a search function  but you also have weather  sports scores  bits of news. Google understood that if you're just a search engine  people assume you're a very  very good search engine. All of you know this actually from when you go in to buy a television. And in the shabbier end of the row of flat screen TVs you can see are these rather despised things called combined TV and DVD players. And we have no knowledge whatsoever of the quality of those things  but we look at a combined TV and DVD player and we go   Uck. It's probably a bit of a crap telly and a bit rubbish as a DVD player.  So we walk out of the shops with one of each. Google is as much a psychological success as it is a technological one. I propose that we can use psychology to solve problems that we didn't even realize were problems at all. This is my suggestion for getting people to finish their course of antibiotics. Don't give them    white pills. Give them    white pills and six blue ones and tell them to take the white pills first and then take the blue ones. It's called chunking. The likelihood that people will get to the end is much greater when there is a milestone somewhere in the middle. One of the great mistakes  I think  of economics is it fails to understand that what something is  whether it's retirement  unemployment  cost  is a function  not only of its amount  but also its meaning. This is a toll crossing in Britain. Quite often queues happen at the tolls. Sometimes you get very  very severe queues. You could apply the same principle actually  if you like  to the security lanes in airports. What would happen if you could actually pay twice as much money to cross the bridge  but go through a lane that's an express lane  It's not an unreasonable thing to do. It's an economically efficient thing to do. Time means more to some people than others. If you're waiting trying to get to a job interview  you'd patently pay a couple of pounds more to go through the fast lane. If you're on the way to visit your mother in law  you'd probably prefer to stay on the left. The only problem is if you introduce this economically efficient solution  people hate it. Because they think you're deliberately creating delays at the bridge in order to maximize your revenue  and  Why on earth should I pay to subsidize your imcompetence   On the other hand  change the frame slightly and create charitable yield management  so the extra money you get goes not to the bridge company  it goes to charity  and the mental willingness to pay completely changes. You have a relatively economically efficient solution  but one that actually meets with public approval and even a small degree of affection  rather than being seen as bastardy. So where economists make the fundamental mistake is they think that money is money. Actually my pain experienced in paying five pounds is not just proportionate to the amount  but where I think that money is going. And I think understanding that could revolutionize tax policy. It could revolutionize the public services. It could really change things quite significantly. Here's a guy you all need to study. He's an Austrian school economist who was first active in the first half of the   th century in Vienna. What was interesting about the Austrian school is they actually grew up alongside Freud. And so they're predominantly interested in psychology. They believed that there was a discipline called praxeology  which is a prior discipline to the study of economics. Praxeology is the study of human choice  action and decision making. I think they're right. I think the danger we have in today's world is we have the study of economics considers itself to be a prior discipline to the study of human psychology. But as Charlie Munger says   If economics isn't behavioral  I don't know what the hell is.  Von Mises  interestingly  believes economics is just a subset of psychology. I think he just refers to economics as  the study of human praxeology under conditions of scarcity.  But von Mises  among many other things  I think uses an analogy which is probably the best justification and explanation for the value of marketing  the value of perceived value and the fact that we should actually treat it as being absolutely equivalent to any other kind of value. We tend to  all of us    even those of us who work in marketing    to think of value in two ways. There's the real value  which is when you make something in a factory and provide a service  and then there's a kind of dubious value  which you create by changing the way people look at things. Von Mises completely rejected this distinction. And he used this following analogy. He referred actually to strange economists called the French Physiocrats  who believed that the only true value was what you extracted from the land. So if you're a shepherd or a quarryman or a farmer  you created true value. If however  you bought some wool from the shepherd and charged a premium for converting it into a hat  you weren't actually creating value  you were exploiting the shepherd. Now von Mises said that modern economists make exactly the same mistake with regard to advertising and marketing. He says  if you run a restaurant  there is no healthy distinction to be made between the value you create by cooking the food and the value you create by sweeping the floor. One of them creates  perhaps  the primary product    the thing we think we're paying for    the other one creates a context within which we can enjoy and appreciate that product. And the idea that one of them should actually have priority over the other is fundamentally wrong. Try this quick thought experiment. Imagine a restaurant that serves Michelin starred food  but actually where the restaurant smells of sewage and there's human feces on the floor. The best thing you can do there to create value is not actually to improve the food still further  it's to get rid of the smell and clean up the floor. And it's vital we understand this. If that seems like some strange  abstruse thing  in the U.K.  the post office had a    percent success rate at delivering first class mail the next day. They decided this wasn't good enough and they wanted to get it up to   . The effort to do that almost broke the organization. If at the same time you'd gone and asked people   What percentage of first class mail arrives the next day   the average answer  or the modal answer would have been    to    percent. Now if your perception is much worse than your reality  what on earth are you doing trying to change the reality  That's like trying to improve the food in a restaurant that stinks. What you need to do is first of all tell people that    percent of mail gets there the next day  first class mail. That's pretty good. I would argue  in Britain there's a much better frame of reference  which is to tell people that more first class mail arrives the next day in the U.K. than in Germany. Because generally in Britain if you want to make us happy about something  just tell us we do it better than the Germans. Choose your frame of reference and the perceived value and therefore the actual value is completely tranformed. It has to be said of the Germans that the Germans and the French are doing a brilliant job of creating a united Europe. The only thing they don't expect is they're uniting Europe through a shared mild hatred of the French and Germans. But I'm British  that's the way we like it. What you also notice is that in any case our perception is leaky. We can't tell the difference between the quality of the food and the environment in which we consume it. All of you will have seen this phenomenon if you have your car washed or valeted. When you drive away  your car feels as if it drives better. And the reason for this  unless my car valet mysteriously is changing the oil and performing work which I'm not paying him for and I'm unaware of  is because perception is in any case leaky. Analgesics that are branded are more effective at reducing pain than analgesics that are not branded. I don't just mean through reported pain reduction  actual measured pain reduction. And so perception actually is leaky in any case. So if you do something that's perceptually bad in one respect  you can damage the other. Thank you very much. Four years ago today  exactly  actually  I started a fashion blog called Style Rookie. Last September of       I started an online magazine for teenage girls called Rookiemag.com. My name's Tavi Gevinson  and the title of my talk is  Still Figuring It Out   and the MS Paint quality of my slides was a total creative decision in keeping with today's theme  and has nothing to do with my inability to use PowerPoint.  Laughter  So I edit this site for teenage girls. I'm a feminist. I am kind of a pop culture nerd  and I think a lot about what makes a strong female character  and  you know  movies and TV shows  these things have influence. My own website. So I think the question of what makes a strong female character often goes misinterpreted  and instead we get these two dimensional superwomen who maybe have one quality that's played up a lot  like a Catwoman type  or she plays her sexuality up a lot  and it's seen as power. But they're not strong characters who happen to be female. They're completely flat  and they're basically cardboard characters. The problem with this is that then people expect women to be that easy to understand  and women are mad at themselves for not being that simple  when  in actuality  women are complicated  women are multifaceted    not because women are crazy  but because people are crazy  and women happen to be people.  Laughter  So the flaws are the key. I'm not the first person to say this. What makes a strong female character is a character who has weaknesses  who has flaws  who is maybe not immediately likable  but eventually relatable. I don't like to acknowledge a problem without also acknowledging those who work to fix it  so just wanted to acknowledge shows like  Mad Men   movies like  Bridesmaids   whose female characters or protagonists are complex  multifaceted. Lena Dunham  who's on here  her show on HBO that premiers next month   Girls   she said she wanted to start it because she felt that every woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions  and that feels accurate for all people  but you don't see women represented like that as much. Congrats  guys.  Laughs  But I don't feel that   I still feel that there are some types of women who are not represented that way  and one group that we'll focus on today are teens  because I think teenagers are especially contradictory and still figuring it out  and in the '  s there was  Freaks and Geeks  and  My So Called Life   and their characters  Lindsay Weir and Angela Chase  I mean  the whole premise of the shows were just them trying to figure themselves out  basically  but those shows only lasted a season each  and I haven't really seen anything like that on TV since. So this is a scientific diagram of my brain    Laughter    around the time when I was  when I started watching those TV shows. I was ending middle school  starting high school    I'm a sophomore now   and I was trying to reconcile all of these differences that you're told you can't be when you're growing up as a girl. You can't be smart and pretty. You can't be a feminist who's also interested in fashion. You can't care about clothes if it's not for the sake of what other people  usually men  will think of you. So I was trying to figure all that out  and I felt a little confused  and I said so on my blog  and I said that I wanted to start a website for teenage girls that was not this kind of one dimensional strong character empowerment thing because I think one thing that can be very alienating about a misconception of feminism is that girls then think that to be a feminist  they have to live up to being perfectly consistent in your beliefs  never being insecure  never having doubts  having all of the answers. And this is not true  and  actually  reconciling all the contradictions I was feeling became easier once I understood that feminism was not a rulebook but a discussion  a conversation  a process  and this is a spread from a zine that I made last year when I    I mean  I think I've let myself go a bit on the illustration front since. But  yeah. So I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publication for teenage girls and ask people to submit their writing  their photography  whatever  to be a member of our staff. I got about       emails. My editorial director and I went through them and put together a staff of people  and we launched last September. And this is an excerpt from my first editor's letter  where I say that Rookie  we don't have all the answers  we're still figuring it out too  but the point is not to give girls the answers  and not even give them permission to find the answers themselves  but hopefully inspire them to understand that they can give themselves that permission  they can ask their own questions  find their own answers  all of that  and Rookie  I think we've been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be figured out. So I'm not saying   Be like us   and  We're perfect role models   because we're not  but we just want to help represent girls in a way that shows those different dimensions. I mean  we have articles called  On Taking Yourself Seriously  How to Not Care What People Think of You   but we also have articles like  oops    I'm figuring it out  Ha ha.  Laughter  If you use that  you can get away with anything. We also have articles called  How to Look Like You Weren't Just Crying in Less than Five Minutes.  So all of that being said  I still really appreciate those characters in movies and articles like that on our site  that aren't just about being totally powerful  maybe finding your acceptance with yourself and self esteem and your flaws and how you accept those. So what I you to take away from my talk  the lesson of all of this  is to just be Stevie Nicks. Like  that's all you have to do.  Laughter  Because my favorite thing about her  other than  like  everything  is that she is very    has always been unapologetically present on stage  and unapologetic about her flaws and about reconciling all of her contradictory feelings and she makes you listen to them and think about them  and yeah  so please be Stevie Nicks. Thank you.  Applause  Well when I was asked to do this TEDTalk  I was really chuckled  because  you see  my father's name was Ted  and much of my life  especially my musical life  is really a talk that I'm still having with him  or the part of me that he continues to be. Now Ted was a New Yorker  an all around theater guy  and he was a self taught illustrator and musician. He didn't read a note  and he was profoundly hearing impaired. Yet  he was my greatest teacher. Because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids  his understanding of music was profound. And for him  it wasn't so much the way the music goes as about what it witnesses and where it can take you. And he did a painting of this experience  which he called  In the Realm of Music.  Now Ted entered this realm every day by improvising in a sort of Tin Pan Alley style like this. But he was tough when it came to music. He said   There are only two things that matter in music  what and how. And the thing about classical music  that what and how  it's inexhaustible.  That was his passion for the music. Both my parents really loved it. They didn't know all that much about it  but they gave me the opportunity to discover it together with them. And I think inspired by that memory  it's been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as I can  sort of pass it on through whatever means. And how people get this music  how it comes into their lives  really fascinates me. One day in New York  I was on the street and I saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants. And a tough  slouchy kid got up to bat  and he took a swing and really connected. And he watched the ball fly for a second  and then he went   Dah dadaratatatah. Brah dada dadadadah.  And he ran around the bases. And I thought  go figure. How did this piece of   th century Austrian aristocratic entertainment turn into the victory crow of this New York kid  How was that passed on  How did he get to hear Mozart  Well when it comes to classical music  there's an awful lot to pass on  much more than Mozart  Beethoven or Tchiakovsky. Because classical music is an unbroken living tradition that goes back over       years. And every one of those years has had something unique and powerful to say to us about what it's like to be alive. Now the raw material of it  of course  is just the music of everyday life. It's all the anthems and dance crazes and ballads and marches. But what classical music does is to distill all of these musics down  to condense them to their absolute essence  and from that essence create a new language  a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly about who we really are. It's a language that's still evolving. Now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of  like concertos and symphonies  but even the most ambitious masterpiece can have as its central mission to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment    like this one from the Beethoven Violin Concerto. It's so simple  so evocative. So many emotions seem to be inside of it. Yet  of course  like all music  it's essentially not about anything. It's just a design of pitches and silence and time. And the pitches  the notes  as you know  are just vibrations. They're locations in the spectrum of sound. And whether we call them     per second  A  or        B flat    trust me  that's right    they're just phenomena. But the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena is complex and emotional and not totally understood. And the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries  as have our preferences for them. So for example  in the   th century  people liked pieces that ended like this. And in the   th century  it was more like this. And in the   st century ... Now your   st century ears are quite happy with this last chord  even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you or sent some of you running from the room. And the reason you like it is because you've inherited  whether you knew it or not  centuries worth of changes in musical theory  practice and fashion. And in classical music we can follow these changes very  very accurately because of the music's powerful silent partner  the way it's been passed on  notation. Now the impulse to notate  or  more exactly I should say  encode music has been with us for a very long time. In     B.C.  a man named Sekulos wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gravestone in the notational system of the Greeks. And a thousand years later  this impulse to notate took an entirely different form. And you can see how this happened in these excerpts from the Christmas mass  Puer Natus est nobis    For Us is Born.  In the   th century  little squiggles were used just to indicate the general shape of the tune. And in the   th century  a line was drawn  like a musical horizon line  to better pinpoint the pitch's location. And then in the   th century  more lines and new shapes of notes locked in the concept of the tune exactly  and that led to the kind of notation we have today. Well notation not only passed the music on  notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely  because it enabled the musicians to imagine music on a much vaster scale. Now inspired moves of improvisation could be recorded  saved  considered  prioritized  made into intricate designs. And from this moment  classical music became what it most essentially is  a dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature  instinct and intelligence. And there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition. Now an improviser senses and plays the next cool move  but a composer is considering all possible moves  testing them out  prioritizing them out  until he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent design of ultimate and enduring coolness. Now some of the greatest composers  like Bach  were combinations of these two things. Bach was like a great improviser with a mind of a chess master. Mozart was the same way. But every musician strikes a different balance between faith and reason  instinct and intelligence. And every musical era had different priorities of these things  different things to pass on  different 'whats' and 'hows'. So in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big 'what' was to praise God. And by the     s  music was being written that tried to mirror God's mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky. The 'how' was a style called polyphony  music of many independently moving voices that suggested the way the planets seemed to move in Ptolemy's geocentric universe. This was truly the music of the spheres. This is the kind of music that Leonardo DaVinci would have known. And perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity meant that something new had to happen    a radical new move  which in      is what did happen. Ah  wicked  cruel fate  Ah  baleful stars  Ah  avaricious heaven  MTT  This  of course  was the birth of opera  and its development put music on a radical new course. The what now was not to mirror the mind of God  but to follow the emotion turbulence of man. And the how was harmony  stacking up the pitches to form chords. And the chords  it turned out  were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions. And the basic chords were the ones we still have with us  the triads  either the major one  which we think is happy  or the minor one  which we perceive as sad. But what's the actual difference between these two chords  It's just these two notes in the middle. It's either E natural  and     vibrations per second  or E flat  at    . So the big difference between human happiness and sadness     freakin' vibrations. So you can see in a system like this there was enormous subtle potential of representing human emotions. And in fact  as man began to understand more his complex and ambivalent nature  harmony grew more complex to reflect it. Turns out it was capable of expressing emotions beyond the ability of words. Now with all this possibility  classical music really took off. It's the time in which the big forms began to arise. And the effects of technology began to be felt also  because printing put music  the scores  the codebooks of music  into the hands of performers everywhere. And new and improved instruments made the age of the virtuoso possible. This is when those big forms arose    the symphonies  the sonatas  the concertos. And in these big architectures of time  composers like Beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime. A piece like Beethoven's Fifth basically witnessing how it was possible for him to go from sorrow and anger  over the course of a half an hour  step by exacting step of his route  to the moment when he could make it across to joy. And it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues  like gripping ones of culture  such as nationalism or quest for freedom or the frontiers of sensuality. But whatever direction the music took  one thing until recently was always the same  and that was when the musicians stopped playing  the music stopped. Now this moment so fascinates me. I find it such a profound one. What happens when the music stops  Where does it go  What's left  What sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance  Is it a melody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude  And how might that change their lives  To me this is the intimate  personal side of music. It's the passing on part. It's the 'why' part of it. And to me that's the most essential of all. Mostly it's been a person to person thing  a teacher student  performer audience thing  and then around      came this new technology that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally created a new and miraculous way of passing things on  albeit an impersonal one. People could now hear music all the time  even though it wasn't necessary for them to play an instrument  read music or even go to concerts. And technology democratized music by making everything available. It spearheaded a cultural revolution in which artists like Caruso and Bessie Smith were on the same footing. And technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes  using computers and synthesizers to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity beyond the means of performers and audiences. At the same time technology  by taking over the role that notation had always played  shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side. The culture in which we live now is awash with music of improvisation that's been sliced  diced  layered and  God knows  distributed and sold. What's the long term effect of this on us or on music  Nobody knows. The question remains  What happens when the music stops  What sticks with people  Now that we have unlimited access to music  what does stick with us  Well let me show you a story of what I mean by  really sticking with us.  I was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home  and I spied a very shaky old man making his way across the room on a walker. He came over to a piano that was there  and he balanced himself and began playing something like this. And he said something like   Me ... boy ... symphony ... Beethoven.  And I suddenly got it  and I said   Friend  by any chance are you trying to play this   And he said   Yes  yes. I was a little boy. The symphony  Isaac Stern  the concerto  I heard it.  And I thought  my God  how much must this music mean to this man that he would get himself out of his bed  across the room to recover the memory of this music that  after everything else in his life is sloughing away  still means so much to him  Well  that's why I take every performance so seriously  why it matters to me so much. I never know who might be there  who might be absorbing it and what will happen to it in their life. But now I'm excited that there's more chance than ever before possible of sharing this music. That's what drives my interest in projects like the TV series  Keeping Score  with the San Francisco Symphony that looks at the backstories of music  and working with the young musicians at the New World Symphony on projects that explore the potential of the new performing arts centers for both entertainment and education. And of course  the New World Symphony led to the YouTube Symphony and projects on the internet that reach out to musicians and audiences all over the world. And the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype. There's just a role here for so many people    teachers  parents  performers    to be explorers together. Sure  the big events attract a lot of attention  but what really matters is what goes on every single day. We need your perspectives  your curiosity  your voices. And it excites me now to meet people who are hikers  chefs  code writers  taxi drivers  people I never would have guessed who loved the music and who are passing it on. You don't need to worry about knowing anything. If you're curious  if you have a capacity for wonder  if you're alive  you know all that you need to know. You can start anywhere. Ramble a bit. Follow traces. Get lost. Be surprised  amused inspired. All that 'what'  all that 'how' is out there waiting for you to discover its 'why'  to dive in and pass it on. Thank you. I love my food. And I love information. My children usually tell me that one of those passions is a little more apparent than the other. But what I want to do in the next eight minutes or so is to take you through how those passions developed  the point in my life when the two passions merged  the journey of learning that took place from that point. And one idea I want to leave you with today is what would would happen differently in your life if you saw information the way you saw food  I was born in Calcutta    a family where my father and his father before him were journalists  and they wrote magazines in the English language. That was the family business. And as a result of that  I grew up with books everywhere around the house. And I mean books everywhere around the house. And that's actually a shop in Calcutta  but it's a place where we like our books. In fact  I've got        of them now and no Kindle in sight. But growing up as a child with the books around everywhere  with people to talk to about those books  this wasn't a sort of slightly learned thing. By the time I was     I had a deep passion for books. It wasn't the only passion I had. I was a South Indian brought up in Bengal. And two of the things about Bengal  they like their savory dishes and they like their sweets. So by the time I grew up  again  I had a well established passion for food. Now I was growing up in the late '  s and early '  s  and there were a number of other passions I was also interested in  but these two were the ones that differentiated me. And then life was fine  dandy. Everything was okay  until I got to about the age of     and I went to a movie called  Short Circuit.  Oh  some of you have seen it. And apparently it's being remade right now and it's going to be coming out next year. It's the story of this experimental robot which got electrocuted and found a life. And as it ran  this thing was saying   Give me input. Give me input.  And I suddenly realized that for a robot both information as well as food were the same thing. Energy came to it in some form or shape  data came to it in some form or shape. And I began to think  I wonder what it would be like to start imagining myself as if energy and information were the two things I had as input    as if food and information were similar in some form or shape. I started doing some research then  and this was the    year journey  and started finding out that actually human beings as primates have far smaller stomachs than should be the size for our body weight and far larger brains. And as I went to research that even further  I got to a point where I discovered something called the expensive tissue hypothesis. That actually for a given body mass of a primate the metabolic rate was static. What changed was the balance of the tissues available. And two of the most expensive tissues in our human body are nervous tissue and digestive tissue. And what transpired was that people had put forward a hypothesis that was apparently coming up with some fabulous results by about     . It's a lady named Leslie Aiello. And the paper then suggested that you traded one for the other. If you wanted your brain for a particular body mass to be large  you had to live with a smaller gut. That then set me off completely to say  Okay  these two are connected. So I looked at the cultivation of information as if it were food and said  So we were hunter gathers of information. We moved from that to becoming farmers and cultivators of information. Does that really explain what we're seeing with the intellectual property battles nowadays  Because those people who were hunter gatherers in origin wanted to be free and roam and pick up information as they wanted  and those that were in the business of farming information wanted to build fences around it  create ownership and wealth and structure and settlement. So there was always going to be a tension within that. And everything I saw in the cultivation said there were huge fights amongst the foodies between the cultivators and the hunter gatherers. And this is happening here. When I moved to preparation  this same thing was true  expect that there were two schools. One group of people said you can distill your information  you can extract value  separate it and serve it up  while another group turned around and said no  no you can ferment it. You bring it all together and mash it up and the value emerges that way. The same is again true with information. But consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable. Because what I began to see then was there were so many different ways people would consume this. They'd buy it from the shop as raw ingredients. Do you cook it  Do you have it served to you  Do you go to a restaurant  The same is true every time as I started thinking about information. The analogies were getting crazy    that information had sell by dates  that people had misused information that wasn't dated properly and could really make an effect on the stock market  on corporate values  etc. And by this time I was hooked. And this is about    years into this process. And I began to start thinking of myself as we start having mash ups of fact and fiction  docu dramas  mockumentaries  whatever you call it. Are we going to reach the stage where information has a percentage for fact associated with it  We start labeling information for the fact percentage  Are we going to start looking at what happens when your information source is turned off  as a famine  Which brings me to the final element of this. Clay Shirky once stated that there is no such animal as information overload  there is only filter failure. I put it to you that information  if viewed from the point of food  is never a production issue  you never speak of food overload. Fundamentally it's a consumption issue. And we have to start thinking about how we create diets within ourselves  exercise within ourselves  to have the faculties to be able to deal with information  to have the labeling to be able to do it responsibly. In fact  when I saw  Supersize Me   I starting thinking of saying  What would happen if an individual had    days nonstop Fox News  Would there be time to be able to work with it  So you start really understanding that you can have diseases  toxins  a need to balance your diet  and once you start looking  and from that point on  everything I have done in terms of the consumption of information  the production of information  the preparation of information  I've looked at from the viewpoint of food. It has probably not helped my waistline any because I like practicing on both sides. But I'd like to leave you with just that question  If you began to think of all the information that you consume the way you think of food  what would you do differently  Thank you very much for your time. I'm a very lucky person. I've been privileged to see so much of our beautiful Earth and the people and creatures that live on it. And my passion was inspired at the age of seven  when my parents first took me to Morocco  at the edge of the Sahara Desert. Now imagine a little Brit somewhere that wasn't cold and damp like home. What an amazing experience. And it made me want to explore more. So as a filmmaker  I've been from one end of the Earth to the other trying to get the perfect shot and to capture animal behavior never seen before. And what's more  I'm really lucky  because I get to share that with millions of people worldwide. Now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step. You might think that it's quite hard to find new stories and new subjects  but new technology is changing the way we can film. It's enabling us to get fresh  new images and tell brand new stories. In Nature's Great Events  a series for the BBC that I did with David Attenborough  we wanted to do just that. Images of grizzly bears are pretty familiar. You see them all the time  you think. But there's a whole side to their lives that we hardly ever see and had never been filmed. So what we did  we went to Alaska  which is where the grizzlies rely on really high  almost inaccessible  mountain slopes for their denning. And the only way to film that is a shoot from the air. thousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep. There is nothing to eat up here  but the conditions were ideal for hibernation. Lots of snow in which to dig a den. To find food  mothers must lead their cubs down to the coast  where the snow will already be melting. But getting down can be a challenge for small cubs. These mountains are dangerous places  but ultimately the fate of these bear families  and indeed that of all bears around the North Pacific  depends on the salmon. KB  I love that shot. I always get goosebumps every time I see it. That was filmed from a helicopter using a gyro stabilized camera. And it's a wonderful bit of gear  because it's like having a flying tripod  crane and dolly all rolled into one. But technology alone isn't enough. To really get the money shots  it's down to being in the right place at the right time. And that sequence was especially difficult. The first year we got nothing. We had to go back the following year  all the way back to the remote parts of Alaska. And we hung around with a helicopter for two whole weeks. And eventually we got lucky. The cloud lifted  the wind was still  and even the bear showed up. And we managed to get that magic moment. For a filmmaker  new technology is an amazing tool  but the other thing that really  really excites me is when new species are discovered. Now  when I heard about one animal  I knew we had to get it for my next series  Untamed Americas  for National Geographic. In       a new species of bat was discovered in the cloud forests of Ecuador. And what was amazing about that discovery is that it also solved the mystery of what pollinated a unique flower. It depends solely on the bat. Now  the series hasn't even aired yet  so you're the very first to see this. See what you think. A pool of delicious nectar lies at the bottom of each flower's long flute. But how to reach it  Necessity is the mother of evolution. This two and a half inch bat has a three and a half inch tongue  the longest relative to body length of any mammal in the world. If human  he'd have a nine foot tongue. KB  What a tongue. We filmed it by cutting a tiny little hole in the base of the flower and using a camera that could slow the action by    times. So imagine how quick that thing is in real life. Now people often ask me   Where's your favorite place on the planet   And the truth is I just don't have one. There are so many wonderful places. But some locations draw you back time and time again. And one remote location    I first went there as a backpacker  I've been back several times for filming  most recently for Untamed Americas    it's the Altiplano in the high Andes of South America  and it's the most otherworldly place I know. But at        feet  it's tough. It's freezing cold  and that thin air really gets you. Sometimes it's hard to breathe  especially carrying all the heavy filming equipment. And that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover. But the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere is that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens with amazing clarity. Have a look. between Chile and Bolivia  the Andes completely change. It's called the Altiplano  or  high plains     a place of extremes and extreme contrasts. Where deserts freeze and waters boil. More like Mars than Earth  it seems just as hostile to life. The stars themselves    at        feet  the dry  thin air makes for perfect stargazing. Some of the world's astronomers have telescopes nearby. But just looking up with the naked eye  you really don't need one. KB  Thank you so much for letting me share some images of our magnificent  wonderful Earth. Thank you for letting me share that with you. I'd like to invite you to close your eyes. Imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home. I'd like you to notice the color of the door  the material that it's made out of. Now visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles. They are competing in a naked bicycle race  and they are headed straight for your front door. I need you to actually see this. They are pedaling really hard  they're sweaty  they're bouncing around a lot. And they crash straight into the front door of your home. Bicycles fly everywhere  wheels roll past you  spokes end up in awkward places. Step over the threshold of your door into your foyer  your hallway  whatever's on the other side  and appreciate the quality of the light. The light is shining down on Cookie Monster. Cookie Monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse. It's a talking horse. You can practically feel his blue fur tickling your nose. You can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie that he's about to shovel into his mouth. Walk past him. Walk past him into your living room. In your living room  in full imaginative broadband  picture Britney Spears. She is scantily clad  she's dancing on your coffee table  and she's singing  Hit Me Baby One More Time.  And then  follow me into your kitchen. In your kitchen  the floor has been paved over with a yellow brick road  and out of your oven are coming towards you Dorothy  the Tin Man  the Scarecrow and the Lion from  The Wizard of Oz   hand in hand  skipping straight towards you. Okay. Open your eyes. I want to tell you about a very bizarre contest that is held every spring in New York City. It's called the United States Memory Championship. And I had gone to cover this contest a few years back as a science journalist  expecting  I guess  that this was going to be like the Superbowl of savants. This was a bunch of guys and a few ladies  widely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep. They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers  looking at them just once. They were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers. They were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes. They were competing to see who could memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest. I was like  this is unbelievable. These people must be freaks of nature. And I started talking to a few of the competitors. This is a guy called Ed Cook  who had come over from England  where he had one of the best trained memories. And I said to him   Ed  when did you realize that you were a savant   And Ed was like   I'm not a savant. In fact  I have just an average memory. Everybody who competes in this contest will tell you that they have just an average memory. We've all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory using a set of ancient techniques  techniques invented       years ago in Greece  the same techniques that Cicero had used to memorize his speeches  that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books.  And I said   Whoa. How come I never heard of this before   And we were standing outside the competition hall  and Ed  who is a wonderful  brilliant  but somewhat eccentric English guy  says to me   Josh  you're an American journalist. Do you know Britney Spears   I'm like   What  No. Why    Because I really want to teach Britney Spears how to memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards on U.S. national television. It will prove to the world that anybody can do this.  I was like   Well  I'm not Britney Spears  but maybe you could teach me. I mean  you've got to start somewhere  right   And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me. I ended up spending the better part of the next year not only training my memory  but also investigating it  trying to understand how it works  why it sometimes doesn't work  and what its potential might be. And I met a host of really interesting people. This is a guy called E.P. He's an amnesic who had  very possibly  the worst memory in the world. His memory was so bad  that he didn't even remember he had a memory problem  which is amazing. And he was this incredibly tragic figure  but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are. At the other end of the spectrum  I met this guy. This is Kim Peek  he was the basis for Dustin Hoffman's character in the movie  Rain Man.  We spent an afternoon together in the Salt Lake City Public Library memorizing phone books  which was scintillating. And I went back and I read a whole host of memory treatises  treatises written       plus years ago in Latin  in antiquity  and then later  in the Middle Ages. And I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff. One of the really interesting things that I learned is that once upon a time  this idea of having a trained  disciplined  cultivated memory was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today. Once upon a time  people invested in their memories  in laboriously furnishing their minds. Over the last few millenia  we've invented a series of technologies    from the alphabet  to the scroll  to the codex  the printing press  photography  the computer  the smartphone    that have made it progressively easier and easier for us to externalize our memories  for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity. These technologies have made our modern world possible  but they've also changed us. They've changed us culturally  and I would argue that they've changed us cognitively. Having little need to remember anymore  it sometimes seems like we've forgotten how. One of the last places on Earth where you still find people passionate about this idea of a trained  disciplined  cultivated memory  is at this totally singular memory contest. It's actually not that singular  there are contests held all over the world. And I was fascinated  I wanted to know how do these guys do it. A few years back a group of researchers at University College London brought a bunch of memory champions into the lab. They wanted to know  Do these guys have brains that are somehow structurally  anatomically different from the rest of ours  The answer was no. Are they smarter than the rest of us  They gave them a bunch of cognitive tests  and the answer was  not really. There was  however  one really interesting and telling difference between the brains of the memory champions and the control subjects that they were comparing them to. When they put these guys in an fMRI machine  scanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers and people's faces and pictures of snowflakes  they found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain than everyone else. Of note  they were using  or they seemed to be using  a part of the brain that's involved in spatial memory and navigation. Why  And is there something that the rest of us can learn from this  The sport of competitive memorizing is driven by a kind of arms race where  every year  somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly  and then the rest of the field has to play catch up. This is my friend Ben Pridmore  three time world memory champion. On his desk in front of him are    shuffled packs of playing cards that he is about to try to memorize in one hour  using a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered. He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of       random binary digits in half an hour. Yeah. And while there are a whole host of ways of remembering stuff in these competitions  everything  all of the techniques that are being used  ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as  elaborative encoding.  And it's well illustrated by a nifty paradox known as the Baker baker paradox  which goes like this  If I tell two people to remember the same word  if I say to you   Remember that there is a guy named Baker.  That's his name. And I say to you   Remember that there is a guy who is a baker.  Okay  And I come back to you at some point later on  and I say   Do you remember that word that I told you a while back  Do you remember what it was   The person who was told his name is Baker is less likely to remember the same word than the person was told his job is a baker. Same word  different amount of remembering  that's weird. What's going on here  Well  the name Baker doesn't actually mean anything to you. It is entirely untethered from all of the other memories floating around in your skull. But the common noun  baker     we know bakers. Bakers wear funny white hats. Bakers have flour on their hands. Bakers smell good when they come home from work. Maybe we even know a baker. And when we first hear that word  we start putting these associational hooks into it  that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date. The entire art of what is going on in these memory contests  and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life  is figuring out ways to transform capital B Bakers into lower case B bakers    to take information that is lacking in context  in significance  in meaning  and transform it in some way  so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things that you have in your mind. One of the more elaborate techniques for doing this dates back       years to Ancient Greece. It came to be known as the memory palace. The story behind its creation goes like this  There was a poet called Simonides  who was attending a banquet. He was actually the hired entertainment  because back then  if you wanted to throw a really slamming party  you didn't hire a D.J.  you hired a poet. And he stands up  delivers his poem from memory  walks out the door  and at the moment he does  the banquet hall collapses. Kills everybody inside. It doesn't just kill everybody  it mangles the bodies beyond all recognition. Nobody can say who was inside  nobody can say where they were sitting. The bodies can't be properly buried. It's one tragedy compounding another. Simonides  standing outside  the sole survivor amid the wreckage  closes his eyes and has this realization  which is that in his mind's eye  he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting. And he takes the relatives by the hand  and guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage. What Simonides figured out at that moment  is something that I think we all kind of intuitively know  which is that  as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers  and word for word instructions from our colleagues  we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories. If I asked you to recount the first    words of the story that I just told you about Simonides  chances are you would have a tough time with it. But  I would wager that if I asked you to recall who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse in your foyer right now  you would be able to see that. The idea behind the memory palace is to create this imagined edifice in your mind's eye  and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember    the crazier  weirder  more bizarre  funnier  raunchier  stinkier the image is  the more unforgettable it's likely to be. This is advice that goes back       plus years to the earliest Latin memory treatises. So how does this work  Let's say that you've been invited to TED center stage to give a speech  and you want to do it from memory  and you want to do it the way that Cicero would have done it  if he had been invited to TEDxRome       years ago. What you might do is picture yourself at the front door of your house. And you'd come up with some sort of crazy  ridiculous  unforgettable image  to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this totally bizarre contest. And then you'd go inside your house  and you would see an image of Cookie Monster on top of Mister Ed. And that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend Ed Cook. And then you'd see an image of Britney Spears to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell. And you'd go into your kitchen  and the fourth topic you were going to talk about was this strange journey that you went on for a year  and you'd have some friends to help you remember that. This is how Roman orators memorized their speeches    not word for word  which is just going to screw you up  but topic for topic. In fact  the phrase  topic sentence     that comes from the Greek word  topos   which means  place.  That's a vestige of when people used to think about oratory and rhetoric in these sorts of spatial terms. The phrase  in the first place   that's like  in the first place of your memory palace.  I thought this was just fascinating  and I got really into it. And I went to a few more of these memory contests  and I had this notion that I might write something longer about this subculture of competitive memorizers. But there was a problem. The problem was that a memory contest is a pathologically boring event. Truly  it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the SATs    I mean  the most dramatic it gets is when somebody starts massaging their temples. And I'm a journalist  I need something to write about. I know that there's incredible stuff happening in these people's minds  but I don't have access to it. And I realized  if I was going to tell this story  I needed to walk in their shoes a little bit. And so I started trying to spend    or    minutes every morning  before I sat down with my New York Times  just trying to remember something. Maybe it was a poem  maybe it was names from an old yearbook that I bought at a flea market. And I found that this was shockingly fun. I never would have expected that. It was fun because this is actually not about training your memory. What you're doing  is you're trying to get better and better at creating  at dreaming up  these utterly ludicrous  raunchy  hilarious  and hopefully unforgettable images in your mind's eye. And I got pretty into it. This is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer's training kit. It's a pair of earmuffs and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over except for two small pinholes  because distraction is the competitive memorizer's greatest enemy. I ended up coming back to that same contest that I had covered a year earlier  and I had this notion that I might enter it  sort of as an experiment in participatory journalism. It'd make  I thought  maybe a nice epilogue to all my research. Problem was  the experiment went haywire. I won the contest    which really wasn't supposed to happen. Now  it is nice to be able to memorize speeches and phone numbers and shopping lists  but it's actually kind of beside the point. These are just tricks. They work because they're based on some pretty basic principles about how our brains work. And you don't have to be building memory palaces or memorizing packs of playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works. We often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an innate gift  but that is not the case. Great memories are learned. At the most basic level  we remember when we pay attention. We remember when we are deeply engaged. We remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience  and figure out why it is meaningful to us  why it is significant  why it's colorful  when we're able to transform it in some way that makes sense in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds  when we're able to transform Bakers into bakers. The memory palace  these memory techniques    they're just shortcuts. In fact  they're not even really shortcuts. They work because they make you work. They force a kind of depth of processing  a kind of mindfulness  that most of us don't normally walk around exercising. But there actually are no shortcuts. This is how stuff is made memorable. And I think if there's one thing that I want to leave you with  it's what E.P.  the amnesic who couldn't even remember he had a memory problem  left me with  which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories. How much are we willing to lose from our already short lives  by losing ourselves in our Blackberries  our iPhones  by not paying attention to the human being across from us who is talking with us  by being so lazy that we're not willing to process deeply  I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capacities latent in all of us. But if you want to live a memorable life  you have to be the kind of person who remembers to remember. Thank you. So what I want to try to do is tell a quick story about a     page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it. But to start it probably helps to have an understanding of what a     page actually is. The     page is that. It's that broken experience on the Web. It's effectively the default page when you ask a website for something and it can't find it. And it serves you the     page. It's inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it. And I just want you to think a little bit about  remember for yourself  it's annoying when you hit this thing. Because it's the feeling of a broken relationship. And that's where it's actually also interesting to think about  where does     come from  It's from a family of errors actually    a whole set of relationship errors  which  when I started digging into them  it looks almost like a checklist for a sex therapist or a couples counselor. You sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey. Yes. But these things are everywhere. They're on sites big  they're on sites small. This is a global experience. What a     page tells you is that you fell through the cracks. And that's not a good experience when you're used to experiences like this. You can get on your Kinect and you can have unicorns dancing and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone. A     page is not what you're looking for. You get that  and it's like a slap in the face. Trying to think about how a     felt  and it would be like if you went to Starbucks and there's the guy behind the counter and you're over there and there's no skim milk. And you say   Hey  could you bring the skim milk   And they walk out from behind the counter and they've got no pants on. And you're like   Oh  I didn't want to see that.  That's the     feeling. I mean  I've heard about that. So where this comes into play and why this is important is I head up a technology incubator  and we had eight startups sitting around there. And those startups are focused on what they are  not what they're not  until one day Athletepath  which is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes  found this video. Crowd  Whoa  Renny Gleeson  You just ... no  he's not okay. They took that video and they embedded it in their     page and it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place. Because finally there was a page that actually felt like what it felt like to hit a    . So this turned into a contest. Dailypath that offers inspiration put inspiration on their     page. Stayhound  which helps you find pet sitters through your social network  commiserated with your pet. Each one of them found this. It turned into a    hour contest. At      the next day  we gave out      in cash. And what they learned was that those little things  done right  actually matter  and that well designed moments can build brands. So you take a look out in the real world  and the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself. You can type in an URL and put in a     and these will pop. This is one that commiserates with you. This is one that blames you. This is one that I loved. This is an error page  but what if this error page was also an opportunity  So it was a moment in time where all of these startups had to sit and think and got really excited about what they could be. Because back to the whole relationship issue  what they figured out through this exercise was that a simple mistake can tell me what you're not  or it can remind me of why I should love you. Thank you. Gotcha. Mosquitos. I hate them. Don't you  That awful buzzing sound at night around your ears that drives you absolutely crazy  Knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin and suck out your blood  That's awful  right  In fact  there's only one good thing I can think of when it gets to mosquitos. When they fly into our bedroom at night  they prefer to bite my wife. But that's fascinating  right  Why does she receive more bites than I do  And the answer is smell  the smell of her body. And since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin that either attract or repel mosquitos  some of us are just more attractive than others. So my wife smells nicer than I do  or I just stink more than she does. Either way  mosquitos find us in the dark by sniffing us out. They smell us. And during my Ph.D  I wanted to know exactly what chemicals from our skin mosquitos used  African malarial mosquitos use to track us down at night. And there's a whole range of compounds that they do use. And this was not going to be an easy task. And therefore  we set up various experiments. Why did we set up these experiments  Because half the world's population runs the risk of contracting a killer disease like malaria through a simple mosquito bite. Every    seconds  somewhere on this planet  a child dies of malaria  and Paul Levy this morning  he was talking about the metaphor of the     crashing into the United States. Well  in Africa  we have the equivalent of seven jumbo    s crashing every day. But perhaps if we can attract these mosquitos to traps  bait it with our smell  we may be able to stop transmission of disease. Now solving this puzzle was not an easy thing  because we produce hundreds of different chemicals on the skin  but we undertook some remarkable experiments that managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed. First  we observed that not all mosquito species bite on the same part of the body. Strange. So we set up an experiment whereby we put a naked volunteer in a large cage  and in that cage we released mosquitos to see where they were biting on the body of that person. And we found some remarkable differences. On the left here you see the bites by the Dutch malarial mosquito on this person. They had a very strong preference for biting on the face. In contrast  the African malarial mosquito had a very strong preference for biting the ankles and feet of this person  and that of course we should have known all along because they're called mosqui toes  you see   Laughter  That's right.  Applause  And so we started focusing on the smell of feet  on the smell of human feet  until we came across a remarkable statement in the literature that said that cheese smells after feet rather than the reverse. Think of it. And this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment. We tried  with a tiny little piece of Limburger cheese  which smells badly after feet  to attract African malaria mosquitos. And you know what  It worked. In fact  it worked so well that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of Limburger cheese that we're using in Tanzania and has been shown there to be two to three times more attractive to mosquitos than humans. Limburg  be proud of your cheese  as it is now used in the fight against malaria. That's the cheese  just to show you. My second story is remarkable as well. It's about man's best friend. It's about dogs. And I will show you how we can use dogs in the fight against malaria. One of the best ways of killing mosquitos is not to wait until they fly around like adults and bite people and transmit disease. It's to kill them when they're still in the water as larvae. Why  Because they are just like the CIA. In that pool of water  these larvae are concentrated. They're all together there. They are immobile. They can't escape from that water. They can't fly. And they're accessible. You can actually walk up to that pool and you can kill them there  right  So the problem that we face with this is that  throughout the landscape  all these pools of water with the larvae  they are scattered all over the place  which makes it very hard for an inspector like this to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insecticides. And last year we thought very  very hard  how can we resolve this problem  Until we realized that just like us  we have a unique smell  that mosquito larvae also have a very unique smell. And so we set up another crazy experiment  because we collected the smell of these larvae  put it on pieces of cloth  and then did something very remarkable. Here we have a bar with four holes  and we put the smell of these larvae in the left hole. Ooh  that was very quick. And then you see the dog. It's called Tweed. It's a border collie. He's examining these holes  and now he's got it already. He's going back to check the control holes again  but he's coming back to the first one  and now he's locking into that smell  which means that now we can use dogs with these inspectors to much better find the breeding sites of mosquitos in the field  and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria. This lady is Ellen van der Zweep. She's one of the best dog trainers in the world  and she believes that we can do a lot more. Since we also know that people that carry malaria parasites smell different compared to people that are uninfected  she's convinced that we can train dogs to find people that carry the parasite. That means that in a population where malaria has gone down all the way  and there's few people remaining with parasites  that the dogs can find these people  we can treat them with anti malarial drugs  and give the final blow to malaria. Man's best friend in the fight against malaria. My third story is perhaps even more remarkable  and  I should say  has never been shown to the public until today. Yeah. It's a crazy story  but I believe it's perhaps the best and ultimate revenge against mosquitos ever. In fact  people have told me that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitos. And the question of course is  what would make someone enjoy being bitten by mosquitos  And the answer I have right here in my pocket  if I get it. It's a tablet  a simple tablet  and when I take it with water  it does miracles. Thank you. Now let me show you how this works. Here in this box I have a cage with several hundred hungry female mosquitos that I'm just about to release.  Laughter  Just kidding  just kidding. What I'm going to show you is I'm gonna stick my arm into it and I will show you how quickly they will bite. Here we go. Don't worry  I do this all the time in the lab. There we go. Okay. Now  on the video  on the video here  I'm going to show you exactly the same thing  except that what I'm showing you on the video happened one hour after I took the tablet. Have a look. That doesn't work. Okay. Sorry about that. I'm sticking in my arm  I'm giving them a big juicy blood meal  I'm shaking them off  and we follow them through time to see these mosquitos get very  very sick indeed  here shown in fast motion  and three hours later what we see at the bottom of the cage is dead mosquitos  very dead mosquitos  and I'm going to say  ladies and gentlemen  we have swapped the cards with mosquitos. They don't kill us. We kill them. Now    Laughter    Maastricht  be prepared. Now think of what we can do with this. We can actually use this to contain outbreaks of mosquito born diseases  of epidemics  right  And better still  imagine what would happen if  in a very large area  everyone would take these drugs  this drug  for just three weeks. That would give us an opportunity to actually eliminate malaria as a disease. So cheese  dogs and a pill to kill mosquitos. That's the kind of out of the box science that I love doing  for the betterment of mankind  but especially for her  so that she can grow up in a world without malaria. Thank you.  Applause  I'm going to talk to you about optimism    or more precisely  the optimism bias. It's a cognitive illusion that we've been studying in my lab for the past few years  and    percent of us have it. It's our tendency to overestimate our likelihood of experiencing good events in our lives and underestimate our likelihood of experiencing bad events. So we underestimate our likelihood of suffering from cancer  being in a car accident. We overestimate our longevity  our career prospects. In short  we're more optimistic than realistic  but we are oblivious to the fact. Take marriage for example. In the Western world  divorce rates are about    percent. That means that out of five married couples  two will end up splitting their assets. But when you ask newlyweds about their own likelihood of divorce  they estimate it at zero percent. And even divorce lawyers  who should really know better  hugely underestimate their own likelihood of divorce. So it turns out that optimists are not less likely to divorce  but they are more likely to remarry. In the words of Samuel Johnson   Remarriage is the triumph of hope over experience.  So if we're married  we're more likely to have kids. And we all think our kids will be especially talented. This  by the way  is my two year old nephew  Guy. And I just want to make it absolutely clear that he's a really bad example of the optimism bias  because he is in fact uniquely talented. And I'm not alone. Out of four British people  three said that they were optimistic about the future of their own families. That's    percent. But only    percent said that they thought families in general are doing better than a few generations ago. And this is a really important point  because we're optimistic about ourselves  we're optimistic about our kids  we're optimistic about our families  but we're not so optimistic about the guy sitting next to us  and we're somewhat pessimistic about the fate of our fellow citizens and the fate of our country. But private optimism about our own personal future remains persistent. And it doesn't mean that we think things will magically turn out okay  but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so. Now I'm a scientist  I do experiments. So to show you what I mean  I'm going to do an experiment here with you. So I'm going to give you a list of abilities and characteristics  and I want you to think for each of these abilities where you stand relative to the rest of the population. The first one is getting along well with others. Who here believes they're at the bottom    percent  Okay  that's about    people out of      . Who believes they're at the top    percent  That's most of us here. Okay  now do the same for your driving ability. How interesting are you  How attractive are you  How honest are you  And finally  how modest are you  So most of us put ourselves above average on most of these abilities. Now this is statistically impossible. We can't all be better than everyone else. But if we believe we're better than the other guy  well that means that we're more likely to get that promotion  to remain married  because we're more social  more interesting. And it's a global phenomenon. The optimism bias has been observed in many different countries    in Western cultures  in non Western cultures  in females and males  in kids  in the elderly. It's quite widespread. But the question is  is it good for us  So some people say no. Some people say the secret to happiness is low expectations. I think the logic goes something like this  If we don't expect greatness  if we don't expect to find love and be healthy and successful  well we're not going to be disappointed when these things don't happen. And if we're not disappointed when good things don't happen  and we're pleasantly surprised when they do  we will be happy. So it's a very good theory  but it turns out to be wrong for three reasons. Number one  Whatever happens  whether you succeed or you fail  people with high expectations always feel better. Because how we feel when we get dumped or win employee of the month depends on how we interpret that event. The psychologists Margaret Marshall and John Brown studied students with high and low expectations. And they found that when people with high expectations succeed  they attribute that success to their own traits.  I'm a genius  therefore I got an A  therefore I'll get an A again and again in the future.  When they failed  it wasn't because they were dumb  but because the exam just happened to be unfair. Next time they will do better. People with low expectations do the opposite. So when they failed it was because they were dumb  and when they succeeded it was because the exam just happened to be really easy. Next time reality would catch up with them. So they felt worse. Number two  Regardless of the outcome  the pure act of anticipation makes us happy. The behavioral economist George Lowenstein asked students in his university to imagine getting a passionate kiss from a celebrity  any celebrity. Then he said   How much are you willing to pay to get a kiss from a celebrity if the kiss was delivered immediately  in three hours  in    hours  in three days  in one year  in    years  He found that the students were willing to pay the most not to get a kiss immediately  but to get a kiss in three days. They were willing to pay extra in order to wait. Now they weren't willing to wait a year or    years  no one wants an aging celebrity. But three days seemed to be the optimum amount. So why is that  Well if you get the kiss now  it's over and done with. But if you get the kiss in three days  well that's three days of jittery anticipation  the thrill of the wait. The students wanted that time to imagine where is it going to happen  how is it going to happen. Anticipation made them happy. This is  by the way  why people prefer Friday to Sunday. It's a really curious fact  because Friday is a day of work and Sunday is a day of pleasure  so you'd assume that people will prefer Sunday  but they don't. It's not because they really  really like being in the office and they can't stand strolling in the park or having a lazy brunch. We know that  because when you ask people about their ultimate favorite day of the week  surprise  surprise  Saturday comes in at first  then Friday  then Sunday. People prefer Friday because Friday brings with it the anticipation of the weekend ahead  all the plans that you have. On Sunday  the only thing you can look forward to is the work week. So optimists are people who expect more kisses in their future  more strolls in the park. And that anticipation enhances their wellbeing. In fact  without the optimism bias  we would all be slightly depressed. People with mild depression  they don't have a bias when they look into the future. They're actually more realistic than healthy individuals. But individuals with severe depression  they have a pessimistic bias. So they tend to expect the future to be worse than it ends up being. So optimism changes subjective reality. The way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it. But it also changes objective reality. It acts as a self fulfilling prophecy. And that is the third reason why lowering your expectations will not make you happy. Controlled experiments have shown that optimism is not only related to success  it leads to success. Optimism leads to success in academia and sports and politics. And maybe the most surprising benefit of optimism is health. If we expect the future to be bright  stress and anxiety are reduced. So all in all  optimism has lots of benefits. But the question that was really confusing to me was  how do we maintain optimism in the face of reality  As an neuroscientist  this was especially confusing  because according to all the theories out there  when your expectations are not met  you should alter them. But this is not what we find. We asked people to come into our lab in order to try and figure out what was going on. We asked them to estimate their likelihood of experiencing different terrible events in their lives. So  for example  what is your likelihood of suffering from cancer  And then we told them the average likelihood of someone like them to suffer these misfortunes. So cancer  for example  is about    percent. And then we asked them again   How likely are you to suffer from cancer   What we wanted to know was whether people will take the information that we gave them to change their beliefs. And indeed they did    but mostly when the information we gave them was better than what they expected. So for example  if someone said   My likelihood of suffering from cancer is about    percent   and we said   Hey  good news. The average likelihood is only    percent   the next time around they would say   Well maybe my likelihood is about    percent.  So they learned quickly and efficiently. But if someone started off saying   My average likelihood of suffering from cancer is about    percent   and we said   Hey  bad news. The average likelihood is about    percent   the next time around they would say   Yep. Still think it's about    percent.  So it's not that they didn't learn at all    they did    but much  much less than when we gave them positive information about the future. And it's not that they didn't remember the numbers that we gave them  everyone remembers that the average likelihood of cancer is about    percent and the average likelihood of divorce is about    percent. But they didn't think that those numbers were related to them. What this means is that warning signs such as these may only have limited impact. Yes  smoking kills  but mostly it kills the other guy. What I wanted to know was what was going on inside the human brain that prevented us from taking these warning signs personally. But at the same time  when we hear that the housing market is hopeful  we think   Oh  my house is definitely going to double in price.  To try and figure that out  I asked the participants in the experiment to lie in a brain imaging scanner. It looks like this. And using a method called functional MRI  we were able to identify regions in the brain that were responding to positive information. One of these regions is called the left inferior frontal gyrus. So if someone said   My likelihood of suffering from cancer is    percent   and we said   Hey  good news. Average likelihood is    percent   the left inferior frontal gyrus would respond fiercely. And it didn't matter if you're an extreme optimist  a mild optimist or slightly pessimistic  everyone's left inferior frontal gyrus was functioning perfectly well  whether you're Barack Obama or Woody Allen. On the other side of the brain  the right inferior frontal gyrus was responding to bad news. And here's the thing  it wasn't doing a very good job. The more optimistic you were  the less likely this region was to respond to unexpected negative information. And if your brain is failing at integrating bad news about the future  you will constantly leave your rose tinted spectacles on. So we wanted to know  could we change this  Could we alter people's optimism bias by interfering with the brain activity in these regions  And there's a way for us to do that. This is my collaborator Ryota Kanai. And what he's doing is he's passing a small magnetic pulse through the skull of the participant in our study into their inferior frontal gyrus. And by doing that  he's interfering with the activity of this brain region for about half an hour. After that everything goes back to normal  I assure you. So let's see what happens. First of all  I'm going to show you the average amount of bias that we see. So if I was to test all of you now  this is the amount that you would learn more from good news relative to bad news. Now we interfere with the region that we found to integrate negative information in this task  and the optimism bias grew even larger. We made people more biased in the way that they process information. Then we interfered with the brain region that we found to integrate good news in this task  and the optimism bias disappeared. We were quite amazed by these results because we were able to eliminate a deep rooted bias in humans. And at this point we stopped and we asked ourselves  would we want to shatter the optimism illusion into tiny little bits  If we could do that  would we want to take people's optimism bias away  Well I've already told you about all of the benefits of the optimism bias  which probably makes you want to hold onto it for dear life. But there are  of course  pitfalls  and it would be really foolish of us to ignore them. Take for example this email I recieved from a firefighter here in California. He says   Fatality investigations for firefighters often include 'We didn't think the fire was going to do that ' even when all of the available information was there to make safe decisions.  This captain is going to use our findings on the optimism bias to try to explain to the firefighters why they think the way they do  to make them acutely aware of this very optimistic bias in humans. So unrealistic optimism can lead to risky behavior  to financial collapse  to faulty planning. The British government  for example  has acknowledged that the optimism bias can make individuals more likely to underestimate the costs and durations of projects. So they have adjusted the      Olympic budget for the optimism bias. My friend who's getting married in a few weeks has done the same for his wedding budget. And by the way  when I asked him about his own likelihood of divorce  he said he was quite sure it was zero percent. So what we would really like to do  is we would like to protect ourselves from the dangers of optimism  but at the same time remain hopeful  benefiting from the many fruits of optimism. And I believe there's a way for us to do that. The key here really is knowledge. We're not born with an innate understanding of our biases. These have to be identified by scientific investigation. But the good news is that becoming aware of the optimism bias does not shatter the illusion. It's like visual illusions  in which understanding them does not make them go away. And this is good because it means we should be able to strike a balance  to come up with plans and rules to protect ourselves from unrealistic optimism  but at the same time remain hopeful. I think this cartoon portrays it nicely. Because if you're one of these pessimistic penguins up there who just does not believe they can fly  you certainly never will. Because to make any kind of progress  we need to be able to imagine a different reality  and then we need to believe that that reality is possible. But if you are an extreme optimistic penguin who just jumps down blindly hoping for the best  you might find yourself in a bit of a mess when you hit the ground. But if you're an optimistic penguin who believes they can fly  but then adjusts a parachute to your back just in case things don't work out exactly as you had planned  you will soar like an eagle  even if you're just a penguin. Thank you. So it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language. It has generated considerable insight in physics  in biology and economics  but not that much in the humanities and in history. I think there's a belief that it's just impossible  that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind  that you cannot measure history. But I don't think that's right. I want to show you a couple of examples why. So my collaborator Erez and I were considering the following fact  that two kings separated by centuries will speak a very different language. That's a powerful historical force. So the king of England  Alfred the Great  will use a vocabulary and grammar that is quite different from the king of hip hop  Jay Z. Now it's just the way it is. Language changes over time  and it's a powerful force. So Erez and I wanted to know more about that. So we paid attention to a particular grammatical rule  past tense conjugation. So you just add  ed  to a verb at the end to signify the past.  Today I walk. Yesterday I walked.  But some verbs are irregular.  Yesterday I thought.  Now what's interesting about that is irregular verbs between Alfred and Jay Z have become more regular. Like the verb  to wed  that you see here has become regular. So Erez and I followed the fate of over     irregular verbs through    centuries of English language  and we saw that there's actually a very simple mathematical pattern that captures this complex historical change  namely  if a verb is     times more frequent than another  it regularizes    times slower. That's a piece of history  but it comes in a mathematical wrapping. Now in some cases math can even help explain  or propose explanations for  historical forces. So here Steve Pinker and I were considering the magnitude of wars during the last two centuries. There's actually a well known regularity to them where the number of wars that are     times deadlier is    times smaller. So there are    wars that are about as deadly as the Six Days War  but there's only four wars that are     times deadlier    like World War I. So what kind of historical mechanism can produce that  What's the origin of this  So Steve and I  through mathematical analysis  propose that there's actually a very simple phenomenon at the root of this  which lies in our brains. This is a very well known feature in which we perceive quantities in relative ways    quantities like the intensity of light or the loudness of a sound. For instance  committing        soldiers to the next battle sounds like a lot. It's relatively enormous if you've already committed       soldiers previously. But it doesn't sound so much  it's not relatively enough  it won't make a difference if you've already committed         soldiers previously. So you see that because of the way we perceive quantities  as the war drags on  the number of soldiers committed to it and the casualties will increase not linearly    like                           but exponentially            later         later       . And so that explains this pattern that we've seen before. So here mathematics is able to link a well known feature of the individual mind with a long term historical pattern that unfolds over centuries and across continents. So these types of examples  today there are just a few of them  but I think in the next decade they will become commonplace. The reason for that is that the historical record is becoming digitized at a very fast pace. So there's about     million books that have been written since the dawn of time. Companies like Google have digitized many of them    above    million actually. And when the stuff of history is available in digital form  it makes it possible for a mathematical analysis to very quickly and very conveniently review trends in our history and our culture. So I think in the next decade  the sciences and the humanities will come closer together to be able to answer deep questions about mankind. And I think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that. It will be able to reveal new trends in our history  sometimes to explain them  and maybe even in the future to predict what's going to happen. Thank you very much. I wanted to talk to you today about creative confidence. I'm going to start way back in the third grade at Oakdale School in Barberton  Ohio. I remember one day my best friend Brian was working on a project. He was making a horse out of the clay that our teacher kept under the sink. And at one point  one of the girls who was sitting at his table  seeing what he was doing  leaned over and said to him   That's terrible. That doesn't look anything like a horse.  And Brian's shoulders sank. And he wadded up the clay horse and he threw it back in the bin. I never saw Brian do a project like that ever again. And I wonder how often that happens. It seems like when I tell that story of Brian to my class  a lot of them want to come up after class and tell me about their similar experience  how a teacher shut them down or how a student was particularly cruel to them. And some opt out thinking of themselves as creative at that point. And I see that opting out that happens in childhood  and it moves in and becomes more ingrained  even by the time you get to adult life. So we see a lot of this. When we have a workshop or when we have clients in to work with us side by side  eventually we get to the point in the process that's fuzzy or unconventional. And eventually these bigshot executives whip out their Blackberries and they say they have to make really important phone calls  and they head for the exits. And they're just so uncomfortable. When we track them down and ask them what's going on  they say something like   I'm just not the creative type.  But we know that's not true. If they stick with the process  if they stick with it  they end up doing amazing things and they surprise themselves just how innovative they and their teams really are. So I've been looking at this fear of judgment that we have. That you don't do things  you're afraid you're going to be judged. If you don't say the right creative thing  you're going to be judged. And I had a major breakthrough when I met the psychologist Albert Bandura. I don't know if you know Albert Bandura. But if you go to Wikipedia  it says that he's the fourth most important psychologist in history    like Freud  Skinner  somebody and Bandura. Bandura's    and he still works at Stanford. And he's just a lovely guy. And so I went to see him because he has just worked on phobias for a long time  which I'm very interested in. He had developed this way  this kind of methodology  that ended up curing people in a very short amount of time. In four hours he had a huge cure rate of people who had phobias. And we talked about snakes. I don't know why we talked about snakes. We talked about snakes and fear of snakes as a phobia. And it was really enjoyable  really interesting. He told me that he'd invite the test subject in  and he'd say   You know  there's a snake in the next room and we're going to go in there.  To which  he reported  most of them replied   Hell no  I'm not going in there  certainly if there's a snake in there.  But Bandura has a step by step process that was super successful. So he'd take people to this two way mirror looking into the room where the snake was  and he'd get them comfortable with that. And then through a series of steps  he'd move them and they'd be standing in the doorway with the door open and they'd be looking in there. And he'd get them comfortable with that. And then many more steps later  baby steps  they'd be in the room  they'd have a leather glove like a welder's glove on  and they'd eventually touch the snake. And when they touched the snake everything was fine. They were cured. In fact  everything was better than fine. These people who had life long fears of snakes were saying things like   Look how beautiful that snake is.  And they were holding it in their laps. Bandura calls this process  guided mastery.  I love that term  guided mastery. And something else happened  these people who went through the process and touched the snake ended up having less anxiety about other things in their lives. They tried harder  they persevered longer  and they were more resilient in the face of failure. They just gained a new confidence. And Bandura calls that confidence self efficacy    the sense that you can change the world and that you can attain what you set out to do. Well meeting Bandura was really cathartic for me because I realized that this famous scientist had documented and scientifically validated something that we've seen happen for the last    years. That we could take people who had the fear that they weren't creative  and we could take them through a series of steps  kind of like a series of small successes  and they turn fear into familiarity  and they surprise themselves. That transformation is amazing. We see it at the d.school all the time. People from all different kinds of disciplines  they think of themselves as only analytical. And they come in and they go through the process  our process  they build confidence and now they think of themselves differently. And they're totally emotionally excited about the fact that they walk around thinking of themselves as a creative person. So I thought one of the things I'd do today is take you through and show you what this journey looks like. To me  that journey looks like Doug Dietz. Doug Dietz is a technical person. He designs medical imaging equipment  large medical imaging equipment. He's worked for GE  and he's had a fantastic career. But at one point he had a moment of crisis. He was in the hospital looking at one of his MRI machines in use when he saw a young family. There was a little girl  and that little girl was crying and was terrified. And Doug was really disappointed to learn that nearly    percent of the pediatric patients in this hospital had to be sedated in order to deal with his MRI machine. And this was really disappointing to Doug  because before this time he was proud of what he did. He was saving lives with this machine. But it really hurt him to see the fear that this machine caused in kids. About that time he was at the d.school at Stanford taking classes. He was learning about our process about design thinking  about empathy  about iterative prototyping. And he would take this new knowledge and do something quite extraordinary. He would redesign the entire experience of being scanned. And this is what he came up with. He turned it into an adventure for the kids. He painted the walls and he painted the machine  and he got the operators retrained by people who know kids  like children's museum people. And now when the kid comes  it's an experience. And they talk to them about the noise and the movement of the ship. And when they come  they say   Okay  you're going to go into the pirate ship  but be very still because we don't want the pirates to find you.  And the results were super dramatic. So from something like    percent of the kids needing to be sedated  to something like    percent of the kids needing to be sedated. And the hospital and GE were happy too. Because you didn't have to call the anesthesiologist all the time  they could put more kids through the machine in a day. So the quantitative results were great. But Doug's results that he cared about were much more qualitative. He was with one of the mothers waiting for her child to come out of the scan. And when the little girl came out of her scan  she ran up to her mother and said   Mommy  can we come back tomorrow   And so I've heard Doug tell the story many times  of his personal transformation and the breakthrough design that happened from it  but I've never really seen him tell the story of the little girl without a tear in his eye. Doug's story takes place in a hospital. I know a thing or two about hospitals. A few years ago I felt a lump on the side of my neck  and it was my turn in the MRI machine. It was cancer. It was the bad kind. I was told I had a    percent chance of survival. So while you're sitting around with the other patients in your pajamas and everybody's pale and thin and you're waiting for your turn to get the gamma rays  you think of a lot of things. Mostly you think about  Am I going to survive  And I thought a lot about  What was my daughter's life going to be like without me  But you think about other things. I thought a lot about  What was I put on Earth to do  What was my calling  What should I do  And I was lucky because I had lots of options. We'd been working in health and wellness  and K through     and the Developing World. And so there were lots of projects that I could work on. But I decided and I committed to at this point to the thing I most wanted to do    was to help as many people as possible regain the creative confidence they lost along their way. And if I was going to survive  that's what I wanted to do. I survived  just so you know. I really believe that when people gain this confidence    and we see it all the time at the d.school and at IDEO    they actually start working on the things that are really important in their lives. We see people quit what they're doing and go in new directions. We see them come up with more interesting  and just more  ideas so they can choose from better ideas. And they just make better decisions. So I know at TED you're supposed to have a change the world kind of thing. Everybody has a change the world thing. If there is one for me  this is it. To help this happen. So I hope you'll join me on my quest    you as thought leaders. It would be really great if you didn't let people divide the world into the creatives and the non creatives  like it's some God given thing  and to have people realize that they're naturally creative. And those natural people should let their ideas fly. That they should achieve what Bandura calls self efficacy  that you can do what you set out to do  and that you can reach a place of creative confidence and touch the snake. Thank you. This is a thousand year old drawing of the brain. It's a diagram of the visual system. And some things look very familiar today. Two eyes at the bottom  optic nerve flowing out from the back. There's a very large nose that doesn't seem to be connected to anything in particular. And if we compare this to more recent representations of the visual system  you'll see that things have gotten substantially more complicated over the intervening thousand years. And that's because today we can see what's inside of the brain  rather than just looking at its overall shape. Imagine you wanted to understand how a computer works and all you could see was a keyboard  a mouse  a screen. You really would be kind of out of luck. You want to be able to open it up  crack it open  look at the wiring inside. And up until a little more than a century ago  nobody was able to do that with the brain. Nobody had had a glimpse of the brain's wiring. And that's because if you take a brain out of the skull and you cut a thin slice of it  put it under even a very powerful microscope  there's nothing there. It's gray  formless. There's no structure. It won't tell you anything. And this all changed in the late   th century. Suddenly  new chemical stains for brain tissue were developed and they gave us our first glimpses at brain wiring. The computer was cracked open. So what really launched modern neuroscience was a stain called the Golgi stain. And it works in a very particular way. Instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue  it somehow only stains about one percent of them. It clears the forest  reveals the trees inside. If everything had been labeled  nothing would have been visible. So somehow it shows what's there. Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal  who's widely considered the father of modern neuroscience  applied this Golgi stain  which yields data which looks like this  and really gave us the modern notion of the nerve cell  the neuron. And if you're thinking of the brain as a computer  this is the transistor. And very quickly Cajal realized that neurons don't operate alone  but rather make connections with others that form circuits just like in a computer. Today  a century later  when researchers want to visualize neurons  they light them up from the inside rather than darkening them. And there's several ways of doing this. But one of the most popular ones involves green fluorescent protein. Now green fluorescent protein  which oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent jellyfish  is very useful. Because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell  that cell will glow green    or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein  you get a cell to glow many different colors. And so coming back to the brain  this is from a genetically engineered mouse called  Brainbow.  And it's so called  of course  because all of these neurons are glowing different colors. Now sometimes neuroscientists need to identify individual molecular components of neurons  molecules  rather than the entire cell. And there's several ways of doing this  but one of the most popular ones involves using antibodies. And you're familiar  of course  with antibodies as the henchmen of the immune system. But it turns out that they're so useful to the immune system because they can recognize specific molecules  like  for example  the coat protein of a virus that's invading the body. And researchers have used this fact in order to recognize specific molecules inside of the brain  recognize specific substructures of the cell and identify them individually. And a lot of the images I've been showing you here are very beautiful  but they're also very powerful. They have great explanatory power. This  for example  is an antibody staining against serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain. And you've heard of serotonin  of course  in the context of diseases like depression and anxiety. You've heard of SSRIs  which are drugs that are used to treat these diseases. And in order to understand how serotonin works  it's critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is. And antibody stainings like this one can be used to understand that sort of question. I'd like to leave you with the following thought  Green fluorescent protein and antibodies are both totally natural products at the get go. They were evolved by nature in order to get a jellyfish to glow green for whatever reason  or in order to detect the coat protein of an invading virus  for example. And only much later did scientists come onto the scene and say   Hey  these are tools  these are functions that we could use in our own research tool palette.  And instead of applying feeble human minds to designing these tools from scratch  there were these ready made solutions right out there in nature developed and refined steadily for millions of years by the greatest engineer of all. Thank you. Twelve years ago  I was in the street writing my name to say   I exist.  Then I went to taking photos of people to paste them on the street to say   They exist.  From the suburbs of Paris to the wall of Israel and Palestine  the rooftops of Kenya to the favelas of Rio  paper and glue    as easy as that. I asked a question last year  Can art change the world  Well let me tell you  in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year  because the Arab Spring is still spreading  the Eurozone has collapsed ... what else  The Occupy movement found a voice  and I still have to speak English constantly. So there has been a lot of change. So when I had my TED wish last year  I said  look  I'm going to switch my concept. You are going to take the photos. You're going to send them to me. I'm going to print them and send them back to you. Then you're going to paste them where it makes sense for you to place your own statement. This is Inside Out. One hundred thousand posters have been printed this year. Those are the kind of posters  let me show you. And we keep sending more every day. This is the size. Just a regular piece of paper with a little bit of ink on it. This one was from Haiti. When I launched my wish last year  hundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us. But I say it has to be under the conditions I've always worked  no credit  no logos  no sponsoring. A week later  a handful of people were there ready to rock and empower the people on the ground who wanted to change the world. These are the people I want to talk about to you today. Two weeks after my speech  in Tunisia  hundreds of portraits were made. And they pasted  over  every single portrait of the dictator  with  their own photos. Boom  This is what happened. Slim and his friends went through the country and pasted hundreds of photos everywhere to show the diversity in the country. They really make Inside Out their own project. Actually  that photo was pasted in a police station  and what you see on the ground are ID cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police. Russia. Chad wanted to fight against homophobia in Russia. He went with his friends in front of every Russian embassy in Europe and stood there with the photos to say   We have rights.  They used Inside Out as a platform for protest. Karachi  Pakistan. Sharmeen is actually here. She organized a TEDx action out there and made all the unseen faces of the city on the walls in her town. And I want to thank her today. North Dakota. Standing Rock Nation  in this Turtle Island   unclear name  from the Dakota Lakota tribe wanted to show that the Native Americans are still here. The seventh generation are still fighting for their rights. He pasted up portraits all over his reservation. And he's here also today. Each time I get a wall in New York  I use his photos to continue spreading the project. Juarez  You've heard of the border    one of the most dangerous borders in the world. Monica has taken thousands of portraits with a group of photographers and covered the entire border. Do you know what it takes to do this  People  energy  make the glue  organize the team. It was amazing. While in Iran at the same time Abololo    of course a nickname    has pasted one single face of a woman to show his resistance against the government. I don't have to explain to you what kind of risk he took for that action. There are tons of school projects. Twenty percent of the posters we are receiving comes from schools. Education is so essential. Kids just make photos in a class  the teacher receives them  they paste them on the school. Here they even got the help of the firemen. There should be even more schools doing this kind of project. Of course we wanted to go back to Israel and Palestine. So we went there with a truck. This is a photobooth truck. You go on the back of that truck  it takes your photo     seconds later take it from the side  you're ready to rock. Thousands of people use them and each of them signs up for a two state peace solution and then walk in the street. This is march  the         march    beginning of September. They were all holding their photo as a statement. On the other side  people were wrapping up streets  buildings. It's everywhere. Come on  don't tell me that people aren't ready for peace out there. These projects took thousands of actions in one year  making hundreds of thousands of people participating  creating millions of views. This is the biggest global art participatory project that's going on. So back to the question   Can art change the world   Maybe not in one year. That's the beginning. But maybe we should change the question. Can art change people's lives  From what I've seen this year  yes. And you know what  It's just the beginning. Let's turn the world inside out together. Thank you. So  I'm going to start off with kind of the buzzkill a little bit. Forty two million people were displaced by natural disasters in     . Now  there was nothing particularly special about       because  on average     and a half million people are displaced by natural disasters every single year. Now  usually when people hear statistics or stats like that  you start thinking about places like Haiti or other kind of exotic or maybe even impoverished areas  but it happens right here in the United States every single year. Last year alone     federally declared disasters were on file with FEMA  from Joplin  Missouri  and Tuscaloosa  Alabama  to the Central Texas wildfires that just happened recently. Now  how does the most powerful country in the world handle these displaced people  They cram them onto cots  put all your personal belongings in a plastic garbage bag  stick it underneath  and put you on the floor of an entire sports arena  or a gymnasium. So obviously there's a massive housing gap  and this really upset me  because academia tells you after a major disaster  there's typically about an    month time frame to    we kinda recover  start the recovery process  but what most people don't realize is that on average it takes    to    days or more for the infamous FEMA trailers to even begin to show up. Before that time  people are left to their own devices. So I became obsessed with trying to figure out a way to actually fill this gap. This actually became my creative obsession. I put aside all my freelance work after hours and started just focusing particularly on this problem. So I started sketching. Two days after Katrina  I started sketching and sketching and trying to brainstorm up ideas or solutions for this  and as things started to congeal or ideas started to form  I started sketching digitally on the computer  but it was an obsession  so I couldn't just stop there. I started experimenting  making models  talking to experts in the field  taking their feedback  and refining  and I kept on refining and refining for nights and weekends for over five years. Now  my obsession ended up driving me to create full size prototypes in my own backyard    Laughter    and actually spending my own personal savings on everything from tooling to patents and a variety of other costs  but in the end I ended up with this modular housing system that can react to any situation or disaster. It can be put up in any environment  from an asphalt parking lot to pastures or fields  because it doesn't require any special setup or specialty tools. Now  at the foundation and kind of the core of this whole system is the Exo Housing Unit  which is just the individual shelter module. And though it's light  light enough that you can actually lift it by hand and move it around  and it actually sleeps four people. And you can arrange these things as kind of more for encampments and more of a city grid type layout  or you can circle the wagons  essentially  and form these circular pods out of them  which give you this semi private communal area for people to actually spill out into so they're not actually trapped inside these units. Now this fundamentally changes the way we respond to disasters  because gone are the horrid conditions inside a sports arena or a gymnasium  where people are crammed on these cots inside. Now we have instant neighborhoods outside. So the Exo is designed to be simply  basically like a coffee cup. They can actually stack together so we get extremely efficient transportation and storage out of them. In fact     Exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself. This means the Exo can actually be transported and set up faster than any other housing option available today. But I'm obsessive  so I couldn't just stop there  so I actually started modifying the bunks where you could actually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving  so the same unit can now be used for an office or storage location. The doors can actually swap out  so you can actually put on a rigid panel with a window unit in it for climate control  or a connector module that would allow you to actually connect multiple units together  which gives you larger and kind of compartmentalized living spaces  so now this same kit of parts  this same unit can actually serve as a living room  bedroom or bathroom  or an office  a living space and secure storage. Sounds like a great idea  but how do you make it real  So the first idea I had  initially  was just to go the federal and state governments and go   Here  take it  for free.  But I was quickly told that   Boy  our government doesn't really work like that.   Laughter  Okay. Okay. So maybe I would start a nonprofit to kind of help consult and get this idea going along with the government  but then I was told   Son  our government looks to private sector for things like this.  Okay. So maybe I would take this whole idea and go to private corporations that would have this mutually shared benefit to it  but I was quickly told by some corporations that my personal passion project was not a brand fit because they didn't want their logos stamped across the ghettos of Haiti. Now  I wasn't just obsessed. I was outraged.  Laughter.  So I decided  kind of told myself   Oh yeah  Watch this. I'll do it myself.   Laughter  Now  this quickly  my day job sent me to work out of our Milan office for a few months  so I was like  what will I do  So I actually scheduled sleep on my calendar  and spent the   hour time difference on conference calls with material suppliers  manufacturers and potential customers. And we found through this whole process  we found this great little manufacturer in Virginia  and if his body language is any indication  that's the owner    Laughter    of what it's like for a manufacturer to work directly with a designer  you've got to see what happens here.  Laughter  But G.S. Industries was fantastic. They actually built three prototypes for us by hand. So now we have prototypes that can show that four people can actually sleep securely and much more comfortably than a tent could ever provide. And they actually shipped them here to Texas for us. Now  a funny thing started happening. Other people started to believe in what we were doing  and actually offered us hangar space  donated hangar space to us. And then the Georgetown Airport Authority was bent over backwards to help us with anything we needed. So now we had a hangar space to work in  and prototypes to demo with. So in one year  we've negotiated manufacturing agreements  been awarded one patent  filed our second patent  talked to multiple people  demoed this to FEMA and its consultants to rave reviews  and then started talking to some other people who requested information  this little group called the United Nations. And on top of that  now we have a whole plethora of other individuals that have come up and started to talk to us from doing it for mining camps  mobile youth hostels  right down to the World Cup and the Olympics. So  in closing  on this whole thing here is hopefully very soon we will not have to respond to these painful phone calls that we get after disasters where we don't really have anything to sell or give you yet. Hopefully very soon we will be there  because we are destined  obsessed with making it real. Thank you.  Applause  Recently I visited Beloit  Wisconsin. And I was there to honor a great   th century explorer  Roy Chapman Andrews. During his time at the American Museum of Natural History  Andrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions  like here in the Gobi Desert. He was quite a figure. He was later  it's said  the basis of the Indiana Jones character. And when I was in Beloit  Wisconsin  I gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students. And I'm here to tell you  if there's anything more intimidating than talking here at TED  it'll be trying to hold the attention of a group of a thousand    year olds for a    minute lecture. Don't try that one. At the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions  but there was one that's really stuck with me since then. There was a young girl who stood up  and she asked the question   Where should we explore   I think there's a sense that many of us have that the great age of exploration on Earth is over  that for the next generation they're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans in order to find something significant to explore. But is that really the case  Is there really nowhere significant for us to explore left here on Earth  It sort of made me think back to one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology. This is an explorer of the unseen world  Martinus Beijerinck. So Beijerinck set out to discover the cause of tobacco mosaic disease. What he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters. And he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known    bacteria  at the time. He came up with a name for his mystery agent. He called it the virus    Latin for  poison.  And in uncovering viruses  Beijerinck really opened this entirely new world for us. We now know that viruses make up the majority of the genetic information on our planet  more than the genetic information of all other forms of life combined. And obviously there's been tremendous practical applications associated with this world    things like the eradication of smallpox  the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer  which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus. And Beijerinck's discovery  this was not something that occurred     years ago. It was a little over     years ago that Beijerinck discovered viruses. So basically we had automobiles  but we were unaware of the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet. We now have these amazing tools to allow us to explore the unseen world    things like deep sequencing  which allow us to do much more than just skim the surface and look at individual genomes from a particular species  but to look at entire metagenomes  the communities of teeming microorganisms in  on and around us and to document all of the genetic information in these species. We can apply these techniques to things from soil to skin and everything in between. In my organization we now do this on a regular basis to identify the causes of outbreaks that are unclear exactly what causes them. And just to give you a sense of how this works  imagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you. And this is something we commonly do to look for respiratory viruses like influenza. The first thing we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information. And if we started looking into that genetic information  we'd see a number of usual suspects out there    of course  a lot of human genetic information  but also bacterial and viral information  mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose. But we'd also see something very  very surprising. As we started to look at this information  we would see that about    percent of the genetic information in your nose doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before    no plant  animal  fungus  virus or bacteria. Basically we have no clue what this is. And for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data  a few of us have actually begun to call this information biological dark matter. We know it's not anything that we've seen before  it's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent right within our own genetic information. And there's a lot of it. If you think    percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot of biological dark matter  if we looked at your gut  up to    or    percent of that information is biological dark matter. And even in the relatively sterile blood  around one to two percent of this information is dark matter    can't be classified  can't be typed or matched with anything we've seen before. At first we thought that perhaps this was artifact. These deep sequencing tools are relatively new. But as they become more and more accurate  we've determined that this information is a form of life  or at least some of it is a form of life. And while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter are really only in their infancy  there's a very  very exciting possibility that exists  that buried in this life  in this genetic information  are signatures of as of yet unidentified life. That as we explore these strings of A's  T's  C's and G's  we may uncover a completely new class of life that  like Beijerinck  will fundamentally change the way that we think about the nature of biology. That perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us or identify the source of an outbreak that we aren't familiar with or perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology. I'm pleased to announce that  along with colleagues at Stanford and Caltech and UCSF  we're currently starting an initiative to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life. A little over a hundred years ago  people were unaware of viruses  the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet. A hundred years from now  people may marvel that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life that literally was right under our noses. It's true  we may have charted all the continents on the planet and we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there  but that doesn't mean that there's nothing left to explore on Earth. Beijerinck and his kind provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers    people like that young girl from Beloit  Wisconsin. And I think if we phrase that lesson  it's something like this  Don't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story. Go after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore. There are unknowns all around us and they're just waiting to be discovered. Thank you. I'm going to talk about religion. But it's a broad and very delicate subject  so I have to limit myself. And therefore I will limit myself to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality. This is a very serious talk. So I will talk of what I remember as the most wonderful. It's when the young couple whisper   Tonight we are going to make a baby.  My talk will be about the impact of religions on the number of babies per woman. This is indeed important  because everyone understands that there is some sort of limit on how many people we can be on this planet. And there are some people who say that the world population is growing like this    three billion in       seven billion just last year    and it will continue to grow because there are religions that stop women from having few babies  and it may continue like this. To what extent are these people right  When I was born there was less than one billion children in the world  and today        there's almost two billion. What has happened since  and what do the experts predict will happen with the number of children during this century  This is a quiz. What do you think  Do you think it will decrease to one billion  Will it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century  Will the number of children increase each year up to    years  or will it continue in the same fast rate and be four billion children up there  I will tell you by the end of my speech. But now  what does religion have to do with it  When you want to classify religion  it's more difficult than you think. You go to Wikipedia and the first map you find is this. It divides the world into Abrahamic religions and Eastern religion  but that's not detailed enough. So we went on and we looked in Wikipedia  we found this map. But that subdivides Christianity  Islam and Buddhism into many subgroups  which was too detailed. Therefore at Gapminder we made our own map  and it looks like this. Each country's a bubble. The size is the population    big China  big India here. And the color now is the majority religion. It's the religion where more than    percent of the people say that they belong. It's Eastern religion in India and China and neighboring Asian countries. Islam is the majority religion all the way from the Atlantic Ocean across the Middle East  Southern Europe and through Asia all the way to Indonesia. That's where we find Islamic majority. And Christian majority religions  we see in these countries. They are blue. And that is most countries in America and Europe  many countries in Africa and a few in Asia. The white here are countries which cannot be classified  because one religion does not reach    percent or there is doubt about the data or there's some other reason. So we were careful with that. So bear with our simplicity now when I take you over to this shot. This is in     . And now I show the number of babies per woman here  two  four or six    many babies  few babies. And here the income per person in comparable dollars. The reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first before you get few babies. So low income here  high income there. And indeed in       you had to be a rich Christian to have few babies. The exception was Japan. Japan here was regarded as an exception. Otherwise it was only Christian countries. But there was also many Christian countries that had six to seven babies per woman. But they were in Latin America or they were in Africa. And countries with Islam as the majority religion  all of them almost had six to seven children per woman  irregardless of the income level. And all the Eastern religions except Japan had the same level. Now let's see what has happened in the world. I start the world  and here we go. Now         can you see they're getting a little richer  but the number of babies per woman is falling  Look at China. They're falling fairly fast. And all of the Muslim majority countries across the income are coming down  as do the Christian majority countries in the middle income range. And when we enter into this century  you'll find more than half of mankind down here. And by       we are actually    percent of humans who live in countries with about two children per woman. It's a quite amazing development which has happened. And these are countries from United States here  with         per capita  France  Russia  Iran  Mexico  Turkey  Algeria  Indonesia  India and all the way to Bangladesh and Vietnam  which has less than five percent of the income per person of the United States and the same amount of babies per woman. I can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman is surprisingly good in all countries. We get that from the census data. It's not one of these statistics which is very doubtful. So what we can conclude is you don't have to get rich to have few children. It has happened across the world. And then when we look at religions  we can see that the Eastern religions  indeed there's not one single country with a majority of that religion that has more than three children. Whereas with Islam as a majority religion and Christianity  you see countries all the way. But there's no major difference. There's no major difference between these religions. There is a difference with income. The countries which have many babies per woman here  they have quite low income. Most of them are in sub Saharan Africa. But there are also countries here like Guatemala  like Papua New Guinea  like Yemen and Afghanistan. Many think that Afghanistan here and Congo  which have suffered severe conflicts  that they don't have fast population growth. It's the other way around. In the world today  it's the countries that have the highest mortality rates that have the fastest population growth. Because the death of a child is compensated by one more child. These countries have six children per woman. They have a sad death rate of one to two children per woman. But    years from now  Afghanistan will go from    million to    million. Congo will go from    to    . That's where we have the fast population growth. And many think that these countries are stagnant  but they are not. Let me compare Senegal  a Muslim dominated country  with a Christian dominated country  Ghana. I take them backwards here to their independence  when they were up here in the beginning of the     s. Just look what they have done. It's an amazing improvement  from seven children per woman  they've gone all the way down to between four and five. It's a tremendous improvement. So what does it take  Well we know quite well what is needed in these countries. You need to have children to survive. You need to get out of the deepest poverty so children are not of importance for work in the family. You need to have access to some family planning. And you need the fourth factor  which perhaps is the most important factor. But let me illustrate that fourth factor by looking at Qatar. Here we have Qatar today  and there we have Bangladesh today. If I take these countries back to the years of their independence  which is almost the same year    '    '      it's a quite amazing development which had happened. Look at Bangladesh and Qatar. With so different incomes  it's almost the same drop in number of babies per woman. And what is the reason in Qatar  Well I do as I always do. I went to the statistical authority of Qatar  to their webpage    It's a very good webpage. I recommend it    and I looked up    oh yeah  you can have lots of fun here    and provided free of charge  I found Qatar's social trends. Very interesting. Lots to read. I found fertility at birth  and I looked at total fertility rate per woman. These are the scholars and experts in the government agency in Qatar  and they say the most important factors are   Increased age at first marriage  increased educational level of Qatari woman and more women integrated in the labor force.  I couldn't agree more. Science couldn't agree more. This is a country that indeed has gone through a very  very interesting modernization. So what it is  is these four  Children should survive  children shouldn't be needed for work  women should get education and join the labor force and family planning should be accessible. Now look again at this. The average number of children in the world is like in Colombia    it's  .  today. There are countries up here which are very poor. And that's where family planning  better child survival is needed. I strongly recommend Melinda Gates' last TEDTalk. And here  down  there are many countries which are less than two children per woman. So when I go back now to give you the answer of the quiz  it's two. We have reached peak child. The number of children is not growing any longer in the world. We are still debating peak oil  but we have definitely reached peak child. And the world population will stop growing. The United Nations Population Division has said it will stop growing at    billion. But why do they grow if the number of children doesn't grow  Well I will show you here. I will use these card boxes in which your notebooks came. They are quite useful for educational purposes. Each card box is one billion people. And there are two billion children in the world. There are two billion young people between    and   . These are rounded numbers. Then there is one billion between    and     almost one between    and   . And then it's my box. This is me     plus. We are here on top. So what will happen now is what we call  the big fill up.  You can see that it's like three billion missing here. They are not missing because they've died  they were never born. Because before       there were much fewer people born than there were during the last    years. So what will happen now is quite straightforward. The old  sadly  we will die. The rest of you  you will grow older and you will get two billion children. Then the old will die. The rest will grow older and get two billion children. And then again the old will die and you will get two billion children. This is the great fill up. It's inevitable. And can you see that this increase took place without life getting longer and without adding children  Religion has very little to do with the number of babies per woman. All the religions in the world are fully capable to maintain their values and adapt to this new world. And we will be just    billion in this world  if the poorest people get out of poverty  their children survive  they get access to family planning. That is needed. But it's inevitable that we will be two to three billion more. So when you discuss and when you plan for the resources and the energy needed for the future  for human beings on this planet  you have to plan for    billion. Thank you very much. This sound  this smell  this sight all remind me of the campfires of my childhood  when anyone could become a storyteller in front of the dancing flames. There was this wondrous ending when people and fire fell asleep almost in unison. It was dreaming time. Now my story has a lot to do with dreaming  although I'm known to make my dreams come true. Last year  I created a one man show. For an hour and a half I shared with the audience a lifetime of creativity  how I pursue perfection  how I cheat the impossible. And then TED challenged me   Philippe  can you shrink this lifetime to    minutes   Eighteen minutes  clearly impossible. But here I am. One solution was to rehearse a machine gun delivery in which every syllable  every second will have its importance and hope to God the audience will be able to follow me. No  no  no. No  the best way for me to start is to pay my respects to the gods of creativity. So please join me for a minute of silence. Okay  I cheated  it was a mere    seconds. But hey  we're on TED time. When I was six years old  I fell in love with magic. For Christmas I got a magic box and a very old book on card manipulation. Somehow I was more interested in pure manipulation than in all the silly little tricks in the box. So I looked in the book for the most difficult move  and it was this. Now I'm not supposed to share that with you  but I have to show you the card is hidden in the back of the hand. Now that manipulation was broken down into seven moves described over seven pages. One  two  three  four  five  six and seven. And let me show you something else. The cards were bigger than my hands. Two months later  six years old  I'm able to do one  two  three  four  five  six  seven. And I go to see a famous magician and proudly ask him   Well what do you think   Six years old. The magician looked at me and said   This is a disaster. You cannot do that in two seconds and have a minuscule part of the card showing. For the move to be professional  it has to be less than one second and it has to be perfect.  Two years later  one    zoop. And I'm not cheating. It's in the back. It's perfect. Passion is the motto of all my actions. As I'm studying magic  juggling is mentioned repeatedly as a great way to acquire dexterity and coordination. Now I had long admired how fast and fluidly jugglers make objects fly. So that's it. I'm     I'm becoming a juggler. I befriend a young juggler in a juggling troupe  and he agrees to sell me three clubs. But in America you have to explain. What are clubs  Nothing to do with golf. They are those beautiful oblong objects  but quite difficult to make. They have to be precisely lathed. Oh  when I was buying the clubs  somehow the young juggler was hiding from the others. Well I didn't think much of it at the time. Anyway  here I was progressing with my new clubs. But I could not understand. I was pretty fast  but I was not fluid at all. The clubs were escaping me at each throw. And I was trying constantly to bring them back to me. Until one day I practiced in front of Francis Brunn  the world's greatest juggler. And he was frowning. And he finally asked   Can I see those   So I proudly showed him my clubs. He said   Philippe  you have been had. These are rejects. They are completely out of alignment. They are impossible to juggle.  Tenacity is how I kept at it against all odds. So I went to the circus to see more magicians  more jugglers  and I saw    oh no  no  no  I didn't see. It was more interesting  I heard. I heard about those amazing men and women who walk on thin air    the high wire walkers. Now I have been playing with ropes and climbing all my childhood  so that's it. I'm     I'm becoming a wire walker. I found two trees    but not any kind of trees  trees with character    and then a very long rope. And I put the rope around and around and around and around and around till I had no more rope. Now I have all of those ropes parallel like this. I get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers  and I gather them together in some kind of ropey path. So I just created the widest tightrope in the world. What did I need  I needed the widest shoes in the world. So I found some enormous  ridiculous  giant ski boots and then wobbly  wobbly I get on the ropes. Well within a few days I'm able to do one crossing. So I cut one rope off. And the next day one rope off. And a few days later  I was practicing on a single tightrope. Now you can imagine at that time I had to switch the ridiculous boots for some slippers. So that is how    in case there are people here in the audience who would like to try    this is how not to learn wire walking. Intuition is a tool essential in my life. In the meantime  I am being thrown out of five different schools because instead of listening to the teachers  I am my own teacher  progressing in my new art and becoming a street juggler. On the high wire  within months  I'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus  except I am not satisfied. I was starting to invent my own moves and bring them to perfection. But nobody wanted to hire me. So I started putting a wire up in secret and performing without permission. Notre Dame  the Sydney Harbor Bridge  the World Trade Center. And I developed a certitude  a faith that convinced me that I will get safely to the other side. If not  I will never do that first step. Well nonetheless  on the top of the World Trade Center my first step was terrifying. All of a sudden the density of the air is no longer the same. Manhattan no longer spreads its infinity. The murmur of the city dissolves into a squall whose chilling power I no longer feel. I lift the balancing pole. I approach the edge. I step over the beam. I put my left foot on the cable  the weight of my body raised on my right leg anchored to the flank of the building. Shall I ever so slightly shift my weight to the left  My right leg will be unburdened  my right foot will freely meet the wire. On one side  a mass of a mountain  a life I know. On the other  the universe of the clouds  so full of unknown we think it's empty. At my feet  the path to the north tower       yards of wire rope. It's a straight line  which sags  which sways  which vibrates  which rolls on itself  which is ice  which is three tons tight  ready to explode  ready to swallow me. An inner howl assails me  the wild longing to flee. But it is too late. The wire is ready. Decisively my other foot sets itself onto the cable. Faith is what replaces doubt in my dictionary. So after the walk people ask me   How can you top that   Well I didn't have that problem. I was not interested in collecting the gigantic  in breaking records. In fact  I put my World Trade Center crossing at the same artistic level as some of my smaller walks    or some completely different type of performance. Let's see  such as my street juggling  for example. So each time I draw my circle of chalk on the pavement and enter as the improvising comic silent character I created    years ago  I am as happy as when I am in the clouds. But this here  this is not the street. So I cannot street juggle here  you understand. So you don't want me to street juggle here  right  You know that  right  You don't want me to juggle  right  Thank you. Thank you. Each time I street juggle I use improvisation. Now improvisation is empowering because it welcomes the unknown. And since what's impossible is always unknown  it allows me to believe I can cheat the impossible. Now I have done the impossible not once  but many times. So what should I share  Oh  I know. Israel. Some years ago I was invited to open the Israel Festival by a high wire walk. And I chose to put my wire between the Arab quarters and the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem over the Ben Hinnom Valley. And I thought it would be incredible if in the middle of the wire I stopped and  like a magician  I produce a dove and send her in the sky as a living symbol of peace. Well now I must say  it was a little bit hard to find a dove in Israel  but I got one. And in my hotel room  each time I practiced making it appear and throwing her in the air  she would graze the wall and end up on the bed. So I said  now it's okay. The room is too small. I mean  a bird needs space to fly. It will go perfectly on the day of the walk. Now comes the day of the walk. Eighty thousand people spread over the entire valley. The mayor of Jerusalem  Teddy Kollek  comes to wish me the best. But he seemed nervous. There was tension in my wire  but I also could feel tension on the ground. Because all those people were made up of people who  for the most part  considered each other enemies. So I start the walk. Everything is fine. I stop in the middle. I make the dove appear. People applaud in delight. And then in the most magnificent gesture  I send the bird of peace into the azure. But the bird  instead of flying away  goes flop  flop  flop and lands on my head. And people scream. So I grab the dove  and for the second time I send her in the air. But the dove  who obviously didn't go to flying school  goes flop  flop  flop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole. You laugh  you laugh. But hey. I sit down immediately. It's a reflex of wire walkers. Now in the meantime  the audience  they go crazy. They must think this guy with this dove  he must have spent years working with him. What a genius  what a professional. So I take a bow. I salute with my hand. And at the end I bang my hand against the pole to dislodge the bird. Now the dove  who  now you know  obviously cannot fly  does for the third time a little flop  flop  flop and ends up on the wire behind me. And the entire valley goes crazy. Now but hold on  I'm not finished. So now I'm like    yards from my arrival and I'm exhausted  so my steps are slow. And something happened. Somebody somewhere  a group of people  starts clapping in rhythm with my steps. And within seconds the entire valley is applauding in unison with each of my steps. But not an applause of delight like before  an applause encouragement. For a moment  the entire crowd had forgotten their differences. They had become one  pushing me to triumph. I want you just for a second to experience this amazing human symphony. So let's say I am here and the chair is my arrival. So I walk  you clap  everybody in unison. So after the walk  Teddy and I become friends. And he tells me  he has on his desk a picture of me in the middle of the wire with a dove on my head. He didn't know the true story. And whenever he's daunted by an impossible situation to solve in this hard to manage city  instead of giving up  he looks at the picture and he says   If Philippe can do that  I can do this   and he goes back to work. Inspiration. By inspiring ourselves we inspire others. I will never forget this music  and I hope now neither will you. Please take this music with you home  and start gluing feathers to your arms and take off and fly  and look at the world from a different perspective. And when you see mountains  remember mountains can be moved. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Let's begin with a story. Once upon a time    well actually less than two years ago    in a kingdom not so very far away  there was a man who traveled many miles to come to work at the jewel in the kingdom's crown    an internationally famous company. Let's call it Island Networks. Now this kingdom had many resources and mighty ambitions  but the one thing it lacked was people. And so it invited workers from around the world to come and help it build the nation. But in order to enter and to stay these migrants had to pass a few tests. And so it was  our man presented himself to authorities in the kingdom  looking forward to settling into his new life. But then something unexpected happened. The medical personnel who took blood samples from the man never actually told him what they were testing for. He wasn't offered counseling before or after the test  which is best medical practice. He was never informed of the results of the test. And yet  a couple of weeks later  he was picked up and taken to prison where he was subjected to a medical exam  including a full body search in full view of the others in the cell. He was released  but then a day or two later  he was taken to the airport and he was deported. What on earth did this man do to merit this treatment  What was his terrible crime  He was infected with HIV. Now the kingdom is one of about    countries that imposes restrictions on the entry or stay of people living with HIV. The kingdom argues that its laws allow it to detain or deport foreigners who pose a risk to the economy or the security or the public health or the morals of the state. But these laws  when applied to people living with HIV  are a violation of international human rights agreements to which these countries are signatories. But you know what  Matters of principle aside  practically speaking  these laws drive HIV underground. People are less likely to come forth to be tested or treated or to disclose their condition  none of which helps these individuals or the communities these laws purport to protect. Today we can prevent the transmission of HIV. And with treatment  it is a manageable condition. We are very far from the days when the only practical response to dread disease was to have banished the afflicted    like this   The Exile of the Leper.  So you tell me why  in our age of science  we still have laws and policies which come from an age of superstition. Time for a quick show of hands. Who here has been touched by HIV    either because you yourself have the virus or you have a family member or a friend or a colleague who is living with HIV  Hands up. Wow. Wow. That's a significant number of us. You know better than anyone that HIV brings out the best and the worst in humanity. And the laws reflect these attitudes. I'm not just talking about laws on the books  but laws as they are enforced on the streets and laws as they are decided in the courts. And I'm not just talking about laws as they relate to people living with HIV  but people who are at greatest risk of infection    people such as those who inject drugs or sex workers or men who have sex with men or transgendered persons or migrants or prisoners. And in many parts of the world that includes women and children who are especially vulnerable. Now there are laws in many parts of the world which reflect the best of human nature. These laws treat people touched by HIV with compassion and acceptance. These laws respect universal human rights and they are grounded in evidence. These laws ensure that people living with HIV and those at greatest risk are protected from violence and discrimination and that they get access to prevention and to treatment. Unfortunately  these good laws are counter balanced by a mass of really bad law    law which is grounded in moral judgement and in fear and in misinformation  laws which specifically punish people living with HIV or those at greatest risk. These laws fly in the face of science  and they are grounded in prejudice and in ignorance and in a rewriting of tradition and a selective reading of religion. But you know what  You don't have to take my word for it. We're going to hear from two people who are on the sharp end of the law. The first is Nick Rhoades. He's an American. And he was convicted under the U.S. State of Iowa's law on HIV transmission and exposure    neither of which offense he actually committed. then that is telling society that is unacceptable  that's bad behavior. And I think the severity of that punishment tells you how bad you are as a person. You're a class B felon  lifetime sex offender. You are a very  very  very bad person. And you did a very  very  very bad thing. And so that's just programmed into you. And you go through the correctional system and everyone's telling you the same thing. And you're just like  I'm a very bad person. Shereen El Feki  It's not just a question of unfair or ineffective laws. Some countries have good laws  laws which could stem the tide of HIV. The problem is that these laws are flouted. Because stigma gives unofficial license to treat people living with HIV or those at greatest risk unlike other citizens. And this is exactly what happened to Helma and Dongo from Namibia. when I went to the hospital for a pregnancy check up. The nurse announced that every pregnant woman must also be tested for HIV that day. I took the test and the result showed I was positive. That's the day I found out. The nurse said to me   Why should you people bcome pregnant when you know you are HIV positive  Why are you pregnant when you are living positive   I am sure now that is the reason they sterilized me. Because I am HIV positive. They didn't give the forms to me or explain what was in the form. The nurse just came with it already marked where I had to sign. And with the labor pain  I didn't have the strength to ask them to read it to me. I just signed. SE  Hilma and Nick and our man in the kingdom are among the    million people living with HIV according to recent estimates. They're the lucky ones because they're still alive. According to those same estimates  in       .  million people died of AIDS related causes. These are terrible and tragic figures. But if we look a little more broadly into the statistics  we actually see some reason for hope. Looking globally  the number of new infections of HIV is declining. And looking globally as well  deaths are also starting to fall. There are many reasons for these positive developments  but one of the most remarkable is in the increase in the number of people around the world on anti retroviral therapy  the medicines they need to keep their HIV in check. Now there are still many problems. Only about half of the people who need treatment are currently receiving it. In some parts of the world    like here in the Middle East and North Africa    new infections are rising and so are deaths. And the money  the money we need for the global response to HIV  that is shrinking. But for the first time in three decades into this epidemic we have a real chance to come to grips with HIV. But in order to do that we need to tackle an epidemic of really bad law. It's for this reason that the Global Commission on HIV and the Law  of which I'm a member  was established by the agencies of the United Nations    to look at the ways that legal environments are affecting people living with HIV and those at greatest risk  and to recommend what should be done to make the law an ally  not an enemy  of the global response to HIV. Let me give you just one example of the way a legal environment can make a positive difference. People who inject drugs are one of those groups I mentioned. They're at high risk of HIV through contaminated injection equipment and other risk related behaviors. In fact  one in every    new infections of HIV is among people who inject drugs. Now drug use or possession is illegal in almost every country. But some countries take a harder line on this than others. In Thailand people who use drugs  or are merely suspected of using drugs  are placed in detention centers  like the one you see here  where they are supposed to clean up. There is absolutely no evidence to show that throwing people into detention cures their drug dependence. There is  however  ample evidence to show that incarcerating people increases their risk of HIV and other infections. We know how to reduce HIV transmission and other risks in people who inject drugs. It's called harm reduction  and it involves  among other things  providing clean needles and syringes  offering opioid substitution therapy and other evidence based treatments to reduce drug dependence. It involves providing information and education and condoms to reduce HIV transmission  and also providing HIV testing and counseling and treatment should people become infected. Where the legal environment allows for harm reduction the results are striking. Australia and Switzerland were two countries which introduced harm reduction very early on in their HIV epidemics  and they have a very low rate of HIV among injecting drug users. The U.S. and Malaysia came to harm reduction a little later  and they have higher rates of HIV in these populations. Thailand and Russia  however  have resisted harm reduction and have stringent laws which punish drug use. And hey  surprise  very high rates of HIV among people who are injecting drugs. At the Global Commission we have studied the evidence  and we've heard the experiences of over     people from     countries. And the trend  Well the trend is clear. Where you criminalize people living with HIV or those at greatest risk  you fuel the epidemic. Now coming up with a vaccine for HIV or a cure for AIDS    now that's rocket science. But changing the law isn't. And in fact  a number of countries are starting to make progress on a number of points. To begin  countries need to review their legislation as it touches HIV and vulnerable groups. On the back of those reviews  governments should repeal laws that punish or discriminate against people living with HIV or those at greatest risk. Repealing a law isn't easy  and it's particularly difficult when it relates to touchy subjects like drugs and sex. But there's plenty you can do while that process is underway. One of the key points is to reform the police so that they have better practices on the ground. So for example  outreach workers who are distributing condoms to vulnerable populations are not themselves subject to police harassment or abuse or arbitrary arrest. We can also train judges so that they find flexibilities in the law and so that they rule on the side of tolerance rather than prejudice. We can retool prisons so that HIV prevention and harm reduction is available to prisoners. The key to all this is reinforcing civil society. Because civil society is key to raising awareness among vulnerable groups of their legal rights. But awareness needs action. And so we need to ensure that these people who are living with HIV or at greatest risk of HIV have access to legal services and they have equal access to the courts. And also important is talking to communities so that we change interpretations of religious or customary law  which is too often used to justify punishment and fuel stigma. For many of us here HIV is not an abstract threat. It hits very close to home. The law  on the other hand  can seem remote  arcane  the stuff of specialists  but it isn't. Because for those of us who live in democracies  or in aspiring democracies  the law begins with us. Laws that treat people living with HIV or those at greatest risk with respect start with the way that we treat them ourselves  as equals. If we are going to stop the spread of HIV in our lifetime  then that is the change we need to spread. Thank you. ici faire Des choses on peut manger. c'est pas pass  the first time. about this convention. It's not so much  as so little has to do with what everything is. But it is within our self interest to understand the topography of our lives unto ourselves. The future states that there is no time other than the collapsation of that sensation of the mirror of the memories in which we are living. Common knowledge  but important nonetheless. As we face fear in these times  and fear is all around us  we also have anti fear. It's hard to imagine or measure. The background radiation is simply too static to be able to be seen under the normal spectral analysis. when a lot of us    you know what I'm saying  But    you know what I'm saying  Because  as a hip hop thing  you know what I'm saying  TED be rocking    you know what I'm saying. Like so I wrote a song  and I hope you guys dig it. It's a song about people and sasquatches    And other French science stuff. That's French science. Okay  here we go. I know that I'm in trouble that I'm in trouble by myself But every time it gets me And you're the one that I want to be so saucy And you're the one I want to  unclear   baby And you can do anything as long as you don't get hurt along the way back If I survive  I'm going to tell you what is wrong Because if you were  unclear  And I think that you're looking like a  unclear  I give you what I want to be you could use as many of those things that you want. And the computer models  no matter how many that you have and how many people that you use  are never going to be able to arrive at the same conclusions. Four years ago I worked with a few people at the Brookings Institute  and I arrived at a conclusion. Tomorrow is another day. Not just any day  but it is a day. It will get here  there's no question. And the important thing to remember is that this simulation is a good one. It's believable  it's tactile. You can reach out    things are solid. You can move objects from one area to another. You can feel your body. You can say   I'd like to go over to this location   and you can move this mass of molecules through the air over to another location  at will. That's something you live inside of every day. Now with the allocation and the understanding of the lack of understanding  we enter into a new era of science in which we feel nothing more than so much so as to say that those within themselves  comporary or non comporary  will figuratively figure into the folding of our non understanding and our partial understanding to the networks of which we all draw our source and conclusions from. So  as I say before the last piece  feel not as though it is a sphere we live on  rather an infinite plane which has the illusion of leading yourself back to the point of origin. Once we understand that all the spheres in the sky are just large infinite planes  it will be plain to see. This is my final piece. And just remember  everything you are    it's more important to realize the negative space  as music is only the division of space  it is the space we are listening to divided as such  which gives us the information in comparison to something other that gives us the idea of what the idea that wants to be transmitted wants to be. So please  without further ado. Thank you. This is a fun one. It goes like this. Okay  for the last piece I'd like to do  this one goes very similar to this. I hope you guys recognize it. Here we go. Okay  that still works. Okay  good. All right  here we go. Here we go. Yeah  yo  yo  yo Thank you. Enjoy the rest. When the Industrial Revolution started  the amount of carbon sitting underneath Britain in the form of coal was as big as the amount of carbon sitting under Saudi Arabia in the form of oil  and this carbon powered the Industrial Revolution  it put the  Great  in Great Britain  and led to Britain's temporary world domination. And then  in       coal production in Britain peaked  and has declined ever since. In due course  Britain started using oil and gas from the North Sea  and in the year       oil and gas production from the North Sea also peaked  and they're now on the decline. These observations about the finiteness of easily accessible  local  secure fossil fuels  this is a motivation for saying   Well  what's next  What is life after fossil fuels going to be like  Shouldn't we be thinking hard about how to get off fossil fuels   Another motivation  of course  is climate change. And when people talk about life after fossil fuels and climate change action  I think there's a lot of fluff  a lot of greenwash  a lot of misleading advertising  and I feel a duty as a physicist to try to guide people around the claptrap and help people understand the actions that really make a difference and to focus on ideas that do add up. Let me illustrate this with what physicists call a back of envelope calculation. We love back of envelope calculations. You ask a question  you write down some numbers  and you get yourself an answer. It may not be very accurate  but it may make you say   Hmm.  So here's a question  Imagine if we said   Oh yes  we can get off fossil fuels. We'll use biofuels. Problem solved. Transport  we don't need oil anymore.  Well  what if we grew the biofuels for a road on the grass verge at the edge of the road  How wide would the verge have to be for that to work out  Okay  so let's put in some numbers. Let's have our cars go at    miles per hour. Let's say they do    miles per gallon. That's the European average for new cars. Let's say the productivity of biofuel plantations is       litres of biofuel per hectare per year. That's true of European biofuels. And let's imagine the cars are spaced    meters apart from each other  and they're just perpetually going along this road. The length of the road doesn't matter  because the longer the road  the more biofuel plantation we've got. What do we do with these numbers  Well  you take the first number  and you divide by the other three  and you get eight kilometers. And that's the answer. That's how wide the plantation would have to be  given these assumptions. And maybe that makes you say   Hmm. Maybe this isn't going to be quite so easy.  And it might make you think  perhaps there's an issue to do with areas  and in this talk  I'd like to talk about land areas  and ask  is there an issue about areas  The answer is going to be yes but it depends which country you are in. So let's start in the United Kingdom  since that's where we are today. The energy consumption of the United Kingdom  the total energy consumption  not just transport  but everything  I like to quantify it in light bulbs. It's as if we've all got     light bulbs on all the time      kilowatt hours per day per person is the energy consumption of the U.K. So there's    light bulbs' worth for transport     light bulbs' worth for heating  and    light bulbs' worth for making electricity  and other things are relatively small compared to those three big fish. It's actually a bigger footprint if we take into account the embodied energy in the stuff we import into our country as well  and    percent of this energy today still comes from fossil fuels  and    percent only from other  greener    possibly greener    sources like nuclear power and renewables. So  that's the U.K.  and the population density of the U.K. is     people per square kilometer  and I'm now going to show you other countries by these same two measures. On the vertical axis  I'm going to show you how much light bulbs    what our energy consumption per person is  and we're at     light bulbs per person  and that little blue dot there is showing you the land area of the United Kingdom  and the population density is on the horizontal axis  and we're     people per square kilometer. Let's add European countries in blue  and you can see there's quite a variety. I should emphasize  both of these axes are logarithmic. As you go from one gray bar to the next gray bar you're going up a factor of   . Next  let's add Asia in red  the Middle East and North Africa in green  sub Saharan Africa in blue  black is South America  purple is Central America  and then in pukey yellow  we have North America  Australia and New Zealand. And you can see the great diversity of population densities and of per capita consumptions. Countries are different from each other. Top left  we have Canada and Australia  with enormous land areas  very high per capita consumption      or     light bulbs per person  and very low population densities. Top right  Bahrain has the same energy consumption per person  roughly  as Canada  over     light bulbs per person  but their population density is a factor of     times greater        people per square kilometer. Bottom right  Bangladesh has the same population density as Bahrain but consumes     times less per person. Bottom left  well  there's no one. But there used to be a whole load of people. Here's another message from this diagram. I've added on little blue tails behind Sudan  Libya  China  India  Bangladesh. That's    years of progress. Where were they    years ago  and where are they now  And the message is  most countries are going to the right  and they're going up  up and to the right    bigger population density and higher per capita consumption. So  we may be off in the top right hand corner  slightly unusual  the United Kingdom accompanied by Germany  Japan  South Korea  the Netherlands  and a bunch of other slightly odd countries  but many other countries are coming up and to the right to come and join us  so we're a picture  if you like  of what the future energy consumption might be looking like in other countries too. And I've also added in this diagram now some pink lines that go down and to the right. Those are lines of equal power consumption per unit area  which I measure in watts per square meter. So  for example  the middle line there   .  watts per square meter  is the energy consumption per unit area of Saudi Arabia  Norway  Mexico in purple  and Bangladesh    years ago  and half of the world's population lives in countries that are already above that line. The United Kingdom is consuming  .   watts per square meter. So's Germany  and Japan is consuming a bit more. So  let's now say why this is relevant. Why is it relevant  Well  we can measure renewables in the same units and other forms of power production in the same units  and renewables is one of the leading ideas for how we could get off our    percent fossil fuel habit. So here come some renewables. Energy crops deliver half a watt per square meter in European climates. What does that mean  And you might have anticipated that result  given what I told you about the biofuel plantation a moment ago. Well  we consume  .   watts per square meter. What this means is  even if you covered the whole of the United Kingdom with energy crops  you couldn't match today's energy consumption. Wind power produces a bit more   .  watts per square meter  but that's only twice as big as  .   watts per square meter  so that means if you wanted literally to produce total energy consumption in all forms on average from wind farms  you need wind farms half the area of the U.K. I've got data to back up all these assertions  by the way. Next  let's look at solar power. Solar panels  when you put them on a roof  deliver about    watts per square meter in England. If you really want to get a lot from solar panels  you need to adopt the traditional Bavarian farming method where you leap off the roof and coat the countryside with solar panels too. Solar parks  because of the gaps between the panels  deliver less. They deliver about   watts per square meter of land area. And here's a solar park in Vermont with real data delivering  .  watts per square meter. Remember where we are   .   watts per square meter  wind farms  .   solar parks about five. So  whatever  whichever of those renewables you pick  the message is  whatever mix of those renewables you're using  if you want to power the U.K. on them  you're going to need to cover something like    percent or    percent of the country with those renewables. And I'm not saying that's a bad idea. We just need to understand the numbers. I'm absolutely not anti renewables. I love renewables. But I'm also pro arithmetic.  Laughter  Concentrating solar power in deserts delivers larger powers per unit area  because you don't have the problem of clouds  and so this facility delivers    watts per square meter  this one    watts per square meter  and this one in Spain   watts per square meter. Being generous to concentrating solar power  I think it's perfect credible it could deliver    watts per square meter. So that's nice. Of course  Britain doesn't have any deserts. Yet.  Laughter  So here's a summary so far. All renewables  much as I love them  are diffuse. They all have a small power per unit area  and we have to live with that fact. And that means  if you do want renewables to make a substantial difference for a country like the United Kingdom on the scale of today's consumption  you need to be imagining renewable facilities that are country sized  not the entire country but a fraction of the country  a substantial fraction. There are other options for generating power as well which don't involve fossil fuels. So there's nuclear power  and on this Ordnance Survey map  you can see there's a Sizewell B inside a blue square kilometer. That's one gigawatt in a square kilometer  which works out to       watts per square meter. So by this particular metric  nuclear power isn't as intrusive as renewables. Of course  other metrics matter too  and nuclear power has all sorts of popularity problems. But the same goes for renewables as well. Here's a photograph of a consultation exercise in full swing in the little town of Penicuik just outside Edinburgh  and you can see the children of Penicuik celebrating the burning of the effigy of the windmill. So people are anti everything  and we've got to keep all the options on the table. What can a country like the U.K. do on the supply side  Well  the options are  I'd say  these three  power renewables  and recognizing that they need to be close to country sized  other people's renewables  so we could go back and talk very politely to the people in the top left hand side of the diagram and say   Uh  we don't want renewables in our backyard  but  um  please could we put them in yours instead   And that's a serious option. It's a way for the world to handle this issue. So countries like Australia  Russia  Libya  Kazakhstan  could be our best friends for renewable production. And a third option is nuclear power. So that's some supply side options. In addition to the supply levers that we can push  and remember  we need large amounts  because at the moment  we get    percent of our energy from fossil fuels. In addition to those levers  we could talk about other ways of solving this issue  namely  we could reduce demand  and that means reducing population   I'm not sure how to do that   or reducing per capita consumption. So let's talk about three more big levers that could really help on the consumption side. First  transport. Here are the physics principles that tell you how to reduce the energy consumption of transport  and people often say   Oh  yes  technology can answer everything. We can make vehicles that are a hundred times more efficient.  And that's almost true. Let me show you. The energy consumption of this typical tank here is    kilowatt hours per hundred person kilometers. That's the average European car. Eighty kilowatt hours. Can we make something a hundred times better by applying those physics principles I just listed  Yes. Here it is. It's the bicycle. It's    times better in energy consumption  and it's powered by biofuel  by Weetabix. And there are other options in between  because maybe the lady in the tank would say   No  no  no  that's a lifestyle change. Don't change my lifestyle  please.  So  well  we could persuade her to get into a train  and that's still a lot more efficient than a car  but that might be a lifestyle change  or there's the eco car  top left. It comfortably accommodates one teenager and it's shorter than a traffic cone  and it's almost as efficient as a bicycle as long as you drive it at    miles per hour. In between  perhaps some more realistic options on this lever  transport lever  are electric vehicles  so electric bikes and electric cars in the middle  perhaps four times as energy efficient as the standard petrol powered tank. Next  there's the heating lever. Heating is a third of our energy consumption in Britain  and quite a lot of that is going into homes and other buildings doing space heating and water heating. So here's a typical crappy British house. It's my house  with the Ferrari out front. What can we do to it  Well  the laws of physics are written up there  which describe what    how the power consumption for heating is driven by the things you can control. The things you can control are the temperature difference between the inside and the outside  and there's this remarkable technology called a thermostat. You grasp it  you rotate it to the left  and your energy consumption in the home will decrease. I've tried it. It works. Some people call it a lifestyle change. You can also get the fluff men in to reduce the leakiness of your building    put fluff in the walls  fluff in the roof  and a new front door and so forth  and the sad truth is  this will save you money. That's not sad  that's good  but the sad truth is  it'll only get about    percent of the leakiness of your building  if you do these things  which are good ideas. If you really want to get a bit closer to Swedish building standards with a crappy house like this  you need to be putting external insulation on the building as shown by this block of flats in London. You can also deliver heat more efficiently using heat pumps which use a smaller bit of high grade energy like electricity to move heat from your garden into your house. The third demand side option I want to talk about  the third way to reduce energy consumption is  read your meters. And people talk a lot about smart meters  but you can do it yourself. Use your own eyes and be smart  read your meter  and if you're anything like me  it'll change your life. Here's a graph I made. I was writing a book about sustainable energy  and a friend asked me   Well how much energy do you use at home   And I was embarrassed. I didn't actually know. And so I started reading the meter every week  and the old meter readings are shown in the top half of the graph  and then      is shown in green at the bottom  and that was when I was reading the meter every week  and my life changed  because I started doing experiments and seeing what made a difference  and my gas consumption plummeted because I started tinkering with the thermostat and the timing on the heating system  and I knocked more than a half off my gas bills. There's a similar story for my electricity consumption  where switching off the DVD players  the stereos  the computer peripherals that were on all the time  and just switching them on when I needed them  knocked another third off my electricity bills too. So we need a plan that adds up  and I've described for you six big levers  and we need big action because we get    percent of our energy from fossil fuels  and so you need to push hard on most if not all of these levers. And most of these levers have popularity problems  and if there is a lever you don't like the use of  well please do bear in mind that means you need even stronger effort on the other levers. So I'm a strong advocate of having grown up conversations that are based on numbers and facts  and I want to close with this map that just visualizes for you the requirement of land and so forth in order to get just    light bulbs per person from four of the big possible sources. So  if you wanted to get    light bulbs  remember  today our total energy consumption is     light bulbs' worth. If you wanted    from wind  this map visualizes a solution for the U.K. It's got     wind farms  each     square kilometers in size  and that would be a twentyfold increase over today's amount of wind. Nuclear power  to get    light bulbs per person  you'd need two gigawatts at each of the purple dots on the map. That's a fourfold increase over today's levels of nuclear power. Biomass  to get    light bulbs per person  you'd need a land area something like three and a half Wales' worth  either in our country  or in someone else's country  possibly Ireland  possibly somewhere else.  Laughter  And a fourth supply side option  concentrating solar power in other people's deserts  if you wanted to get    light bulbs' worth  then we're talking about these eight hexagons down at the bottom right. The total area of those hexagons is two Greater London's worth of someone else's Sahara  and you'll need power lines all the way across Spain and France to bring the power from the Sahara to Surrey. We need a plan that adds up. We need to stop shouting and start talking  and if we can have a grown up conversation  make a plan that adds up and get building  maybe this low carbon revolution will actually be fun. Thank you very much for listening. I know this is going to sound strange  but I think robots can inspire us to be better humans. See  I grew up in Bethlehem  Pennsylvania  the home of Bethlehem Steel. My father was an engineer  and when I was growing up  he would teach me how things worked. We would build projects together  like model rockets and slot cars. Here's the go kart that we built together. That's me behind the wheel  with my sister and my best friend at the time. And one day  he came home  when I was about    years old  and at the dinner table  he announced that for our next project   we were going to build ... a robot. A robot. Now  I was thrilled about this  because at school  there was a bully named Kevin  and he was picking on me  because I was the only Jewish kid in class. So I couldn't wait to get started to work on this  so I could introduce Kevin to my robot. But that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind. See  he owned a chromium plating company  and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals. And so he needed an industrial robot like this  that could basically do the heavy lifting. But my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted  either. He and I worked on it for several years  but it was the     s  and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet. So Dad continued to do this kind of work by hand. And a few years later  he was diagnosed with cancer. You see  what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting. It was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals. He didn't recognize that at the time  and he contracted leukemia. And he died at the age of   . I was devastated by this. And I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build. When I was at college  I decided to study engineering  like him. And I went to Carnegie Mellon  and I earned my PhD in robotics. I've been studying robots ever since. So what I'd like to tell you about are four robot projects  and how they've inspired me to be a better human. By       I was a young professor at USC  and I was just building up my own robotics lab  and this was the year the World Wide Web came out. And I remember my students were the ones who told me about it  and we would    we were just amazed. We started playing with this  and that afternoon  we realized that we could use this new  universal interface to allow anyone in the world to operate the robot in our lab. So  rather than have it fight or do industrial work  we decided to build a planter  put the robot into the center of it  and we called it the Telegarden. And we had put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the robot  and we wrote some special scripts and software  so that anyone in the world could come in  and by clicking on the screen  they could move the robot around and visit the garden. But we also set up some other software that lets you participate and help us water the garden  remotely. And if you watered it a few times  we'd give you your own seed to plant. Now  this was an engineering project  and we published some papers on the system design of it  but we also thought of it as an art installation. It was invited  after the first year  by the Ars Electronica Museum in Austria  to have it installed in their lobby. And I'm happy to say  it remained online there     hours a day  for almost nine years. That robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history. Now  one day  I got a call out of the blue from a student  who asked a very simple but profound question. He said   Is the robot real   Now  everyone else had assumed it was  and we knew it was  because we were working with it. But I knew what he meant  because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of flowers in a garden and then  basically  index them in a computer system  such that it would appear that there was a real robot  when there wasn't. And the more I thought about it  I couldn't think of a good answer for how he could tell the difference. This was right about the time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley. And when I got here  I looked up Hubert Dreyfus  who's a world renowned professor of philosophy  And I talked with him about this and he said   This is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy. It goes back to the Skeptics and up through Descartes. It's the issue of epistemology  the study of how do we know that something is true.  So he and I started working together  and we coined a new term   telepistemology   the study of knowledge at a distance. We invited leading artists  engineers and philosophers to write essays about this  and the results are collected in this book from MIT Press. So thanks to this student  who questioned what everyone else had assumed to be true  this project taught me an important lesson about life  which is to always question assumptions. Now  the second project I'll tell you about grew out of the Telegarden. As it was operating  my students and I were very interested in how people were interacting with each other  and what they were doing with the garden. So we started thinking  what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment  Like  for example  what if it could go to a dinner party at the White House  So  because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface than in the hardware  we decided that  rather than have a robot replace the human to go to the party  we'd have a human replace the robot. We called it the Tele Actor. We got a human  someone who's very outgoing and gregarious  and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment  cameras and microphones  and then a backpack with wireless Internet connection. And the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment  and then over the Internet  people could experience what she was experiencing. So they could see what she was seeing  but then  more importantly  they could participate  by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go  and then conveying those to the Tele Actor. So we got a chance to take the Tele Actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco. And that year  Sam Donaldson was the host. Just before the curtain went up  I had about    seconds to explain to Mr. Donaldson what we were going to do. And I said   The Tele Actor is going to be joining you onstage. This is a new experimental project  and people are watching her on their screens  there's cameras involved and there's microphones and she's got an earbud in her ear  and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next.  And he said   Wait a second. That's what I do.  So he loved the concept  and when the Tele Actor walked onstage  she walked right up to him  and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips. We were totally surprised    we had no idea that would happen. And he was great  he just gave her a big hug in return  and it worked out great. But that night  as we were packing up  I asked the Tele Actor  how did the Tele Directors decide that they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson  And she said they hadn't. She said  when she was just about to walk onstage  the Tele Directors still were trying to agree on what to do  and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural. So  the success of the Tele Actor that night was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor. She knew when to trust her instincts. And so that project taught me another lesson about life  which is that  when in doubt  improvise. Now  the third project grew out of my experience when my father was in the hospital. He was undergoing a treatment    chemotherapy treatments    and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy  where tiny  radioactive seeds are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors. And the way it's done  as you can see here  is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds. And all these needles are inserted in parallel. So it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs. And as a result  the needles damage these organs  cause damage  which leads to trauma and side effects. So my students and I wondered  what if we could modify the system  so that the needles could come in at different angles  So we simulated this  we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this. And we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs  and yet still achieve the coverage of the tumors with the radiation. So now  we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins  and we're building a robot that has a number of    it's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles. And as you can see here  they can avoid delicate organs and still reach the targets they're aiming for. So  by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel  this project also taught me an important lesson  When in doubt  when your path is blocked  pivot. And the last project also has to do with medical robotics. And this is something that's grown out of a system called the da Vinci surgical robot. And this is a commercially available device. It's being used in over       hospitals around the world. The idea is it allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in his own coordinate frame. Many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious  like suturing  and currently  all of these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon. So the surgeon becomes fatigued over time. And we've been wondering  what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks  and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicated parts of the surgery  and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster  Now  it's hard to program a robot to do delicate things like this. But it turns out my colleague Pieter Abbeel  who's here at Berkeley  has developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example. So he's gotten robots to fly helicopters  do incredibly interesting  beautiful acrobatics  by watching human experts fly them. So we got one of these robots. We started working with Pieter and his students. And we asked a surgeon to perform a task    with the robot. So what we're doing is asking the surgeon to perform the task  and we record the motions of the robot. So here's an example. I'll use tracing out a figure eight as an example. So here's what it looks like when the robot    this is what the robot's path looks like  those three examples. Now  those are much better than what a novice like me could do  but they're still jerky and imprecise. So we record all these examples  the data  and then go through a sequence of steps. First  we use a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition. And this allows us to temporally align all of the examples. And then we apply Kalman filtering  a technique from control theory  that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them. Now we take those human demonstrations    they're all noisy and imperfect    and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot. We then execute that on the robot  we observe what happens  then we adjust the controls  using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning. Then what we do is we increase the velocity a little bit. We observe the results  adjust the controls again  and observe what happens. And we go through this several rounds. And here's the result. That's the inferred task trajectory  and here's the robot moving at the speed of the human. Here's four times the speed of the human. Here's seven times. And here's the robot operating at    times the speed of the human. So we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task like a surgical subtask  at    times the speed of a human. So this project also  because of its involved practicing and learning  doing something over and over again  this project also has a lesson  which is  if you want to do something well  there's no substitute for practice  practice  practice. So these are four of the lessons that I've learned from robots over the years. And the field of robotics has gotten much better over time. Nowadays  high school students can build robots  like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build. But  it's very    now ... And now  I have a daughter  named Odessa. She's eight years old. And she likes robots  too. Maybe it runs in the family. I wish she could meet my dad. And now I get to teach her how things work  and we get to build projects together. And I wonder what kind of lessons she'll learn from them. Robots are the most human of our machines. They can't solve all of the world's problems  but I think they have something important to teach us. I invite all of you to think about the innovations that you're interested in  the machines that you wish for. And think about what they might be telling you. Because I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations  the devices we dream about  can inspire us to be better humans. Thank you. The great texts of the ancient world don't survive to us in their original form. They survive because medieval scribes copied them and copied them and copied them. And so it is with Archimedes  the great Greek mathematician. Everything we know about Archimedes as a mathematician we know about because of just three books  and they're called A  B and C. And A was lost by an Italian humanist in     . And B was last heard of in the Pope's Library about a hundred miles north of Rome in Viterbo in     . Now Codex C was only discovered in       and it landed on my desk in Baltimore on the   th of January      . And this is Codex C here. Now Codex C is actually buried in this book. It's buried treasure. Because this book is actually a prayer book. It was finished by a guy called Johannes Myrones on the   th of April      . And to make his prayer book he used parchment. But he didn't use new parchment  he used parchment recycled from earlier manuscripts  and there were seven of them. And Archimedes Codex C was just one of those seven. He took apart the Archimedes manuscript and the other seven manuscripts. He erased all of their texts  and then he cut the sheets down in the middle  he shuffled them up  and he rotated them    degrees  and he wrote prayers on top of these books. And essentially these seven manuscripts disappeared for     years  and we have a prayer book. The prayer book was discovered by this guy  Johan Ludvig Heiberg  in     . And with just a magnifying glass  he transcribed as much of the text as he could. And the thing is that he found two texts in this manuscript that were unique texts. They weren't in A and B at all  they were completely new texts by Archimedes  and they were called  The Method  and  The Stomachion.  And it became a world famous manuscript. Now it should be clear by now that this book is in bad condition. It got in worse condition in the   th century after Heiberg saw it. Forgeries were painted over it  and it suffered very badly from mold. This book is the definition of a write off. It's the sort of book that you thought would be in an institution. But it's not in an institution  it was bought by a private owner in     . Why did he buy this book  Because he wanted to make that which was fragile safe. He wanted to make that which was unique ubiquitous. He wanted to make that which was expensive free. And he wanted to do this as a matter of principle. Because not many people are really going to read Archimedes in ancient Greek  but they should have the chance to do it. So he gathered around himself the friends of Archimedes  and he promised to pay for all the work. And it was an expensive job  but actually it wouldn't be as much as you think because these people  they didn't come from money  they came from Archimedes. And they came from all sorts of different backgrounds. They came from particle physics  they came from classical philology  they came from book conservation  they came from ancient mathematics  they came from data management  they came from scientific imaging and program management. And they got together to work on this manuscript. The first problem was a conservation problem. And this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with  There was glue on the spine of the book. And if you look at this photograph carefully  the bottom half of this is rather brown. And that glue is hide glue. Now if you're a conservator  you can take off this glue reasonably easily. The top half is Elmer's wood glue. It's polyvinyl acetate emulsion that doesn't dissolve in water once it's dry. And it's much tougher than the parchment that it was written on. And so before we could start imaging Archimedes  we had to take this book apart. So it took four years to take apart. And this is a rare action shot  ladies and gentlemen. Another thing is that we had to get rid of all the wax  because this was used in the liturgical services of the Greek Orthodox Church and they'd used candle wax. And the candle wax was dirty  and we couldn't image through the wax. So very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax. It's hard to tell you exactly how bad this condition of this book is  but it came out in little bits very often. And normally in a book  you wouldn't worry about the little bits  but these little bits might contain unique Archimedes text. So  tiny fragments we actually managed to put back in the right place. Then  having done that  we started to image the manuscript. And we imaged the manuscript in    different wavebands of light. Because if you look at something in different wavebands of light  you see different things. And here is an image of a page imaged in    different wavebands of light. But none of them worked. So what we did was we processed the images together  and we put two images into one blank screen. And here are two different images of the Archimedes manuscript. And the image on the left is the normal red image. And the image on the right is an ultraviolet image. And in the image on the right you might be able to see some of the Archimedes writing. If you merge them together into one digital canvas  the parchment is bright in both images and it comes out bright. The prayer book is dark in both images and it comes out dark. The Archimedes text is dark in one image and bright in another. And it'll come out dark but red  and then you can start to read it rather clearly. And that's what it looks like. Now that's a before and after image  but you don't read the image on the screen like that. You zoom in and you zoom in and you zoom in and you zoom in  and you can just read it now. If you process the same two images in a different way  you can actually get rid of the prayer book text. And this is terribly important  because the diagrams in the manuscript are the unique source for the diagrams that Archimedes drew in the sand in the fourth century B.C. And there we are  I can give them to you. With this kind of imaging    this kind of infrared  ultraviolet  invisible light imaging    we were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries. How were we going to do that  Well we took the manuscript  and we decided to image it in X ray fluorescence imaging. So an X ray comes in in the diagram on the left and it knocks out an electron from the inner shell of an atom. And that electron disappears. And as it disappears  an electron from a shell farther out jumps in and takes its place. And when it takes its place  it sheds electromagnetic radiation. It sheds an X ray. And this X ray is specific in its wavelength to the atom that it hits. And what we wanted to get was the iron. Because the ink was written in iron. And if we can map where this X ray that comes out  where it comes from  we can map all the iron on the page  then theoretically we can read the image. The thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this. So we took it to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory in California  which is a particle accelerator. Electrons go around one way  positrons go around the other. They meet in the middle  and they create subatomic particles like the charm quark and the tau lepton. Now we weren't actually going to put Archimedes in that beam. But as the electrons go round at the speed of light  they shed X rays. And this is the most powerful light source in the solar system. This is called synchrotron radiation  and it's normally used to look at things like proteins and that sort of thing. But we wanted it to look at atoms  at iron atoms  so that we could read the page from before and after. And lo and behold  we found that we could do it. It took about    minutes to do a single page. So what did we discover  Well one of the unique texts in Archimedes is called  The Stomachion.  And this didn't exist in Codices A and B. And we knew that it involved this square. And this is a perfect square  and it's divided into    bits. But no one knew what Archimedes was doing with these    bits. And now we think we know. He was trying to work out how many ways you can recombine those    bits and still make a perfect square. Anyone want to guess the answer  It's        divided into     families. And the important point about this is that it's the earliest study in combinatorics in mathematics. And combinatorics is a wonderful and interesting branch of mathematics. The really astonishing thing though about this manuscript is that we looked at the other manuscripts that the palimpsester had made  the scribe had made his book out of  and one of them was a manuscript containing text by Hyperides. Now Hyperides was an Athenian orator from the fourth century B.C. He was an exact contemporary of Demosthenes. And in     B.C. he and Demosthenes together decided that they wanted to stand up to the military might of Philip of Macedon. So Athens and Thebes went out to fight Philip of Macedon. This was a bad idea  because Philip of Macedon had a son called Alexander the Great  and they lost the battle of Chaeronea. Alexander the Great went on to conquer the known world  Hyperides found himself on trial for treason. And this is the speech that he gave when he was on trial    and it's a great speech   Best of all   he says   is to win. But if you can't win  then you should fight for a noble cause  because then you'll be remembered. Consider the Spartans. They won enumerable victories  but no one remembers what they are because they were all fought for selfish ends. The one battle that the Spartans fought that everybody remembers is the the battle of Thermopylae where they were butchered to a man  but fought for the freedom of Greece.  It was such a great speech that the Athenian law courts let him off. He lived for another    years  then the Macedonian faction caught up with him. They cut out his tongue in mockery of his oratory  and no one knows what they did with his body. So this is the discovery of a lost voice from antiquity  speaking to us  not from the grave  because his grave doesn't exist  but from the Athenian law courts. Now I should say at this point that normally when you're looking at medieval manuscripts that have been scraped off  you don't find unique texts. And to find two in one manuscript is really something. To find three is completely weird. And we found three. Aristotle's  Categories  is one of the foundational texts of Western philosophy. And we found a third century A.D. commentary on it  possibly by Galen and probably by Porphyry. Now all this data that we collected  all the images  all the raw images  all the transcriptions that we made and that sort of thing have been put online under a Creative Commons license for anyone to use for any commercial purpose. Why did the owner of the manuscript do this  He did this because he understands data as well as books. Now the thing to do with books  if you want to ensure their long term utility  is to hide them away in closets and let very few people look at them. The thing to do with data  if you want it to survive  is to let it out and have everybody have it with as little control on that data as possible. And that's what he did. And institutions can learn from this. Because institutions at the moment confine their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing. And if you want to look at medieval manuscripts on the Web  at the moment you have to go to the National Library of Y's site or the University Library of X's site  which is about the most boring way in which you can deal with digital data. What you want to do is to aggregate it all together. Because the Web of the ancient manuscripts of the future isn't going to be built by institutions. It's going to be built by users  by people who get this data together  by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps from wherever they come from  all sorts of medieval romances from wherever they come from  people who just want to curate their own glorious selection of beautiful things. And that is the future of the Web. And it's an attractive and beautiful future  if only we can make it happen. Now we at the Walters Art Museum have followed this example  and we have put up all our manuscripts on the Web for people to enjoy    all the raw data  all the descriptions  all the metadata. under a Creative Commons license. Now the Walters Art Museum is a small museum and it has beautiful manuscripts  but the data is fantastic. And the result of this is that if you do a Google search on images right now and you type in  Illuminated manuscript Koran  for example     of the    images you'll find come from my institution. Now  let's think about this for a minute. What's in it for the institution  There are all sorts of things that are in it for the institution. You can talk about the Humanities and that sort of thing  but let's talk about selfish things. Because what's really in it for the institution is this  Now why do people go to the Louvre  They go to see the Mona Lisa. Why do they go to see the Mona Lisa  Because they already know what she looks like. And they know what she looks like because they've seen pictures of her absolutely everywhere. Now  there is no need for these restrictions at all. And I think that institutions should stand up and release all their data under unrestricted licenses  and it would be a great benefit to everybody. Why don't we just let everybody have access to this data and curate their own collection of ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things and increase the beauty and the cultural significance of the Internet. Thank you very much indeed. My talk today is about something maybe a couple of you have already heard about. It's called the Arab Spring. Anyone heard of it  So in       power shifted  from the few to the many  from oval offices to central squares  from carefully guarded airwaves to open source networks. But before Tahrir was a global symbol of liberation  there were representative surveys already giving people a voice in quieter but still powerful ways. I study Muslim societies around the world at Gallup. Since       we've interviewed hundreds of thousands of people    young and old  men and women  educated and illiterate. My talk today draws on this research to reveal why Arabs rose up and what they want now. Now this region's very diverse  and every country is unique. But those who revolted shared a common set of grievances and have similar demands today. I'm going to focus a lot of my talk on Egypt. It has nothing to do with the fact that I was born there  of course. But it's the largest Arab country and it's also one with a great deal of influence. But I'm going to end by widening the lens to the entire region to look at the mundane topics of Arab views of religion and politics and how this impacts women  revealing some surprises along the way. So after analyzing mounds of data  what we discovered was this  Unemployment and poverty alone did not lead to the Arab revolts of     . If an act of desperation by a Tunisian fruit vendor sparked these revolutions  it was the difference between what Arabs experienced and what they expected that provided the fuel. To tell you what I mean  consider this trend in Egypt. On paper the country was doing great. In fact  it attracted accolades from multinational organizations because of its economic growth. But under the surface was a very different reality. In       right before the revolution  even though GDP per capita had been growing at five percent for several years  Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives. Now this is very unusual  because globally we find that  not surprisingly  people feel better as their country gets richer. And that's because they have better job opportunities and their state offers better social services. But it was exactly the opposite in Egypt. As the country got more well off  unemployment actually rose and people's satisfaction with things like housing and education plummeted. But it wasn't just anger at economic injustice. It was also people's deep longing for freedom. Contrary to the clash of civilizations theory  Arabs didn't despise Western liberty  they desired it. As early as       we asked Arabs  and Muslims in general around the world  what they admired most about the West. Among the most frequent responses was liberty and justice. In their own words to an open ended question we heard   Their political system is transparent and it's following democracy in its true sense.  Another said it was  liberty and freedom and being open minded with each other.  Majorities as high as    percent and greater in Egypt  Indonesia and Iran told us in      that if they were to write a new constitution for a theoretical new country that they would guarantee freedom of speech as a fundamental right  especially in Egypt. Eighty eight percent said moving toward greater democracy would help Muslims progress    the highest percentage of any country we surveyed. But pressed up against these democratic aspirations was a very different day to day experience  especially in Egypt. While aspiring to democracy the most  they were the least likely population in the world to say that they had actually voiced their opinion to a public official in the last month    at only four percent. So while economic development made a few people rich  it left many more worse off. As people felt less and less free  they also felt less and less provided for. So rather than viewing their former regimes as generous if overprotective fathers  they viewed them as essentially prison wardens. So now that Egyptians have ended Mubarak's    year rule  they potentially could be an example for the region. If Egypt is to succeed at building a society based on the rule of law  it could be a model. If  however  the core issues that propelled the revolution aren't addressed  the consequences could be catastrophic    not just for Egypt  but for the entire region. The signs don't look good  some have said. Islamists  not the young liberals that sparked the revolution  won the majority in Parliament. The military council has cracked down on civil society and protests and the country's economy continues to suffer. Evaluating Egypt on this basis alone  however  ignores the real revolution. Because Egyptians are more optimistic than they have been in years  far less divided on religious secular lines than we would think and poised for the demands of democracy. Whether they support Islamists or liberals  Egyptians' priorities for this government are identical  and they are jobs  stability and education  not moral policing. But most of all  for the first time in decades  they expect to be active participants  not spectators  in the affairs of their country. I was meeting with a group of newly elected parliamentarians from Egypt and Tunisia a couple of weeks ago. And what really struck me about them was that they weren't only optimistic  but they kind of struck me as nervous  for lack of a better word. One said to me   Our people used to gather in cafes to watch football     or soccer  as we say in America     and now they gather to watch Parliament.   They're really watching us  and we can't help but worry that we're not going to live up to their expectations.  And what really struck me is that less than    months ago  it was the people that were nervous about being watched by their government. And the reason that they're expecting a lot is because they have a new found hope for the future. So right before the revolution we said that Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives  but not only that  they thought their future would be no better. What really changed after the ouster of Mubarak wasn't that life got easier. It actually got harder. But people's expectations for their future went up significantly. And this hope  this optimism  endured a year of turbulent transition. One reason that there's this optimism is because  contrary to what many people have said  most Egyptians think things really have changed in many ways. So while Egyptians were known for their single digit turnout in elections before the revolution  the last election had around    percent voter turnout    men and women. Where scarcely a quarter believed in the honesty of elections in         I'm surprised it was a quarter       percent thought that this last election was honest. Now why this matters is because we discovered a link between people's faith in their democratic process and their faith that oppressed people can change their situation through peaceful means alone. Now I know what some of you are thinking. The Egyptian people  and many other Arabs who've revolted and are in transition  have very high expectations of the government. They're just victims of a long time autocracy  expecting a paternal state to solve all their problems. But this conclusion would ignore a tectonic shift taking place in Egypt far from the cameras in Tahrir Square. And that is Egyptians' elevated expectations are placed first on themselves. In the country once known for its passive resignation  where  as bad as things got  only four percent expressed their opinion to a public official  today    percent tell us that if there's a problem in their community  it's up to them to fix it. And three fourths believe they not only have the responsibility  but the power to make change. And this empowerment also applies to women  whose role in the revolts cannot be underestimated. They were doctors and dissidents  artists and organizers. A full third of those who braved tanks and tear gas to ask or to demand liberty and justice in Egypt were women. Now people have raised some real concerns about what the rise of Islamist parties means for women. What we've found about the role of religion in law and the role of religion in society is that there's no female consensus. We found that women in one country look more like the men in that country than their female counterparts across the border. Now what this suggests is that how women view religion's role in society is shaped more by their own country's culture and context than one monolithic view that religion is simply bad for women. Where women agree  however  is on their own role  and that it must be central and active. And here is where we see the greatest gender difference within a country    on the issue of women's rights. Now how men feel about women's rights matters to the future of this region. Because we discovered a link between men's support for women's employment and how many women are actually employed in professional fields in that country. So the question becomes  What drives men's support for women's rights  What about men's views of religion and law   Does  a man's opinion of the role of religion in politics shape their view of women's rights  The answer is no. We found absolutely no correlation  no impact whatsoever  between these two variables. What drives men's support for women's employment is men's employment  their level of education as well as a high score on their country's U.N. Human Development Index. What this means is that human development  not secularization  is what's key to women's empowerment in the transforming Middle East. And the transformation continues. From Wall Street to Mohammed Mahmoud Street  it has never been more important to understand the aspirations of ordinary people. Thank you. We are today talking about moral persuasion. What is moral and immoral in trying to change people's behaviors by using technology and using design  And I don't know what you expect  but when I was thinking about that issue  I early on realized what I'm not able to give you are answers. I'm not able to tell you what is moral or immoral because we're living in a pluralist society. My values can be radically different from your values. Which means that what I consider moral or immoral based on that might not necessarily be what you consider moral or immoral. But I also realized that there is one thing that I could give you. And that is what this guy behind me gave the world    Socrates. It is questions. What I can do and what I would like to do with you is give you  like that initial question  a set of questions to figure out for yourself  layer by layer  like peeling an onion  getting at the core of what you believe is moral or immoral persuasion. And I'd like to do that with a couple of examples of technologies where people have used game elements to get people to do things. So it's a first very simple  a very obvious question I would like to give you  What are your intentions if you are designing something  And obviously intentions are not the only thing  so here is another example for one of these applications. There are a couple of these kinds of eco dashboards right now    so dashboards built into cars which try to motivate you to drive more fuel efficiently. This here is Nissan's MyLeaf  where your driving behavior is compared with the driving behavior of other people  so you can compete for who drives around the most fuel efficiently. And these things are very effective  it turns out  so effective that they motivate people to engage in unsafe driving behaviors    like not stopping on a red headlight. Because that way you have to stop and restart the engine  and that would use quite some fuel  wouldn't it  So despite this being a very well intended application  obviously there was a side effect of that. And here's another example for one of these side effects. Commendable  a site that allows parents to give their kids little badges for doing the things that parents want their kids to do    like tying their shoes. And at first that sounds very nice  very benign  well intended. But it turns out  if you look into research on people's mindset  that caring about outcomes  caring about public recognition  caring about these kinds of public tokens of recognition is not necessarily very helpful for your long term psychological well being. It's better if you care about learning something. It's better when you care about yourself than how you appear in front of other people. So that kind of motivational tool that is used actually in and of itself has a long term side effect in that every time we use a technology that uses something like public recognition or status  we're actually positively endorsing this as a good and a normal thing to care about    that way  possibly having a detrimental effect on the long term psychological well being of ourselves as a culture. So that's a second  very obvious question  What are the effects of what you're doing  The effects that you're having with the device  like less fuel  as well as the effects of the actual tools you're using to get people to do things    public recognition. Now is that all    intention  effect  Well there are some technologies which obviously combine both. Both good long term and short term effects and a positive intention like Fred Stutzman's Freedom  where the whole point of that application is  well  we're usually so bombarded with calls and requests by other people  with this device you can shut off the Internet connectivity of your PC of choice for a preset amount of time to actually get some work done. And I think most of us will agree  well that's something well intended and also has good consequences. In the words of Michel Foucault   It is a technology of the self.  It is a technology that empowers the individual to determine its own life course  to shape itself. But the problem is  as Foucault points out  that every technology of the self has a technology of domination as its flip side. As you see in today's modern liberal democracies  the society  the state  not only allows us to determine our self  to shape our self  it also demands it of us. It demands that we optimize ourselves  that we control ourselves  that we self manage continuously because that's the only way in which such a liberal society works. These technologies want us to stay in the game that society has devised for us. They want us to fit in even better. They want us to optimize ourselves to fit in. Now I don't say that is necessarily a bad thing. I just think that this example points us to a general realization  and that is no matter what technology or design you look at  even something we consider as well intended and as good in its effects    like Stutzman's Freedom    comes with certain values embedded in it. And we can question these values. We can question  Is it a good thing that all of us continuously self optimize ourselves to fit better into that society  Or to give you another example  what about a piece of persuasive technology that convinces Muslim women to wear their headscarves  Is that a good or a bad technology in its intentions or in its effects  Well that basically depends on the kind of values that you bring to bear to make these kinds of judgments. So that's a third question  What values do you use to judge  And speaking of values  I've noticed that in the discussion about moral persuasion online  and when I'm talking with people  more often than not there is a weird bias. And that bias is that we're asking  is this or that  still  ethical  Is it  still  permissible  We're asking things like  Is this Oxfam donation form    where the regular monthly donation is the preset default and people  maybe without intending it  are that way encouraged or nudged into giving a regular donation instead of a one time donation    is that still permissible  Is it still ethical  We're fishing at the low end. But in fact  that question  Is it still ethical   is just one way of looking at ethics. Because if you look at the beginning of ethics in Western culture  you see a very different idea of what ethics also could be. For Aristotle  ethics was not about the question  is that still good  or is it bad  Ethics was about the question of how to live life well. And he put that in the word  arete   which we  from the  Ancient Greek   translate as  virtue.  But really it means excellence. It means living up to your own full potential as a human being. And that is an idea that  I think  that Paul Richard Buchanan nicely put in a recent essay where he said   Products are vivid arguments about how we should live our lives.  Our designs are not ethical or unethical in that they're using ethical or unethical means of persuading us. They have a moral component just in the kind of vision and the aspiration of the good life that they present to us. And if you look into the designed environment around us with that kind of lens  asking   What is the vision of the good life that our products  our design  present to us    then you often get the shivers  because of how little we expect of each other  of how little we actually seem to expect of our life and what the good life looks like. So that's the fourth question I'd like to leave you with  What vision of the good life do your designs convey  And speaking of design  you notice that I already broadened the discussion. Because it's not just persuasive technology that we're talking about here  it's any piece of design that we put out here in the world. I don't know whether you know the great communication researcher Paul Watzlawick who  back in the '  s  made the argument we cannot not communicate. Even if we choose to be silent  we chose to be silent. We're communicating something by choosing to be silent. And in the same way that we cannot not communicate  we cannot not persuade. Whatever we do or refrain from doing  whatever we put out there as a piece of design into the world has a persuasive component. It tries to affect people. It puts a certain vision of the good life out there in front of us. Which is what Peter Paul Verbeek  the Dutch philosopher of technology  says. No matter whether we as designers intend it or not  we materialize morality. We make certain things harder and easier to do. We organize the existence of people. We put a certain vision of what good or bad or normal or usual is in front of people by everything we put out there in the world. Even something as innocuous as a set of school chairs is a persuasive technology. Because it presents and materializes a certain vision of the good life    the good life in which teaching and learning and listening is about one person teaching  the others listening  in which it is about  learning is done while sitting  in which you learn for yourself  in which you're not supposed to change these rules because the chairs are fixed to the ground. And even something as innocuous as a single design chair    like this one by Arne Jacobsen    is a persuasive technology. Because  again  it communicates an idea of the good life. A good life    a life that you say you as a designer consent to by saying   In the good life  goods are produced as sustainably or unsustainably as this chair. Workers are treated as well or as badly as the workers were treated who built that chair.  The good life is a life where design is important because somebody obviously took the time and spent the money for that kind of well designed chair  where tradition is important because this is a traditional classic and someone cared about this  and where there is something as conspicuous consumption  where it is okay and normal to spend a humungous amount of money on such a chair to signal to other people what your social status is. So these are the kinds of layers  the kinds of questions I wanted to lead you through today    the question of  What are the intentions that you bring to bear when you're designing something  What are the effects  intended and unintended  that you're having  What are the values you're using to judge those  What are the virtues  the aspirations that you're actually expressing in that  And how does that apply  not just to persuasive technology  but to everything you design  Do we stop there  I don't think so. I think that all of these things are eventually informed by the core of all of this    and this is nothing but life itself. Why  when the question of what the good life is informs everything that we design  should we stop at design and not ask ourselves  how does it apply to our own life   Why should the lamp or the house be an art object  but not our life   as Michel Foucault puts it. Just to give you a practical example of Buster Benson. This is Buster setting up a pull up machine at the office of his new startup Habit Labs  where they're trying to build up other applications like Health Month for people. And why is he building a thing like this  Well here is the set of axioms that Habit Labs  Buster's startup  put up for themselves on how they wanted to work together as a team when they're building these applications    a set of moral principles they set themselves for working together    and one of them being   We take care of our own health and manage our own burnout.  Because ultimately how can you ask yourselves and how can you find an answer on what vision of the good life you want to convey and create with your designs without asking the question  what vision of the good life do you yourself want to live  And with that  I thank you.
