  Thank you so much  Chris. And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice  I'm extremely grateful. I have been blown away by this conference  and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. And I say that sincerely  partly because  Mock sob  I need that. Put yourselves in my position. I flew on Air Force Two for eight years. Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane  I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me. It's a true story    every bit of this is true. Soon after Tipper and I left the     Mock sob  White House    we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have    miles east of Nashville. Driving ourselves. I know it sounds like a little thing to you  but    I looked in the rear view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. There was no motorcade back there. You've heard of phantom limb pain  This was a rented Ford Taurus. It was dinnertime  and we started looking for a place to eat. We were on I   . We got to Exit      Lebanon  Tennessee. We got off the exit  we found a Shoney's restaurant. Low cost family restaurant chain  for those of you who don't know it. We went in and sat down at the booth  and the waitress came over  made a big commotion over Tipper. She took our order  and then went to the couple in the booth next to us  and she lowered her voice so much  I had to really strain to hear what she was saying. And she said  Yes  that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife  Tipper.  And the man said   He's come down a long way  hasn't he   There's been kind of a series of epiphanies. The very next day  continuing the totally true story  I got on a G V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria  in the city of Lagos  on the topic of energy. And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville. And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you  Tipper and I were driving ourselves  Shoney's  low cost family restaurant chain  what the man said    they laughed. I gave my speech  then went back out to the airport to fly back home. I fell asleep on the plane until  during the middle of the night  we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. I woke up  they opened the door  I went out to get some fresh air  and I looked  and there was a man running across the runway. And he was waving a piece of paper  and he was yelling   Call Washington  Call Washington   And I thought to myself  in the middle of the night  in the middle of the Atlantic  what in the world could be wrong in Washington  Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things. But what it turned out to be  was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech  and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. It was printed in Monterey  I checked. And the story began   Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday   quote  'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low cost family restaurant'      'named Shoney's  and we are running it ourselves.'  Before I could get back to U.S. soil  David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on    one of them had me in a big white chef's hat  Tipper was saying   One more burger with fries   Three days later  I got a nice  long  handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton  saying   Congratulations on the new restaurant  Al   We like to celebrate each other's successes in life. I was going to talk about information ecology. But I was thinking that  since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED  that maybe I could talk about that another time. Chris Anderson  It's a deal  Al Gore  I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on  What can you do about the climate crisis  I want to start with a couple of    I'm going to show some new images  and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five. Now  the slide show. I update the slide show every time I give it. I add new images  because I learn more about it every time I give it. It's like beach combing  you know  Every time the tide comes in and out  you find some more shells. Just in the last two days  we got the new temperature records in January. This is just for the United States of America. Historical average for Januarys is    degrees  last month was   .  degrees. Now  I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment    I'm kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides  and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do. But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these. First of all  this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming  under business as usual. Efficiency in end use electricity and end use of all energy is the low hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation    it's not a cost  it's a profit. The sign is wrong. It's not negative  it's positive. These are investments that pay for themselves. But they are also very effective in deflecting our path. Cars and trucks    I talked about that in the slideshow  but I want you to put it in perspective. It's an easy  visible target of concern    and it should be    but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Cars and trucks are very significant  and we have the lowest standards in the world. And so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle. Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks. Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod  and John Doerr and others  many of you here    there are a lot of people directly involved in this    this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it. Carbon Capture and Sequestration    that's what CCS stands for    is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe. Not quite there yet. OK. Now  what can you do  Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures are also profitable. Insulation  better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles    buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options that are much better. It's important. Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy  between things that have a harsh effect  or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis. Consider this  Make a decision to live a carbon neutral life. Those of you who are good at branding  I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. It is easier than you think. It really is. A lot of us in here have made that decision  and it is really pretty easy. It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make  and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced. And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net. There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened    with my active involvement    the leading software writers in the world  on this arcane science of carbon calculation  to construct a consumer friendly carbon calculator. You can very precisely calculate what your CO  emissions are  and then you will be given options to reduce. And by the time the movie comes out in May  this will be updated to  .   and we will have click through purchases of offsets. Next  consider making your business carbon neutral. Again  some of us have done that  and it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations  whether you are from the technology  or entertainment  or design and architecture community. Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. Listen  if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance  don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management. Over time  people do what you pay them to do. And if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested  based on the short term returns  you're going to get short term decisions. A lot more to be said about that. Become a catalyst of change. Teach others  learn about it  talk about it. The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago  except it's a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it. Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow    re purposed  with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach  and it's not just the slides  it's what they mean. And it's how they link together. And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse  in communities all across the country  and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week  to keep it right on the cutting edge. Working with Larry Lessig  it will be  somewhere in that process  posted with tools and limited use copyrights  so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way. Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics  It doesn't mean that if you're a Republican  that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue  and I know that in this group it really is. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work. Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions    global warming pollution    and trading it. Here's why  as long as the United States is out of the world system  it's not a closed system. Once it becomes a closed system  with U.S. participation  then everybody who's on a board of directors    how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation  Once it's a closed system  you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work to solve this problem    if we can accomplish this. Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring. We have to change the minds of the American people. Because presently  the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done. And in our modern country  the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did. It's now repetition of short  hot button     second     second television ads. We have to buy a lot of those ads. Let's re brand global warming  as many of you have suggested. I like  climate crisis  instead of  climate collapse   but again  those of you who are good at branding  I need your help on this. Somebody said the test we're facing now  a scientist told me  is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination. That's really true. I said the other night  and I'll repeat now  this is not a political issue. Again  the Republicans here    this shouldn't be partisan. You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do. This is an opportunity. Not just this  but connected to the ideas that are here  to bring more coherence to them. We are one. Thank you very much  I appreciate it. Hello voice mail  my old friend. I've called for tech support again. I ignored my boss's warning. I called on a Monday morning. Now it's evening  and my dinner first grew cold  and then grew mold. I'm still on hold. I'm listening to the sounds of silence. I don't think you understand. I think your phone lines are unmanned. I punched every touch tone I was told  but I've still spent    hours on hold. It's not enough your software crashed my Mac  and it constantly hangs and bombs    it erased my ROMs  Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence. In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys. Say your motorcycle crashes. Blood comes gushing from your gashes. With your fading strength  you call       and you pray for a trained MD. But you get me. And you listen to the sounds of silence. Thank you. Good evening and welcome to   Spot the TED Presenter Who Used to Be a Broadway Accompanist.  When I was offered the Times column six years ago  the deal was like this  you'll be sent the coolest  hottest  slickest new gadgets. Every week  it'll arrive at your door. You get to try them out  play with them  evaluate them until the novelty wears out  before you have to send them back  and you'll get paid for it. You can think about it  if you want. So  I've always been a technology nut  and I absolutely love it. The job  though  came with one small downside  and that is  they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column. And what I've noticed is    first of all  you get an incredible amount of email. If you ever are feeling lonely  get a New York Times column  because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails. And the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration. People are feeling like things    Ok  I just had an alarm come up on my screen. Lucky you can't see it. People are feeling overwhelmed. They're feeling like it's too much technology  too fast. It may be good technology  but I feel like there's not enough of a support structure. There's not enough help. There's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use. One time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support  and within    hours  there were     messages from readers on the feedback boards on the Times website  from users saying    Me too  and here's my tale of woe.  I call it  software rage.  And man  let me tell you  whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will    Oh  how did that get up there  Just kidding. Ok  so why is the problem accelerating  And part of the problem is  ironically  because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use. I'll show you what I mean. This is what the computer interface used to look like  DOS. Over the years  it's gotten easier to use. This is the original Mac operating system. Reagan was President. Madonna was still a brunette. And the entire operating system    this is the good part    the entire operating system fit in     k. You couldn't put the Mac OS X logo in     k  So the irony is  that as these things became easier to use  a less technical  broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time. I once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day. The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to. And the calls that    you know how they say   Your call may be recorded for quality assurance   Uh uh. Your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD. Which they do. And I have a copy. It's in your gift bag. No  no. With your voices on it  So  some of the stories are just so classic  and yet so understandable. A woman called Apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking. Making a squeaking noise. And the technician said   Well  ma'am  what do you mean your mouse is squeaking   She says   All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder  the faster I move it across the screen.  And the technician's like   Ma'am  you've got the mouse up against the screen   She goes   Well  the message said  'Click here to continue.'  Well  if you like that one    how much time have we got  Another one  a guy called    this is absolutely true    his computer had crashed  and he told the technician he couldn't restart it  no matter how many times he typed    .  And the technician said   What  Why are you typing      He said   The message says  'Error Type   .'  So  we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users. But why is the technical overload crisis  the complexity crisis  accelerating now  In the hardware world  it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller  smaller  smaller. So the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier  but our fingers are essentially staying the same size. So it gets to be more and more of a challenge. Software is subject to another primal force  the mandate to release more and more versions. When you buy a piece of software  it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar  where you own it. It's more like joining a club  where you pay dues every year  and every year  they say   We've added more features  and we'll sell it to you for    .  I know one guy who's spent        just on Photoshop over the years. And software companies make    percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades. I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox    which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times  you eventually ruin it. I mean  Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in  you know  the Eisenhower administration. But what's the alternative  Microsoft actually did this experiment. They said   Well  wait a minute. Everyone complains that we're adding so many features. Let's create a word processor that's just a word processor  Simple  pure  does not do web pages  is not a database.  And it came out  and it was called Microsoft Write. And none of you are nodding in acknowledgment  because it died. It tanked. No one ever bought it. I call this the Sport Utility Principle. People like to surround themselves with unnecessary power  right  They don't need the database and the website  but they're like   Well  I'll upgrade  because  I might  you know  I might need that someday.  So the problem is  as you add more features  where are they going to go  Where are you going to stick them  You only have so many design tools. You can do buttons  you can do sliders  pop up menus  sub menus. But if you're not careful about how you choose  you wind up with this. This is an un retouched    this is not a joke    un retouched photo of Microsoft Word  the copy that you have  with all the toolbars open. You've obviously never opened all the toolbars  but all you have to type in is this little  teeny window down here. And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices  where there are so many features and options  you have to do two dimensions  you know  a vertical and a horizontal. You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically. The off switch is in there somewhere. I'm telling you    it's there. Part of the art of designing a simple  good interface  is knowing when to use which one of these features. So  here is the log off dialogue box for Windows     . There are only four choices  so why are they in a pop up menu  It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices. They could have put them all out in view. Here's Apple's take on the exact same dialogue box. Thank you    yes  I designed the dialogue box. No  no. Already  we can see that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design. Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be  let's break it down  let's just make it more steps. There are these  wizards  everywhere. And you know  there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall. If they continue at this pace  there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up.  Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard   Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard.  Ok  I'll bite. Let's click  Next  to continue. From the drop down menu  choose the first letter you want to type. Ok. So there is a limit that we don't want to cross. So what is the answer  How do you pack in all these features in a simple  intelligent way  I believe in consistency  when possible  real world equivalents  trash can folder  when possible  label things  mostly. But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all  which is intelligence. Now what do I mean by that  I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent  but it's better. If you are buying something on the web  you're supposed to put in your address  and you're supposed to choose what country you're from  ok  There are     countries in the world. We like to think of the Internet as a global village. I'm sorry  it's not one yet. It's mainly like  the United States  Europe  and Japan. So why is  United States  in the  U s  You have to scroll  like  seven screensful to get to it. Now  it would be inconsistent to put  United States  first  but it would be intelligent. This one's been touched on before  but why in God's name do you shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called  Start   Here's another pet one of mine  you have a printer. Most of the time  you want to print one copy of your document  in page order  on that printer. So why in God's name do you see this every time you print  It's like a     shuttle cockpit. And one of the buttons at the bottom  you'll notice  is not  Print.  Now  I'm not saying that Apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity. Palm is also  especially in the old days  wonderful about this. I actually got to speak to Palm when they were flying high in the '  s  and after the talk  I met one of the employees. He says   Nice talk.  And I said   Thank you. What do you do here   He said   I'm a tap counter.  I'm like   You're a what   He goes   Well Jeff Hawkins  the CEO  says  'If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus  it's too long  and it has to be redesigned.' So I'm the tap counter.  So  I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter. This is Microsoft Word. Ok  when you want to create a new blank document in Word    it could happen. You go up to the  File  menu and you choose  New.  Now  what happens when you choose  New   Do you get a new blank document  You do not. On the opposite side of the monitor  a task bar appears  and somewhere in those links    by the way  not at the top    somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document. Ok  so that is a company not counting taps. You know  I don't want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft ... Yes  I do. The Bill Gates song  I've been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS. I put my software and IBM together  I got profit and they got the loss. I write the code that makes the whole world run. I'm getting royalties from everyone. Sometimes it's garbage  but the press is snowed. You buy the box  I'll sell the code. Every software company is doing Microsoft's R D. You can't keep a good idea down these days. Even Windows is a hack. We're kind of based loosely on the Mac. So it's big  so it's slow. You've got nowhere to go. I'm not doing this for praise. I write the code that fits the world today. Big mediocrity in every way. We've entered planet domination mode. You'll have no choice  you'll buy my code. I am Bill Gates and I write the code. But actually  I believe there are really two Microsofts. There's the old one  responsible for Windows and Office. They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh  but they can't. They're locked in  because so many add ons and other company stuff locks into the old      chassis. But there's also a new Microsoft  that's really doing good  simple interface designs. I liked the Media Center PC. I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch. The Wireless Watch flopped miserably in the market  but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed. But let's put it this way  would you pay     a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone  and stops working when you leave your area code  So  the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse. So is there any hope  The screens are getting smaller  people are illuminating  putting manuals in the boxes  things are coming out at a faster pace. It's funny    when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in       after    years away  it was the MacWorld Expo    he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans  and he sort of did this. The crowd went wild  but I had just seen    I'm like  where have I seen this before  I had just seen the movie  Evita     with Madonna  and I'm like  you know what  I've got to do one about Steve Jobs. It won't be easy. You'll think I'm strange. When I try to explain why I'm back  after telling the press Apple's future is black. You won't believe me. All that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz. You try rhyming with garage  Don't cry for me  Cupertino. The truth is  I never left you. I know the ropes now  know what the tricks are. I made a fortune over at Pixar. Don't cry for me  Cupertino. I've still got the drive and vision. I still wear sandals in any weather. It's just that these days  they're Gucci leather. Thank you. So Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty. And the truth is  for years I was a little depressed  because Americans obviously did not value it  because the Mac had three percent market share  Windows had    percent market share    people did not think it was worth putting a price on it. So I was a little depressed. And then I heard Al Gore's talk  and I realized I didn't know the meaning of depressed. But it turns out I was wrong  right  Because the iPod came out  and it violated every bit of common wisdom. Other products cost less  other products had more features  they had voice recorders and FM transmitters. The other products were backed by Microsoft  with an open standard  not Apple's propriety standard. But the iPod won    this is the one they wanted. The lesson was  simplicity sells. And there are signs that the industry is getting the message. This is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance. The Sonos thing    it's catching on. I've got just a couple examples. Physically  a really cool  elegant thinking coming along lately. When you have a digital camera  how do you get the pictures back to your computer  Well  you either haul around a USB cable  or you buy a card reader and haul that around. Either one  you're going to lose. What I do is  I take out the memory card  and I fold it in half  revealing USB contacts. I just stick it in the computer  offload the pictures  put it right back in the camera. I never have to lose anything. Here's another example. Chris  you're the source of all power. Will you be my power plug  Chris Anderson  Oh yeah. DP  Hold that and don't let go. You might've seen this  this is Apple's new laptop. This the power cord. It hooks on like this. And I'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives  or one of your children. You walk along    and I'm about to pull this onto the floor. I don't care. It's a loaner. Here we go. Whoa  It's magnetic    it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor. In my very last example    I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software. And I'll just    you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous. Speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly  period. Like  I get hundreds of them a day  period. And it's not just what I dictate that it writes down  period. I also use this feature called voice macros  period. Correct  dissuade.  Not  just.  Ok  this is not an ideal situation  because it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff. The point is  I can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word  and having it write out a much longer thing. So if somebody sends me a fan letter  I'll say   Thanks for that.   Thank you so much for taking the time to write ...  And conversely  if somebody sends me hate mail    which happens daily    I say   Piss off.   I admire your frankness ...  So that's my dirty little secret. Don't tell anyone. So the point is    this is a really interesting story. This is version eight of this software  and do you know what they put in version eight  No new features. It's never happened before in software  The company put no new features. They just said   We'll make this software work right.  Right  Because for years  people had bought this software  tried it out       percent accuracy was all they got  which means one in    words is wrong    and they'd put it in their drawer. And the company got sick of that  so they said   This version  we're not going to do anything  but make sure it's darned accurate.  And so that's what they did. This cult of doing things right is starting to spread. So  my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology  remember  if it doesn't work  it's not necessarily you  ok  It could be the design of the thing you're using. Be aware in life of good design and bad design. And if you're among the people who create this stuff  Easy is hard. Pre sweat the details for your audience. Count the taps. Remember  the hard part is not deciding what features to add  it's deciding what to leave out. And best of all  your motivation is  simplicity sells. CA  Bravo. DP  Thank you very much. CA  Hear  hear  If you're here today    and I'm very happy that you are    you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves. However  when we're not at TED  we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible  especially in large urban areas like New York City. And that's because most people with decision making powers  in both the public and the private sector  really don't feel as though they're in danger. The reason why I'm here today  in part  is because of a dog    an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain  back in     . She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated. When she came into my life  we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than    percent of the entire city's commercial waste  a sewage treatment pelletizing plant  a sewage sludge plant  four power plants  the world's largest food distribution center  as well as other industries that bring more than        diesel truck trips to the area each week. The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city. So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a         seed grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects  I thought they were really well meaning  but a bit naive. I'd lived in this area all my life  and you could not get to the river  because of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier. Then  while jogging with my dog one morning  she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump. There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here  but she kept dragging me  and lo and behold  at the end of that lot was the river. I knew that this forgotten little street end  abandoned like the dog that brought me there  was worth saving. And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community led revitalization of the new South Bronx. And just like my new dog  it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined. We garnered much support along the way  and the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than    years. We leveraged that         seed grant more than     times  into a    million park. And in the fall  I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved. Thank you very much. That's him pressing my buttons back there  which he does all the time. But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine. We feel the problems right now  and have for some time. Environmental justice  for those of you who may not be familiar with the term  goes something like this  no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other. Unfortunately  race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff  like parks and trees  and where one might find the bad stuff  like power plants and waste facilities. As a black person in America  I am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health. I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility  which I do. These land use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity  diabetes and asthma. Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood  Our    percent obesity rate is high even for this country  and diabetes comes with it. One out of four South Bronx children has asthma. Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average. These impacts are coming everyone's way. And we all pay dearly for solid waste costs  health problems associated with pollution and more odiously  the cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men  who possess untold amounts of untapped potential. Fifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line     percent of us are unemployed. Low income citizens often use emergency room visits as primary care. This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits. Poor people are not only still poor  they are still unhealthy. Fortunately  there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low income communities of color in the short term  and won't destroy us all in the long term. None of us want that  and we all have that in common. So what else do we have in common  Well  first of all  we're all incredibly good looking. Graduated high school  college  post graduate degrees  traveled to interesting places  didn't have kids in your early teens  financially stable  never been imprisoned. OK. Good. But  besides being a black woman  I am different from most of you in some other ways. I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down. My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam  only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home. Jesus. I grew up with a crack house across the street. Yeah  I'm a poor black child from the ghetto. These things make me different from you. But the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community  and I am in between these two worlds with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other. So how did things get so different for us  In the late '  s  my dad    a Pullman porter  son of a slave    bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx  and a few years later  he married my mom. At the time  the community was a mostly white  working class neighborhood. My dad was not alone. And as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream  white flight became common in the South Bronx and in many cities around the country. Red lining was used by banks  wherein certain sections of the city  including ours  were deemed off limits to any sort of investment. Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions    dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding. Hunts Point was formerly a walk to work community  but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to. A national highway construction boom was added to our problems. In New York State  Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway expansion campaign. One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan. The South Bronx  which lies in between  did not stand a chance. Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed.         people were displaced. The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx. And if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community  that it's bad and ugly  how could it not reflect on you  So now  my family's property was worthless  save for that it was our home  and all we had. And luckily for me  that home and the love inside of it  along with help from teachers  mentors and friends along the way  was enough. Now  why is this story important  Because from a planning perspective  economic degradation begets environmental degradation  which begets social degradation. The disinvestment that began in the     s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come. Antiquated zoning and land use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood. Are these factors taken into consideration when land use policy is decided  What costs are associated with these decisions  And who pays  Who profits  Does anything justify what the local community goes through  This was  planning     in quotes    that did not have our best interests in mind. Once we realized that  we decided it was time to do our own planning. That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx. I wrote a one and a quarter million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on street bike paths. Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety  the placement of the waste and other facilities  which  if done properly  don't compromise a community's quality of life. They provide opportunities to be more physically active  as well as local economic development. Think bike shops  juice stands. We secured    million dollars to build first phase projects. This is Lafayette Avenue    and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects. And once this path is constructed  it'll connect the South Bronx with more than     acres of Randall's Island Park. Right now we're separated by about    feet of water  but this link will change that. As we nurture the natural environment  its abundance will give us back even more. We run a project called the Bronx  Environmental  Stewardship Training  which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration  so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well paying jobs. Little by little  we're seeding the area with green collar jobs    and with people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment. The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era  built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it. Even during rush hour  it goes virtually unused. The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway. We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re envision how this    acres can be better utilized for parkland  affordable housing and local economic development. We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices. Cool roofs are highly reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat  and pass it on to the building or atmosphere. Green roofs are soil and living plants. Both can be used instead of petroleum based roofing materials that absorb heat  contribute to urban  heat island  effect and degrade under the sun  which we in turn breathe. Green roofs also retain up to    percent of rainfall  so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end of pipe solutions    which  incidentally  are often located in environmental justice communities like mine. And they provide habitats for our little friends   Butterfly  So cool  Anyway  the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business  bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx.  Green is the new black ...  I like that  too. Anyway  I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here  but since I have all of your attention  We need investors. End of pitch. It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. Anyway    OK. Katrina. Prior to Katrina  the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common. Both were largely populated by poor people of color  both hotbeds of cultural innovation  think hip hop and jazz. Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another. In the post Katrina era  we have still more in common. We're at best ignored  and maligned and abused  at worst  by negligent regulatory agencies  pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability. Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable. But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out. We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone. Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two  like the South Bronx did  Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine  Now listen  I do not expect individuals  corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral. This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through. Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue. But I'll tell you later  if you want to know. But    I know it's the bottom line  or one's perception of it  that motivates people in the end. I'm interested in what I like to call the  triple bottom line  that sustainable development can produce. Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned  the developers  government and the community where these projects go up. At present  that's not happening in New York City. And we are operating with a comprehensive urban planning deficit. A parade of government subsidies is going to propose big box and stadium developments in the South Bronx  but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic  pollution  solid waste and the impacts on open space. And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it's not even funny. Because on top of that  the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well loved community parks. Now  we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier. And although less than    percent of South Bronx residents own cars  these projects include thousands of new parking spaces  yet zip in terms of mass public transit. Now  what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy  environmentally challenged community  versus incorporating structural  sustainable changes. My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues. Now let's get this straight  I am not anti development. Ours is a city  not a wilderness preserve. And I've embraced my inner capitalist. And  but I don't have    You probably all have  and if you haven't  you need to. So I don't have a problem with developers making money. There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable  community friendly development can still make a fortune. Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins    both heroes of mine by the way    have shown that you can actually do that. I do have a problem with developments that hyper exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit. That it continues is a shame upon us all  because we are all responsible for the future that we create. But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities  is to learn from visionaries in other cities. This is my version of globalization. Let's take Bogota. Poor  Latino  surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking  a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx. However  this city was blessed in the late     s with a highly influential mayor named Enrique Pe alosa. He looked at the demographics. Few Bogotanos own cars  yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them. If you're a mayor  you can do something about that. His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three  outlawed parking on those streets  expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes  created public plazas  created one of the most efficient bus mass transit systems in the entire world. For his brilliant efforts  he was nearly impeached. But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day to day lives  incredible things happened. People stopped littering. Crime rates dropped  because the streets were alive with people. His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time  and on a third world budget  at that. We have no excuse in this country  I'm sorry. But the bottom line is  their people first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars  but rather  to provide opportunities for all Bogotanos to participate in the city's resurgence. That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the U.S. But Bogota's example has the power to change that. You  however  are blessed with the gift of influence. That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange. Use your influence in support of comprehensive  sustainable change everywhere. Don't just talk about it at TED. This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build  and as you all know  politics are personal. Help me make green the new black. Help me make sustainability sexy. Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations. Help me fight for environmental and economic justice. Support investments with a triple bottom line return. Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table  and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere. Oh good  glad I have a little more time  Listen    when I spoke to Mr. Gore the other day after breakfast  I asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy. His response was a grant program. I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding. I was making him an offer. What troubled me was that this top down approach is still around. Now  don't get me wrong  we need money. But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision making process. Of the    percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day  don't add wasting our energy  intelligence and hard earned experience to that count. I have come from so far to meet you like this. Please don't waste me. By working together  we can become one of those small  rapidly growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world. We might have come to this conference from very  very different stations in life  but believe me  we all share one incredibly powerful thing. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Ciao  bellos  Good morning. How are you  It's been great  hasn't it  I've been blown away by the whole thing. In fact  I'm leaving. There have been three themes running through the conference which are relevant to what I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here. Just the variety of it and the range of it. The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen  in terms of the future. No idea how this may play out. I have an interest in education. Actually  what I find is everybody has an interest in education. Don't you  I find this very interesting. If you're at a dinner party  and you say you work in education    Actually  you're not often at dinner parties  frankly. If you work in education  you're not asked. And you're never asked back  curiously. That's strange to me. But if you are  and you say to somebody  you know  they say   What do you do   and you say you work in education  you can see the blood run from their face. They're like   Oh my God   you know   Why me    My one night out all week.  But if you ask about their education  they pin you to the wall. Because it's one of those things that goes deep with people  am I right  Like religion  and money and other things. So I have a big interest in education  and I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it  partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think of it  children starting school this year will be retiring in     . Nobody has a clue  despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days  what the world will look like in five years' time. And yet we're meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability  I think  is extraordinary. And the third part of this is that we've all agreed  nonetheless  on the really extraordinary capacities that children have    their capacities for innovation. I mean  Sirena last night was a marvel  wasn't she  Just seeing what she could do. And she's exceptional  but I think she's not  so to speak  exceptional in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent. And my contention is  all kids have tremendous talents. And we squander them  pretty ruthlessly. So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity. My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy  and we should treat it with the same status. That was it  by the way. Thank you very much. So     minutes left. Well  I was born... no. I heard a great story recently    I love telling it    of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson. She was six  and she was at the back  drawing  and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention  and in this drawing lesson  she did. The teacher was fascinated. She went over to her  and she said   What are you drawing   And the girl said   I'm drawing a picture of God.  And the teacher said   But nobody knows what God looks like.  And the girl said   They will  in a minute.  When my son was four in England    Actually  he was four everywhere  to be honest. If we're being strict about it  wherever he went  he was four that year. He was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story  No  it was big  it was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel  you may have seen it.  Nativity II.  But James got the part of Joseph  which we were thrilled about. We considered this to be one of the lead parts. We had the place crammed full of agents in T shirts   James Robinson IS Joseph    Laughter  He didn't have to speak  but you know the bit where the three kings come in  They come in bearing gifts  gold  frankincense and myrrh. This really happened. We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence  because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said   You OK with that   And he said   Yeah  why  Was that wrong   They just switched. The three boys came in  four year olds with tea towels on their heads  and they put these boxes down  and the first boy said   I bring you gold.  And the second boy said   I bring you myrrh.  And the third boy said   Frank sent this.  What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance. If they don't know  they'll have a go. Am I right  They're not frightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is  if you're not prepared to be wrong  you'll never come up with anything original    if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults  most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities. Picasso once said this  he said that all children are born artists. The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately  that we don't grow into creativity  we grow out of it. Or rather  we get educated out of it. So why is this  I lived in Stratford on Avon until about five years ago. In fact  we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles. So you can imagine what a seamless transition that was. Actually  we lived in a place called Snitterfield  just outside Stratford  which is where Shakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought  I was. You don't think of Shakespeare having a father  do you  Do you  Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child  do you  Shakespeare being seven  I never thought of it. I mean  he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's English class  wasn't he  How annoying would that be   Must try harder.  Being sent to bed by his dad  you know  to Shakespeare   Go to bed  now  And put the pencil down.   And stop speaking like that.   It's confusing everybody.  Anyway  we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles  and I just want to say a word about the transition. My son didn't want to come. I've got two kids  he's    now  my daughter's   . He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it  but he had a girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life  Sarah. He'd known her for a month. Mind you  they'd had their fourth anniversary  because it's a long time when you're   . He was really upset on the plane  he said   I'll never find another girl like Sarah.  And we were rather pleased about that  frankly    Because she was the main reason we were leaving the country. But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world  Every education system on Earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be otherwise  but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages  then the humanities  and at the bottom are the arts. Everywhere on Earth. And in pretty much every system too  there's a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why  Why not  I think this is rather important. I think math is very important  but so is dance. Children dance all the time if they're allowed to  we all do. We all have bodies  don't we  Did I miss a meeting  Truthfully  what happens is  as children grow up  we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side. If you were to visit education  as an alien  and say  What's it for  public education   I think you'd have to conclude  if you look at the output  who really succeeds by this  who does everything that they should  who gets all the brownie points  who are the winners    I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it  They're the people who come out the top. And I used to be one  so there. And I like university professors  but you know  we shouldn't hold them up as the high water mark of all human achievement. They're just a form of life  another form of life. But they're rather curious  and I say this out of affection for them. There's something curious about professors in my experience    not all of them  but typically  they live in their heads. They live up there  and slightly to one side. They're disembodied  you know  in a kind of literal way. They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads. Don't they  It's a way of getting their head to meetings. If you want real evidence of out of body experiences  get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics  and pop into the discotheque on the final night. And there  you will see it. Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably  off the beat. Waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it. Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world  there were no public systems of education  really  before the   th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas. Number one  that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid  things you liked  on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that. Is that right  Don't do music  you're not going to be a musician  don't do art  you won't be an artist. Benign advice    now  profoundly mistaken. The whole world is engulfed in a revolution. And the second is academic ability  which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence  because the universities designed the system in their image. If you think of it  the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly talented  brilliant  creative people think they're not  because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued  or was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford to go on that way. In the next    years  according to UNESCO  more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history. More people  and it's the combination of all the things we've talked about    technology and its transformation effect on work  and demography and the huge explosion in population. Suddenly  degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true  When I was a student  if you had a degree  you had a job. If you didn't have a job  it's because you didn't want one. And I didn't want one  frankly.  Laughter  But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games  because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA  and now you need a PhD for the other. It's a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence. We know three things about intelligence. One  it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it. We think visually  we think in sound  we think kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms  we think in movement. Secondly  intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions of a human brain  as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations  intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn't divided into compartments. In fact  creativity    which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value    more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things. By the way  there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum. It's thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday  this is probably why women are better at multi tasking. Because you are  aren't you  There's a raft of research  but I know it from my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal at home    which is not often  thankfully. No  she's good at some things  but if she's cooking  she's dealing with people on the phone  she's talking to the kids  she's painting the ceiling  she's doing open heart surgery over here. If I'm cooking  the door is shut  the kids are out  the phone's on the hook  if she comes in I get annoyed. I say   Terry  please  I'm trying to fry an egg in here.   Give me a break.  Actually  do you know that old philosophical thing  if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it  did it happen  Remember that old chestnut  I saw a great t shirt recently  which said   If a man speaks his mind in a forest  and no woman hears him  is he still wrong   And the third thing about intelligence is  it's distinct. I'm doing a new book at the moment called  Epiphany   which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. I'm fascinated by how people got to be there. It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of  Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her  Some have. She's a choreographer  and everybody knows her work. She did  Cats  and  Phantom of the Opera.  She's wonderful. I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet  as you can see. Anyway  Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said   How did you get to be a dancer   It was interesting. When she was at school  she was really hopeless. And the school  in the '  s  wrote to her parents and said   We think Gillian has a learning disorder.  She couldn't concentrate  she was fidgeting. I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you  But this was the     s  and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point. It wasn't an available condition. People weren't aware they could have that. Anyway  she went to see this specialist. So  this oak paneled room  and she was there with her mother  and she was led and sat on this chair at the end  and she sat on her hands for    minutes while this man talked to her mother about the problems Gillian was having at school. Because she was disturbing people  her homework was always late  and so on  little kid of eight. In the end  the doctor went and sat next to Gillian  and said   I've listened to all these things your mother's told me  I need to speak to her privately. Wait here. We'll be back  we won't be very long   and they went and left her. But as they went out of the room  he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk. And when they got out  he said to her mother   Just stand and watch her.  And the minute they left the room  she was on her feet  moving to the music. And they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said   Mrs. Lynne  Gillian isn't sick  she's a dancer. Take her to a dance school.  I said   What happened   She said   She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was. We walked in this room and it was full of people like me. People who couldn't sit still. People who had to move to think.  Who had to move to think. They did ballet  they did tap  jazz  they did modern  they did contemporary. She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School  she became a soloist  she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School  founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company  met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history  she's given pleasure to millions  and she's a multi millionaire. Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down. What I think it comes to is this  Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology  one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip mine the earth  for a particular commodity. And for the future  it won't serve us. We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children. There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk  who said   If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth  within    years all life on Earth would end. If all human beings disappeared from the Earth  within    years all forms of life would flourish.  And he's right. What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination. We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about. And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are. And our task is to educate their whole being  so they can face this future. By the way    we may not see this future  but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it. Thank you very much. About    years ago  I took on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students. That was after having spent about    years together with African institutions studying hunger in Africa  so I was sort of expected to know a little about the world. And I started in our medical university  Karolinska Institute  an undergraduate course called Global Health. But when you get that opportunity  you get a little nervous. I thought  these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in Swedish college systems    so I thought  maybe they know everything I'm going to teach them about. So I did a pre test when they came. And one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one   Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs   I put them together  so that in each pair of country  one has twice the child mortality of the other. And this means that it's much bigger a difference than the uncertainty of the data. I won't put you at a test here  but it's Turkey  which is highest there  Poland  Russia  Pakistan and South Africa. And these were the results of the Swedish students. I did it so I got the confidence interval  which is pretty narrow  and I got happy  of course  a  .  right answer out of five possible. That means that there was a place for a professor of international health and for my course. But one late night  when I was compiling the report  I really realized my discovery. I have shown that Swedish top students know statistically significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees. Because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey. They would be right half of the cases. But the students are not there. The problem for me was not ignorance  it was preconceived ideas. I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute  that hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine  and they are on par with the chimpanzee there. This is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate  because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware. We did this software which displays it like this  every bubble here is a country. This country over here is China. This is India. The size of the bubble is the population  and on this axis here  I put fertility rate. Because my students  what they said when they looked upon the world  and I asked them   What do you really think about the world   Well  I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin  mainly. And they said   The world is still 'we' and 'them.' And 'we' is Western world and 'them' is Third World.   And what do you mean with Western world   I said.  Well  that's long life and small family  and Third World is short life and large family.  So this is what I could display here. I put fertility rate here  number of children per woman  one  two  three  four  up to about eight children per woman. We have very good data since              about    on the size of families in all countries. The error margin is narrow. Here  I put life expectancy at birth  from    years in some countries up to about    years. And       there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries  and they had small families and long lives. And these were the developing countries  they had large families and they had relatively short lives. Now  what has happened since       We want to see the change. Are the students right  Is it still two types of countries  Or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here  Or have they got longer lives and live up there  Let's see. We stopped the world then. This is all U.N. statistics that have been available. Here we go. Can you see there  It's China there  moving against better health there  improving there. All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families. Your yellow ones here are the Arabic countries  and they get longer life  but not larger families. The Africans are the green here. They still remain here. This is India  Indonesia is moving on pretty fast. In the '  s here  you have Bangladesh still among the African countries. But now  Bangladesh    it's a miracle that happens in the '  s  the imams start to promote family planning. They move up into that corner. And in the '  s  we have the terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy of the African countries and all the rest of them move up into the corner  where we have long lives and small family  and we have a completely new world. Let me make a comparison directly between the United States of America and Vietnam.     . America had small families and long life  Vietnam had large families and short lives. And this is what happens  the data during the war indicate that even with all the death  there was an improvement of life expectancy. By the end of the year  the family planning started in Vietnam  they went for smaller families. And the United States up there is getting for longer life  keeping family size. And in the '  s now  they give up Communist planning and they go for market economy  and it moves faster even than social life. And today  we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in Vietnam        as in United States        by the end of the war. If we don't look in the data  I think we all underestimate the tremendous change in Asia  which was in social change before we saw the economical change. Let's move over to another way here in which we could display the distribution in the world of the income. This is the world distribution of income of people. One dollar     dollars or     dollars per day. There's no gap between rich and poor any longer. This is a myth. There's a little hump here. But there are people all the way. And if we look where the income ends up  this is     percent the world's annual income. And the richest    percent  they take out of that about    percent. And the poorest    percent  they take about two percent. And this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful. We think about aid  like these people here giving aid to these people here. But in the middle  we have most of the world population  and they have now    percent of the income. We heard it in other forms. And who are these  Where are the different countries  I can show you Africa. This is Africa.     the world population  most in poverty. This is OECD. The rich country. The country club of the U.N. And they are over here on this side. Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD. And this is Latin America. It has everything on this Earth  from the poorest to the richest in Latin America. And on top of that  we can put East Europe  we can put East Asia  and we put South Asia. And how did it look like if we go back in time  to about       Then there was more of a hump. And we have most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians. The problem in the world was the poverty in Asia. And if I now let the world move forward  you will see that while population increases  there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty  and this is the pattern we have today. And the best projection from the World Bank is that this will happen  and we will not have a divided world. We'll have most people in the middle. Of course it's a logarithmic scale here  but our concept of economy is growth with percent. We look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase. If I change this  and take GDP per capita instead of family income  and I turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product  and I take the regions down here  the size of the bubble is still the population. And you have the OECD there  and you have sub Saharan Africa there  and we take off the Arab states there  coming both from Africa and from Asia  and we put them separately  and we can expand this axis  and I can give it a new dimension here  by adding the social values there  child survival. Now I have money on that axis  and I have the possibility of children to survive there. In some countries    .   of children survive to five years of age  others  only   . And here  it seems  there is a gap between OECD  Latin America  East Europe  East Asia  Arab states  South Asia and sub Saharan Africa. The linearity is very strong between child survival and money. But let me split sub Saharan Africa. Health is there and better health is up there. I can go here and I can split sub Saharan Africa into its countries. And when it burst  the size of its country bubble is the size of the population. Sierra Leone down there. Mauritius is up there. Mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers  and they could sell their sugar    they could sell their textiles    on equal terms as the people in Europe and North America. There's a huge difference between Africa. And Ghana is here in the middle. In Sierra Leone  humanitarian aid. Here in Uganda  development aid. Here  time to invest  there  you can go for a holiday. It's a tremendous variation within Africa which we rarely often make    that it's equal everything. I can split South Asia here. India's the big bubble in the middle. But a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. I can split Arab states. How are they  Same climate  same culture  same religion    huge difference. Even between neighbors. Yemen  civil war. United Arab Emirates  money  which was quite equally and well used. Not as the myth is. And that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country. Data is often better than you think. Many people say data is bad. There is an uncertainty margin  but we can see the difference here  Cambodia  Singapore. The differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data. East Europe  Soviet economy for a long time  but they come out after    years very  very differently. And there is Latin America. Today  we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America. Chile will have a lower child mortality than Cuba within some few years from now. Here  we have high income countries in the OECD. And we get the whole pattern here of the world  which is more or less like this. And if we look at it  how the world looks  in       it starts to move. This is Mao Tse tung. He brought health to China. And then he died. And then Deng Xiaoping came and brought money to China  and brought them into the mainstream again. And we have seen how countries move in different directions like this  so it's sort of difficult to get an example country which shows the pattern of the world. But I would like to bring you back to about here  at     . I would like to compare South Korea  which is this one  with Brazil  which is this one. The label went away for me here. And I would like to compare Uganda  which is there. And I can run it forward  like this. And you can see how South Korea is making a very  very fast advancement  whereas Brazil is much slower. And if we move back again  here  and we put on trails on them  like this  you can see again that the speed of development is very  very different  and the countries are moving more or less in the same rate as money and health  but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first. And to show that  you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates. They came from here  a mineral country. They cached all the oil  they got all the money  but health cannot be bought at the supermarket. You have to invest in health. You have to get kids into schooling. You have to train health staff. You have to educate the population. And Sheikh Zayed did that in a fairly good way. In spite of falling oil prices  he brought this country up here. So we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world  where all countries tend to use their money better than they used in the past. Now  this is  more or less  if you look at the average data of the countries    they are like this. Now that's dangerous  to use average data  because there is such a lot of difference within countries. So if I go and look here  we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in     . If I split Uganda  there's quite a difference within Uganda. These are the quintiles of Uganda. The richest    percent of Ugandans are there. The poorest are down there. If I split South Africa  it's like this. And if I go down and look at Niger  where there was such a terrible famine  lastly  it's like this. The    percent poorest of Niger is out here  and the    percent richest of South Africa is there  and yet we tend to discuss on what solutions there should be in Africa. Everything in this world exists in Africa. And you can't discuss universal access to HIV  medicine  for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here. The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized  and it's not relevant to have it on regional level. We must be much more detailed. We find that students get very excited when they can use this. And even more  policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changing. Now  why doesn't this take place  Why are we not using the data we have  We have data in the United Nations  in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other non governmental organizations. Because the data is hidden down in the databases. And the public is there  and the Internet is there  but we have still not used it effectively. All that information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly funded statistics. There are some web pages like this  you know  but they take some nourishment down from the databases  but people put prices on them  stupid passwords and boring statistics. And this won't work. So what is needed  We have the databases. It's not the new database you need. We have wonderful design tools  and more and more are added up here. So we started a nonprofit venture which  linking data to design  we called Gapminder  from the London Underground  where they warn you   mind the gap.  So we thought Gapminder was appropriate. And we started to write software which could link the data like this. And it wasn't that difficult. It took some person years  and we have produced animations. You can take a data set and put it there. We are liberating U.N. data  some few U.N. organization. Some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world  but what we really need is  of course  a search function. A search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world. And what do we hear when we go around  I've done anthropology on the main statistical units. Everyone says   It's impossible. This can't be done. Our information is so peculiar in detail  so that cannot be searched as others can be searched. We cannot give the data free to the students  free to the entrepreneurs of the world.  But this is what we would like to see  isn't it  The publicly funded data is down here. And we would like flowers to grow out on the Net. And one of the crucial points is to make them searchable  and then people can use the different design tool to animate it there. And I have pretty good news for you. I have good news that the present  new Head of U.N. Statistics  he doesn't say it's impossible. He only says   We can't do it.  And that's a quite clever guy  huh  So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years. We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways. This is the income distribution of China      . This is the income distribution of the United States      . Almost no overlap. And what has happened  What has happened is this  that China is growing  it's not so equal any longer  and it's appearing here  overlooking the United States. Almost like a ghost  isn't it  It's pretty scary. But I think it's very important to have all this information. We need really to see it. And instead of looking at this  I would like to end up by showing the Internet users per      . In this software  we access about     variables from all the countries quite easily. It takes some time to change for this  but on the axises  you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have. And the thing would be to get up the databases free  to get them searchable  and with a second click  to get them into the graphic formats  where you can instantly understand them. Now  statisticians don't like it  because they say that this will not show the reality  we have to have statistical  analytical methods. But this is hypothesis generating. I end now with the world. There  the Internet is coming. The number of Internet users are going up like this. This is the GDP per capita. And it's a new technology coming in  but then amazingly  how well it fits to the economy of the countries. That's why the      computer will be so important. But it's a nice tendency. It's as if the world is flattening off  isn't it  These countries are lifting more than the economy and will be very interesting to follow this over the year  as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data. Thank you very much. Thank you. I have to tell you I'm both challenged and excited. My excitement is  I get a chance to give something back. My challenge is  the shortest seminar I usually do is    hours. I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends    I do more  obviously  I also coach people    but I'm into immersion  because how did you learn language  Not just by learning principles  you got in it and you did it so often that it became real. The bottom line of why I'm here  besides being a crazy mofo  is that    I'm not here to motivate you  you don't need that  obviously. Often that's what people think I do  and it's the furthest thing from it. What happens  though  is people say to me   I don't need any motivation.  But that's not what I do. I'm the  why  guy. I want to know why you do what you do. What is your motive for action  What is it that drives you in your life today  Not    years ago. Are you running the same pattern  Because I believe that the invisible force of internal drive  activated  is the most important thing. I'm here because I believe emotion is the force of life. All of us here have great minds. Most of us here have great minds  right  We all know how to think. With our minds we can rationalize anything. We can make anything happen. I agree with what was described a few days ago  that people work in their self interest. But we know that that's bullshit at times. You don't work in your self interest all the time  because when emotion comes into it  the wiring changes in the way it functions. So it's wonderful to think intellectually about how the life of the world is  especially those who are very smart can play this game in our head. But I really want to know what's driving you. What I would like to invite you to do by the end of this talk is explore where you are today  for two reasons. One  so that you can contribute more. And two  that hopefully we can not just understand other people more  but appreciate them more  and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges that we face today. They're only going to get magnified by the very technology that connects us  because it's making us intersect. That intersection doesn't always create a view of  everybody now understands everybody  and everybody appreciates everybody.  I've had an obsession basically for    years   What makes the difference in the quality of people's lives  What in their performance   I got hired to produce the result now. I've done it for    years. I get the phone call when the athlete is burning down on national television  and they were ahead by five strokes and now they can't get back on the course. I've got to do something right now or nothing matters. I get the phone call when the child is going to commit suicide  I've got to do something. In    years  I'm very grateful to tell you I've never lost one. It doesn't mean I won't some day  but I haven't yet. The reason is an understanding of these human needs. When I get those calls about performance  that's one thing. How do you make a change  I'm also looking to see what is shaping the person's ability to contribute  to do something beyond themselves. Maybe the real question is  I look at life and say there's two master lessons. One is  there's the science of achievement  which almost everyone here has mastered amazingly.  How do you take the invisible and make it visible   How do you make your dreams happen  Your business  your contribution to society  money    whatever  your body  your family. The other lesson that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment. Because science is easy  right  We know the rules  you write the code and you get the results. Once you know the game  you just up the ante  don't you  But when it comes to fulfillment    that's an art. The reason is  it's about appreciation and contribution. You can only feel so much by yourself. I've had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the real question how somebody's life changes if you look at them like those people that you've given everything to  Like all the resources they say they need. You gave not a     dollar computer  but the best computer. You gave them love  joy  were there to comfort them. Those people very often    you know some of them    end up the rest of their life with all this love  education  money and background going in and out of rehab. Some people have been through ultimate pain  psychologically  sexually  spiritually  emotionally abused    and not always  but often  they become some of the people that contribute the most to society. The question we've got to ask ourselves really is  what is it  What is it that shapes us  We live in a therapy culture. Most of us don't do that  but the culture's a therapy culture  the mindset that we are our past. And you wouldn't be in this room if you bought that  but most of society thinks biography is destiny. The past equals the future. Of course it does if you live there. But what we know and what we have to remind ourselves    because you can know something intellectually and then not use it  not apply it. We've got to remind ourselves that decision is the ultimate power. When you ask people  have you failed to achieve something significant in your life  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. TR  Thanks for the interaction on a high level there. But if you ask people  why didn't you achieve something  Somebody who's working for you  or a partner  or even yourself. When you fail to achieve  what's the reason people say  What do they tell you  Didn't have the knowledge  didn't have the money  didn't have the time  didn't have the technology. I didn't have the right manager. Al Gore  Supreme Court. TR  The Supreme Court. TR  And    What do all those  including the Supreme Court  have in common  They are a claim to you missing resources  and they may be accurate. You may not have the money  or the Supreme Court  but that is not the defining factor. And you correct me if I'm wrong. The defining factor is never resources  it's resourcefulness. And what I mean specifically  rather than just some phrase  is if you have emotion  human emotion  something that I experienced from you the day before yesterday at a level that is as profound as I've ever experienced and I believe with that emotion you would have beat his ass and won. Audience  Yeah  How easy for me to tell him what he should do. Idiot  Robbins. But I know when we watched the debate at that time  there were emotions that blocked people's ability to get this man's intellect and capacity. And the way that it came across to some people on that day    because I know people that wanted to vote in your direction and didn't  and I was upset. But there was emotion there. Do you know what I'm talking about  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. TR  So  emotion is it. And if we get the right emotion  we can get ourselves to do anything. If you're creative  playful  fun enough  can you get through to anybody  yes or no  If you don't have the money  but you're creative and determined  you find the way. This is the ultimate resource. But this is not the story that people tell us. They tell us a bunch of different stories. They tell us we don't have the resources  but ultimately  if you take a look here  they say  what are all the reasons they haven't accomplished that  He's broken my pattern  that son of a bitch. But I appreciated the energy  I'll tell you that. What determines your resources  We've said decisions shape destiny  which is my focus here. If decisions shape destiny  what determines it is three decisions. What will you focus on  You have to decide what you're going to focus on. Consciously or unconsciously. the minute you decide to focus  you must give it a meaning  and that meaning produces emotion. Is this the end or the beginning  Is God punishing me or rewarding me  or is this the roll of the dice  An emotion creates what we're going to do  or the action. So  think about your own life  the decisions that have shaped your destiny. And that sounds really heavy  but in the last five or    years  have there been some decisions that if you'd made a different decision  your life would be completely different  How many can think about it  Better or worse. Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. So the bottom line is  maybe it was where to go to work  and you met the love of your life there  a career decision. I know the Google geniuses I saw here    I mean  I understand that their decision was to sell their technology. What if they made that decision versus to build their own culture  How would the world or their lives be different  their impact  The history of our world is these decisions. When a woman stands up and says   No  I won't go to the back of the bus.  She didn't just affect her life. That decision shaped our culture. Or someone standing in front of a tank. Or being in a position like Lance Armstrong   You've got testicular cancer.  That's pretty tough for any male  especially if you ride a bike. You've got it in your brain  you've got it in your lungs. But what was his decision of what to focus on  Different than most people. What did it mean  It wasn't the end  it was the beginning. He goes off and wins seven championships he never once won before the cancer  because he got emotional fitness  psychological strength. That's the difference in human beings that I've seen of the three million I've been around. In my lab  I've had three million people from    countries over the last    years. And after a while  patterns become obvious. You see that South America and Africa may be connected in a certain way  right  Others say   Oh  that sounds ridiculous.  It's simple. So  what shaped Lance  What shapes you  Two invisible forces. Very quickly. One  state. We all have had times  you did something  and after  you thought to yourself   I can't believe I said or did that  that was so stupid.  Who's been there  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. Or after you did something  you go   That was me   It wasn't your ability  it was your state. Your model of the world is what shapes you long term. Your model of the world is the filter. That's what's shaping us. It makes people make decisions. To influence somebody  we need to know what already influences them. It's made up of three parts. First  what's your target  What are you after  It's not your desires. You can get your desires or goals. Who has ever got a goal or desire and thought  is this all there is  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. It's needs we have. I believe there are six human needs. Second  once you know what the target that's driving you is and you uncover it for the truth    you don't form it    then you find out what's your map  what's the belief systems that tell you how to get those needs. Some people think the way to get them is to destroy the world  some people  to build  create something  love someone. There's the fuel you pick. So very quickly  six needs. Let me tell you what they are. First one  certainty. These are not goals or desires  these are universal. Everyone needs certainty they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable. Now  how do you get it  Control everybody  Develop a skill  Give up  Smoke a cigarette  And if you got totally certain  ironically  even though we need that    you're not certain about your health  or your children  or money. If you're not sure the ceiling will hold up  you won't listen to any speaker. While we go for certainty differently  if we get total certainty  we get what  What do you feel if you're certain  You know what will happen  when and how it will happen  what would you feel  Bored out of your minds. So  God  in Her infinite wisdom  gave us a second human need  which is uncertainty. We need variety. We need surprise. How many of you here love surprises  Say   Aye.  Audience  Aye. TR  Bullshit. You like the surprises you want. The ones you don't want  you call problems  but you need them. So  variety is important. Have you ever rented a video or a film that you've already seen  Who's done this  Get a fucking life. Why are you doing it  You're certain it's good because you read or saw it before  but you're hoping it's been long enough you've forgotten  and there's variety. Third human need  critical  significance. We all need to feel important  special  unique. You can get it by making more money or being more spiritual. You can do it by getting yourself in a situation where you put more tattoos and earrings in places humans don't want to know. Whatever it takes. The fastest way to do this  if you have no background  no culture  no belief and resources or resourcefulness  is violence. If I put a gun to your head and I live in the 'hood  instantly I'm significant. Zero to   . How high    . How certain am I that you're going to respond to me    . How much uncertainty  Who knows what's going to happen next  Kind of exciting. Like climbing up into a cave and doing that stuff all the way down there. Total variety and uncertainty. And it's significant  isn't it  So you want to risk your life for it. So that's why violence has always been around and will be around unless we have a consciousness change as a species. You can get significance a million ways  but to be significant  you've got to be unique and different. Here's what we really need  connection and love  fourth need. We all want it  most settle for connection  love's too scary. Who here has been hurt in an intimate relationship  If you don't raise your hand  you've had other shit  too. And you're going to get hurt again. Aren't you glad you came to this positive visit  Here's what's true  we need it. We can do it through intimacy  friendship  prayer  through walking in nature. If nothing else works for you  don't get a cat  get a dog  because if you leave for two minutes  it's like you've been gone six months  when you come back   minutes later. These first four needs  every human finds a way to meet. Even if you lie to yourself  you need to have split personalities. I call the first four needs the needs of the personality. The last two are the needs of the spirit. And this is where fulfillment comes. You won't get it from the first four. You'll figure a way  smoke  drink  do whatever  meet the first four. But number five  you must grow. We all know the answer. If you don't grow  you're what  If a relationship or business is not growing  if you're not growing  doesn't matter how much money or friends you have  how many love you  you feel like hell. And I believe the reason we grow is so we have something to give of value. Because the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves. Because we all know  corny as that sounds  the secret to living is giving. We all know life is not about me  it's about we. This culture knows that  this room knows that. It's exciting. When you see Nicholas talking about his      computer  the most exciting thing is  here's a genius  but he's got a calling now. You can feel the difference in him  and it's beautiful. And that calling can touch other people. My life was touched because when I was    years old  Thanksgiving  no money  no food  we were not going to starve  but my father was totally messed up  my mom was letting him know how bad he messed up  and somebody came to the door and delivered food. My father made three decisions  I know what they were  briefly. His focus was  This is charity. What does it mean  I'm worthless. What do I have to do  Leave my family   which he did. It was one of the most painful experiences of life. My three decisions gave me a different path. I set focus on  There's food.  What a concept  But this is what changed my life  shaped me as a human being. Somebody's gift  I don't even know who it is. My father always said   No one gives a shit.  And now somebody I don't know  they're not asking for anything  just giving us food  looking out for us. It made me believe this  that strangers care. And that made me decide  if strangers care about me and my family  I care about them. I'm going to do something to make a difference. So when I was     I went out on Thanksgiving  it was my target for years to have enough money to feed two families. The most fun and moving thing I ever did in my life. Next year  I did four  then eight. I didn't tell anybody what I was doing  I wasn't doing it for brownie points. But after eight  I thought I could use some help. So I went out  got my friends involved  then I grew companies  got     and I built the foundation.    years later  I'm proud to tell you last year we fed   million people in    countries through our foundation. All during the holidays  Thanksgiving  Christmas  in different countries around the world. Thank you. I don't tell you that to brag  but because I'm proud of human beings because they get excited to contribute once they've had the chance to experience it  not talk about it. So  finally    I'm about out of time. The target that shapes you    Here's what's different about people. We have the same needs. But are you a certainty freak  is that what you value most  or uncertainty  This man couldn't be a certainty freak if he climbed through those caves. Are you driven by significance or love  We all need all six  but what your lead system is tilts you in a different direction. And as you move in a direction  you have a destination or destiny. The second piece is the map. The operating system tells you how to get there  and some people's map is   I'm going to save lives even if I die for other people   and they're a fireman  and somebody else says   I'm going to kill people to do it.  They're trying to meet the same needs of significance. They want to honor God or honor their family. But they have a different map. And there are seven different beliefs  I can't go through them  because I'm done. The last piece is emotion. One of the parts of the map is like time. Some people's idea of a long time is     years. Somebody else's is three seconds  which is what I have. And the last one I've already mentioned that fell to you. If you've got a target and a map    I can't use Google because I love Macs  and they haven't made it good for Macs yet. So if you use MapQuest    how many have made this fatal mistake of using it  You use this thing and you don't get there. Imagine if your beliefs guarantee you can never get to where you want to go. The last thing is emotion. Here's what I'll tell you about emotion. There are       emotions that we have words for in the English language  which is just a linguistic representation that changes by language. But if your dominant emotions    If I have        people or       and I have them write down all the emotions that they experience in an average week  and I give them as long as they need  and on one side they write empowering emotions  the other's disempowering  guess how many emotions they experience  Less than   . And half of those make them feel like shit. They have six good feelings. Happy  happy  excited  oh shit  frustrated  frustrated  overwhelmed  depressed. How many of you know somebody who  no matter what happens  finds a way to get pissed off  Or no matter what happens  they find a way to be happy or excited. How many of you know somebody like this  When      happened  I'll finish with this  I was in Hawaii. I was with       people from    countries  we were translating four languages simultaneously for a program I was conducting  for a week. The night before was called Emotional Mastery. I got up  had no plan for this  and I said    we had fireworks  I do crazy shit  fun stuff  and at the end  I stopped. I had this plan  but I never know what I'm going to say. And all of a sudden  I said   When do people really start to live  When they face death.  And I went through this whole thing about  if you weren't going to get off this island  if nine days from now  you were going to die  who would you call  what would you say  what would you do  That night is when      happened. One woman had come to the seminar  and when she came there  her previous boyfriend had been kidnapped and murdered. Her new boyfriend wanted to marry her  and she said no. He said   If you go to that Hawaii thing  it's over with us.  She said   It's over.  When I finished that night  she called him and left a message at the top of the World Trade Center where he worked  saying   I love you  I want you to know I want to marry you. It was stupid of me.  She was asleep  because it was   a.m. for us  when he called her back  and said   Honey  I can't tell you what this means. I don't know how to tell you this  but you gave me the greatest gift  because I'm going to die.  And she played the recording for us in the room. She was on Larry King later. And he said   You're probably wondering how on Earth this could happen to you twice. All I can say is this must be God's message to you. From now on  every day  give your all  love your all. Don't let anything ever stop you.  She finishes  and a man stands up  and he says   I'm from Pakistan  I'm a Muslim. I'd love to hold your hand and say I'm sorry  but frankly  this is retribution.  I can't tell you the rest  because I'm out of time. Are you sure     seconds     seconds  I want to be respectful. All I can tell you is  I brought this man on stage with a man from New York who worked in the World Trade Center  because I had about     New Yorkers there. More than    lost their entire companies  friends  marking off their Palm Pilots. One financial trader  woman made of steel  bawling       friends crossing off that all died. And I said   What are we going to focus on  What does this mean and what are we going to do   And I got the group to focus on  if you didn't lose somebody today  your focus is going to be how to serve somebody else. Then one woman stood up and was so angry  screaming and yelling. I found out she wasn't from New York  she's not an American  doesn't know anybody here. I asked   Do you always get angry   She said   Yes.  Guilty people got guilty  sad people got sad. I took these two men and I did an indirect negotiation. Jewish man with family in the occupied territory  someone in New York who would have died if he was at work that day  and this man who wanted to be a terrorist  and I made it very clear. This integration is on a film  which I'd be happy to send you  instead of my verbalization  but the two of them not only came together and changed their beliefs and models of the world  but worked together to bring  for almost four years now  through various mosques and synagogues  the idea of how to create peace. And he wrote a book  called  My Jihad  My Way of Peace.  So  transformation can happen. My invitation to you is  explore your web  the web in here    the needs  the beliefs  the emotions that are controlling you  for two reasons  so there's more of you to give  and achieve  too  but I mean give  because that's what's going to fill you up. And secondly  so you can appreciate    not just understand  that's intellectual  that's the mind  but appreciate what's driving other people. It's the only way our world's going to change. God bless you  thank you. I hope this was of service. I'm going to take you on a journey very quickly. To explain the wish  I'm going to have to take you somewhere where many people haven't been  and that's around the world. When I was about    years old  Kate Stohr and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work  not only about responding to natural disasters  but involved in systemic issues. We believe that where the resources and expertise are scarce  innovative  sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives. So I started my life as an architect  or training as an architect  and I was always interested in socially responsible design  and how you can really make an impact. But when I went to architecture school  it seemed that I was a black sheep in the family. Many architects seemed to think that when you design  you design a jewel  and it's a jewel that you try and crave for  whereas I felt that when you design  you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing. So you're not just doing a building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it  but for the community as a whole. And in       we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in Kosovo. And I didn't know what I was doing    like I said  mid   s    and I'm the Internet generation  so we started a website. We put a call out there  and to my surprise  in a couple of months  we had hundreds of entries from around the world. That led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas. Two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub Saharan Africa  responding to the HIV AIDS pandemic. That led to     entries from    countries. We also have designers from around the world that participate. And we had an exhibit of work that followed that.      was the tipping point for us. We started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in Iran  in Bam  also following up on our work in Africa. Working within the United States    most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner. But I live in Bozeman  Montana    go up to the north plains on the reservations  or go down to Alabama or Mississippi  pre Katrina  and I could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries that I've been to. So we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere  and also  I will go into some more projects.       Mother Nature kicked our ass. I think we can pretty much assume that      was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters. And because of the Internet  and because of connections to blogs and so forth  within literally hours of the tsunami  we were already raising funds  getting involved  working with people on the ground. We run from a couple of laptops  and in the first couple of days  I had       emails from people needing help. So we began to get involved in projects there  and I'll talk about some others. And then of course  this year we've been responding to Katrina  as well as following up on our reconstruction work. So this is a brief overview. In       I really couldn't manage the number of people who wanted to help  or the number of requests that I was getting. It was all coming into my laptop and cell phone. So we decided to embrace an open source model of business    so that anyone  anywhere in the world  could start a local chapter  and they can get involved in local problems. Because I believe there is no such thing as Utopia. All problems are local. All solutions are local. So that means  you know  somebody who's based in Mississippi knows more about Mississippi than I do. So what happened is  we used Meetup and all these other Internet tools  and we ended up having    chapters starting up  thousands of architects in     countries. So the bullet point    sorry  I never do a suit  so I knew that I was going to take this off. OK  because I'm going to do it very quick. This isn't just about nonprofit. What it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on  of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller  and that we have the opportunity    not the responsibility  but the opportunity    to really get involved in making change. I'm adding that to my time. So what you don't know is  we've got these thousands of designers working around the world  connected basically by a website  and we have a staff of three. The fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it  we did it. And so there's something to be said about na vet . So seven years later  we've developed so that we've got advocacy  instigation and implementation. We advocate for good design  not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums  op eds  we have a book on humanitarian work  but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy. We can talk about FEMA  but that's another talk. Instigation  developing ideas with communities and NGOs  doing open source design competitions. Referring  matchmaking with communities. And then implementing    actually going out there and doing the work  because when you invent  it's never a reality until it's built. So it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change  we build that change. So here's a select number of projects. Kosovo. This is Kosovo in '  . We did an open design competition  like I said. It led to a whole variety of ideas. And this wasn't about emergency shelter  but transitional shelter that would last five to    years  that would be placed next to the land the resident lived in  and that they would rebuild their own home. This wasn't imposing an architecture on a community  this was giving them the tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow the way they want to. We had from the sublime to the ridiculous  but they worked. This is an inflatable hemp house. It was built  it works. This is a shipping container. Built and works. And a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with architectural building  but also the issues of governance  and the idea of creating communities through complex networks. So we've engaged not just designers  but also a whole variety of technology based professionals. Using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes. Using straw bale construction  creating heat walls. And then something remarkable happened in '  . We went to Africa originally to look at the housing issue. Within three days  we realized the problem was not housing  it was the growing pandemic of HIV AIDS. And it wasn't doctors telling us this  it was actual villagers that we were staying with. And so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk        kilometers to see doctors  you get the doctors to the people. And we started engaging the medical community  and you know  we thought we were real bright sparks     We've come up with this great idea  mobile health clinics  widely distributed throughout sub Saharan Africa.  And the medical community there said   We've said this for the last decade. We know this. We just don't know how to show this.  So in a way  we had taken pre existing needs and shown solutions. And so again  we had a whole variety of ideas that came in. This one I personally love  because the idea is that architecture is not just about solutions  but about raising awareness. This is a kenaf clinic. You get seed and you grow it in a plot of land  and it grows    feet in a month. And on the fourth week  the doctors come and they mow out an area  put a tensile structure on the top  and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers  you cut down the clinic and you eat it. It's an eat your own clinic. So it's dealing with the fact that if you have AIDS  you also need to have nutrition rates  and the idea of nutrition is as important as getting antiretrovirals out there. So you know  this is a serious solution. This one I love. The idea is it's not just a clinic  it's a community center. This looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community  so it can be a self sustaining project. Every one of these projects is sustainable. That's not because I'm a tree hugging green person. It's because when you live on four dollars a day  you're living on survival and you have to be sustainable. You have to know where your energy is coming from  you have to know where your resource is coming from  and you have to keep the maintenance down. So this is about getting an economic engine  and then at night  it turns into a movie theater. So it's not an AIDS clinic. It's a community center. So you can see ideas. And these ideas developed into prototypes  and they were eventually built. And currently  as of this year  there are clinics rolling out in Nigeria and Kenya. From that  we also developed Siyathemba. The community came to us and said   The problem is that the girls don't have education.  And we're working in an area where young women between the ages of    and    have a    percent HIV AIDS rate. And that's not because they're promiscuous  it's because there's no knowledge. And so we decided to look at the idea of sports  and create a youth sports center that doubled as an HIV AIDS outreach center  and the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors. So that there would be a very slow way of developing confidence in health care. And we picked nine finalists  and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region  and then the community picked their design. They said  this is our design  because it's not only about engaging a community  it's about empowering a community  and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process. So  the winning design is here. And then  of course  we actually go and work with the community and the clients. So this is the designer. He's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team in KwaZulu Natal  Siyathemba. And they can tell it better. Video  Well  my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza. I work at the Africa Centre  I'm an IT user consultant. I'm also the national football player for South Africa  Banyana Banyana. And I also play in the Vodacom League  for the team called Tembisa  which has now changed to Siyathemba. This is our home ground. Cameron Sinclair  I'm going to show that later because I'm running out of time. I can see Chris looking at me slyly. This was a connection  just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop Africa's first telemedicine center  in Tanzania. And we met  literally  a couple of months ago. We've already developed a design. The team is over there  working in partnership. This was a matchmaking  thanks to a couple of TEDsters    Sun  Microsystems   Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli  who connected me with this amazing African woman. And we start construction in June  and it will be opened by TEDGlobal. So when you come to TEDGlobal  you can check it out. But what we're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development  and we've been involved in a lot of issues  such as the tsunami and also things like Hurricane Katrina. This is a     dollar shelter that can be easily assembled. This is a community designed community center. And what that means is we actually live and work with the community  and they're part of the design process. The kids actually get involved in mapping out where the community center should be. And then eventually  the community  through skills training  end up building the building with us. Here is another school. This is what the UN gave these guys for six months       plastic tarps. This was in August. This was the replacement  that's supposed to last for two years. When the rain comes down  you can't hear a thing  and in the summer  it's about     degrees inside. So we said  if the rain's coming down  let's get fresh water. So every one of our schools has a rainwater collection system. Very low cost  three classrooms and rainwater collection is       dollars. This was raised by hot chocolate sales in Atlanta. It's built by the parents of the kids. The kids are out there on site  building the buildings. And it opened a couple of weeks ago  and there's     kids that are now using the schools. So  disaster hits home. We see the bad stories on CNN and Fox and all that  but we don't see the good stories. Here is a community that got together  and they said  no  to waiting. They formed a partnership  a diverse partnership of players  to actually map out East Biloxi  to figure out who's getting involved. We've had over       volunteers rebuilding  rehabbing homes. Figuring out what FEMA regulations are  not waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild. Working with residents  getting them out of their homes  so they don't get ill. This is what they're cleaning up on their own. Designing housing. This house is going in in a couple of weeks. This is a rehabbed home  done in four days. This is a utility room for a woman who is on a walker. She's    years old. This is what FEMA gave her.     bucks  happened two days ago. We put together  very quickly  a washroom. It's built  it's running and she just started a business today  where she's washing other people's clothes. These are the Calhouns. They're photographers who had documented the Lower Ninth for the last    years. That was their home  and these are the photographs they took. And we're helping  working with them to create a new building. Projects we've done. Projects we've been a part of  support. Why don't aid agencies do this  This is the UN tent. This is the new UN tent  just introduced this year. Quick to assemble. It's got a flap    that's the invention. It took    years to design this and get it implemented in the field. I was    years old. There's a problem here. Luckily  we're not alone. There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of architects and designers and inventors around the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work. More hemp houses    it's a theme in Japan  apparently. I'm not sure what they're smoking. This is a Grip Clip  designed by somebody who said   All you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical support beams.  This guy designed for NASA  is now doing housing. I'm going to whip through this quickly  because I know I've got only a couple of minutes. So this is all done in the last two years. I showed you something that took    years to do. And this is just a selection of things that were built in the last couple of years. From Brazil to India  Mexico  Alabama  China  Israel  Palestine  Vietnam. The average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is       that's how old I am. So it's a young    I just have to stop here  because Arup is in the room  and this is the best designed toilet in the world. If you're ever  ever in India  go use this toilet. Chris Luebkeman will tell you why. I'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party. But the future is not going to be the sky scraping cities of New York  but this. And when you look at this  you see crisis. What I see is many  many inventors. One billion people live in abject poverty. We hear about them all the time. Four billion live in growing but fragile economies. One in seven live in unplanned settlements. If we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen  in    years  one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp. Look left  look right  one of you will be there. How do we improve the living standards of five billion people  With    million solutions. So I wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions for everyone. Chris Anderson  Wait a sec    that's your wish  CS  That's my wish. CA  That's his wish  CS  We started Architecture for Humanity with     dollars and a website. So Chris somehow decided to give me        . So why not this many people  Open source architecture is the way to go. You have a diverse community of participants    and we're not just talking about inventors and designers  but we're talking about the funding model. My role is not as a designer  it's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world. And what we need is something that replicates me globally  because I haven't slept in seven years. Secondly  what will this thing be  Designers want to respond to issues of humanitarian crisis  but they don't want some company in the West taking their idea and basically profiting from it. So Creative Commons has developed the Developing Nations license. And what that means is that a designer can    The Siyathemba project I showed was the first ever building to have a Creative Commons license on it. As soon as that is built  anyone in Africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents and replicate it for free. So why not allow designers the opportunity to do this  but still protect their rights here  We want to have a community where you can upload ideas  and those ideas can be tested in an earthquake  in flood  in all sorts of austere environments. The reason that's important is I don't want to wait for the next Katrina to find out if my house works. That's too late  we need to do it now. So doing that globally    and I want this whole thing to work multi lingually. When you look at the face of an architect  most people think a gray haired white guy. I don't see that  I see the face of the world. So I want everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development. The idea of needs based competitions    XPRIZE for the other    percent  if you want to call it that. We also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together  and the idea of integrating manufacturers    fab labs in every country. When I hear about the      laptop and it's going to educate every child    educate every designer in the world. Put one in every favela  every slum settlement. Because you know what  Innovation will happen. And I need to know that. It's called the leap back. We talk about leapfrog technologies. I write with Worldchanging  and the one thing we've been talking about is  I learn more on the ground than I've ever learned here. So let's take those ideas  adapt them  and we can use them. These ideas are supposed to be adaptable  they should have the potential for evolution  they should be developed by every nation in the world and useful for every nation in the world. What will it take  There should be a sheet. I don't have time to read this  because I'm going to be yanked off. CA  Let's just leave it up for a sec. CS  Well  what will it take  You guys are smart. So it's going to take a lot of computing power  because I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in developing these designs  but utilize the designs. Also  a process of reviewing the designs. I want every Arup engineer in the world to check and make sure that we're doing stuff that's standing  because those guys are the best in the world. Plug. And so  you know  I want these    I just should note  I have two laptops and one of them is there  and that has      designs on it. If I drop that laptop ... What happens  So it's important to have these proven ideas put up there  easy to use  easy to get ahold of. My mom once said   There's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers.  I'm fed up of talking about making change. You only make it by doing it. We've changed FEMA guidelines  we've changed public policy  we've changed international response    based on building things. So for me  it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation  and that it's free innovation. Think of free culture    this is free innovation. Somebody said this a couple of years back. I will give points for those who know it. But I think the man was maybe    years too early. So let's do it. Thank you. I can't help but this wish  to think about when you're a little kid  and all your friends ask you   If a genie could give you one wish in the world  what would it be   And I always answered   Well  I'd want the wish to have the wisdom to know exactly what to wish for.  Well  then you'd be screwed  because you'd know what to wish for  and you'd use up your wish  and now  since we only have one wish    unlike last year they had three wishes    I'm not going to wish for that. So let's get to what I would like  which is world peace. And I know what you're thinking  You're thinking   The poor girl up there  she thinks she's at a beauty pageant. She's not. She's at the TED Prize.  But I really do think it makes sense. And I think that the first step to world peace is for people to meet each other. I've met a lot of different people over the years  and I've filmed some of them  from a dotcom executive in New York who wanted to take over the world  to a military press officer in Qatar  who would rather not take over the world. If you've seen the film  Control Room  that was sent out  you'd understand a little bit why. Thank you. Wow  Some of you watched it. That's great. That's great. So basically what I'd like to talk about today is a way for people to travel  to meet people in a different way than    because you can't travel all over the world at the same time. And a long time ago    well  about    years ago    my mom had an exchange student. And I'm going to show you slides of the exchange student. This is Donna. This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty. This is my mother and aunt teaching Donna how to ride a bike. This is Donna eating ice cream. And this is Donna teaching my aunt how to do a Filipino dance. I really think as the world is getting smaller  it becomes more and more important that we learn each other's dance moves  that we meet each other  we get to know each other  we are able to figure out a way to cross borders  to understand each other  to understand people's hopes and dreams  what makes them laugh and cry. And I know that we can't all do exchange programs  and I can't force everybody to travel  I've already talked about that to Chris and Amy  and they said that there's a problem with this  You can't force people  free will. And I totally support that  so we're not forcing people to travel. But I'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn't require a ship or an airplane  and just requires a movie camera  a projector and a screen. And that's what I'm going to talk to you about today. I was asked that I speak a little bit about where I personally come from  and Cameron  I don't know how you managed to get out of that one  but I think that building bridges is important to me because of where I come from. I'm the daughter of an American mother and an Egyptian Lebanese Syrian father. So I'm the living product of two cultures coming together. No pun intended. And I've also been called  as an Egyptian Lebanese Syrian American with a Persian name  the  Middle East Peace Crisis.  So maybe me starting to take pictures was some kind of way to bring both sides of my family together    a way to take the worlds with me  a way to tell stories visually. It all kind of started that way  but I think that I really realized the power of the image when I first went to the garbage collecting village in Egypt  when I was about   . My mother took me there. She's somebody who believes strongly in community service  and decided that this was something that I needed to do. And so I went there and I met some amazing women there. There was a center there  where they were teaching people how to read and write  and get vaccinations against the many diseases you can get from sorting through garbage. And I began teaching there. I taught English  and I met some incredible women there. I met people that live seven people to a room  barely can afford their evening meal  yet lived with this strength of spirit and sense of humor and just incredible qualities. I got drawn into this community and I began to take pictures there. I took pictures of weddings and older family members    things that they wanted memories of. About two years after I started taking these pictures  the UN Conference on Population and Development asked me to show them at the conference. So I was     I was very excited. It was my first exhibit of photographs and they were all put up there  and after about two days  they all came down except for three. People were very upset  very angry that I was showing these dirty sides of Cairo  and why didn't I cut the dead donkey out of the frame  And as I sat there  I got very depressed. I looked at this big empty wall with three lonely photographs that were  you know  very pretty photographs and I was like   I failed at this.  But I was looking at this intense emotion and intense feeling that had come out of people just seeing these photographs. Here I was  this    year old pipsqueak that nobody listened to  and all of a sudden  I put these photographs on the wall  and there were arguments  and they had to be taken down. And I saw the power of the image  and it was incredible. And I think the most important reaction that I saw there was actually from people that would never have gone to the garbage village themselves  that would never have seen that the human spirit could thrive in such difficult circumstances. And I think it was at that point that I decided I wanted to use photography and film to somehow bridge gaps  to bridge cultures  bring people together  cross borders. And so that's what really kind of started me off. Did a stint at MTV  made a film called  Startup.com   and I've done a couple of music films. But in       when the war in Iraq was about to start  it was a very surreal feeling for me  because before the war started  there was kind of this media war that was going on. And I was watching television in New York  and there seemed to be just one point of view that was coming across  and the coverage went from the US State Department to embedded troops. And what was coming across on the news was that there was going to be this clean war and precision bombings  and the Iraqis would be greeting the Americans as liberators  and throwing flowers at their feet in the streets of Baghdad. And I knew that there was a completely other story that was taking place in the Middle East  where my parents were. I knew that there was a completely other story being told  and I was thinking   How are people supposed to communicate with each other when they're getting completely different messages  and nobody knows what the other's being told  How are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding or know how to move together into the future  So I knew that I had to go there. I just wanted to be in the center. I had no plan. I had no funding. I didn't even have a camera at the time    I had somebody bring it there  because I wanted to get access to Al Jazeera  George Bush's favorite channel  and a place which I was very curious about because it's disliked by many governments across the Arab world  and also called the mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden by some people in the US government. So I was thinking  this station that's hated by so many people has to be doing something right. I've got to go see what this is all about. And I also wanted to go see Central Command  which was    minutes away. And that way  I could get access to how this news was being created    on the Arab side  reaching the Arab world  and on the US and Western side  reaching the US. And when I went there and sat there  and met these people that were in the center of it  and sat with these characters  I met some surprising  very complex people. And I'd like to share with you a little bit of that experience of when you sit with somebody and you film them  and you listen to them  and you allow them more than a five second sound bite. The amazing complexity of people emerges. Samir Khader  Business as usual. Iraq  and then Iraq  and then Iraq. But between us  if I'm offered a job with Fox  I'll take it. To change the Arab nightmare into the American dream. I still have that dream. Maybe I will never be able to do it  but I have plans for my children. When they finish high school  I will send them to America to study there. I will pay for their study. And they will stay there. Josh Rushing  The night they showed the POWs and the dead soldiers    Al Jazeera showed them    it was powerful  because America doesn't show those kinds of images. Most of the news in America won't show really gory images and this showed American soldiers in uniform  strewn about a floor  a cold tile floor. And it was revolting. It was absolutely revolting. It made me sick at my stomach. And then what hit me was  the night before  there had been some kind of bombing in Basra  and Al Jazeera had shown images of the people. And they were equally  if not more  horrifying    the images were. And I remember having seen it in the Al Jazeera office  and thought to myself   Wow  that's gross. That's bad.  And then going away  and probably eating dinner or something. And it didn't affect me as much. So  the impact that had on me    me realizing that I just saw people on the other side  and those people in the Al Jazeera office must have felt the way I was feeling that night  and it upset me on a profound level that I wasn't as bothered as much the night before. It makes me hate war. But it doesn't make me believe that we're in a world that can live without war yet. Jehane Noujaim  I was overwhelmed by the response of the film. We didn't know whether it would be able to get out there. We had no funding for it. We were incredibly lucky that it got picked up. And when we showed the film in both the United States and the Arab world  we had such incredible reactions. It was amazing to see how people were moved by this film. In the Arab world    and it's not really by the film  it's by the characters    I mean  Josh Rushing was this incredibly complex person who was thinking about things. And when I showed the film in the Middle East  people wanted to meet Josh. He kind of redefined us as an American population. People started to ask me   Where is this guy now   Al Jazeera offered him a job. And Samir  on the other hand  was also quite an interesting character for the Arab world to see  because it brought out the complexities of this love hate relationship that the Arab world has with the West. In the United States  I was blown away by the motivations  the positive motivations of the American people when they'd see this film. You know  we're criticized abroad for believing we're the saviors of the world in some way  but the flip side of it is that  actually  when people do see what is happening abroad and people's reactions to some of our policy abroad  we feel this power  that we need to    we feel like we have to get the power to change things. And I saw this with audiences. This woman came up to me after the screening and said   You know  I know this is crazy. I saw the bombs being loaded on the planes  I saw the military going out to war  but you don't understand people's anger towards us until you see the people in the hospitals and the victims of the war  and how do we get out of this bubble  How do we understand what the other person is thinking   Now  I don't know whether a film can change the world. But I know the power of it  I know that it starts people thinking about how to change the world. Now  I'm not a philosopher  so I feel like I shouldn't go into great depth on this  but let film speak for itself and take you to this other world. Because I believe that film has the ability to take you across borders  I'd like you to just sit back and experience for a couple of minutes being taken into another world. And these couple clips take you inside of two of the most difficult conflicts that we're faced with today.  The last    hours of two Palestinian suicide bombers.   Paradise Now   Man  As long as there is injustice  someone must make a sacrifice    Woman  That's no sacrifice  that's revenge    If you kill  there's no difference between victim and occupier.   Man  If we had airplanes  we wouldn't need martyrs  that's the difference.   Woman  The difference is that the Israeli military is still stronger.   Man  Then let us be equal in death.   We still have Paradise.   Woman  There is no Paradise  It only exists in your head    Man  God forbid    May God forgive you.   If you were not Abu Azzam's daughter ...   Anyway  I'd rather have Paradise in my head than live in this hell    In this life  we're dead anyway.   One only chooses bitterness when the alternative is even bitterer.   Woman  And what about us  The ones who remain    Will we win that way    Don't you see what you're doing is destroying us    And that you give Israel an alibi to carry on    Man  So with no alibi  Israel will stop    Woman  Perhaps. We have to turn it into a moral war.   Man  How  if Israel has no morals    Woman  Be careful    And the real people building peace through non violence   Encounter Point  Video   Ambulance siren   Tel Aviv  Israel        Tzvika  My wife Ayelet called me and said      There was a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv.    Ayelet  What do you know about the casualties    Tzvika off screen  We're looking for three girls.   We have no information.   Ayelet  One is wounded here  but we haven't heard from the other three.   Tzvika  I said   OK  that's Bat Chen  that's my daughter.   Are you sure she is dead     They said yes.  Video   Police siren and shouting over megaphone   Bethlehem  Occupied Palestinian Territories         George  On that day  at around        I was driving with my wife and daughters to the supermarket.   When we got to here ...   we saw three Israeli military jeeps parked on the side of the road.   When we passed by the first jeep ...   they opened fire on us.   And my    year old daughter Christine   was killed in the shooting.   Bereaved Families Forum  Jerusalem   Tzvika  I'm the headmaster for all parts.   George  But there is a teacher that is in charge    Tzvika  Yes  I have assistants.   I deal with children all the time.   One year after their daughters' deaths both Tzvika and George join the forum   George  At first  I thought it was a strange idea.   But after thinking logically about it     I didn't find any reason why not to meet them   and let them know of our suffering.   Tzvika  There were many things that touched me.   We see that there are Palestinians who suffered a lot  who lost children    and still believe in the peace process and in reconciliation.   If we who lost what is most precious can talk to each other    and look forward to a better future    then everyone else must do so  too.   From South Africa  A Revolution Through Music   Amandla  who otherwise would not have understood where we're coming from. You could give them a long political speech  they would still not understand. But I tell you  when you finish that song  people will be like   Damn  I know where you niggas are coming from. I know where you guys are coming from. Death unto apartheid   Narrator  It's about the liberation struggle. It's about those children who took to the streets    fighting  screaming   Free Nelson Mandela   It's about those unions who put down their tools and demanded freedom. Yes. Yes  Jehane Noujaim  I think everybody's had that feeling of sitting in a theater  in a dark room  with other strangers  watching a very powerful film  and they felt that feeling of transformation. And what I'd like to talk about is how can we use that feeling to actually create a movement through film  I've been listening to the talks in the conference  and Robert Wright said yesterday that if we have an appreciation for another person's humanity  then they will have an appreciation for ours. And that's what this is about. It's about connecting people through film  getting these independent voices out there. Now  Josh Rushing actually ended up leaving the military and taking a job with Al Jazeera. So his feeling is that he's at Al Jazeera International because he feels like he can actually use media to bridge the gap between East and West. And that's an amazing thing. But I've been trying to think about ways to give power to these independent voices  to give power to the filmmakers  to give power to people who are trying to use film for change. And there are incredible organizations that are out there doing this already. There's Witness  that you heard from earlier. There's Just Vision  that are working with Palestinians and Israelis who are working together for peace  and documenting that process and getting interviews out there and using this film to take to Congress to show that it's a powerful tool  to show that this is a woman who's had her daughter killed in an attack  and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this. There's Working Films and there's Current TV  which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put their    Yeah  it's amazing. I've watched it and I'm blown away by it and its potential to bring voices from around the world    independent voices from around the world    and create a truly democratic  global television. So what can we do to create a platform for these organizations  to create some momentum  to get everybody in the world involved in this movement  I'd like for us to imagine for a second. Imagine a day when you have everyone coming together from around the world. You have towns and villages and theaters    all from around the world  getting together  and sitting in the dark  and sharing a communal experience of watching a film  or a couple of films  together. Watching a film which maybe highlights a character that is fighting to live  or just a character that defies stereotypes  makes a joke  sings a song. Comedies  documentaries  shorts. This amazing power can be used to change people and to bond people together  to cross borders  and have people feel like they're having a communal experience. So if you imagine this day when all around the world  you have theaters and places where we project films. If you imagine projecting from Times Square to Tahrir Square in Cairo  the same film in Ramallah  the same film in Jerusalem. You know  we've been talking to a friend of mine about using the side of the Great Pyramid and the Great Wall of China. It's endless what you can imagine  in terms of where you can project films and where you can have this communal experience. And I believe that this one day  if we can create it  this one day can create momentum for all of these independent voices. There isn't an organization which is connecting the independent voices of the world to get out there  and yet I'm hearing throughout this conference that the biggest challenge in our future is understanding the other  and having mutual respect for the other and crossing borders. And if film can do that  and if we can get all of these different locations in the world to watch these films together    this could be an incredible day. So we've already made a partnership  set up through somebody from the TED community  John Camen  who introduced me to Steven Apkon  from the Jacob Burns Film Center. And we started calling up everybody. And in the last week  there have been so many people that have responded to us  from as close as Palo Alto  to Mongolia and to India. There are people that want to be a part of this global day of film  to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there. Now  we've thought about a name for this day  and I'd like to share this with you. Now  the most amazing part of this whole process has been sharing ideas and wishes  and so I invite you to give brainstorms onto how does this day echo into the future  How do we use technology to make this day echo into the future  so that we can build community and have these communities working together  through the Internet  There was a time  many  many years ago  when all of the continents were stuck together. And we call that landmass Pangea. So what we'd like to call this day of film is Pangea Cinema Day. And if you just imagine that all of these people in these towns would be watching  then I think that we can actually really make a movement towards people understanding each other better. I know that it's very intangible  touching people's hearts and souls  but the only way that I know how to do it  the only way that I know how to reach out to somebody's heart and soul all across the world  is by showing them a film. And I know that there are independent filmmakers and films out there that can really make this happen. And that's my wish. I guess I'm supposed to give you my one sentence wish  but we're way out of time. Chris Anderson  That is an incredible wish. Pangea Cinema  The day the world comes together. JN  It's more tangible than world peace  and it's certainly more immediate. But it would be the day that the world comes together through film  the power of film. CA  Ladies and gentlemen  Jehane Noujaim. I'm the luckiest guy in the world. I got to see the last case of killer smallpox in the world. I was in India this past year  and I may have seen the last cases of polio in the world. There's nothing that makes you feel more    the blessing and the honor of working in a program like that    than to know that something that horrible no longer exists. So I'm going to tell you    so I'm going to show you some dirty pictures. They are difficult to watch  but you should look at them with optimism  because the horror of these pictures will be matched by the uplifting quality of knowing that they no longer exist. But first  I'm going to tell you a little bit about my own journey. My background is not exactly the conventional medical education that you might expect. When I was an intern in San Francisco  I heard about a group of Native Americans who had taken over Alcatraz Island  and a Native American who wanted to give birth on that island  and no other doctor wanted to go and help her give birth. I went out to Alcatraz  and I lived on the island for several weeks. She gave birth  I caught the baby  I got off the island  I landed in San Francisco  and all the press wanted to talk to me  because my three weeks on the island made me an expert in Indian affairs. I wound up on every television show. Someone saw me on television  they called me up  and they asked me if I'd like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ride from San Francisco to England. And I said  yes  I would do that  so I became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie called  Medicine Ball Caravan.  Now  you know from the '  s  you're either on the bus or you're off the bus  I was on the bus. My wife of    years and I joined the bus. Our bus ride took us from San Francisco to London  then we switched buses at the big pond. We then got on two more buses and we drove through Turkey and Iran  Afghanistan  over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan  like every other young doctor. This is us at the Khyber Pass  and that's our bus. We had some difficulty getting over the Khyber Pass. But we wound up in India. And then  like everyone else in our generation  we went to live in a Himalayan monastery. This is just like a residency program  for those of you that are in medical school. And we studied with a wise man  a guru named Karoli Baba  who then told me to get rid of the dress  put on a three piece suit  go join the United Nations as a diplomat and work for the World Health Organization. And he made an outrageous prediction that smallpox would be eradicated  and that this was God's gift to humanity  because of the hard work of dedicated scientists. And that prediction came true. This little girl is Rahima Banu  and she was the last case of killer smallpox in the world. And this document is the certificate that the global commission signed  certifying the world to have eradicated the first disease in history. The key to eradicating smallpox was early detection  early response. I'm going to ask you to repeat that  early detection  early response. Can you say that  Audience  Early detection  early response. Larry Brilliant  Smallpox was the worst disease in history. It killed more people than all the wars in history. In the last century  it killed     million people. You're reading about Larry Page already. Somebody reads very fast. In the year that Larry Page and Sergey Brin    with whom I have a certain affection and a new affiliation    in the year in which they were born  two million people died of smallpox. We declared smallpox eradicated in     . This is the most important slide that I've ever seen in public health   Sovereigns killed by smallpox  because it shows you to be the richest and the strongest  and to be kings and queens of the world  did not protect you from dying of smallpox. Never can you doubt that we are all in this together. But to see smallpox from the perspective of a sovereign is the wrong perspective. You should see it from the perspective of a mother  watching her child develop this disease and standing by helplessly. Day one  day two  day three  day four  day five  day six. You're a mother and you're watching your child  and on day six  you see pustules that become hard. Day seven  they show the classic scars of smallpox umbilication. Day eight. And Al Gore said earlier that the most photographed image in the world  the most printed image in the world  was that of the Earth. But this was in       and as of that moment  this photograph was the photograph that was the most widely printed  because we printed two billion copies of this photograph  and we took them hand to hand  door to door  to show people and ask them if there was smallpox in their house  because that was our surveillance system. We didn't have Google  we didn't have web crawlers  we didn't have computers. By day nine    you look at this picture and you're horrified  I look at this picture and I say   Thank God   because it's clear that this is only an ordinary case of smallpox  and I know this child will live. And by day     the lesions are scabbing  his eyelids are swollen  but you know this child has no other secondary infection. And by day     while he will be scarred for life  he will live. There are other kinds of smallpox that are not like that. This is confluent smallpox  in which there isn't a single place on the body where you could put a finger and not be covered by lesions. Flat smallpox  which killed     percent of people who got it. And hemorrhagic smallpox  the most cruel of all  which had a predilection for pregnant women. I've probably had    women die. They all had hemorrhagic smallpox. I've never seen anybody die from it who wasn't a pregnant woman. In       the WHO embarked on what was an outrageous program to eradicate a disease. In that year  there were    countries affected with smallpox. By       we were down to    countries.       we were down to five countries. But in that year  smallpox exploded throughout India. And India was the place where smallpox made its last stand. In       India had a population of     million. There are    linguistic states in India  which is like saying    different countries. There are    million people on the road at any time  in buses and trains  walking          villages      million households  and none of them wanted to report if they had a case of smallpox in their house  because they thought that smallpox was the visitation of a deity  Shitala Mata  the cooling mother  and it was wrong to bring strangers into your house when the deity was in the house. No incentive to report smallpox. It wasn't just India that had smallpox deities  smallpox deities were prevalent all over the world. So  how we eradicated smallpox was    max vaccination wouldn't work. You could vaccinate everybody in India  but one year later there'd be    million new babies  which was then the population of Canada. It wouldn't do just to vaccinate everyone. You had to find every single case of smallpox in the world at the same time  and draw a circle of immunity around it. And that's what we did. In India alone  my         best friends and I went door to door  with that same picture  to every single house in India. We made over one billion house calls. And in the process  I learned something very important. Every time we did a house to house search  we had a spike in the number of reports of smallpox. When we didn't search  we had the illusion that there was no disease. When we did search  we had the illusion that there was more disease. A surveillance system was necessary  because what we needed was early detection  early response. So we searched and we searched  and we found every case of smallpox in India. We had a reward. We raised the reward. We continued to increase the reward. We had a scorecard that we wrote on every house. And as we did that  the number of reported cases in the world dropped to zero. And in       we declared the globe free of smallpox. It was the largest campaign in United Nations history  until the Iraq war.         people from all over the world    doctors of every race  religion  culture and nation  who fought side by side  brothers and sisters  with each other  not against each other  in a common cause to make the world better. But smallpox was the fourth disease that was intended for eradication. We failed three other times. We failed against malaria  yellow fever and yaws. But soon we may see polio eradicated. But the key to eradicating polio is early detection  early response. This may be the year we eradicate polio. That will make it the second disease in history. And David Heymann  who's watching this on the webcast    David  keep on going. We're close  We're down to four countries. I feel like Hank Aaron. Barry Bonds can replace me any time. Let's get another disease off the list of terrible things to worry about. I was just in India working on the polio program. The polio surveillance program is four million people going door to door. That is the surveillance system. But we need to have early detection  early response. Blindness  the same thing. The key to discovering blindness is doing epidemiological surveys and finding out the causes of blindness  so you can mount the correct response. The Seva Foundation was started by a group of alumni of the Smallpox Eradication Programme  who  having climbed the highest mountain  tasted the elixir of the success of eradicating a disease  wanted to do it again. And over the last    years  Seva's programs in    countries have given back sight to more than two million blind people. Seva got started because we wanted to apply these lessons of surveillance and epidemiology to something which nobody else was looking at as a public health issue  blindness  which heretofore had been thought of only as a clinical disease. In       Steve Jobs gave me that computer  which is Apple number     and it's still in Kathmandu  and it's still working  and we ought to go get it and auction it off and make more money for Seva. And we conducted the first Nepal survey ever done for health  and the first nationwide blindness survey ever done  and we had astonishing results. Instead of finding out what we thought was the case    that blindness was caused mostly by glaucoma and trachoma    we were astounded to find out that blindness was caused instead by cataract. You can't cure or prevent what you don't know is there. In your TED packages there's a DVD   Infinite Vision   about Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital. I hope that you will take a look at it. Aravind  which started as a Seva project  is now the world's largest and best eye hospital. This year  that one hospital will give back sight to more than         people in Tamil Nadu  India. Bird flu. I stand here as a representative of all terrible things    this might be the worst. The key to preventing or mitigating pandemic bird flu is early detection and rapid response. We will not have a vaccine or adequate supplies of an antiviral to combat bird flu if it occurs in the next three years. WHO stages the progress of a pandemic. We are now at stage three on the pandemic alert stage  with just a little bit of human to human transmission  but no human to human to human sustained transmission. The moment WHO says we've moved to category four    this will not be like Katrina. The world as we know it will stop. There'll be no airplanes flying. Would you get in an airplane with     people you didn't know  coughing and sneezing  when you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you  for which you had no antivirals or vaccine  I did a study of the top epidemiologists in the world in October. I asked them    these are all fluologists and specialists in influenza    and I asked them the questions you'd like to ask them  What do you think the likelihood is that there'll be a pandemic  If it happens  how bad do you think it will be  Fifteen percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within three years. But much worse than that     percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within your children or your grandchildren's lifetime. And they thought that if there was a pandemic  a billion people would get sick. As many as     million people would die. There would be a global recession and depression as our just in time inventory system and the tight rubber band of globalization broke  and the cost to our economy of one to three trillion dollars would be far worse for everyone than merely     million people dying  because so many more people would lose their job and their healthcare benefits  that the consequences are almost unthinkable. And it's getting worse  because travel is getting so much better. Let me show you a simulation of what a pandemic looks like. So we know what we're talking about. Let's assume  for example  that the first case occurs in South Asia. It initially goes quite slowly. You get two or three discrete locations. Then there'll be secondary outbreaks  and the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you won't know what hit you. Within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world. Now  if we had an  undo  button  and we could go back and isolate it and grab it when it first started    if we could find it early  and we had early detection and early response  and we could put each one of those viruses in jail    that's the only way to deal with something like a pandemic. And let me show you why that is. We have a joke. This is an epidemic curve  and everyone in medicine  I think  ultimately gets to know what it is. But the joke is  an epidemiologist likes to arrive at an epidemic right here and ride to glory on the downhill curve. But you don't get to do that usually. You usually arrive right about here. What we really want is to arrive right here  so we can stop the epidemic. But you can't always do that. But there's an organization that has been able to find a way to learn when the first cases occur  and that is called GPHIN  it's the Global Public Health Information Network. And that simulation that I showed you that you thought was bird flu    that was SARS. And SARS is the pandemic that did not occur. And it didn't occur because GPHIN found the pandemic to be of SARS three months before WHO actually announced it  and because of that  we were able to stop the SARS pandemic. And I think we owe a great debt of gratitude to GPHIN and to Ron St. John  who I hope is in the audience some place    over there    who's the founder of GPHIN. Hello  Ron  And TED has flown Ron here from Ottawa  where GPHIN is located  because not only did GPHIN find SARS early  but you may have seen last week that Iran announced that they had bird flu in Iran  but GPHIN found the bird flu in Iran not February       but last September. We need an early warning system to protect us against the things that are humanity's worst nightmare. And so my TED wish is based on the common denominator of these experiences. Smallpox    early detection  early response. Blindness  polio    early detection  early response. Pandemic bird flu    early detection  early response. It is a litany. It is so obvious that our only way of dealing with these new diseases is to find them early and to kill them before they spread. So  my TED wish is for you to help build a global system    an early warning system    to protect us against humanity's worst nightmares. And what I thought I would call it is  Early Detection   But it should really be called ...  Total Early Detection.   TED  What  What  But in all seriousness  because this idea is birthed in TED  I would like it to be a legacy of TED  and I'd like to call it the  International System for Total Early Disease Detection.   INSTEDD  And INSTEDD then becomes our mantra. So instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu  we find it and immediately contain it. Instead of a novel virus caused by bio terror or bio error  or shift or drift  we find it and we contain it. Instead of industrial accidents like oil spills or the catastrophe in Bhopal  we find them  and we respond to them. Instead of famine  hidden until it is too late  we detect it  and we respond. And instead of a system which is owned by a government  and hidden in the bowels of government  let's build an early detection system that's freely available to anyone in the world in their own language. Let's make it transparent  non governmental  not owned by any single country or company  housed in a neutral country  with redundant backup in a different time zone and a different continent. And let's build it on GPHIN. Let's start with GPHIN. Let's increase the websites that they crawl from        to    million. Let's increase the languages they crawl from seven to     or more. Let's build in outbound confirmation messages  using text messages or SMS or instant messaging to find out from people who are within     meters of the rumor that you hear  if it is  in fact  valid. And let's add satellite confirmation. And we'll add Gapminder's amazing graphics to the front end. And we'll grow it as a moral force in the world  finding out those terrible things before anybody else knows about them  and sending our response to them  so that next year  instead of us meeting here  lamenting how many terrible things there are in the world  we will have pulled together  used the unique skills and the magic of this community  and be proud that we have done everything we can to stop pandemics  other catastrophes  and change the world  beginning right now. Chris Anderson  An amazing presentation. First of all  just so everyone understands  you're saying that by creating web crawlers  looking on the Internet for patterns  they can detect something suspicious before WHO  before anyone else can see it  Give an example of how that could possibly be true. Larry Brilliant  You're not mad about the copyright violation  CA  No. I love it. LB  Well  as Ron St. John    I hope you'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him. When he started GPHIN    In       there was an outbreak of bird flu    H N . It was in Hong Kong. And a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong responded immediately  by slaughtering  .  million chickens and birds  and they stopped that outbreak in its tracks. Immediate detection  immediate response. Then a number of years went by  and there were a lot of rumors about bird flu. Ron and his team in Ottawa began to crawl the web    only crawling        different websites  mostly periodicals    and they read about and heard about a concern  of a lot of children who had high fever and symptoms of bird flu. They reported this to WHO. WHO took a little while taking action  because WHO will only receive a report from a government  because it's the United Nations. But they were able to point to WHO and let them know that there was this surprising and unexplained cluster of illnesses that looked like bird flu. That turned out to be SARS. That's how the world found out about SARS. And because of that  we were able to stop SARS. Now  what's really important is that  before there was GPHIN      percent of all the world's reports of bad things    whether you're talking about famine or you're talking about bird flu or you're talking about Ebola        percent of all those reports came from nations. The moment these guys in Ottawa    on a budget of         dollars a year    got cracking     percent of all the reports in the world came from GPHIN     percent of all the reports in the world came from all the other     nations. Now  here's what's really interesting  after they'd been working for a couple years  what do you think happened to those nations  They felt pretty stupid. So they started sending in their reports early. And now  their reporting percentage is down to    percent  because other nations have started to report. So  can you find diseases early by crawling the web  Of course you can. Can you find it even earlier than GPHIN does now  Of course you can. You saw that they found SARS using their Chinese web crawler a full six weeks before they found it using their English web crawler. Well  they're only crawling in seven languages. These bad viruses really don't have any intention of showing up first in English or Spanish or French. So yes  I want to take GPHIN  I want to build on it. I want to add all the languages of the world that we possibly can. I want to make this open to everybody  so that the health officer in Nairobi or in Patna  Bihar will have as much access to it as the folks in Ottawa or in CDC. And I want to make it part of our culture that there is a community of people who are watching out for the worst nightmares of humanity  and that it's accessible to everyone. I'm going to present three projects in rapid fire. I don't have much time to do it. And I want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid fire presentation. The first is what I like to call a hyper rational process. It's a process that takes rationality almost to an absurd level  and it transcends all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call  sort of a rational conclusion to something. And it concludes in something that you see here  that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality. The second    the second is that this process does not have a signature. There is no authorship. Architects are obsessed with authorship. This is something that has editing and it has teams  but in fact  we no longer see within this process  the traditional master architect creating a sketch that his minions carry out. And the third is that it challenges    and this is  in the length of this  very hard to support why  connect all these things    but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility. High modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic  almost anything can happen within them. I call it sort of  shotgun flexibility     turn your head this way  shoot  and you're bound to kill something. So  this is the promise of high modernism  within a single space  actually  any kind of activity can happen. But as we're seeing  operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters. And so  with this sort of idea  what happens is  whatever actually is in the building on opening day  or whatever seems to be the most immediate need  starts to dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it  of anything else could ever happen. And so we're proposing a different kind of flexibility  something that we call  compartmentalized flexibility.  And the idea is that you  within that continuum  identify a series of points  and you design specifically to them. They can be pushed off center a little bit  but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped. With high modernist flexibility  that doesn't really work. Now I'm going to talk about    I'm going to build up the Seattle Central Library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams  and I truly mean this is the design process that you'll see. With the library staff and the library board  we settled on two core positions. This is the first one  and this is showing  over the last     years  the evolution of the book  and other technologies. This diagram was our sort of position piece about the book  and our position was  books are technology    that's something people forget    but it's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media. The second premise    and this was something that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first    is that libraries  since the inception of Carnegie Library tradition in America  had a second responsibility  and that was for social roles. Ok  now  this I'll come back to later  but something    actually  the librarians at first said   No  this isn't our mandate. Our mandate is media  and particularly the book.  So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building. The upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility. Sort of  any activity could happen anywhere. We don't know the future of the library  we don't know the future of the book  and so  we'll use this approach. And what we saw were buildings that were very generic  and worse    not only were they very generic    so  not only does the reading room look like the copy room look like the magazine area    but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it. And in this case  what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book. And so we proposed what's at the lower diagram. Very dumb approach  simply compartmentalize. Put those things whose evolution we could predict    and I don't mean that we could say what would actually happen in the future  but we have some certainty of the spectrum of what would happen in the future    put those in boxes designed specifically for it  and put the things that we can't predict on the rooftops. So that was the core idea. Now  we had to convince the library that social roles were equally important to media  in order to get them to accept this. What you're seeing here is actually their program on the left. That's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory. Our first operation was to re digest it back to them  show it to them and say   You know what  We haven't touched it  but only one third of your own program is dedicated to media and books. Two thirds of it is already dedicated    that's the white band below  the thing you said isn't important    is already dedicated to social functions.  So once we had presented that back to them  they agreed that this sort of core concept could work. We got the right to go back to first principles    that's the third diagram. We recombined everything. And then we started making new decisions. What you're seeing on the right is the design of the library  specifically in terms of square footage. On the left of that diagram  here  you'll see a series of five platforms    sort of combs  collective programs. And on the right are the more indeterminate spaces  things like reading rooms  whose evolution in            years we can't predict. So that literally was the design of the building. They signed it  and to their chagrin  we came back a week later  and we presented them this. And as you can see  it is literally the diagram on the right. We just sized    no  really  I mean that  literally. The things on the left hand side of the diagram  those are the boxes. We sized them into five compartments. They're super efficient. We had a very low budget to work with. We pushed them around on the site to make very literal contextual relationships. The reading room should be able to see the water. The main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code  and so forth. So  you see the five platforms  those are the boxes. within each one  a very discrete thing is happening. The area in between is sort of an urban continuum  these things that we can't predict their evolution to the same degree. To give you some sense of the power of this idea  the biggest block is what we call the book spiral. It's literally built in a very inexpensive way    it is a parking garage for books. It just so happens to be on the  th through   th floors of the building  but that is not necessarily an expensive approach. And it allows us to organize the entire Dewey Decimal System on one continuous run  no matter how it grows or contracts within the building  it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears that we've all experienced in public libraries. And so this was the final operation  which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter  and to hold onto them with a skin. That skin serves double duty  again  for economics. One  it is the lateral stability for the entire building  it's a structural element. But its dimensions were designed not only for structure  but also for holding on every piece of glass. The glass was then    I'll use the word impregnated    but it had a layer of metal that was called  stretched metal.  That metal acts as a microlouver  so from the exterior of the building  the sun sees it as totally opaque  but from the interior  it's entirely transparent. So now I'm going to take you on a tour of the building. Let me see if I can find it. For anyone who gets motion sickness  I apologize. So  this is the building. And I think what's important is  when we first unveiled the building  the public saw it as being totally about our whim and ego. And it was defended  believe it or not  by the librarians. They said   Look  we don't know what it is  but we know it's everything that we need it to be  based on the observations that we've done about the program.  This is going into one of the entries. So  it's an unusual building for a public library  obviously. So now we're going into what we call the living room. This is actually a program that we invented with the library. It was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space. There are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle  but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain. So this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything  including eat  yell  play chess and so forth. Now we're moving up into what we call the mixing chamber. That was the main technology area in the building. You'll have to tell me if I'm going too fast for you. And now up. This is actually the place that we put into the building so I could propose to my wife  right there. She said yes. I'm running out of time  so I'm actually going to stop. I can show this to you later. But let's see if I can very quickly get into the book spiral  because I think it's  as I said  the most    this is the main reading room    the most unique part of the building. You dizzy yet  Ok  so here  this is the book spiral. So  it's very indiscernible  but it's actually a continuous stair stepping. It allows you to  on one city block  go up one full floor  so that it's on a continuum. Ok  now I'm going to go back  and I'm going to hit a second project. I'm going to go very  very quickly through this. Now this is the Dallas Theater. It was an unusual client for us  because they came to us and they said   We need you to do a new building. We've been working in a temporary space for    years  but because of that temporary space  we've become an infamous theater company. Theater is really focused in New York  Chicago and Seattle  with the exception of the Dallas Theater Company.  And the very fact that they worked in a provisional space meant that for Beckett  they could blow out a wall  they could do  Cherry Orchard  and blow a hole through the floor  and so forth. So it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand new building that could be a pristine building  but keep this kind of experimental nature. And the second is  they were what we call a multi form theater  they do different kinds of performances in repertory. So they in the morning will do something in arena  then they'll do something in proscenium and so forth. And so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations  and for operational budget reasons  this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi form theater in the United States  so we needed to figure out a way to overcome that. So our thought was to literally put the theater on its head  to take those things that were previously defined as front of house and back of house and stack them above house and below house  and to create what we called a theater machine. We invest the money in the operation of the building. It's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere  wherever you place it  the area under it is charged for theatrical performances. And it allowed us to go back to first principles  and redefine fly tower  acoustic enclosure  light enclosure and so forth. And at the push of a button  it allows the artistic director to move between proscenium  thrust  and in fact  arena and traverse and flat floor  in a very quick transfiguration. So in fact  using operational budget  we can    sorry  capital cost    we can actually achieve what was no longer achievable in operational cost. And that means that the artistic director now has a palette that he or she can choose from  between a series of forms and a series of processions  because that enclosure around the theater that is normally trapped with front of house and back of house spaces has been liberated. So an artistic director has the ability to have a performance that enters in a Wagnerian procession  shows the first act in thrust  the intermission in a Greek procession  second act in arena  and so forth. So I'm going to show you what this actually means. This is the theater up close. Any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely. The light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure  so you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop. Portions can be opened  so you can now actually have motorcycles drive directly into the performance  or you can even just have an open air performance  or for intermissions. The balconies all move to go between those configurations  but they also disappear. The proscenium line can also disappear. You can bring enormous objects in  so in fact  the Dallas Theater Company    their first show will be a play about Charles Lindbergh  and they'll want to bring in a real aircraft. And then it also provides them  in the off season  the ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things. This is it from a distance. Open up entire portions for different kinds of events. And at night. Again  remove the light enclosure  keep the acoustic enclosure. This is a monster truck show. I'm going to show now the last project. This also is an unusual client. They inverted the whole idea of development. They came to us and they said    unlike normal developers    they said   We want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in Louisville. That's our main goal.  And so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money  they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown. And the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma  so they worked in reverse. And that pro forma led us to a mixed use building that was very large  in order to support their aspirations of the art  but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate  interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within. And it also charged us with thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of sub building. So this is Louisville's skyline  and I'm going to take you through the various constraints that led to the project. First  the physical constraints. We actually had to operate on three discrete sites  all of them well smaller than the size of the building. We had to operate next to the new Muhammad Ali Center  and respect it. We had to operate within the     year floodplain. Now  this area floods three to four times a year  and there's a levee behind our site  similar to the ones that broke in New Orleans. Had to operate behind the I    corridor  a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites. So we're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub. Underneath the bathtub are the city's main power lines. And there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add  that would link a series of cultural buildings  and a view corridor    because this is the historic district    that they didn't want to obstruct with a new building. And now we're going to add  .  million square feet. And if we did the traditional thing  that  .  million square feet    these are the different programs    the traditional thing would be to identify the public elements  place them on sites  and now we'd have a really terrible situation  a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods. And then we would size all the other elements    the different commercial elements  hotel  luxury housing  offices and so forth    and dump it on top. And we would create something that was unviable. In fact    and you know this    this is called the Time Warner Building. So our strategy was very simple. Just lift the entire block  flip some of the elements over  reposition them so they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown  and make circulation connections and reroute the road. So that's the basic concept  and now I'm going to show you what it leads to. Ok  it seems a very formal  willful gesture  but something derived entirely out of the constraints. And again  when we unveiled it  there was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect making a statement  not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems. Now  within that center zone  as I said  we have the ability to mix a series of things. So here  this is sort of an x ray    the towers are totally developer driven. They told us the dimensions  the sizes and so forth  and we focused on taking all the public components    the lobbies  the bars    everything that different commercial elements would have  and combined it in the center  in the sort of subway map  in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum. So it creates a situation like this  where you have artists who can operate within an art space that also has an amazing view on the   nd floor  but it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close. It allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen  or to see the art  and so forth. It also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool  they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool  so they're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space. So  how to build this. It's very simple  it's a chair. So  we begin by building the cores. As we're building the cores  we build the contemporary art museum at grade. That allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency. This is not a high budget building. The moment the cores get to mid level  we finish the art museum  we put all the mechanical equipment in it  and then we jack it up into the air. This is how they build really large aircraft hangars  for instance  the ones that they did for the A   . Finish the cores  finish the meat and you get something that looks like this. Now I only have about    seconds  so I want to start an animation  and we'll conclude with that. Thank you. Chris asked me to add    the theater is under construction  and this project will start construction in about a year  and finish in     .  identify public elements   insert public elements at grade   optimize tower dimensions   place towers on site   lift program   flip    optimize program adjacencies   connect to context   redirect  th street  On September     the morning of my seventh birthday  I came downstairs to the kitchen  where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something  and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway  and they said   Hey  happy birthday   And I said   I'm seven.  And my father smiled and said   Well  you know what that means  don't you   And I said   Yeah  that I'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents   And my dad said   Well  yes. But more importantly  being seven means that you've reached the age of reason  and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man.  Now  I had heard this phrase   age of reason   before. Sister Mary Kevin had been bandying it about my second grade class at school. But when she said it  the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for our first communion and our first confession  and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil. And anyway  I hadn't really paid all that much attention to that phrase   age of reason.  So  I said   Yeah  yeah  age of reason. What does that mean again   And my dad said   Well  we believe  in the Catholic Church  that God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong  but when you're seven  you're old enough to know better. So  you've grown up and reached the age of reason  and now God will start keeping notes on you  and begin your permanent record.  And I said   Oh ... Wait a minute. You mean all that time  up till today  all that time I was so good  God didn't notice it   And my mom said   Well  I noticed it.  And I thought   How could I not have known this before  How could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me  All that being good and no real credit for it. And worst of all  how could I not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me   So I said   Well  Mom and Dad  what about Santa Claus  I mean  Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice  right   And my dad said   Yeah  but  honey  I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  And my mother said   Oh  Bob  stop it. Let's just tell her. I mean  she's seven. Julie  there is no Santa Claus.  Now  this was actually not that upsetting to me. My parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus  how they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed that instead of Santa delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve  like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning  our family would give Santa more time. Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning  but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss. Which made me very suspicious. It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents. I mean  my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style  and my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's. Plus  why would Santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he'd gone to everybody else's  There was only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence  our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit  and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment  this humiliation of rejection by Santa  who was jolly    but let's face it  he was also very judgmental. So to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief. I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa  but rather  I was just dumbfounded about how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing. It was too late for me  but maybe I could help someone else  someone who could use the information. They had to fit two criteria  they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason  and not yet seven. The answer was clear  my brother Bill. He was six. Well  I finally found Bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground. It was a Saturday  and he was all by himself  just kicking a ball against the side of a wall. I ran up to him and said   Bill  I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven  and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against God and man.  And Bill said   So   And I said   So  you're six. You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it.  And he said   So   And I said   So  So everything   And I turned to run. I was so angry with him. But when I got to the top of the steps  I turned around dramatically and said   Oh  by the way  Bill    there is no Santa Claus.  Now  I didn't know it at the time  but I really wasn't turning seven on September   th. For my   th birthday  I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends  but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said   I need to speak to you privately. September   th is not your birthday. It's October   th.  And I said   What   And she said ...  Listen. The cut off date to start kindergarten was September   th.   So I told them that your birthday was September   th  and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place  so I started to tell you your birthday was September   th. But  Julie  you were so ready to start school  honey. You were so ready.  I thought about it  and when I was four  I was already the oldest of four children  and my mother even had another child to come  so what I think she    understandably    really meant was that she was so ready  she was so ready. Then she said   Don't worry  Julie. Every year on October   th  when it was your birthday but you didn't realize it  I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day.  Which was comforting  but troubling. My mother had been celebrating my birthday with me  without me. What was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that I had to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends. What was most upsetting was that this meant I was not a Virgo. I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom. And I read my horoscope every single day  and it was so totally me. And this meant that I was a Libra  So  I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster. The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair  sort of lounging by some water  but the Libra poster is just a huge scale. This was around the time that I started filling out physically  and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls  and frankly  the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing. But I got the new Libra poster  and I started to read my new Libra horoscope  and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me. It wasn't until years later  looking back on this whole age of reason  change of birthday thing  that it dawned on me  I wasn't turning seven when I thought I turned seven. I had a whole other month to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me. Oh  life can be so cruel. One day  two Mormon missionaries came to my door. Now  I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles  and my block is    well  it's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door. Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven. And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people  if I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them. So normally  I just ignore the doorbell  but on this day  I answered. And there stood two boys  each about     in white  starched short sleeved shirts  and they had little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  and they said they had a message for me  from God. I said   A message for me  From God   And they said   Yes.  Now  I was raised in the Pacific Northwest  around a lot of Church of Latter day Saints people and  you know  I've worked with them and even dated them  but I never really knew the doctrine  or what they said to people when they were out on a mission  and I guess I was sort of curious  so I said   Well  please  come in.  And they looked really happy  because I don't think this happens to them all that often. And I sat them down  and I got them glasses of water    Ok  I got it  I got it. I got them glasses of water. Don't touch my hair  that's the thing. You can't put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair. Ok. So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water  and after niceties  they said   Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart   And I thought   Well  of course I believe in God  but you know  I don't like that word 'heart ' because it anthropomorphizes God  and I don't like the word  'his ' either  because that sexualizes God.  But I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys  so after a very long  uncomfortable pause  I said   Yes  yes  I do. I feel very loved.  And they looked at each other and smiled  like that was the right answer. And then they said   Do you believe that we're all brothers and sisters on this planet   And I said   Yes  I do.  And I was so relieved that it was a question I could answer so quickly. And they said   Well  then we have a story to tell you.  And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi  who lived in Jerusalem in     BC. Now  apparently in Jerusalem in     BC  everyone was completely bad and evil. Every single one of them  man  woman  child  infant  fetus. And God came to Lehi and said to him   Put your family on a boat and I will lead you out of here.  And God did lead them. He led them to America. I said   America  From Jerusalem to America by boat in     BC   And they said   Yes.  Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced  and over the course of     years  there were two great races of them  the Nephites and the Lamanites  and the Nephites were totally good    each and every one of them    and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil    every single one of them just bad to the bone. Then  after Jesus died on the cross for our sins  on his way up to heaven  he stopped by America and visited the Nephites. And he told them that if they all remained totally  totally good    each and every one of them    they would win the war against the evil Lamanites. But apparently somebody blew it  because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites. All but one guy  this guy named Mormon  who managed to survive by hiding in the woods. And he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates  which he then buried near Palmyra  New York. Well  I was just on the edge of my seat. I said   What happened to the Lamanites   And they said   Well  they became our Native Americans  here in the U.S.  And I said   So  you believe the Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil   And they said   Yes.  Then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith found those buried gold plates right in his backyard  and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into  and this allowed him to translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English. Well  at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch. I wanted to say     Ok  don't start with this story.  I mean  even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start    telling people all about Xenu  the evil intergalactic overlord. Then  they said   Do you believe that God speaks to us through his righteous prophets   And I said   No  I don't   because I was sort of upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story  but the truth was  I hadn't really thought this through  so I backpedaled a little and I said   Well  what exactly do you mean by 'righteous'  And what do you mean by prophets  Like  could the prophets be women   And they said   No.  And I said   Why   And they said   Well  it's because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular  it is so wonderful  that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy.  What is this wonderful gift God gave women  I wondered  Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt  Women's longer lifespan  The fact that women tend to be much less violent than men  But no    it wasn't any of these gifts. They said   Well  it's her ability to bear children.  I said   Oh  come on. I mean  even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were    to the time they were     assuming they didn't die from exhaustion  it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God.  And they said   No.  Well  then they didn't look so fresh faced and cute to me any more  but they had more to say. They said   Well  we also believe that if you're a Mormon  and if you're in good standing with the church  when you die  you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity.  And I said   Oh  dear. That wouldn't be such a good incentive for me.  And they said   Oh. Hey  Well  we also believe that when you go to heaven  you get your body restored to you in its best original state. Like  if you'd lost a leg  well  you get it back. Or  if you'd gone blind  you could see.  I said   Oh. Now  I don't have a uterus  because I had cancer a few years ago. So does this mean that if I went to heaven  I would get my old uterus back   And they said   Sure.  And I said   I don't want it back. I'm happy without it.  Gosh. What if you had a nose job and you liked it  Would God force you to get your old nose back  Then they gave me this Book of Mormon  told me to read this chapter and that chapter  and said they'd come back and check in on me  and I think I said something like   Please don't hurry   or maybe just   Please don't   and they were gone. Ok  so I initially felt really superior to these boys  and smug in my more conventional faith. But then the more I thought about it  the more I had to be honest with myself. If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time  and they said   We believe that God impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse  and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us.   And she had a baby  and that's the son of God   I mean  I would think that's equally ridiculous. I'm just so used to that story. So  I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys. But the question they asked me when they first arrived really stuck in my head  Did I believe that God loved me with all his heart  Because I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question. Now  if they had asked me   Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart   Well  that would have been much different  I think I would have instantly answered   Yes  yes  I feel it all the time. I feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused  and I feel consoled and cared for. I take shelter in God's love when I don't understand why tragedy hits  and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see.  But since they asked me that question with the word  believe  in it  somehow it was all different  because I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt. I'm often asked   What surprised you about the book   And I say   That I got to write it.  I would have never imagined that. Not in my wildest dreams did I think    I don't even consider myself to be an author. And I'm often asked   Why do you think so many people have read this  This thing's selling still about a million copies a month.  And I think it's because spiritual emptiness is a universal disease. I think inside at some point  we put our heads down on the pillow and we go   There's got to be more to life than this.  Get up in the morning  go to work  come home and watch TV  go to bed  get up in the morning  go to work  come home  watch TV  go to bed  go to parties on weekends. A lot of people say   I'm living.  No  you're not living    that's just existing. Just existing. I really think that there's this inner desire. I do believe what Chris said  I believe that you're not an accident. Your parents may not have planned you  but I believe God did. I think there are accidental parents  there's no doubt about that. I don't think there are accidental kids. And I think you matter. I think you matter to God  I think you matter to history  I think you matter to this universe. And I think that the difference between what I call the survival level of living  the success level of living  and the significance level of living is  Do you figure out   What on Earth am I here for   I meet a lot of people who are very smart  and say   But why can't I figure out my problems   And I meet a lot of people who are very successful  who say   Why don't I feel more fulfilled  Why do I feel like a fake  Why do I feel like I've got to pretend that I'm more than I really am   I think that comes down to this issue of meaning  of significance  of purpose. I think it comes down to this issue of   Why am I here  What am I here for  Where am I going   These are not religious issues. They're human issues. I wanted to tell Michael before he spoke that I really appreciate what he does  because it makes my life work a whole lot easier. As a pastor  I do see a lot of kooks. And I have learned that there are kooks in every area of life. Religion doesn't have a monopoly on that  but there are plenty of religious kooks. There are secular kooks  there are smart kooks  dumb kooks. There are people    a lady came up to me the other day  and she had a white piece of paper    Michael  you'll like this one    and she said   What do you see in it   And I looked at it and I said   Oh  I don't see anything.  And she goes   Well  I see Jesus   and started crying and left. I'm going   OK   you know   Fine.  Good for you. When the book became the best selling book in the world for the last three years  I kind of had my little crisis. And that was  What is the purpose of this  Because it brought in enormous amounts of money. When you write the best selling book in the world  it's tons and tons of money. And it brought in a lot of attention  neither of which I wanted. When I started Saddleback Church  I was    years old. I started it with one other family in     . And I decided that I was never going to go on TV  because I didn't want to be a celebrity. I didn't want to be a  quote   evangelist  televangelist     that's not my thing. And all of the sudden  it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention. I don't think    now  this is a worldview  and I will tell you  everybody's got a worldview. Everybody's betting their life on something. You're betting your life on something  you just better know why you're betting what you're betting on. So  everybody's betting their life on something. And when I  you know  made a bet  I happened to believe that Jesus was who he said he was. And I believe in a pluralistic society  everybody's betting on something. And when I started the church  you know  I had no plans to do what it's doing now. And then when I wrote this book  and all of a sudden  it just took off  and I started saying  now  what's the purpose of this  Because as I started to say  I don't think you're given money or fame for your own ego  ever. I just don't believe that. And when you write a book that the first sentence of the book is   It's not about you   then  when all of a sudden it becomes the best selling book in history  you've got to figure  well  I guess it's not about me. That's kind of a no brainer. So  what is it for  And I began to think about what I call the  stewardship of affluence  and the  stewardship of influence.  So I believe  essentially  leadership is stewardship. That if you are a leader in any area    in business  in politics  in sports  in art  in academics  in any area    you don't own it. You are a steward of it. For instance  that's why I believe in protecting the environment. This is not my planet. It wasn't mine before I was born  it's not going to be mine after I die  I'm just here for    years and then that's it. I was debating the other day on a talk show  and the guy was challenging me and he'd go   What's a pastor doing on protecting the environment   And I asked this guy  I said   Well  do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation  Do you think we have a stewardship here  to take the environment seriously   And he said   No.  I said   Oh  you don't   I said   Let me make this clear again  Do you believe that as human beings    I'm not talking about religion    do you believe that as human beings  it is our responsibility to take care of this planet  and make it just a little bit better for the next generation   And he said   No. Not any more than any other species.  When he said the word  species   he was revealing his worldview. And he was saying   I'm no more responsible to take care of this environment than a duck is.  Well now  I know a lot of times we act like ducks  but you're not a duck. You're not a duck. And you are responsible    that's my worldview. And so  you need to understand what your worldview is. The problem is most people never really think it through. They never really ... codify it or qualify it or quantify it  and say   This is what I believe in. This is why I believe what I believe.  I don't personally have enough faith to be an atheist. But you may  you may. Your worldview  though  does determine everything else in your life  because it determines your decisions  it determines your relationships  it determines your level of confidence. It determines  really  everything in your life. What we believe  obviously    and you know this    determines our behavior  and our behavior determines what we become in life. So all of this money started pouring in  and all of this fame started pouring in. And I'm going  what do I do with this  My wife and I first made five decisions on what to do with the money. We said   First  we're not going to use it on ourselves.  I didn't go out and buy a bigger house. I don't own a guesthouse. I still drive the same four year old Ford that I've driven. We just said  we're not going to use it on us. The second thing was  I stopped taking a salary from the church that I pastor. Third thing is  I added up all that the church had paid me over the last    years  and I gave it back. And I gave it back because I didn't want anybody thinking that I do what I do for money    I don't. In fact  personally  I've never met a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money. I know that's the stereotype  I've never met one of them. Believe me  there's a whole lot easier ways to make money. Pastors are like on    hours a day call  they're like doctors. I left late today    I'd hoped to be here yesterday    because my father in law is in his last  probably     hours before he dies of cancer. And I'm watching a guy who's lived his life    he's now in his mid   s    and he's dying with peace. You know  the test of your worldview is not how you act in the good times. The test of your worldview is how you act at the funeral. And having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals  it makes a difference. It makes a difference what you believe. So  we gave it all back  and then we set up three foundations  working on some of the major problems of the world  illiteracy  poverty  pandemic diseases    particularly HIV AIDS    and set up these three foundations  and put the money into that. The last thing we did is we became what I call  reverse tithers.  And that is  when my wife and I got married    years ago  we started tithing. Now  that's a principle in the Bible that says give    percent of what you get back to charity  give it away to help other people. So  we started doing that  and each year we would raise our tithe one percent. So  our first year of marriage we went to    percent  second year we went to    percent  and the third year we went to    percent  and on and on and on. Why did I do that  Because every time I give  it breaks the grip of materialism in my life. Materialism is all about getting    get  get  get  get all you can  can all you get  sit on the can and spoil the rest. It's all about more  having more. And we think that the good life is actually looking good    that's most important of all    looking good  feeling good and having the goods. But that's not the good life. I meet people all the time who have those  and they're not necessarily happy. If money actually made you happy  then the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest. And that I know  personally  I know  is not true. It's just not true. So  the good life is not about looking good  feeling good or having the goods  it's about being good and doing good. Giving your life away. Significance in life doesn't come from status  because you can always find somebody who's got more than you. It doesn't come from sex. It doesn't come from salary. It comes from serving. It is in giving our lives away that we find meaning  we find significance. That's the way we were wired  I believe  by God. And so we began to give away  and now after    years  my wife and I are reverse tithers    we give away    percent and live on   . That  actually  was the easy part. The hard part is  what do I do with all this attention  Because I started getting all kinds of invitations. I just came off a nearly month long speaking tour on three different continents  and I won't go into that  but it was an amazing thing. And I'm going  what do I do with this notoriety that the book has brought  And  being a pastor  I started reading the Bible. There's a chapter in the Bible called Psalm     and it's Solomon's prayer for more influence. When you read this prayer  it sounds incredibly selfish  self centered. He says   God  I want you to make me famous.  That's what he prays. He said   I want you to make me famous. I want you to spread the fame of my name through every land  I want you to give me power. I want you to make me famous  I want you to give me influence.  And it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make  if you were going to pray. Until you read the whole psalm  the whole chapter. And then he says   So that the king ...     he was the king of Israel at that time  at its apex in power     ... so that the king may care for the widow and orphan  support the oppressed  defend the defenseless  care for the sick  assist the poor  speak up for the foreigner  those in prison.  Basically  he's talking about all the marginalized in society. And as I read that  I looked at it  and I thought  you know  what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. The purpose of influence is not to build your ego. Or your net worth. And  by the way  your net worth is not the same thing as your self worth. Your value is not based on your valuables. It's based on a whole different set of things. And so the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. And I had to admit  I can't think of the last time I thought of widows and orphans. They're not on my radar. I pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of America    a bunch of gated communities. I have a church full of CEOs and scientists. And I could go five years and never  ever see a homeless person. They're just not in my pathway. Now  they're    miles up the road in Santa Ana. So I had to say  ok  I would use whatever affluence and whatever influence I've got to help those who don't have either of those. You know  there's a story in the Bible about Moses  whether you believe it's true or not  it really doesn't matter to me. But Moses  if you saw the movie   The Ten Commandments   Moses goes out  and there's this burning bush  and God talks to him  and God says   Moses  what's in your hand   I think that's one of the most important questions you'll ever be asked  What's in your hand  Moses says   It's a staff. It's a shepherd's staff.  And God says   Throw it down.  And if you saw the movie  you know  he throws it down and it becomes a snake. And then God says   Pick it up.  And he picks it back up again  and it becomes a staff again. Now  I'm reading this thing  and I'm going  what is that all about  OK. What's that all about  Well  I do know a couple of things. Number one  God never does a miracle to show off. It's not just   Wow  isn't that cool   And  by the way  my God doesn't have to show up on cheese bread. You know  if God's going to show up  he's not going to show up on cheese bread. Ok  I just  this is why I love what Michael does  because it's like  if he's debunking it  then I don't have to. But God    my God    doesn't show up on sprinkler images. He's got a few more powerful ways than that to do whatever he wants to do. But he doesn't do miracles just to show off. Second thing is  if God ever asks you a question  he already knows the answer. Obviously  if he's God  then that would mean that when he asks the question  it's for your benefit  not his. So he's going   What's in your hand   Now  what was in Moses' hand  Well  it was a shepherd's staff. Now  follow me on this. This staff represented three things about Moses' life. First  it represented his identity  he was a shepherd. It's the symbol of his own occupation  I am a shepherd. It's a symbol of his identity  his career  his job. Second  it's a symbol of not only his identity  it's a symbol of his income  because all of his assets are tied up in sheep. In those days  nobody had bank accounts  or American Express cards  or hedge funds. Your assets are tied up in your flocks. So it's a symbol of his identity  and it's a symbol of his income. And the third thing  it's a symbol of his influence. What do you do with a shepherd's staff  Well  you know  you move sheep from point A to point B with it  by hook or by crook. You pull them or you poke them. One or the other. So  he's saying   You're going to lay down your identity. What's in your hand  You've got identity  you've got income  you've got influence. What's in your hand   And he's saying   If you lay it down  I'll make it come alive. I'll do some things you could never imagine possible.  And if you've watched that movie   Ten Commandments   all of those big miracles that happen in Egypt are done through this staff. Last year  I was invited to speak at the NBA All Stars game. And so  I'm talking to the players  because most of the NBA teams  NFL teams and all the other teams have done this    Days of Purpose  based on the book. And I asked them  I said   What's in your hand  So  what's in your hand   I said   It's a basketball. And that basketball represents your identity  who you are  you're an NBA player. It represents your income  you're making a lot of money off that little ball. And it represents your influence. And even though you're only going to be in the NBA for a few years  you're going to be an NBA player for the rest of your life. And that gives you enormous influence. So  what are you going to do with what you've been given   And I guess that's the main reason I came up here today  to all of you very bright people at TED    it is to say   What's in your hand   What do you have that you've been given  Talent  background  education  freedom  networks  opportunities  wealth  ideas  creativity. What are you doing with what you've been given  That  to me  is the primary question about life. That  to me  is what being purpose driven is all about. In the book  I talk about how you're wired to do certain things  you're  SHAPED  with    a little acrostic  Spiritual gifts  Heart  Ability  Personality and Experiences. These things shape you. And if you want to know what you ought to be doing with your life  you need to look at your shape     What am I wired to do   Why would God wire you to do something and then not have you do it  If you're wired to be an anthropologist  you'll be an anthropologist. If you're wired to be an undersea explorer  you'll be an undersea explorer. If you're wired to make deals  you make deals. If you're wired to paint  you paint. Did you know that God smiles when you be you  When my little kids    when my kids were little    they're all grown now  I have grandkids    I used to go in and sit on the side of their bed  and I used to watch my kids sleep. And I just watched their little bodies rise and lower  rise and lower. And I would look at them   This is not an accident.  Rise and lower. And I got joy out of just watching them sleep. Some people have the misguided idea that God only gets excited when you're doing  quote   spiritual things   like going to church or helping the poor  or  you know  confessing or doing something like that. The bottom line is  God gets pleasure watching you be you. Why  He made you. And when you do what you were made to do  he goes   That's my boy  That's my girl  You're using the talent and ability that I gave you.  So my advice to you is  look at what's in your hand    your identity  your influence  your income    and say   It's not about me. It's about making the world a better place.  Thank you. It's wonderful to be back. I love this wonderful gathering. And you must be wondering   What on earth  Have they put up the wrong slide   No  no. Look at this magnificent beast  and ask the question  Who designed it  This is TED  this is Technology  Entertainment  Design  and there's a dairy cow. It's a quite wonderfully designed animal. And I was thinking  how do I introduce this  And I thought  well  maybe that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer  you know   Poems are made by fools like me  but only God can make a tree.  And you might say   Well  God designed the cow.  But  of course  God got a lot of help. This is the ancestor of cattle. This is the aurochs. And it was designed by natural selection  the process of natural selection  over many millions of years. And then it became domesticated  thousands of years ago. And human beings became its stewards  and  without even knowing what they were doing  they gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it. And then more recently  they really began to do reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what the parts were  how they worked and how they might be optimized    how they might be made better. Now  why am I talking about cows  Because I want to say that much the same thing is true of religions. Religions are natural phenomena    they're just as natural as cows. They have evolved over millennia. They have a biological base  just like the aurochs. They have become domesticated  and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years. This is TED  and I want to talk about design. Because what I've been doing for the last four years    really since the first time you saw me    some of you saw me at TED when I was talking about religion    and in the last four years  I've been working just about non stop on this topic. And you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions. Now that very idea  I think  strikes terror in many people  or anger  or anxiety of one sort or another. And that is the spell that I want to break. I want to say  no  religions are an important natural phenomenon. We should study them with the same intensity that we study all the other important natural phenomena  like global warming  as we heard so eloquently last night from Al Gore. Today's religions are brilliantly designed    brilliantly designed. They are immensely powerful social institutions and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering. And  as with the cow  there's a mixture of evolutionary design    designed by natural selection itself    and intelligent design    more or less intelligent design    and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions. You don't do book talks at TED  but I'm going to have just one slide about my book  because there is one message in it which I think this group really needs to hear. And I would be very interested to get your responses to this. It's the one policy proposal that I make in the book  at this time  when I claim not to know enough about religion to know what other policy proposals to make. And it's one that echoes remarks that you've heard already today. Here's my proposal  I'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it  Education on world religions for all of our children    in primary school  in high school  in public schools  in private schools and in home schooling. So what I'm proposing is  just as we require reading  writing  arithmetic  American history  so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world    about their history  about their creeds  about their texts  their music  their symbolisms  their prohibitions  their requirements. And this should be presented factually  straightforwardly  with no particular spin  to all of the children in the country. And as long as you teach them that  you can teach them anything else you like. That  I think  is maximal tolerance for religious freedom. As long as you inform your children about other religions  then you may    and as early as you like and whatever you like    teach them whatever creed you want them to learn. But also let them know about other religions. Now  why do I say that  Because democracy depends on an informed citizenship. Informed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy. Misinformed consent is not worth it. It's like a coin flip  it doesn't count  really. Democracy depends on informed consent. This is the way we treat people as responsible adults. Now  children below the age of consent are a special case. Parents    I'm going to use a word that Pastor Rick just used    parents are stewards of their children. They don't own them. You can't own your children. You have a responsibility to the world  to the state  to them  to take care of them right. You may teach them whatever creed you think is most important  but I say you have a responsibility to let them be informed about all the other creeds in the world  too. The reason I've taken this time is I've been fascinated to hear some of the reactions to this. One reviewer for a Roman Catholic newspaper called it  totalitarian.  It strikes me as practically libertarian. Is it totalitarian to require reading  writing and arithmetic  I don't think so. All I'm saying is    and facts  facts only  no values  just facts    about all the world's religions. Another reviewer called it  hilarious.  Well  I'm really bothered by the fact that anybody would think that was hilarious. It seems to me to be such a plausible  natural extension of the democratic principles we already have that I'm shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous. I know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths. I don't think that's defensible. But I'd really be pleased to get your answers on that    any reactions to that    later. But now I'm going to move on. Back to the cow. This picture  which I pulled off the web    the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture. That's the steward. Cows couldn't live without human stewards    they're domesticated. They're a sort of ectosymbiont. They depend on us for their survival. And Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep. I'm going to talk about sheep  too. There's a lot of serendipitous convergence here. How clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds  Think of what this got them. They could outsource all their problems  protection from predators  food finding ... ... health maintenance. The only cost in most flocks    not even this    a loss of free mating. What a deal   How clever of sheep   you might say. Except  of course  it wasn't the sheep's cleverness. We all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists    they're not very smart. It wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all. They were clueless. But it was a very clever move. Whose clever move was it  It was the clever move of natural selection itself. Francis Crick  the co discoverer of the structure of DNA with Jim Watson  once joked about what he called Orgel's Second Rule. Leslie Orgel is a molecular biologist  brilliant guy  and Orgel's Second Rule is  Evolution is cleverer than you are. Now  that is not Intelligent Design    not from Francis Crick. Evolution is cleverer than you are. If you understand Orgel's Second Rule  then you understand why the Intelligent Design movement is basically a hoax. The designs discovered by the process of natural selection are brilliant  unbelievably brilliant. Again and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered. But the process itself is without purpose  without foresight  without design. When I was here four years ago  I told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass. And why the ant was doing it was because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce. So it was sort of a spooky story. And I think some people may have misunderstood. Lancet flukes aren't smart. I submit that the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there  somewhere between petunia and carrot. They're not really bright. They don't have to be. The lesson we learn from this is  you don't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary. The design is there in nature  but it's not in anybody's head. It doesn't have to be. That's the way evolution works. Question  Was domestication good for sheep  It was great for their genetic fitness. And here I want to remind you of a wonderful point that Paul MacCready made at TED three years ago. Here's what he said   Ten thousand years ago  at the dawn of agriculture  human population  plus livestock and pets  was approximately a tenth of one percent of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass.  That was just        years ago. Yesterday  in biological terms. What is it today  Does anybody remember what he told us     percent. That is what we have done on this planet. Now  I talked to Paul afterwards    I wanted to check to find out how he'd calculated this  and get the sources and so forth    and he also gave me a paper that he had written on this. And there was a passage in it which he did not present here and I think it is so good  I'm going to read it to you   Over billions of years on a unique sphere  chance has painted a thin covering of life  complex  improbable  wonderful and fragile. Suddenly  we humans    a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature    have grown in population  technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush.  We heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish. Life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet. And we're the ones that hold the paintbrush. And how can we do that  The key to our domination of the planet is culture. And the key to culture is religion. Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth. They would be puzzled by many things. Anybody know what this is  I'll tell you what it is. This is a million people gathering on the banks of the Ganges in       perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever  as seen from satellite photograph. Here's a big crowd. Here's another crowd in Mecca. Martians would be amazed by this. They'd want to know how it originated  what it was for and how it perpetuates itself. Actually  I'm going to pass over this. The ant isn't alone. There's all sorts of wonderful cases of species which    in that case    A parasite gets into a mouse and needs to get into the belly of a cat. And it turns the mouse into Mighty Mouse  makes it fearless  so it runs out in the open  where it'll be eaten by a cat. True story. In other words  we have these hijackers    you've seen this slide before  from four years ago    a parasite that infects the brain and induces even suicidal behavior  on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness. Does that ever happen to us  Yes  it does    quite wonderfully. The Arabic word  Islam  means  submission.  It means  surrender of self interest to the will of Allah.  But I'm not just talking about Islam. I'm talking also about Christianity. This is a parchment music page that I found in a Paris bookstall    years ago. And on it  it says  in Latin   Semen est verbum Dei. Sator autem Christus.  The word of God is the seed and the sower of the seed is Christ. Same idea. Well  not quite. But in fact  Christians  too ... glory in the fact that they have surrendered to God. I'll give you a few quotes.  The heart of worship is surrender. Surrendered people obey God's words  even if it doesn't make sense.  Those words are by Rick Warren. Those are from  The Purpose Driven Life.  And I want to turn now  briefly  to talk about that book  which I've read. You've all got a copy  and you've just heard the man. And what I want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint  because I think it's actually a brilliant book. First of all  the goal    and you heard just now what the goal is    it's to bring purpose to the lives of millions  and he has succeeded. Is it a good goal  In itself  I'm sure we all agree  it is a wonderful goal. He's absolutely right. There are lots of people out there who don't have purpose in their life  and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal. I give him an A  on this. Is the goal achieved  Yes. Thirty million copies of this book. Al Gore  eat your heart out. Just exactly what Al is trying to do  Rick is doing. This is a fantastic achievement. And the means    how does he do it  It's a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes    updating them  quietly dropping obsolete features  putting new interpretations on other features. This is the evolution of religion that's been going on for thousands of years  and he's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it. I don't have to tell you this  you just heard the man. Excellent insights into human psychology  wise advice on every page. Moreover  he invites us to look under the hood. I really appreciated that. For instance  he has an appendix where he explains his choice of translations of different Bible verses. The book is clear  vivid  accessible  beautifully formatted. Just enough repetition. That's really important. Every time you read it or say it  you make another copy in your brain. Every time you read it or say it  you make another copy in your brain. With me  everybody    you make another copy in your brain. Thank you. And now we come to my problem. Because I'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that I said about this book. But I wish it were better. I have some problems with the book. And it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems. I wish he could do this with a revision  a Mark   version of his book.  The truth will set you free.  That's what it says in the Bible  and it's something that I want to live by  too. My problem is  some of the bits in it I don't think are true. Now some of this is a difference of opinion. And that's not my main complaint  that's worth mentioning. Here's a passage    it's very much what he said  anyway   If there was no God we would all be accidents  the result of astronomical random chance in the Universe. You could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance. There would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on Earth.  Now  I just do not believe that. By the way  I find    Homer Groening's film presented a beautiful alternative to that very claim. Yes  there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong. We don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us. But that  as I said  is just a difference of opinion. That's not what I'm really worried about. How about this   God designed this planet's environment just so we could live in it.  I'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean that we don't have to do the sorts of things that Al Gore is trying so hard to get us to do. I am not happy with that sentiment at all. And then I find this   All the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that the cosmos is a specially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose  a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact.  Well  that's Michael Denton. He's a creationist. And here  I think   Wait a minute.  I read this again. I read it three or four times and I think   Is he really endorsing Intelligent Design  Is he endorsing creationism here   And you can't tell. So I'm sort of thinking   Well  I don't know  I don't know if I want to get upset with this yet.  But then I read on  and I read this   First  Noah had never seen rain  because prior to the Flood  God irrigated the earth from the ground up.  I wish that sentence weren't in there  because I think it is false. And I think that thinking this way about the history of the planet  after we've just been hearing about the history of the planet over millions of years  discourages people from scientific understanding. Now  Rick Warren uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way. Here's one   God deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him in a way that makes your ministry unique. He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail that created you.  I think that's false. Now  maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical. Here's another one   For instance  your brain can store     trillion facts. Your mind can handle        decisions a second.  Well  it would be interesting to find the interpretation where I would accept that. There might be some way of treating that as true.  Anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge  hardwired by God into the very fiber of our being    an inbuilt need to connect with God.  Well  the sense of which I agree with him  except I think it has an evolutionary explanation. And what I find deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral  if you want to have meaning in your life  you have to be an Intelligent Designer  you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection. And I think  on the contrary  that it is very important to solving the world's problems that we take evolutionary biology seriously. Whose truth are we going to listen to  Well  this is from  The Purpose Driven Life    The Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life  the compass I rely on for direction  the counsel I listen to for making wise decisions  and the benchmark I use for evaluating everything.  Well maybe  OK  but what's going to follow from this  And here's one that does concern me. Remember I quoted him before with this line   Surrendered people obey God's word  even if it doesn't make sense.  And that's a problem.  Don't ever argue with the Devil. He's better at arguing than you are  having had thousands of years to practice.  Now  Rick Warren didn't invent this clever move. It's an old move. It's a very clever adaptation of religions. It's a wild card for disarming any reasonable criticism.  You don't like my interpretation  You've got a reasonable objection to it  Don't listen  don't listen  That's the Devil speaking.  This discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship it seems to me that we want to have. I've got one more problem  then I'm through. And I'd really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it.  In the Great Commission  Jesus said  'Go to all people of all nations and make them my disciples. Baptize them in the name of the Father  the Son and the Holy Spirit  and teach them to do everything I've told you.'  The Bible says Jesus is the only one who can save the world. We've seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so. Here's one  not as beautiful as the others  it simply shows the religions of the world. Here's one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions. Do we really want to commit ourselves to engulfing all the other religions  when their holy books are telling them   Don't listen to the other side  that's just Satan talking    It seems to me that that's a very problematic ship to get on for the future. I found this sign as I was driving to Maine recently  in front of a church   Good without God becomes zero.  Sort of cute. A very clever little meme. I don't believe it and I think this idea  popular as it is    not in this guise  but in general    is itself one of the main problems that we face. If you are like me  you know many wonderful  committed  engaged atheists  agnostics  who are being very good without God. And you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanctity instead of doing good works. So  I wish we could drop this meme. I wish this meme would go extinct. Thanks very much for your attention.
