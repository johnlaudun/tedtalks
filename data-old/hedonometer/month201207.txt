The phenomenon you saw here for a brief moment is called quantum levitation and quantum locking. And the object that was levitating here is called a superconductor. Superconductivity is a quantum state of matter  and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature. Now  it's quite an old phenomenon  it was discovered     years ago. However  only recently  due to several technological advancements  we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum levitation and quantum locking. So  a superconductor is defined by two properties. The first is zero electrical resistance  and the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor. That sounds complicated  right  But what is electrical resistance  So  electricity is the flow of electrons inside a material. And these electrons  while flowing  they collide with the atoms  and in these collisions they lose a certain amount of energy. And they dissipate this energy in the form of heat  and you know that effect. However  inside a superconductor there are no collisions  so there is no energy dissipation. It's quite remarkable. Think about it. In classical physics  there is always some friction  some energy loss. But not here  because it is a quantum effect. But that's not all  because superconductors don't like magnetic fields. So a superconductor will try to expel magnetic field from the inside  and it has the means to do that by circulating currents. Now  the combination of both effects    the expulsion of magnetic fields and zero electrical resistance    is exactly a superconductor. But the picture isn't always perfect  as we all know  and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor. Now  under proper conditions  which we have here  these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor. And these strands of magnetic field inside the superconductor  they come in discrete quantities. Why  Because it is a quantum phenomenon. It's quantum physics. And it turns out that they behave like quantum particles. In this movie here  you can see how they flow one by one discretely. This is strands of magnetic field. These are not particles  but they behave like particles. So  this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking. But what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field  Well  first there are strands of magnetic field left inside  but now the superconductor doesn't like them moving around  because their movements dissipate energy  which breaks the superconductivity state. So what it actually does  it locks these strands  which are called fluxons  and it locks these fluxons in place. And by doing that  what it actually does is locking itself in place. Why  Because any movement of the superconductor will change their place  will change their configuration. So we get quantum locking. And let me show you how this works. I have here a superconductor  which I wrapped up so it'd stay cold long enough. And when I place it on top of a regular magnet  it just stays locked in midair. Now  this is not just levitation. It's not just repulsion. I can rearrange the fluxons  and it will be locked in this new configuration. Like this  or move it slightly to the right or to the left. So  this is quantum locking    actually locking    three dimensional locking of the superconductor. Of course  I can turn it upside down  and it will remain locked. Now  now that we understand that this so called levitation is actually locking  Yeah  we understand that. You won't be surprised to hear that if I take this circular magnet  in which the magnetic field is the same all around  the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet. Why  Because as long as it rotates  the locking is maintained. You see  I can adjust and I can rotate the superconductor. We have frictionless motion. It is still levitating  but can move freely all around. So  we have quantum locking and we can levitate it on top of this magnet. But how many fluxons  how many magnetic strands are there in a single disk like this  Well  we can calculate it  and it turns out  quite a lot. One hundred billion strands of magnetic field inside this three inch disk. But that's not the amazing part yet  because there is something I haven't told you yet. And  yeah  the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here is only half a micron thick. It's extremely thin. And this extremely thin layer is able to levitate more than        times its own weight. It's a remarkable effect. It's very strong. Now  I can extend this circular magnet  and make whatever track I want. For example  I can make a large circular rail here. And when I place the superconducting disk on top of this rail  it moves freely. And again  that's not all. I can adjust its position like this  and rotate  and it freely moves in this new position. And I can even try a new thing  let's try it for the first time. I can take this disk and put it here  and while it stays here    don't move    I will try to rotate the track  and hopefully  if I did it correctly  it stays suspended. You see  it's quantum locking  not levitation. Now  while I'll let it circulate for a little more  let me tell you a little bit about superconductors. Now     Laughter     So we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors  so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fields  such as needed in MRI machines  particle accelerators and so on. But we can also store energy using superconductors  because we have no dissipation. And we could also produce power cables  to transfer enormous amounts of current between power stations. Imagine you could back up a single power station with a single superconducting cable. But what is the future of quantum levitation and quantum locking  Well  let me answer this simple question by giving you an example. Imagine you would have a disk similar to the one I have here in my hand  three inch diameter  with a single difference. The superconducting layer  instead of being half a micron thin  being two millimeters thin  quite thin. This two millimeter thin superconducting layer could hold       kilograms  a small car  in my hand. Amazing. Thank you. I'd like to talk about my dad. My dad has Alzheimer's disease. He started showing the symptoms about    years ago  and he was officially diagnosed in     . Now he's really pretty sick. He needs help eating  he needs help getting dressed  he doesn't really know where he is or when it is  and it's been really  really hard. My dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life  and I've spent the last decade watching him disappear. My dad's not alone. There's about    million people globally living with some kind of dementia  and by      they're expecting that to double to    million. That's a lot of people. Dementia scares us. The confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia  the big numbers of people who get it  they frighten us. And because of that fear  we tend to do one of two things  We go into denial   It's not me  it has nothing to do with me  it's never going to happen to me.  Or  we decide that we're going to prevent dementia  and it will never happen to us because we're going to do everything right and it won't come and get us. I'm looking for a third way  I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease. Prevention is good  and I'm doing the things that you can do to prevent Alzheimer's. I'm eating right  I'm exercising every day  I'm keeping my mind active  that's what the research says you should do. But the research also shows that there's nothing that will     percent protect you. If the monster wants you  the monster's gonna get you. That's what happened with my dad. My dad was a bilingual college professor. His hobbies were chess  bridge and writing op eds. He got dementia anyway. If the monster wants you  the monster's gonna get you. Especially if you're me  'cause Alzheimer's tends to run in families. So I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease. Based on what I've learned from taking care of my father  and researching what it's like to live with dementia  I'm focusing on three things in my preparation  I'm changing what I do for fun  I'm working to build my physical strength  and    this is the hard one    I'm trying to become a better person. Let's start with the hobbies. When you get dementia  it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself. You can't sit and have long talks with your old friends  because you don't know who they are. It's confusing to watch television  and often very frightening. And reading is just about impossible. When you care for someone with dementia  and you get training  they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar  hands on  open ended. With my dad  that turned out to be letting him fill out forms. He was a college professor at a state school  he knows what paperwork looks like. He'll sign his name on every line  he'll check all the boxes  he'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers. But it got me thinking  what would my caregivers do with me  I'm my father's daughter. I read  I write  I think about global health a lot. Would they give me academic journals so I could scribble in the margins  Would they give me charts and graphs that I could color  So I've been trying to learn to do things that are hands on. I've always liked to draw  so I'm doing it more even though I'm really very bad at it. I am learning some basic origami. I can make a really great box. And I'm teaching myself to knit  which so far I can knit a blob. But  you know  it doesn't matter if I'm actually good at it. What matters is that my hands know how to do it. Because the more things that are familiar  the more things my hands know how to do  the more things that I can be happy and busy doing when my brain's not running the show anymore. They say that people who are engaged in activities are happier  easier for their caregivers to look after  and it may even slow the progress of the disease. That all seems like win to me. I want to be as happy as I can for as long as I can. A lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms  as well as cognitive symptoms. You lose your sense of balance  you get muscle tremors  and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile. They get scared to walk around. They get scared to move. So I'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance. I'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance  so that when I start to lose it  I'll still be able to be mobile. I'm doing weight bearing exercise  so that I have the muscle strength so that when I start to wither  I have more time that I can still move around. Finally  the third thing. I'm trying to become a better person. My dad was kind and loving before he had Alzheimer's  and he's kind and loving now. I've seen him lose his intellect  his sense of humor  his language skills  but I've also seen this  He loves me  he loves my sons  he loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers. And that love makes us want to be around him  even now. even when it's so hard. When you take away everything that he ever learned in this world  his naked heart still shines. I was never as kind as my dad  and I was never as loving. And what I need now is to learn to be like that. I need a heart so pure that if it's stripped bare by dementia  it will survive. I don't want to get Alzheimer's disease. What I want is a cure in the next    years  soon enough to protect me. But if it comes for me  I'm going to be ready. Thank you. About    years ago  my grandfather  a young man  walked into a tent that was converted into a movie theater like that  and he fell hopelessly in love with the woman he saw on the silver screen  none other than Mae West  the heartthrob of the '  s  and he could never forget her. In fact  when he had his daughter many years later  he wanted to name her after Mae West  but can you imagine an Indian child name Mae West  The Indian family said  no way  So when my twin brother Kaesava was born  he decided to tinker with the spelling of Keshava's name. He said  if Mae West can be M A E  why can't Keshava be K A E  So he changed Kaesava's spelling. Now Kaesava had a baby boy called Rehan a couple of weeks ago. He decided to spell  or  rather  misspell Raehan with an A E. You know  my grandfather died many years ago when I was little  but his love for Mae West lives on as a misspelling in the DNA of his progeny. That for me is successful legacy.  Laughs  You know  as for me  my wife and I have our own crazy legacy project. We actually sit every few years  argue  disagree  fight  and actually come up with our very own     year plan. Our friends think we're mad. Our parents think we're cuckoo. Because  you know  we both come from families that really look up to humility and wisdom  but we both like to live larger than life. I believe in the concept of a Raja Yogi  Be a dude before you can become an ascetic. This is me being a rock star  even if it's in my own house. You know  So when Netra and I sat down to make our first plan    years ago  we said we want the focus of this plan to go way beyond ourselves. What do we mean by beyond ourselves  Well     years  we calculated  is at the end of our direct contact with the world. There's nobody I'll meet in my life will ever live beyond     years  so we thought that's a perfect place where we should situate our plan and let our imagination take flight. You know  I never really believed in legacy. What am I going to leave behind  I'm an artist. Until I made a cartoon about     . It caused so much trouble for me. I was so upset. You know  a cartoon that was meant to be a cartoon of the week ended up staying so much longer. Now I'm in the business of creating art that will definitely even outlive me  and I think about what I want to leave behind through those paintings. You know  the      cartoon upset me so much that I decided I'll never cartoon again. I said  I'm never going to make any honest public commentary again. But of course I continued creating artwork that was honest and raw  because I forgot about how people reacted to my work. You know  sometimes forgetting is so important to remain idealistic. Perhaps loss of memory is so crucial for our survival as human beings. One of the most important things in my     year plan that Netra and I write is what to forget about ourselves. You know  we carry so much baggage  from our parents  from our society  from so many people    fears  insecurities    and our     year plan really lists all our childhood problems that we have to expire. We actually put an expiry date on all our childhood problems. The latest date I put was  I said  I am going to expire my fear of my leftist  feminist mother in law  and this today is the date   Laughs  She's watching.  Laughter  Anyway  you know  I really make decisions all the time about how I want to remember myself  and that's the most important kind of decisions I make. And this directly translates into my paintings. But like my friends  I can do that really well on Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Flickr  YouTube. Name it  I'm on it. I've started outsourcing my memory to the digital world  you know  But that comes with a problem. It's so easy to think of technology as a metaphor for memory  but our brains are not perfect storage devices like technology. We only remember what we want to. At least I do. And I rather think of our brains as biased curators of our memory  you know  And if technology is not a metaphor for memory  what is it  Netra and I use our technology as a tool in our     year plan to really curate our digital legacy. That is a picture of my mother  and she recently got a Facebook account. You know where this is going. And I've been very supportive until this picture shows up on my Facebook page.  Laughter  And I actually untagged myself first  then I picked up the phone. I said   Mom  you will never put a picture of me in a bikini ever again.  And she said   Why  You look so cute  darling.  I said   You just don't understand.  Maybe we are among the first generation that really understands this digital curating of ourselves. Maybe we are the first to even actively record our lives. You know  whether you agree with  you know  legacy or not  we are actually leaving behind digital traces all the time. So Netra and I really wanted to use our     year plan to curate this digital legacy  and not only digital legacy but we believe in curating the legacy of my past and future. How  you may ask  Well  when I think of the future  I never see myself moving forward in time. I actually see time moving backward towards me. I can actually visualize my future approaching. I can dodge what I don't want and pull in what I want. It's like a video game obstacle course. And I've gotten better and better at doing this. Even when I make a painting  I actually imagine I'm behind the painting  it already exists  and someone's looking at it  and I see whether they're feeling it from their gut. Are they feeling it from their heart  or is it just a cerebral thing  And it really informs my painting. Even when I do an art show  I really think about  what should people walk away with  I remember when I was     I did  I wanted to do my first art exhibition  and I wanted the whole world to know about it. I didn't know TED then  but what I did was I closed my eyes tight  and I started dreaming. I could imagine people coming in  dressed up  looking beautiful  my paintings with all the light  and in my visualization I actually saw a very famous actress launching my show  giving credibility to me. And I woke up from my visualization and I said  who was that  I couldn't tell if it was Shabana Azmi or Rekha  two very famous Indian actresses  like the Meryl Streeps of India. As it turned out  next morning I wrote a letter to both of them  and Shabana Azmi replied  and came and launched my very first show    years ago. And what a bang it started my career with  You know  when we think of time in this way  we can curate not only the future but also the past. This is a picture of my family  and that is Netra  my wife. She's the co creator of my     year plan. Netra's a high school history teacher. I love Netra  but I hate history. I keep saying   Nets  you live in the past while I'll create the future  and when I'm done  you can study about it.  She gave me an indulgent smile  and as punishment  she said   Tomorrow I'm teaching a class on Indian history  and you are sitting in it  and I'm grading you.  I'm like   Oh  God.  I went. I actually went and sat in on her class. She started by giving students primary source documents from India  Pakistan  from Britain  and I said   Wow.  Then she asked them to separate fact from bias. I said   Wow   again. Then she said   Choose your facts and biases and create an image of your own story of dignity.  History as an imaging tool  I was so inspired. I went and created my own version of Indian history. I actually included stories from my grandmother. She used to work for the telephone exchange  and she used to actually overhear conversations between Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten. And she used to hear all kinds of things she shouldn't have heard. But  you know  I include things like that. This is my version of Indian history. You know  if this is so  it occurred to me that maybe  just maybe  the primary objective of our brains is to serve our dignity. Go tell Facebook to figure that out  Netra and I don't write our     year plan for someone else to come and execute it in     years. Imagine receiving a parcel saying  from the past  okay now you're supposed to spend the rest of your life doing all of this. No. We actually write it only to set our attitudes right. You know  I used to believe that education is the most important tool to leave a meaningful legacy. Education is great. It really teaches us who we are  and helps us contextualize ourselves in the world  but it's really my creativity that's taught me that I can be much more than what my education told me I am. I'd like to make the argument that creativity is the most important tool we have. It lets us create who we are  and curate what is to come. I like to think    Thank you. I like to think of myself as a storyteller  where my past and my future are only stories  my stories  waiting to be told and retold. I hope all of you one day get a chance to share and write your own     year story. Thank you so much. Shukran   Applause  In the ocean  what is the common point between oil  plastic and radioactivity  On the top line  this is the BP oil spill  billions of barrels of oil gushing in the Gulf of Mexico. The middle line is millions of tons of plastic debris accumulating in our ocean  and the third line is radioactive material leaking from Fukushima nuclear power plant in the Pacific Ocean. Well  the three big problems have in common that they are man made problems but they are controlled by natural forces. This should make us feel very  terribly awful as much as it should make us feel hopeful  because if we have the power to create these problems  we may as well have the power to remediate these problems. But what about natural forces  Well  that's exactly what I want to talk about today  is how we can use these natural forces to remediate these man made problems. When the BP oil spill happened  I was working at MIT  and I was in charge of developing an oil spill cleaning technology. And I had a chance to go in the Gulf of Mexico and meet some fishermen and see the terrible conditions in which they were working. More than     of these boats  which are fishermen boats repurposed with oil absorbent in white and oil containment in orange  were used  but they only collected three percent of the oil on the surface  and the health of the cleaners were very deeply affected. I was working on a very interesting technology at MIT  but it was a very long term view of how to develop technology  and it was going to be a very expensive technology  and also it would be patented. So I wanted to develop something that we could develop very fast  that would be cheap  and that would be open source  so  because oil spills are not only happening in the Gulf of Mexico  and that would be using renewable energy. So I quit my dream job  and I moved to New Orleans  and I kept on studying how the oil spill was happening. Currently  what they were doing is that they were using these small fishing boats  and they were cleaning clean lines in an ocean of dirt. If you're using the exact same amount of surface of oil absorbent  but you're just paying attention to natural patterns  and if you're going up the winds  you can collect a lot more material. If you're multiplying the rig  so you multiply how many layers of absorbent you're using  you can collect a lot more. But it's extremely difficult to move oil absorbent against the winds  the surface currents and the waves. These are enormous forces. So the very simple idea was to use the ancient technique of sailing and tacking of the wind to capture or intercept the oil that is drifting down the wind. So this didn't require any invention. We just took a simple sailing boat and we tried to pull something long and heavy  but as we tacked back and forth  what we lost was two things  we were losing pulling power and direction. And so  I thought  what about if we just take the rudder from the back of the boat to the front  would we have better control  So I built this small sailing robot with the rudder at the front  and I was trying to pull something very long and heavy  so that's a four meter long object just to pull  and I was surprised with just a    centimeter rudder  I could control four meters of absorbent. Then I was so happy that I kept playing with the robot  and so you see the robot has a front rudder here. Normally it's at the back. And  playing  I realized that the maneuverability of this was really amazing  and I could avoid an obstacle at the very last second  more maneuverable than a normal boat. Then I started publishing online  and some friends from Korea  they started being interested in this  and we made a boat which has a front rudder and a back rudder  so we started interacting with this  and it was slightly better  although it was very small and a bit off balance  but then we thought  what if we have more than two points of control  What if the entire boat becomes a point of control  What if the entire boat changes shape  So    Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  And so that's the beginning of Protei  and that's the first boat in history that completely changed the shape of the hull in order to control it  and the properties of sailing that we get are very superior compared to a normal boat. When we're turning  we have the feeling of surfing  and the way it's going up wind  it's very efficient. This is low speed  low wind speed  and the maneuverability is very increased  and here I'm going to do a small jibe  and look at the position of the sail. What's happening is that  because the boat changes shape  the position of the front sail and the main sail are different to the wind. We're catching wind from both sides. And this is exactly what we're looking  for  if we want to pull something long and heavy. We don't want to lose pulling power  nor direction. So  I wanted to know if this was possible to put this at an industrial level  so we made a large boat with a large sail  and with a very light hull  inflatable  very small footprint  so we have a very big size and power ratio. After this  we wanted to see if we could implement this and automate the system  so we used the same system but we added a structure to it so we could activate the machine. So  we used the same bladder inflated system  and we took it for testing. So this is happening in the Netherlands. We tried in the water without any skin or ballast just to see how it works. And then we mounted a camera for controlling it  but quickly we saw that we would need a lot more weight at the bottom  so we had to take it back to the lab  and then we built a skin around it  we put batteries  remote controllers  and then we put it in the water and then we let it go in the water and see how well it would work  so let some rope out  and hope it's going to work  and it worked okay  but we still have a long way. Our small prototype has given us good insight that it's working very well  but we still need to work a lot more on this. So what we are doing is an accelerated evolution of sailing technology. We went from a back rudder to a front rudder to two rudders to multiple rudders to the whole boat changing shape  and the more we are moving forward  and the more the design looks simple and cute.  Laughter  But I wanted to show you a fish because    In fact  it's very different from a fish. A fish will move because    by changing like this  but our boat is propelled by the wind still  and the hull controls the trajectory. So I brought to you for the first time on the TED stage Protei Number Eight. It's not the last one  but it's a good one for making demos. So the first thing as I show you in the video is that we may be able to control the trajectory of a sailing boat better  or we may be able to never be in irons  so never facing the wind  we always can catch the wind from both sides. But new properties of a sailing boat. So if you're looking at the boat from this side  this might remind you of an airplane profile. An airplane  when you're moving in this direction  starts to lift  and that's how it takes off. Now  if you're taking the same system  and you're putting vertical  you're bending  and if you're moving this way forward  your instinct will tell you that you might go this way  but if you're moving fast enough  you might create what we call lateral lift  so we could get further or closer to the wind. Other property is this  A normal sailing boat has a centerboard here and a rudder at the back  and these two things are what creates most resistance and turbulence behind the boat  but because this doesn't have either a centerboard or a rudder  we hope that if we keep working on this hull design we can improve and have less resistance. The other thing is  most boats  when they reach a certain speed  and they are going on waves  they start to hit and slap on the surface of the water  and a lot of the energy moving forward is lost. But if we're going with the flow  if we pay attention to natural patterns instead of trying to be strong  but if you're going with the flow  we may absorb a lot of environmental noises  so the wave energy  to actually save some energy to move forward. So we may have developed the technology which is very efficient for pulling something long and heavy  but the idea is  what is the purpose of technology if it doesn't reach the right hands  Normal technology or innovation happens like this  Somebody has an interesting idea  some other scientist or engineer  they take it to the next level  they make a theory about it and maybe they patent it  and then some industry will make a contract of exclusivity to manufacture and sell it  and then  eventually  a buyer will buy it  and we hope that they are going to use  it  for a good purpose. What we really want is that this innovation happens continuously. The inventor and engineers and also the manufacturers and everybody works at the same time  but this would be sterile if this was happening in a parallel and uncrossed process. What you really want is not a sequential  not parallel development. You want to have a network of innovation. You want everybody  like we're doing now  to work at the same time  and that can only happen if these people all together decide to share the information  and that's exactly what open hardware is about. It's to replace competition by collaboration. It's to transform any new product into a new market. So what is open hardware  Essentially  open hardware is a license. It's just an intellectual property setup. It means that everybody is free to use  modify and distribute  and in exchange we only ask for two things  The name is credited    the name of the project    and also the people who make improvement  they share back with the community. So it's a very simple condition. And I started this project alone in a garage in New Orleans  but quickly after I wanted to publish and share this information  so I made a Kickstarter  which is a crowd fundraising platform  and in about one month we fundraised        dollars. With this money  I hired a team of young engineers from all over the world  and we rented a factory in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We were peer learning  we were engineering  we were making things  prototyping  but most importantly we were trying our prototypes in the water as often as possible  to fail as quickly as possible  to learn from. This is a proud member of Protei from Korea  and on the right side  this is a multiple masts design proposed by a team in Mexico. This idea really appealed to Gabriella Levine in New York  and so she decided to prototype this idea that she saw  and she documented every step of the process  and she published it on Instructables  which is a website for sharing inventions. Less than one week after  this is a team in Eindhoven  it's a school of engineering. They made it  but they eventually published a simplified design. They also made it into an Instructable  and in less than one week  they had almost        views  and they got many new friends. We're working on also simpler technology  not that complex  with younger people and also older people  like this dinosaur is from Mexico.  Laughter  So Protei is now an international network of innovation for selling technology using this shape shifting hull. And what puts us together is that we have a common  at least  global understanding of what the word  business  is  or what it should be. This is how most work today. Business as usual is saying  what's most important is to make lots of profit  and you'll be using technology for that  and people will be your work force  instrumentalized  and environment is usually the last priority. It will be just a way to  say  greenwash your audience and  say  increase your price tag. What we're trying to do  or what we believe  because this is how we believe the world really works  is that without the environment you have nothing. We have the people so we need to protect each other  yes  and we're a technology company  and profit is necessary to make this happen.  Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  If we have the courage to understand or accept that this actually how the world really works  and this is the order of priority that we need to choose  then it makes obvious why we need to choose open hardware for developing environmental technology  because we need to share information. What's next for us  So  this small machine that you've seen  we're hoping to make small toys like one meter remote control Protei that you can upgrade    so replace the remote control parts by Androids  so the mobile phone  and Arduino micro controller  so you could be controlling this from your mobile phone  your tablet. Then what we want to do is create six meter versions so we can test the maximum performance of these machines  so we can go at very  very high speed. So imagine yourself. You are laying down in a flexible torpedo  sailing at high speed  controlling the shape of the hull with your legs and controlling the sail with your arms. So that's what we're looking for developing.  Applause  And we replace the human being    to go  for example  for measuring radioactivity  you don't want a human to be sailing those robots    with batteries  motors  micro controllers and sensors. This is what our teammates  we dream of at night. We hope that we can sometime clean up oil spills  or we can gather or collect plastic in the ocean  or we can have swarms of our machines controlled by multi player video game engines to control many of these machines  to monitor coral reefs or to monitor fisheries. Our hope is that we can use open hardware technology to better understand and protect our oceans. Thank you very much.  Applause  I'm a gamer  so I like to have goals. I like special missions and secret objectives. So here's my special mission for this talk  I'm going to try to increase the life span of every single person in this room by seven and a half minutes. Literally  you will live seven and a half minutes longer than you would have otherwise  just because you watched this talk. Some of you are looking a little bit skeptical. That's okay  because check it out    I have math to prove that it is possible. It won't make much sense now. I'll explain it all later  just pay attention to the number at the bottom    .         minutes. That will be my gift to you if I'm successful in my mission. Now  you have a secret mission too. Your mission is to figure out how you want to spend your extra seven and a half minutes. And I think you should do something unusual with them  because these are bonus minutes. You weren't going to have them anyway. Now  because I'm a game designer  you might be thinking to yourself  I know what she wants us to do with those minutes  she wants us to spend them playing games. Now this is a totally reasonable assumption  given that I have made quite a habit of encouraging people to spend more time playing games. For example  in my first TED Talk  I did propose that we should spend    billion hours a week  as a planet  playing video games. Now     billion hours  it's a lot of time. It's so much time  in fact  that the number one unsolicited comment that I have heard from people all over the world since I gave that talk  is this  Jane  games are great and all  but on your deathbed  are you really going to wish you spent more time playing Angry Birds  This idea is so pervasive    that games are a waste of time that we will come to regret    that I hear it literally everywhere I go. For example  true story  Just a few weeks ago  this cab driver  upon finding out that a friend and I were in town for a game developers' conference  turned around and said    and I quote     I hate games. Waste of life. Imagine getting to the end of your life and regretting all that time.  Now  I want to take this problem seriously. I want games to be a force for good in the world. I don't want gamers to regret the time they spent playing  time that I encouraged them to spend. So I have been thinking about this question a lot lately. When we're on our deathbeds  will we regret the time we spent playing games  Now  this may surprise you  but it turns out there is actually some scientific research on this question. It's true. Hospice workers  the people who take care of us at the end of our lives  recently issued a report on the most frequently expressed regrets that people say when they are literally on their deathbeds. And that's what I want to share with you today    the top five regrets of the dying. Number one  I wish I hadn't worked so hard. Number two  I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends. Number three  I wish I had let myself be happier. Number four  I wish I'd had the courage to express my true self. And number five  I wish I'd lived a life true to my dreams  instead of what others expected of me. Now  as far as I know  no one ever told one of the hospice workers   I wish I'd spent more time playing video games   but when I hear these top five regrets of the dying  I can't help but hear five deep human cravings that games actually help us fulfill. For example  I wish I hadn't worked so hard. For many people  this means  I wish I'd spent more time with my family  with my kids when they were growing up. Well  we know that playing games together has tremendous family benefits. A recent study from Brigham Young University School of Family Life reported that parents who spend more time playing video games with their kids have much stronger real life relationships with them.  I wish I'd stayed in touch with my friends.  Hundreds of millions of people use social games like FarmVille or Words With Friends to stay in daily contact with real life friends and family. A recent study from the University of Michigan showed that these games are incredibly powerful relationship management tools. They help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would otherwise grow distant from  if we weren't playing games together.  I wish I'd let myself be happier.  Well  here I can't help but think of the groundbreaking clinical trials recently conducted at East Carolina University that showed that online games can outperform pharmaceuticals for treating clinical anxiety and depression. Just    minutes of online game play a day was enough to create dramatic boosts in mood and long term increases in happiness.  I wish I'd had the courage to express my true self.  Well  avatars are a way to express our true selves  our most heroic  idealized version of who we might become. You can see that in this alter ego portrait by Robbie Cooper of a gamer with his avatar. And Stanford University has been doing research for five years now to document how playing a game with an idealized avatar changes how we think and act in real life  making us more courageous  more ambitious  more committed to our goals.  I wish I'd led a life true to my dreams  and not what others expected of me.  Are games doing this yet  I'm not sure  so I've left a Super Mario question mark. We're going to come back to this one. But in the meantime  perhaps you're wondering  who is this game designer to be talking to us about deathbed regrets  And it's true  I've never worked in a hospice  I've never been on my deathbed. But recently I did spend three months in bed  wanting to die. Really wanting to die. Now let me tell you that story. It started two years ago  when I hit my head and got a concussion. The concussion didn't heal properly  and after    days  I was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches  nausea  vertigo  memory loss  mental fog. My doctor told me that in order to heal my brain  I had to rest it. So I had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms. For me that meant no reading  no writing  no video games  no work or email  no running  no alcohol  no caffeine. In other words    and I think you see where this is going    no reason to live. Of course it's meant to be funny  but in all seriousness  suicidal ideation is quite common with traumatic brain injuries. It happens to one in three  and it happened to me. My brain started telling me   Jane  you want to die.  It said   You're never going to get better.  It said   The pain will never end.  And these voices became so persistent and so persuasive that I started to legitimately fear for my life  which is the time that I said to myself after    days    and I will never forget this moment    I said   I am either going to kill myself or I'm going to turn this into a game.  Now  why a game  I knew from researching the psychology of games for more than a decade that when we play a game    and this is in the scientific literature    we tackle tough challenges with more creativity  more determination  more optimism  and we're more likely to reach out to others for help. I wanted to bring these gamer traits to my real life challenge  so I created a role playing recovery game called Jane the Concussion Slayer. Now this became my new secret identity  and the first thing I did as a slayer was call my twin sister    I have an identical twin sister named Kelly    and tell her   I'm playing a game to heal my brain  and I want you to play with me.  This was an easier way to ask for help. She became my first ally in the game  my husband Kiyash joined next  and together we identified and battled the bad guys. Now this was anything that could trigger my symptoms and therefore slow down the healing process  things like bright lights and crowded spaces. We also collected and activated power ups. This was anything I could do on even my worst day to feel just a little bit good  just a little bit productive. Things like cuddling my dog for    minutes  or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once. Now the game was that simple  Adopt a secret identity  recruit your allies  battle the bad guys  activate the power ups. But even with a game so simple  within just a couple days of starting to play  that fog of depression and anxiety went away. It just vanished. It felt like a miracle. Now it wasn't a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive symptoms. That lasted for more than a year  and it was the hardest year of my life by far. But even when I still had the symptoms  even while I was still in pain  I stopped suffering. Now what happened next with the game surprised me. I put up some blog posts and videos online  explaining how to play. But not everybody has a concussion  obviously  not everyone wants to be  the slayer   so I renamed the game SuperBetter. And soon  I started hearing from people all over the world who were adopting their own secret identity  recruiting their own allies  and they were getting  super better   facing challenges like cancer and chronic pain  depression and Crohn's disease. Even people were playing it for terminal diagnoses like ALS. And I could tell from their messages and their videos that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me. They talked about feeling stronger and braver. They talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family. And they even talked about feeling happier  even though they were in pain  even though they were tackling the toughest challenge of their lives. Now at the time  I'm thinking to myself  what is going on here  I mean  how could a game so trivial intervene so powerfully in such serious  and in some cases life and death  circumstances  I mean  if it hadn't worked for me  there's no way I would have believed it was possible. Well  it turns out there's some science here  too. Some people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event. And that's what was happening to us. The game was helping us experience what scientists call post traumatic growth  which is not something we usually hear about. We usually hear about post traumatic stress disorder. But scientists now know that a traumatic event doesn't doom us to suffer indefinitely. Instead  we can use it as a springboard to unleash our best qualities and lead happier lives. Here are the top five things that people with post traumatic growth say   My priorities have changed.   I'm not afraid to do what makes me happy.   I feel closer to my friends and family.   I understand myself better. I know who I really am now.   I have a new sense of meaning and purpose in my life.   I'm better able to focus on my goals and dreams.  Now  does this sound familiar  It should  because the top five traits of post traumatic growth are essentially the direct opposite of the top five regrets of the dying. Now this is interesting  right  It seems that somehow  a traumatic event can unlock our ability to lead a life with fewer regrets. But how does it work  How do you get from trauma to growth  Or better yet  is there a way to get all the benefits of post traumatic growth without the trauma  without having to hit your head in the first place  That would be good  right  I wanted to understand the phenomenon better  so I devoured the scientific literature  and here's what I learned. There are four kinds of strength  or resilience  that contribute to post traumatic growth  and there are scientifically validated activities that you can do every day to build up these four kinds of resilience  and you don't need a trauma to do it. I could tell you what these four types of strength are  but I'd rather you experience them firsthand. I'd rather we all start building them up together right now. Here's what we're going to do. We'll play a quick game together. This is where you earn the seven and a half minutes of bonus life that I promised you earlier. All you have to do is successfully complete the first four SuperBetter quests. And I feel like you can do it. I have confidence in you. So  everybody ready  This is your first quest. Here we go. Pick one  Stand up and take three steps  or make your hands into fists  raise them over your head as high as you can for five seconds  go  All right  I like the people doing both. You are overachievers. Very good. Well done  everyone. That is worth    physical resilience  which means that your body can withstand more stress and heal itself faster. We know from the research that the number one thing you can do to boost your physical resilience is to not sit still. That's all it takes. Every single second that you are not sitting still  you are actively improving the health of your heart  and your lungs and brains. Everybody ready for your next quest  I want you to snap your fingers exactly    times  or count backwards from     by seven  like this         ... Go  Don't give up. Don't let the people counting down from     interfere with your counting to   . Nice. Wow. That's the first time I've ever seen that. Bonus physical resilience. Well done  everyone. Now that's worth    mental resilience  which means you have more mental focus  more discipline  determination and willpower. We know from the scientific research that willpower actually works like a muscle. It gets stronger the more you exercise it. So tackling a tiny challenge without giving up  even one as absurd as snapping your fingers exactly    times or counting backwards from     by seven is actually a scientifically validated way to boost your willpower. So good job. Quest number three. Pick one  Because of the room  fate's really determined this for you  but here are the two options. If you're inside  find a window and look out of it. If you're outside  find a window and look in. Or do a quick YouTube or Google image search for  baby  your favorite animal.   Do it on your phones  or just shout out some baby animals  and I'll put them on the screen. So  what do we want to see  Sloth  giraffe  elephant  snake. Okay  let's see what we got. Baby dolphin and baby llamas. Everybody look. Got that  Okay  one more. Baby elephant. We're clapping for that  That's amazing. All right  what we're just feeling there is plus one emotional resilience  which means you have the ability to provoke powerful  positive emotions like curiosity or love  which we feel looking at baby animals  when you need them most. Here's a secret from the scientific literature for you. If you can manage to experience three positive emotions for every one negative emotion over the course of an hour  a day  a week  you dramatically improve your health and your ability to successfully tackle any problem you're facing. And this is called the three to one positive emotion ratio. It's my favorite SuperBetter trick  so keep it up. All right  pick one  last quest  Shake someone's hand for six seconds  or send someone a quick thank you by text  email  Facebook or Twitter. Go  Looking good  looking good. Nice  nice. Keep it up. I love it  All right  everybody  that is    social resilience  which means you actually get more strength from your friends  your neighbors  your family  your community. Now  a great way to boost social resilience is gratitude. Touch is even better. Here's one more secret for you  Shaking someone's hand for six seconds dramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream  now that's the trust hormone. That means that all of you who just shook hands are biochemically primed to like and want to help each other. This will linger during the break  so take advantage of the networking opportunities. Well  you have successfully completed your four quests  let's see if I've successfully completed my mission to give you seven and a half minutes of bonus life. Now I get to share one more little bit of science with you. It turns out that people who regularly boost these four types of resilience    physical  mental  emotional and social    live    years longer than everyone else. So this is true. If you are regularly achieving the three to one positive emotion ratio  if you are never sitting still for more than an hour at a time  if you are reaching out to one person you care about every single day  if you are tackling tiny goals to boost your willpower  you will live    years longer than everyone else  and here's where that math I showed you earlier comes in. So  the average life expectancy in the U.S. and the U.K. is   .  years  but we know from more than       peer reviewed scientific studies that you can add    years of life by boosting your four types of resilience. So every single year that you are boosting your four types of resilience  you're actually earning .    more years of life or    more days of life  or        more minutes of life  which means every single day  you are earning     minutes of life  or every single hour that you are boosting your four types of resilience  like we just did together  you are earning  .         more minutes of life. Congratulations  those seven and a half minutes are all yours. You totally earned them. Yeah  Awesome. Wait  wait  wait. You still have your special mission  your secret mission. How are you going to spend these minutes of bonus life  Well  here's my suggestion. These seven and a half bonus minutes are kind of like genie's wishes. You can use your first wish to wish for a million more wishes. Pretty clever  right  So  if you spend these seven and a half minutes today doing something that makes you happy  or that gets you physically active  or puts you in touch with someone you care about  or even just tackling a tiny challenge  you're going to boost your resilience  so you're going to earn more minutes. And the good news is  you can keep going like that. Every hour of the day  every day of your life  all the way to your deathbed  which will now be    years later than it would have otherwise. And when you get there  more than likely  you will not have any of those top five regrets  because you will have built up the strength and resilience to lead a life truer to your dreams. And with    extra years  you might even have enough time to play a few more games. Thank you. I'm going to start with a little story. So  I grew up in this neighborhood. When I was    years old  I went from being what I think was a strapping young athlete  over four months  slowly wasting away until I was basically a famine victim with an unquenchable thirst. I had basically digested away my body. And this all came to a head when I was on a backpacking trip  my first one ever actually  on Old Rag Mountain in West Virginia  and was putting my face into puddles of water and drinking like a dog. That night  I was taken into the emergency room and diagnosed as a type   diabetic in full blown ketoacidosis. And I recovered  thanks to the miracles of modern medicine  insulin and other things  and gained all my weight back and more. And something festered inside me after this happened. What I thought about was  what caused the diabetes  You see  diabetes is an autoimmune disease where your body fights itself  and at the time people thought that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen and then kill the cells that make insulin. And this is what I thought for a long period of time  and that's in fact what medicine and people have focused on quite a bit  the microbes that do bad things. And that's where I need my assistant here now. You may recognize her. So  I went yesterday  I apologize  I skipped a few of the talks  and I went over to the National Academy of Sciences building  and they sell toys  giant microbes. And here we go  So you have caught flesh eating disease if you caught that one. I gotta get back out my baseball ability here. So  unfortunately or not surprisingly  most of the microbes they sell at the National Academy building are pathogens. Everybody focuses on the things that kill us  and that's what I was focusing on. And it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes  and those microbes actually do us good much of the time  rather than killing us. And so  we've known about this for some period of time. People have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us  I know you're not paying attention to me  but ... The microbes that cover us. And if you look at them in the microscope  you can see that we actually have    times as many cells of microbes on us as we have human cells. There's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain. We are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms. And unfortunately  if you want to learn about the microorganisms  just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient. And so we just heard about the DNA sequencing. It turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes and to understand them is to look at their DNA. And that's what I've been doing for    years  using DNA sequencing  collecting samples from various places  including the human body  reading the DNA sequence and then using that DNA sequencing to tell us about the microbes that are in a particular place. And what's amazing  when you use this technology  for example  looking at humans  we're not just covered in a sea of microbes. There are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us. We have millions of genes of microbes in our human microbiome covering us. And so this microbial diversity differs between people  and what people have been thinking about in the last     maybe    years is  maybe these microbes  this microbial cloud in and on us  and the variation between us  may be responsible for some of the health and illness differences between us. And that comes back to the diabetes story I was telling you. It turns out that people now think that one of the triggers for type   diabetes is not fighting a pathogen  but is in fact trying to    miscommunicating with the microbes that live in and on you. And somehow maybe the microbial community that's in and on me got off  and then this triggered some sort of immune response and led to me killing the cells that make insulin in my body. And so what I want to tell you about for a few minutes is  what people have learned using DNA sequencing techniques in particular  to study the microbial cloud that lives in and on us. And I want to tell you a story about a personal project. My first personal experience with studying the microbes on the human body actually came from a talk that I gave  right around the corner from here at Georgetown. I gave a talk  and a family friend who happened to be the Dean of Georgetown Medical School was at the talk  and came up to me afterwards saying  they were doing a study of ileal transplants in people. And they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants. And so I started a collaboration with this person  Michael Zasloff and Thomas Fishbein  to look at the microbes that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient. And I can tell you all the details about the microbial study that we did there  but the reason I want to tell you this story is something really striking that they did at the beginning of this project. They take the donor ileum  which is filled with microbes from a donor and they have a recipient who might have a problem with their microbial community  say Crohn's disease  and they sterilized the donor ileum. Cleaned out all the microbes  and then put it in the recipient. They did this because this was common practice in medicine  even though it was obvious that this was not a good idea. And fortunately  in the course of this project  the transplant surgeons and the other people decided  forget common practice. We have to switch. So they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial community in the ileum. They leave the microbes with the donor  and theoretically that might help the people who are receiving this ileal transplant. And so  people    this is a study that I did now. In the last few years there's been a great expansion in using DNA technology to study the microbes in and on people. There's something called the Human Microbiome Project that's going on in the United States  and MetaHIT going on in Europe  and a lot of other projects. And when people have done a variety of studies  they have learned things such as  when a baby is born  during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the microbes from your mother. There are risk factors associated with cesarean sections  some of those risk factors may be due to mis colonization when you carve a baby out of its mother rather than being delivered through the birth canal. And a variety of other studies have shown that the microbial community that lives in and on us helps in development of the immune system  helps in fighting off pathogens  helps in our metabolism  and determining our metabolic rate  probably determines our odor  and may even shape our behavior in a variety of ways. And so  these studies have documented or suggested out of a variety of important functions for the microbial community  this cloud  the non pathogens that live in and on us. And one area that I think is very interesting  which many of you may have now that we've thrown microbes into the crowd  is something that I would call  germophobia.  So people are really into cleanliness  right  We have antibiotics in our kitchen counters  people are washing every part of them all of the time  we pump antibiotics into our food  into our communities  we take antibiotics excessively. And killing pathogens is a good thing if you're sick  but we should understand that when we pump chemicals and antibiotics into our world  that we're also killing the cloud of microbes that live in and on us. And excessive use of antibiotics  in particular in children  has been shown to be associated with  again  risk factors for obesity  for autoimmune diseases  for a variety of problems that are probably due to disruption of the microbial community. So the microbial community can go wrong whether we want it to or not  or we can kill it with antibiotics  but what can we do to restore it  I'm sure many people here have heard about probiotics. Probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore the microbial community that is in and on you. And they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases. There's a project going on at UC Davis where people are using probiotics to try and treat  prevent  necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants. Premature infants have real problems with their microbial community. And it may be that probiotics can help prevent the development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis in these premature infants. But probiotics are sort of a very  very simple solution. Most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat have one or two species in them  maybe five species in them  and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species. So what can we do to restore our microbial community when we have thousands and thousands of species on us  Well  one thing that animals seem to do is  they eat poo    coprophagia. And it turns out that many veterinarians  old school veterinarians in particular  have been doing something called  poo tea   not booty  but poo tea  to treat colic and other ailments in horses and cows and things like that  where you make tea from the poo from a healthy individual animal and you feed it to a sick animal. Although  unless you have a fistulated cow with a big hole in its side  and you can put your hand into its rumen  it's hard to imagine that the delivery of microbes directly into the mouth and through the entire top of the digestive tract is the best delivery system  so you may have heard in people they are now doing fecal transplants  where rather than delivering a couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth  they are delivering a community of probiotics  a community of microbes from a healthy donor  through the other end. And this has turned out to be very effective in fighting certain intransigent infectious diseases like Clostridium difficile infections that can stay with people for years and years and years. Transplants of the feces  of the microbes from the feces  from a healthy donor has actually been shown to cure systemic C. dif infections in some people. Now what these transplants  these fecal transplants  or the poo tea suggest to me  and many other people have come up with this same idea  is that the microbial community in and on us  it's an organ. We should view it as a functioning organ  part of ourselves. We should treat it carefully and with respect  and we do not want to mess with it  say by C sections or by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness  without some real good justification. And what the DNA sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now is do detailed studies of  say      patients who have Crohn's disease and     people who don't have Crohn's disease. Or     people who took antibiotics when they were little  and     people who did not take antibiotics. And we can now start to compare the community of microbes and their genes and see if there are differences. And eventually we may be able to understand if they're not just correlative differences  but causative. Studies in model systems like mouse and other animals are also helping do this  but people are now using these technologies because they've gotten very cheap  to study the microbes in and on a variety of people. So  in wrapping up  what I want to tell you about is  I didn't tell you a part of the story of coming down with diabetes. It turns out that my father was an M.D.  actually studied hormones. I told him many times that I was tired  thirsty  not feeling very good. And he shrugged it off  I think he either thought I was just complaining a lot  or it was the typical M.D.  nothing can be wrong with my children.  We even went to the International Society of Endocrinology meeting as family in Quebec. And I was getting up every five minutes to pee  and drinking everybody's water at the table  and I think they all thought I was a druggie. But the reason I'm telling you this is that the medical community  my father as an example  sometimes doesn't see what's right in front of their eyes. The microbial cloud  it is right in front of us. We can't see it most of the time. It's invisible. They're microbes. They're tiny. But we can see them through their DNA  we can see them through the effects that they have on people. And what we need now is to start thinking about this microbial community in the context of everything in human medicine. It doesn't mean that it affects every part of us  but it might. What we need is a full field guide to the microbes that live in and on people  so that we can understand what they're doing to our lives. We are them. They are us. Thank you. So  how many of you have ever gotten behind the wheel of a car when you really shouldn't have been driving  Maybe you're out on the road for a long day  and you just wanted to get home. You were tired  but you felt you could drive a few more miles. Maybe you thought  I've had less to drink than everybody else  I should be the one to go home. Or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere. Does this sound familiar to you  Now  in those situations  wouldn't it be great if there was a button on your dashboard that you could push  and the car would get you home safely  Now  that's been the promise of the self driving car  the autonomous vehicle  and it's been the dream since at least       when General Motors showcased this idea at their Futurama booth at the World's Fair. Now  it's been one of those dreams that's always seemed about    years in the future. Now  two weeks ago  that dream took a step forward  when the state of Nevada granted Google's self driving car the very first license for an autonomous vehicle  clearly establishing that it's legal for them to test it on the roads in Nevada. Now  California's considering similar legislation  and this would make sure that the autonomous car is not one of those things that has to stay in Vegas. Now  in my lab at Stanford  we've been working on autonomous cars too  but with a slightly different spin on things. You see  we've been developing robotic race cars  cars that can actually push themselves to the very limits of physical performance. Now  why would we want to do such a thing  Well  there's two really good reasons for this. First  we believe that before people turn over control to an autonomous car  that autonomous car should be at least as good as the very best human drivers. Now  if you're like me  and the other    percent of the population who know that we are above average drivers  you understand that's a very high bar. There's another reason as well. Just like race car drivers can use all of the friction between the tire and the road  all of the car's capabilities to go as fast as possible  we want to use all of those capabilities to avoid any accident we can. Now  you may push the car to the limits not because you're driving too fast  but because you've hit an icy patch of road  conditions have changed. In those situations  we want a car that is capable enough to avoid any accident that can physically be avoided. I must confess  there's kind of a third motivation as well. You see  I have a passion for racing. In the past  I've been a race car owner  a crew chief and a driving coach  although maybe not at the level that you're currently expecting. One of the things that we've developed in the lab    we've developed several vehicles    is what we believe is the world's first autonomously drifting car. It's another one of those categories where maybe there's not a lot of competition. But this is P . It's an entirely student built electric vehicle  which through using its rear wheel drive and front wheel steer by wire can drift around corners. It can get sideways like a rally car driver  always able to take the tightest curve  even on slippery  changing surfaces  never spinning out. We've also worked with Volkswagen Oracle  on Shelley  an autonomous race car that has raced at     miles an hour through the Bonneville Salt Flats  gone around Thunderhill Raceway Park in the sun  the wind and the rain  and navigated the     turns and   .  miles of the Pikes Peak Hill Climb route in Colorado with nobody at the wheel. I guess it goes without saying that we've had a lot of fun doing this. But in fact  there's something else that we've developed in the process of developing these autonomous cars. We have developed a tremendous appreciation for the capabilities of human race car drivers. As we've looked at the question of how well do these cars perform  we wanted to compare them to our human counterparts. And we discovered their human counterparts are amazing. Now  we can take a map of a race track  we can take a mathematical model of a car  and with some iteration  we can actually find the fastest way around that track. We line that up with data that we record from a professional driver  and the resemblance is absolutely remarkable. Yes  there are subtle differences here  but the human race car driver is able to go out and drive an amazingly fast line  without the benefit of an algorithm that compares the trade off between going as fast as possible in this corner  and shaving a little bit of time off of the straight over here. Not only that  they're able to do it lap after lap after lap. They're able to go out and consistently do this  pushing the car to the limits every single time. It's extraordinary to watch. You put them in a new car  and after a few laps  they've found the fastest line in that car  and they're off to the races. It really makes you think  we'd love to know what's going on inside their brain. So as researchers  that's what we decided to find out. We decided to instrument not only the car  but also the race car driver  to try to get a glimpse into what was going on in their head as they were doing this. Now  this is Dr. Lene Harbott applying electrodes to the head of John Morton. John Morton is a former Can Am and IMSA driver  who's also a class champion at Le Mans. Fantastic driver  and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research. She's putting electrodes on his head so that we can monitor the electrical activity in John's brain as he races around the track. Now  clearly we're not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track. However  neuroscientists have identified certain patterns that let us tease out some very important aspects of this. For instance  the resting brain tends to generate a lot of alpha waves. In contrast  theta waves are associated with a lot of cognitive activity  like visual processing  things where the driver is thinking quite a bit. Now  we can measure this  and we can look at the relative power between the theta waves and the alpha waves. This gives us a measure of mental workload  how much the driver is actually challenged cognitively at any point along the track. Now  we wanted to see if we could actually record this on the track  so we headed down south to Laguna Seca. Laguna Seca is a legendary raceway about halfway between Salinas and Monterey. It has a curve there called the Corkscrew. Now  the Corkscrew is a chicane  followed by a quick right handed turn as the road drops three stories. Now  the strategy for driving this as explained to me was  you aim for the bush in the distance  and as the road falls away  you realize it was actually the top of a tree. All right  so thanks to the Revs Program at Stanford  we were able to take John there and put him behind the wheel of a      Porsche Abarth Carrera. Life is way too short for boring cars. So  here you see John on the track  he's going up the hill    Oh  Somebody liked that    and you can see  actually  his mental workload    measuring here in the red bar    you can see his actions as he approaches. Now watch  he has to downshift. And then he has to turn left. Look for the tree  and down. Not surprisingly  you can see this is a pretty challenging task. You can see his mental workload spike as he goes through this  as you would expect with something that requires this level of complexity. But what's really interesting is to look at areas of the track where his mental workload doesn't increase. I'm going to take you around now to the other side of the track. Turn three. And John's going to go into that corner and the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out. He's going to have to correct for that with steering. So watch as John does this here. Watch the mental workload  and watch the steering. The car begins to slide out  dramatic maneuver to correct it  and no change whatsoever in the mental workload. Not a challenging task. In fact  entirely reflexive. Now  our data processing on this is still preliminary  but it really seems that these phenomenal feats that the race car drivers are performing are instinctive. They are things that they have simply learned to do. It requires very little mental workload for them to perform these amazing feats. And their actions are fantastic. This is exactly what you want to do on the steering wheel to catch the car in this situation. Now  this has given us tremendous insight and inspiration for our own autonomous vehicles. We've started to ask the question  Can we make them a little less algorithmic and a little more intuitive  Can we take this reflexive action that we see from the very best race car drivers  introduce it to our cars  and maybe even into a system that could get onto your car in the future  That would take us a long step along the road to autonomous vehicles that drive as well as the best humans. But it's made us think a little bit more deeply as well. Do we want something more from our car than to simply be a chauffeur  Do we want our car to perhaps be a partner  a coach  someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential  Can  in fact  the technology not simply replace humans  but allow us to reach the level of reflex and intuition that we're all capable of  So  as we move forward into this technological future  I want you to just pause and think of that for a moment. What is the ideal balance of human and machine  And as we think about that  let's take inspiration from the absolutely amazing capabilities of the human body and the human mind. Thank you. I study the future of crime and terrorism  and frankly  I'm afraid. I'm afraid by what I see. I sincerely want to believe that technology can bring us the techno utopia that we've been promised  but  you see  I've spent a career in law enforcement  and that's informed my perspective on things. I've been a street police officer  an undercover investigator  a counter terrorism strategist  and I've worked in more than    countries around the world. I've had to see more than my fair share of violence and the darker underbelly of society  and that's informed my opinions. My work with criminals and terrorists has actually been highly educational. They have taught me a lot  and I'd like to be able to share some of these observations with you. Today I'm going to show you the flip side of all those technologies that we marvel at  the ones that we love. In the hands of the TED community  these are awesome tools which will bring about great change for our world  but in the hands of suicide bombers  the future can look quite different. I started observing technology and how criminals were using it as a young patrol officer. In those days  this was the height of technology. Laugh though you will  all the drug dealers and gang members with whom I dealt had one of these long before any police officer I knew did. Twenty years later  criminals are still using mobile phones  but they're also building their own mobile phone networks  like this one  which has been deployed in all    states of Mexico by the narcos. They have a national encrypted radio communications system. Think about that. Think about the innovation that went into that. Think about the infrastructure to build it. And then think about this  Why can't I get a cell phone signal in San Francisco   Laughter  How is this possible   Laughter  It makes no sense.  Applause  We consistently underestimate what criminals and terrorists can do. Technology has made our world increasingly open  and for the most part  that's great  but all of this openness may have unintended consequences. Consider the      terrorist attack on Mumbai. The men that carried that attack out were armed with AK   s  explosives and hand grenades. They threw these hand grenades at innocent people as they sat eating in cafes and waited to catch trains on their way home from work. But heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations. Guns and bombs are nothing new. What was different this time is the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies to locate additional victims and slaughter them. They were armed with mobile phones. They had BlackBerries. They had access to satellite imagery. They had satellite phones  and they even had night vision goggles. But perhaps their greatest innovation was this. We've all seen pictures like this on television and in the news. This is an operations center. And the terrorists built their very own op center across the border in Pakistan  where they monitored the BBC  al Jazeera  CNN and Indian local stations. They also monitored the Internet and social media to monitor the progress of their attacks and how many people they had killed. They did all of this in real time. The innovation of the terrorist operations center gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness and tactical advantage over the police and over the government. What did they do with this  They used it to great effect. At one point during the    hour siege  the terrorists were going room to room trying to find additional victims. They came upon a suite on the top floor of the hotel  and they kicked down the door and they found a man hiding by his bed. And they said to him   Who are you  and what are you doing here   And the man replied   I'm just an innocent schoolteacher.  Of course  the terrorists knew that no Indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the Taj. They picked up his identification  and they phoned his name in to the terrorist war room  where the terrorist war room Googled him  and found a picture and called their operatives on the ground and said   Your hostage  is he heavyset  Is he bald in front  Does he wear glasses    Yes  yes  yes   came the answers. The op center had found him and they had a match. He was not a schoolteacher. He was the second wealthiest businessman in India  and after discovering this information  the terrorist war room gave the order to the terrorists on the ground in Mumbai. We all worry about our privacy settings on Facebook  but the fact of the matter is  our openness can be used against us. Terrorists are doing this. A search engine can determine who shall live and who shall die. This is the world that we live in. During the Mumbai siege  terrorists were so dependent on technology that several witnesses reported that as the terrorists were shooting hostages with one hand  they were checking their mobile phone messages in the very other hand. In the end      people were gravely wounded and over     men  women and children lost their lives that day. Think about what happened. During this    hour siege on Mumbai     men armed not just with weapons  but with technology  were able to bring a city of    million people to a standstill. Ten people brought    million people to a standstill  and this traveled around the world. This is what radicals can do with openness. This was done nearly four years ago. What could terrorists do today with the technologies available that we have  What will they do tomorrow  The ability of one to affect many is scaling exponentially  and it's scaling for good and it's scaling for evil. It's not just about terrorism  though. There's also been a big paradigm shift in crime. You see  you can now commit more crime as well. In the old days  it was a knife and a gun. Then criminals moved to robbing trains. You could rob     people on a train  a great innovation. Moving forward  the Internet allowed things to scale even more. In fact  many of you will remember the recent Sony PlayStation hack. In that incident  over     million people were robbed. Think about that. When in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob     million  Of course  it's not just about stealing things. There are other avenues of technology that criminals can exploit. Many of you will remember this super cute video from the last TED  but not all quadcopter swarms are so nice and cute. They don't all have drumsticks. Some can be armed with HD cameras and do countersurveillance on protesters  or  as in this little bit of movie magic  quadcopters can be loaded with firearms and automatic weapons. Little robots are cute when they play music to you. When they swarm and chase you down the block to shoot you  a little bit less so. Of course  criminals and terrorists weren't the first to give guns to robots. We know where that started. But they're adapting quickly. Recently  the FBI arrested an al Qaeda affiliate in the United States  who was planning on using these remote controlled drone aircraft to fly C  explosives into government buildings in the United States. By the way  these travel at over     miles an hour. Every time a new technology is being introduced  criminals are there to exploit it. We've all seen  D printers. We know with them that you can print in many materials ranging from plastic to chocolate to metal and even concrete. With great precision I actually was able to make this just the other day  a very cute little ducky. But I wonder to myself  for those people that strap bombs to their chests and blow themselves up  how might they use  D printers  Perhaps like this. You see  if you can print in metal  you can print one of these  and in fact you can also print one of these too. The UK I know has some very strict firearms laws. You needn't bring the gun into the UK anymore. You just bring the  D printer and print the gun while you're here  and  of course  the magazines for your bullets. But as these get bigger in the future  what other items will you be able to print  The technologies are allowing bigger printers. As we move forward  we'll see new technologies also  like the Internet of Things. Every day we're connecting more and more of our lives to the Internet  which means that the Internet of Things will soon be the Internet of Things To Be Hacked. All of the physical objects in our space are being transformed into information technologies  and that has a radical implication for our security  because more connections to more devices means more vulnerabilities. Criminals understand this. Terrorists understand this. Hackers understand this. If you control the code  you control the world. This is the future that awaits us. There has not yet been an operating system or a technology that hasn't been hacked. That's troubling  since the human body itself is now becoming an information technology. As we've seen here  we're transforming ourselves into cyborgs. Every year  thousands of cochlear implants  diabetic pumps  pacemakers and defibrillators are being implanted in people. In the United States  there are        people who have a pacemaker that connects to the Internet. The defibrillators allow a physician at a distance to give a shock to a heart in case a patient needs it. But if you don't need it  and somebody else gives you the shock  it's not a good thing. Of course  we're going to go even deeper than the human body. We're going down to the cellular level these days. Up until this point  all the technologies I've been talking about have been silicon based  ones and zeroes  but there's another operating system out there  the original operating system  DNA. And to hackers  DNA is just another operating system waiting to be hacked. It's a great challenge for them. There are people already working on hacking the software of life  and while most of them are doing this to great good and to help us all  some won't be. So how will criminals abuse this  Well  with synthetic biology you can do some pretty neat things. For example  I predict that we will move away from a plant based narcotics world to a synthetic one. Why do you need the plants anymore  You can just take the DNA code from marijuana or poppies or coca leaves and cut and past that gene and put it into yeast  and you can take those yeast and make them make the cocaine for you  or the marijuana  or any other drug. So how we use yeast in the future is going to be really interesting. In fact  we may have some really interesting bread and beer as we go into this next century. The cost of sequencing the human genome is dropping precipitously. It was proceeding at Moore's Law pace  but then in       something changed. The technologies got better  and now DNA sequencing is proceeding at a pace five times that of Moore's Law. That has significant implications for us. It took us    years to get from the introduction of the personal computer to the level of cybercrime we have today  but looking at how biology is proceeding so rapidly  and knowing criminals and terrorists as I do  we may get there a lot faster with biocrime in the future. It will be easy for anybody to go ahead and print their own bio virus  enhanced versions of ebola or anthrax  weaponized flu. We recently saw a case where some researchers made the H N  avian influenza virus more potent. It already has a    percent mortality rate if you get it  but it's hard to get. Engineers  by moving around a small number of genetic changes  were able to weaponize it and make it much more easy for human beings to catch  so that not thousands of people would die  but tens of millions. You see  you can go ahead and create new pandemics  and the researchers who did this were so proud of their accomplishments  they wanted to publish it openly so that everybody could see this and get access to this information. But it goes deeper than that. DNA researcher Andrew Hessel has pointed out quite rightly that if you can use cancer treatments  modern cancer treatments  to go after one cell while leaving all the other cells around it intact  then you can also go after any one person's cell. Personalized cancer treatments are the flip side of personalized bioweapons  which means you can attack any one individual  including all the people in this picture. How will we protect them in the future  What to do  What to do about all this  That's what I get asked all the time. For those of you who follow me on Twitter  I will be tweeting out the answer later on today.  Laughter  Actually  it's a bit more complex than that  and there are no magic bullets. I don't have all the answers  but I know a few things. In the wake of       the best security minds put together all their innovation and this is what they created for security. If you're expecting the people who built this to protect you from the coming robopocalypse    Laughter    uh  you may want to have a backup plan.  Laughter  Just saying. Just think about that.  Applause  Law enforcement is currently a closed system. It's nation based  while the threat is international. Policing doesn't scale globally. At least  it hasn't  and our current system of guns  border guards  big gates and fences are outdated in the new world into which we're moving. So how might we prepare for some of these specific threats  like attacking a president or a prime minister  This would be the natural government response  to hide away all our government leaders in hermetically sealed bubbles. But this is not going to work. The cost of doing a DNA sequence is going to be trivial. Anybody will have it and we will all have them in the future. So maybe there's a more radical way that we can look at this. What happens if we were to take the President's DNA  or a king or queen's  and put it out to a group of a few hundred trusted researchers so they could study that DNA and do penetration testing against it as a means of helping our leaders  Or what if we sent it out to a few thousand  Or  controversially  and not without its risks  what happens if we just gave it to the whole public  Then we could all be engaged in helping. We've already seen examples of this working well. The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project is staffed by journalists and citizens where they are crowd sourcing what dictators and terrorists are doing with public funds around the world  and  in a more dramatic case  we've seen in Mexico  a country that has been racked by        narcotics related murders in the past six years. They're killing so many people they can't even afford to bury them all in anything but these unmarked graves like this one outside of Ciudad Juarez. What can we do about this  The government has proven ineffective. So in Mexico  citizens  at great risk to themselves  are fighting back to build an effective solution. They're crowd mapping the activities of the drug dealers. Whether or not you realize it  we are at the dawn of a technological arms race  an arms race between people who are using technology for good and those who are using it for ill. The threat is serious  and the time to prepare for it is now. I can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are. My personal belief is that  rather than having a small  elite force of highly trained government agents here to protect us all  we're much better off having average and ordinary citizens approaching this problem as a group and seeing what we can do. If we all do our part  I think we'll be in a much better space. The tools to change the world are in everybody's hands. How we use them is not just up to me  it's up to all of us. This was a technology I would frequently deploy as a police officer. This technology has become outdated in our current world. It doesn't scale  it doesn't work globally  and it surely doesn't work virtually. We've seen paradigm shifts in crime and terrorism. They call for a shift to a more open form and a more participatory form of law enforcement. So I invite you to join me. After all  public safety is too important to leave to the professionals. Thank you.  Applause  My passions are music  technology and making things. And it's the combination of these things that has led me to the hobby of sound visualization  and  on occasion  has led me to play with fire. This is a Rubens' tube. It's one of many I've made over the years  and I have one here tonight. It's about an   foot long tube of metal  it's got a hundred or so holes on top  on that side is the speaker  and here is some lab tubing  and it's connected to this tank of propane. So  let's fire it up and see what it does. So let's play a     herz frequency and watch what happens. Thank you.  Applause  It's okay to applaud the laws of physics  but essentially what's happening here     Laughter     is the energy from the sound via the air and gas molecules is influencing the combustion properties of propane  creating a visible waveform  and we can see the alternating regions of compression and rarefaction that we call frequency  and the height is showing us amplitude. So let's change the frequency of the sound  and watch what happens to the fire. So every time we hit a resonant frequency we get a standing wave and that emergent sine curve of fire. So let's turn that off. We're indoors. Thank you.  Applause  I also have with me a flame table. It's very similar to a Rubens' tube  and it's also used for visualizing the physical properties of sound  such as eigenmodes  so let's fire it up and see what it does. Ooh.  Laughter  Okay. Now  while the table comes up to pressure  let me note here that the sound is not traveling in perfect lines. It's actually traveling in all directions  and the Rubens' tube's a little like bisecting those waves with a line  and the flame table's a little like bisecting those waves with a plane  and it can show a little more subtle complexity  which is why I like to use it to watch Geoff Farina play guitar. All right  so it's a delicate dance. If you watch closely    Applause  If you watch closely  you may have seen some of the eigenmodes  but also you may have seen that jazz music is better with fire. Actually  a lot of things are better with fire in my world  but the fire's just a foundation. It shows very well that eyes can hear  and this is interesting to me because technology allows us to present sound to the eyes in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes for seeing sound  such as the removal of time. So here  I'm using a rendering algorithm to paint the frequencies of the song  Smells Like Teen Spirit  in a way that the eyes can take them in as a single visual impression  and the technique will also show the strengths of the visual cortex for pattern recognition. So if I show you another song off this album  and another  your eyes will easily pick out the use of repetition by the band Nirvana  and in the frequency distribution  the colors  you can see the clean dirty clean sound that they are famous for  and here is the entire album as a single visual impression  and I think this impression is pretty powerful. At least  it's powerful enough that if I show you these four songs  and I remind you that this is  Smells Like Teen Spirit   you can probably correctly guess  without listening to any music at all  that the song a die hard Nirvana fan would enjoy is this song   I'll Stick Around  by the Foo Fighters  whose lead singer is Dave Grohl  who was the drummer in Nirvana. The songs are a little similar  but mostly I'm just interested in the idea that someday maybe we'll buy a song because we like the way it looks. All right  now for some more sound data. This is data from a skate park  and this is Mabel Davis skate park in Austin  Texas.  Skateboard sounds  And the sounds you're hearing came from eight microphones attached to obstacles around the park  and it sounds like chaos  but actually all the tricks start with a very distinct slap  but successful tricks end with a pop  whereas unsuccessful tricks more of a scratch and a tumble  and tricks on the rail will ring out like a gong  and voices occupy very unique frequencies in the skate park. So if we were to render these sounds visually  we might end up with something like this. This is all    minutes of the recording  and right away the algorithm tells us a lot more tricks are missed than are made  and also a trick on the rails is a lot more likely to produce a cheer  and if you look really closely  we can tease out traffic patterns. You see the skaters often trick in this direction. The obstacles are easier. And in the middle of the recording  the mics pick this up  but later in the recording  this kid shows up  and he starts using a line at the top of the park to do some very advanced tricks on something called the tall rail. And it's fascinating. At this moment in time  all the rest of the skaters turn their lines    degrees to stay out of his way. You see  there's a subtle etiquette in the skate park  and it's led by key influencers  and they tend to be the kids who can do the best tricks  or wear red pants  and on this day the mics picked that up. All right  from skate physics to theoretical physics. I'm a big fan of Stephen Hawking  and I wanted to use all eight hours of his Cambridge lecture series to create an homage. Now  in this series he's speaking with the aid of a computer  which actually makes identifying the ends of sentences fairly easy. So I wrote a steering algorithm. It listens to the lecture  and then it uses the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x axis  and it uses the inflection of sentences to move a same point up and down on the y axis. And these trend lines  you can see  there's more questions than answers in the laws of physics  and when we reach the end of a sentence  we place a star at that location. So there's a lot of sentences  so a lot of stars  and after rendering all of the audio  this is what we get. This is Stephen Hawking's universe. It's all eight hours of the Cambridge lecture series taken in as a single visual impression  and I really like this image  but a lot of people think it's fake. So I made a more interactive version  and the way I did that is I used their position in time in the lecture to place these stars into  D space  and with some custom software and a Kinect  I can walk right into the lecture. I'm going to wave through the Kinect here and take control  and now I'm going to reach out and I'm going to touch a star  and when I do  it will play the sentence that generated that star. Stephen Hawking  There is one  and only one  arrangement in which the pieces make a complete picture. Jared Ficklin  Thank you.  Applause  There are       stars. It's a really fun way to explore the lecture  and  I hope  a fitting homage. All right. Let me close with a work in progress. I think  after    years  the opportunity exists to create an enhanced version of closed captioning. Now  we've all seen a lot of TEDTalks online  so let's watch one now with the sound turned off and the closed captioning turned on. There's no closed captioning for the TED theme song  and we're missing it  but if you've watched enough of these  you hear it in your mind's ear  and then applause starts. It usually begins here  and it grows and then it falls. Sometimes you get a little star applause  and then I think even Bill Gates takes a nervous breath  and the talk begins. All right  so let's watch this clip again. This time  I'm not going to talk at all. There's still going to be no audio  but what I am going to do is I'm going to render the sound visually in real time at the bottom of the screen. So watch closely and see what your eyes can hear. This is fairly amazing to me. Even on the first view  your eyes will successfully pick out patterns  but on repeated views  your brain actually gets better at turning these patterns into information. You can get the tone and the timbre and the pace of the speech  things that you can't get out of closed captioning. That famous scene in horror movies where someone is walking up from behind is something you can see  and I believe this information would be something that is useful at times when the audio is turned off or not heard at all  and I speculate that deaf audiences might actually even be better at seeing sound than hearing audiences. I don't know. It's a theory right now. Actually  it's all just an idea. And let me end by saying that sound moves in all directions  and so do ideas. Thank you.  Applause  Something happened in the early morning hours of May  nd        that had a profound effect on the way our society operates. Ironically  hardly anyone noticed at the time. The change was silent  imperceptible  unless you knew exactly what to look for. On that morning  U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered that a special switch be thrown in the orbiting satellites of the Global Positioning System. Instantaneously  every civilian GPS receiver around the globe went from errors the size of a football field to errors the size of a small room. It's hard to overstate the effect that this change in accuracy has had on us. Before this switch was thrown  we didn't have in car navigation systems giving turn by turn directions  because back then  GPS couldn't tell you what block you were on  let alone what street. For geolocation  accuracy matters  and things have only improved over the last    years. With more base stations  more ground stations  better receivers and better algorithms  GPS can now not only tell you what street you are on  but what part of the street. This level of accuracy has unleashed a firestorm of innovation. In fact  many of you navigated here today with the help of your TomTom or your smartphone. Paper maps are becoming obsolete. But we now stand on the verge of another revolution in geolocation accuracy. What if I told you that the two meter positioning that our current cell phones and our TomToms give us is pathetic compared to what we could be getting  For some time now  it's been known that if you pay attention to the carrier phase of the GPS signal  and if you have an Internet connection  then you can go from meter level to centimeter level  even millimeter level positioning. So why don't we have this capability on our phones  Only  I believe  for a lack of imagination. Manufacturers haven't built this carrier phase technique into their cheap GPS chips because they're not sure what the general public would do with geolocation so accurate that you could pinpoint the wrinkles in the palm of your hand. But you and I and other innovators  we can see the potential in this next leap in accuracy. Imagine  for example  an augmented reality app that overlays a virtual world to millimeter level precision on top of the physical world. I could build for you a structure up here in  D  millimeter accurate  that only you could see  or my friends at home. So this level of positioning  this is what we're looking for  and I believe that  within the next few years  I predict  that this kind of hyper precise  carrier phase based positioning will become cheap and ubiquitous  and the consequences will be fantastic. The Holy Grail  of course  is the GPS dot. Do you remember the movie  The Da Vinci Code   Here's Professor Langdon examining a GPS dot  which his accomplice tells him is a tracking device accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe  but we know that in the world of nonfiction  the GPS dot is impossible  right  For one thing  GPS doesn't work indoors  and for another  they don't make devices quite this small  especially when those devices have to relay their measurements back over a network. Well  these objections were perfectly reasonable a few years ago  but things have changed. There's been a strong trend toward miniaturization  better sensitivity  so much so that  a few years ago  a GPS tracking device looked like this clunky box to the left of the keys. Compare that with the device released just months ago that's now packaged into something the size of a key fob  and if you take a look at the state of the art for a complete GPS receiver  which is only a centimeter on a side and more sensitive than ever  you realize that the GPS dot will soon move from fiction to nonfiction. Imagine what we could do with a world full of GPS dots. It's not just that you'll never lose your wallet or your keys anymore  or your child when you're at Disneyland. You'll buy GPS dots in bulk  and you'll stick them on everything you own worth more than a few tens of dollars. I couldn't find my shoes one recent morning  and  as usual  had to ask my wife if she had seen them. But I shouldn't have to bother my wife with that kind of triviality. I should be able to ask my house where my shoes are. Those of you who have made the switch to Gmail  remember how refreshing it was to go from organizing all of your email to simply searching it. The GPS dot will do the same for our possessions. Now  of course  there is a flip side to the GPS dot. I was in my office some months back and got a telephone call. The woman on the other end of the line  we'll call her Carol  was panicked. Apparently  an ex boyfriend of Carol's from California had found her in Texas and was following her around. So you might ask at this point why she's calling you. Well  so did I. But it turned out there was a technical twist to Carol's case. Every time her ex boyfriend would show up  at the most improbable times and the most improbable locations  he was carrying an open laptop  and over time Carol realized that he had planted a GPS tracking device on her car  so she was calling me for help to disable it.  Well  you should go to a good mechanic and have him look at your car   I said.  I already have   she told me.  He didn't see anything obvious  and he said he'd have to take the car apart piece by piece.   Well then  you'd better go to the police   I said.  I already have   she replied.  They're not sure this rises to the level of harassment  and they're not set up technically to find the device.   Okay  what about the FBI    I've talked to them too  and same story.  We then talked about her coming to my lab and us performing a radio sweep of her car  but I wasn't even sure that would work  given that some of these devices are configured to only transmit when they're inside safe zones or when the car is moving. So  there we were. Carol isn't the first  and certainly won't be the last  to find herself in this kind of fearsome environment  worrisome situation caused by GPS tracking. In fact  as I looked into her case  I discovered to my surprise that it's not clearly illegal for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else's car. The Supreme Court ruled last month that a policeman has to get a warrant if he wants to do prolonged tracking  but the law isn't clear about civilians doing this to one another  so it's not just Big Brother we have to worry about  but Big Neighbor.  Laughter  There is one alternative that Carol could have taken  very effective. It's called the Wave Bubble. It's an open source GPS jammer  developed by Limor Fried  a graduate student at MIT  and Limor calls it  a tool for reclaiming our personal space.  With a flip of the switch you create a bubble around you within which GPS signals can't reside. They get drowned out by the bubble. And Limor designed this  in part  because  like Carol  she felt threatened by GPS tracking. Then she posted her design to the web  and if you don't have time to build your own  you can buy one. Chinese manufacturers now sell thousands of nearly identical devices on the Internet. So you might be thinking  the Wave Bubble sounds great. I should have one. Might come in handy if somebody ever puts a tracking device on my car. But you should be aware that its use is very much illegal in the United States. And why is that  Well  because it's not a bubble at all. Its jamming signals don't stop at the edge of your personal space or at the edge of your car. They go on to jam innocent GPS receivers for miles around you.  Laughter  Now  if you're Carol or Limor  or someone who feels threatened by GPS tracking  it might not feel wrong to turn on a Wave Bubble  but in fact  the results can be disastrous. Imagine  for example  you're the captain of a cruise ship trying to make your way through a thick fog and some passenger in the back turns on a Wave Bubble. All of a sudden your GPS readout goes blank  and now it's just you and the fog and whatever you can pull off the radar system if you remember how to work it. They    in fact  they don't update or upkeep lighthouses anymore  and LORAN  the only backup to GPS  was discontinued last year. Our modern society has a special relationship with GPS. We're almost blindly reliant on it. It's built deeply into our systems and infrastructure. Some call it  the invisible utility.  So  turning on a Wave Bubble might not just cause inconvenience. It might be deadly. But as it turns out  for purposes of protecting your privacy at the expense of general GPS reliability  there's something even more potent and more subversive than a Wave Bubble  and that is a GPS spoofer. The idea behind the GPS spoofer is simple. Instead of jamming the GPS signals  you fake them. You imitate them  and if you do it right  the device you're attacking doesn't even know it's being spoofed. So let me show you how this works. In any GPS receiver  there's a peak inside that corresponds to the authentic signals. These three red dots represent the tracking points that try to keep themselves centered on that peak. But if you send in a fake GPS signal  another peak pops up  and if you can get these two peaks perfectly aligned  the tracking points can't tell the difference  and they get hijacked by the stronger counterfeit signal  with the authentic peak getting forced off. At this point  the game is over. The fake signals now completely control this GPS receiver. So is this really possible  Can someone really manipulate the timing and positioning of a GPS receiver just like that  with a spoofer  Well  the short answer is yes. The key is that civil GPS signals are completely open. They have no encryption. They have no authentication. They're wide open  vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack. Even so  up until very recently  nobody worried about GPS spoofers. People figured that it would be too complex or too expensive for some hacker to build one. But I  and a friend of mine from graduate school  we didn't see it that way. We knew it wasn't going to be so hard  and we wanted to be the first to build one so we could get out in front of the problem and help protect against GPS spoofing. I remember vividly the week it all came together. We built it at my home  which means that I got a little extra help from my three year old son Ramon. Here's Ramon    Laughter    looking for a little attention from Dad that week. At first  the spoofer was just a jumble of cables and computers  though we eventually got it packaged into a small box. Now  the Dr. Frankenstein moment  when the spoofer finally came alive and I glimpsed its awful potential  came late one night when I tested the spoofer against my iPhone. Let me show you some actual footage from that very first experiment. I had come to completely trust this little blue dot and its reassuring blue halo. They seemed to speak to me. They'd say   Here you are. Here you are.   Laughter  And  you can trust us.  So something felt very wrong about the world. It was a sense  almost  of betrayal  when this little blue dot started at my house  and went running off toward the north leaving me behind. I wasn't moving. What I then saw in this little moving blue dot was the potential for chaos. I saw airplanes and ships veering off course  with the captain learning only too late that something was wrong. I saw the GPS derived timing of the New York Stock Exchange being manipulated by hackers. You can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc you could cause if you knew what you were doing with a GPS spoofer. There is  though  one redeeming feature of the GPS spoofer. It's the ultimate weapon against an invasion of GPS dots. Imagine  for example  you're being tracked. Well  you can play the tracker for a fool  pretending to be at work when you're really on vacation. Or  if you're Carol  you could lure your ex boyfriend into some empty parking lot where the police are waiting for him. So I'm fascinated by this conflict  a looming conflict  between privacy on the one hand and the need for a clean radio spectrum on the other. We simply cannot tolerate GPS jammers and spoofers  and yet  given the lack of effective legal means for protecting our privacy from the GPS dot  can you really blame people for wanting to turn them on  for wanting to use them  I hold out hope that we'll be able to reconcile this conflict with some sort of  some yet uninvented technology. But meanwhile  grab some popcorn  because things are going to get interesting. Within the next few years  many of you will be the proud owner of a GPS dot. Maybe you'll have a whole bag full of them. You'll never lose track of your things again. The GPS dot will fundamentally reorder your life. But will you be able to resist the temptation to track your fellow man  Or will you be able to resist the temptation to turn on a GPS spoofer or a Wave Bubble to protect your own privacy  So  as usual  what we see just beyond the horizon is full of promise and peril. It'll be fascinating to see how this all turns out. Thanks.  Applause  I love to collect things. Ever since I was a kid  I've had massive collections of random stuff  everything from bizarre hot sauces from all around the world to insects that I've captured and put in jars. Now  it's no secret  because I like collecting things  that I love the Natural History Museum and the collections of animals at the Natural History Museum in dioramas. These  to me  are like living sculptures  right  that you can go and look at  and they memorialize a specific point of time in this animal's life. So I was thinking about my own life  and how I'd like to memorialize my life  you know  for the ages  and also    Laughter    the lives of my friends  but the problem with this is that my friends aren't quite keen on the idea of me taxidermy ing them.  Laughter  So instead  I turned to video  and video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize someone and to capture a specific moment in time. So what I did was  I filmed six of my friends and then  using video mapping and video projection  I created a video sculpture  which was these six friends projected into jars.  Laughter  So now I have this collection of my friends I can take around with me whenever I go  and this is called Animalia Chordata  from the Latin nomenclature for human being  classification system. So this piece memorializes my friends in these jars  and they actually move around.  Laughter  So  this is interesting to me  but it lacked a certain human element.  Laughter  It's a digital sculpture  so I wanted to add an interaction system. So what I did was  I added a proximity sensor  so that when you get close to the people in jars  they react to you in different ways. You know  just like people on the street when you get too close to them. Some people reacted in terror.  Laughter  Others reacted in asking you for help  and some people hide from you. So this was really interesting to me  this idea of taking video off the screen and putting it in real life  and also adding interactivity to sculpture. So over the next year  I documented    of my other friends and trapped them in jars as well and created a piece known as Garden  which is literally a garden of humanity. But something about the first piece  the Animali Chordata piece  kept coming back to me  this idea of interaction with art  and I really liked the idea of people being able to interact  and also being challenged by interacting with art. So I wanted to create a new piece that actually forced people to come and interact with something  and the way I did this was actually by projecting a     s housewife into a blender.  Laughter  This is a piece called Blend  and what it does is it actually makes you implicit in the work of art. You may never experience the entire thing yourself. You can walk away  you can just watch as this character stands there in the blender and looks at you  or you can actually choose to interact with it. So if you do choose to interact with the piece  and you press the blender button  it actually sends this character into this dizzying disarray of dishevelment. By doing that  you are now part of my piece. You  like the people that are trapped in my work    Blender noises  laughter    have become part of my work as well.  Laughter  But  but this seems a bit unfair  right  I put my friends in jars  I put this character  this sort of endangered species character in a blender. But I'd never done anything about myself. I'd never really memorialized myself. So I decided to create a piece which is a self portrait piece. This is sort of a self portrait taxidermy time capsule piece called A Point Just Passed  in which I project myself on top of a time card punch clock  and it's up to you. If you want to choose to punch that punch card clock  you actually age me. So I start as a baby  and then if you punch the clock  you'll actually transform the baby into a toddler  and then from a toddler I'm transformed into a teenager. From a teenager  I'm transformed into my current self. From my current self  I'm turned into a middle aged man  and then  from there  into an elderly man. And if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times in one day  the piece goes black and is not to be reset until the next day. So  in doing so  you're erasing time. You're actually implicit in this work and you're erasing my life. So I like this about interactive video sculpture  that you can actually interact with it  that all of you can actually touch an artwork and be part of the artwork yourselves  and hopefully  one day  I'll have each and every one of you trapped in one of my jars.  Laughter  Thank you.  Applause  Now  I don't usually like cartoons  I don't think many of them are funny  I find them weird. But I love this cartoon from the New Yorker. So  the guy is telling the cat  don't you dare think outside the box. Well  I'm afraid I used to be the cat. I always wanted to be outside the box. And it's partly because I came to this field from a different background  chemist and a bacterial geneticist. So  what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer  sources of cancer  or  for that matter  why you are who you are  didn't make sense. So  let me quickly try and tell you why I thought that and how I went about it. So  to begin with  however  I have to give you a very  very quick lesson in developmental biology  with apologies to those of you who know some biology. So  when your mom and dad met  there is a fertilized egg  that round thing with that little blip. It grows and then it grows  and then it makes this handsome man. So  this guy  with all the cells in his body  all have the same genetic information. So how did his nose become his nose  his elbow his elbow  and why doesn't he get up one morning and have his nose turn into his foot  It could. It has the genetic information. You all remember  dolly  it came from a single mammary cell. So  why doesn't it do it  So  have a guess of how many cells he has in his body. Somewhere between    trillion to    trillion cells in his body. Trillion  Now  how did these cells  all with the same genetic material  make all those tissues  And so  the question I raised before becomes even more interesting if you thought about the enormity of this in every one of your bodies. Now  the dominant cancer theory would say that there is a single oncogene in a single cancer cell  and it would make you a cancer victim. Well  this did not make sense to me. Do you even know how a trillion looks  Now  let's look at it. There it comes  these zeroes after zeroes after zeroes. Now  if .     of these cells got mutated  and .      got cancer  you will be a lump of cancer. You will have cancer all over you. And you're not. Why not  So  I decided over the years  because of a series of experiments that this is because of context and architecture. And let me quickly tell you some crucial experiment that was able to actually show this. To begin with  I came to work with this virus that causes that ugly tumor in the chicken. Rous discovered this in     . It was the first cancer virus discovered  and when I call it  oncogene   meaning  cancer gene.  So  he made a filtrate  he took this filter which was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter  and he injected it to another chicken  and he got another tumor. So  scientists were very excited  and they said  a single oncogene can do it. All you need is a single oncogene. So  they put the cells in cultures  chicken cells  dumped the virus on it  and it would pile up  and they would say  this is malignant and this is normal. And again this didn't make sense to me. So for various reasons  we took this oncogene  attached it to a blue marker  and we injected it into the embryos. Now look at that. There is that beautiful feather in the embryo. Every one of those blue cells are a cancer gene inside a cancer cell  and they're part of the feather. So  when we dissociated the feather and put it in a dish  we got a mass of blue cells. So  in the chicken you get a tumor  in the embryo you don't  you dissociate  you put it in a dish  you get another tumor. What does that mean  That means that microenvironment and the context which surrounds those cells actually are telling the cancer gene and the cancer cell what to do. Now  let's take a normal example. The normal example  let's take the human mammary gland. I work on breast cancer. So  here is a lovely human breast. And many of you know how it looks  except that inside that breast  there are all these pretty  developing  tree like structures. So  we decided that what we like to do is take just a bit of that mammary gland  which is called an  acinus   where there are all these little things inside the breast where the milk goes  and the end of the nipple comes through that little tube when the baby sucks. And we said  wonderful  Look at this pretty structure. We want to make this a structure  and ask the question  how do the cells do that  So  we took the red cells    you see the red cells are surrounded by blue  other cells that squeeze them  and behind it is material that people thought was mainly inert  and it was just having a structure to keep the shape  and so we first photographed it with the electron microscope years and years ago  and you see this cell is actually quite pretty. It has a bottom  it has a top  it is secreting gobs and gobs of milk  because it just came from an early pregnant mouse. You take these cells  you put them in a dish  and within three days  they look like that. They completely forget. So you take them out  you put them in a dish  they don't make milk. They completely forget. For example  here is a lovely yellow droplet of milk on the left  there is nothing on the right. Look at the nuclei. The nuclei in the cell on the left is in the animal  the one on the right is in a dish. They are completely different from each other. So  what does this tell you  This tells you that here also  context overrides. In different contexts  cells do different things. But how does context signal  So  Einstein said that  For an idea that does not first seem insane  there is no hope.  So  you can imagine the amount of skepticism I received    couldn't get money  couldn't do a whole lot of other things  but I'm so glad it all worked out. So  we made a section of the mammary gland of the mouse  and all those lovely acini are there  every one of those with the red around them are an acinus  and we said okay  we are going to try and make this  and I said  maybe that red stuff around the acinus that people think there's just a structural scaffold  maybe it has information  maybe it tells the cells what to do  maybe it tells the nucleus what to do. So I said  extracellular matrix  which is this stuff called ECM  signals and actually tells the cells what to do. So  we decided to make things that would look like that. We found some gooey material that had the right extracellular matrix in it  we put the cells in it  and lo and behold  in about four days  they got reorganized and on the right  is what we can make in culture. On the left is what's inside the animal  we call it in vivo  and the one in culture was full of milk  the lovely red there is full of milk. So  we Got Milk  for the American audience. All right. And here is this beautiful human cell  and you can imagine that here also  context goes. So  what do we do now  I made a radical hypothesis. I said  if it's true that architecture is dominant  architecture restored to a cancer cell should make the cancer cell think it's normal. Could this be done  So  we tried it. In order to do that  however  we needed to have a method of distinguishing normal from malignant  and on the left is the single normal cell  human breast  put in three dimensional gooey gel that has extracellular matrix  it makes all these beautiful structures. On the right  you see it looks very ugly  the cells continue to grow  the normal ones stop. And you see here in higher magnification the normal acinus and the ugly tumor. So we said  what is on the surface of these ugly tumors  Could we calm them down    they were signaling like crazy and they have pathways all messed up    and make them to the level of the normal  Well  it was wonderful. Boggles my mind. This is what we got. We can revert the malignant phenotype. And in order to show you that the malignant phenotype I didn't just choose one  here are little movies  sort of fuzzy  but you see that on the left are the malignant cells  all of them are malignant  we add one single inhibitor in the beginning  and look what happens  they all look like that. We inject them into the mouse  the ones on the right  and none of them would make tumors. We inject the other ones in the mouse      percent tumors. So  it's a new way of thinking about cancer  it's a hopeful way of thinking about cancer. We should be able to be dealing with these things at this level  and these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior is regulated at the level of tissue organization and that the tissue organization is dependent on the extracellular matrix and the microenvironment. All right  thus form and function interact dynamically and reciprocally. And here is another five seconds of repose  is my mantra. Form and function. And of course  we now ask  where do we go now  We'd like to take this kind of thinking into the clinic. But before we do that  I'd like you to think that at any given time when you're sitting there  in your    trillion cells  the extracellular matrix signaling to your nucleus  the nucleus is signaling to your extracellular matrix and this is how your balance is kept and restored. We have made a lot of discoveries  we have shown that extracellular matrix talks to chromatin. We have shown that there's little pieces of DNA on the specific genes of the mammary gland that actually respond to extracellular matrix. It has taken many years  but it has been very rewarding. And before I get to the next slide  I have to tell you that there are so many additional discoveries to be made. There is so much mystery we don't know. And I always say to the students and post docs I lecture to  don't be arrogant  because arrogance kills curiosity. Curiosity and passion. You need to always think  what else needs to be discovered  And maybe my discovery needs to be added to or maybe it needs to be changed. So  we have now made an amazing discovery  a post doc in the lab who is a physicist asked me  what do the cells do when you put them in  What do they do in the beginning when they do  I said  I don't know  we couldn't look at them. We didn't have high images in the old days. So she  being an imager and a physicist  did this incredible thing. This is a single human breast cell in three dimensions. Look at it. It's constantly doing this. Has a coherent movement. You put the cancer cells there  and they do go all over  they do this. They don't do this. And when we revert the cancer cell  it again does this. Absolutely boggles my mind. So the cell acts like an embryo. What an exciting thing. So I'd like to finish with a poem. Well I used to love English literature  and I debated in college  which one should I do  And unfortunately or fortunately  chemistry won. But here is a poem from Yeats. I'll just read you the last two lines. It's called  Among the School Children.   O body swayed to music   O brightening glance   How  can we know  the dancer from the dance   And here is Merce Cunningham  I was fortunate to dance with him when I was younger  and here he is a dancer  and while he is dancing  he is both the dancer and the dance. The minute he stops  we have neither. So it's like form and function. Now  I'd like to show you a current picture of my group. I have been fortunate to have had these magnificant students and post docs who have taught me so much  and I have had many of these groups come and go. They are the future and I try to make them not be afraid of being the cat and being told  don't think outside the box. And I'd like to leave you with this thought. On the left is water coming through the shore  taken from a NASA satellite. On the right  there is a coral. Now if you take the mammary gland and spread it and take the fat away  on a dish it looks like that. Do they look the same  Do they have the same patterns  Why is it that nature keeps doing that over and over again  And I'd like to submit to you that we have sequenced the human genome  we know everything about the sequence of the gene  the language of the gene  the alphabet of the gene  But we know nothing  but nothing  about the language and alphabet of form. So  it's a wonderful new horizon  it's a wonderful thing to discover for the young and the passionate old  and that's me. So go to it  So let me start by taking you back  back into the mists of your memory to perhaps the most anticipated year in your life  but certainly the most anticipated year in all human history  the year     . Remember that  Y K  the dotcom bubble  stressing about whose party you're going to go to as the clock strikes midnight  before the champagne goes flat  and then there's that inchoate yearning that was felt  I think  by many  that the millennium  that the year       should mean more  more than just a two and some zeroes. Well  amazingly  for once  our world leaders actually lived up to that millennium moment and back in      agreed to some pretty extraordinary stuff  visionary  measurable  long term targets called the Millennium Development Goals. Now  I'm sure you all keep a copy of the goals under your pillow  or by the bedside table  but just in case you don't  and your memory needs some jogging  the deal agreed then goes like this  developing countries promised to at least halve extreme poverty  hunger and deaths from disease  alongside some other targets  by       and developed nations promised to help them get that done by dropping debts  increasing smart aid  and trade reform. Well  we're approaching       so we'd better assess  how are we doing on these goals  But we've also got to decide  do we like such global goals  Some people don't. And if we like them  we've got to decide what we want to do on these goals going forward. What does the world want to do together  We've got to decide a process by which we decide. Well  I definitely think these goals are worth building on and seeing through  and here's just a few reasons why. Incredible partnerships between the private sector  political leaders  philanthropists and amazing grassroots activists across the developing world  but also         people marched in the streets of Edinburgh outside this very building for Make Poverty History. All together  they achieved these results  increased the number of people on anti retrovirals  life saving anti AIDS drugs  nearly halved deaths from malaria  vaccinated so many that  .  million lives will be saved. And combined  this is going to result in two million fewer children dying every year  last year  than in the year     . That's       fewer kids dying every day  ten times you lot not dead every day  because of all of these partnerships. So I think this is amazing living proof of progress that more people should know about  but the challenge of communicating this kind of good news is probably the subject of a different TEDTalk. Anyway  for now  anyone involved in getting these results  thank you. I think this proved these goals are worth it. But there's still a lot of unfinished business. Still   .  million children die every year of preventable  treatable diseases  and     million kids are malnourished to the point of stunting  a horrible term which means physical and cognitive lifelong impairment. So there's plainly a lot more to do on the goals we've got. But then  a lot of people think there are things that should have been in the original package that weren't agreed back then that should now be included  like sustainable development targets  natural resource governance targets  access to opportunity  to knowledge  equity  fighting corruption. All of this is measurable and could be in the new goals. But the key thing here is  what do you think should be in the new goals  What do you want  Are you annoyed that I didn't talk about gender equality or education  Should those be in the new package of goals  And quite frankly  that's a good question  but there's going to be some tough tradeoffs and choices here  so you want to hope that the process by which the world decides these new goals is going to be legitimate  right  Well  as we gather here in Edinburgh  technocrats appointed by the U.N. and certain governments  with the best intentions  are busying themselves designing a new package of goals  and currently they're doing that through pretty much the same old late   th century  top down  elite  closed process. But  of course  since then  the Web and mobile telephony  along with ubiquitous reality TV formats have spread all around the world. So what we'd like to propose is that we use them to involve people from all around the world in an historic first  the world's first truly global poll and consultation  where everyone everywhere has an equal voice for the very first time. I mean  wouldn't it be a huge historic missed opportunity not to do this  given that we can  There's hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake  tens of millions of lives  or deaths  at stake  and  I'd argue  the security and future of you and your family is also at stake. So  if you're with me  I'd say there's three essential steps in this crowdsourcing campaign  collecting  connecting and committing. So first of all  we've got to ground this campaign in core polling data. Let's go into every country that will let us in  ask       people what they want the new goals to be  making special efforts to reach the poorest  those without access to modern technology  and let's make sure that their views are at the center of the goals going forward. Then  we've got to commission a baseline survey to make sure we can monitor and progress the goals going forward. The original goals didn't really have good baseline survey data  and we're going to need the help of big data through all of this process to make sure we can really monitor the progress. And then we've got to connect with the big crowd. Now here  we see the role for an unprecedented coalition of social media giants and upstarts  telecoms companies  reality TV show formats  gaming companies  telecoms  all of them together in kind of their  We Are The World  moment. Could they come together and help the Millennium Development Goals get rebranded into the Millennial Generation's Goals  And if just five percent of the five billion plus who are currently connected made a comment  and that comment turned into a commitment  we could crowdsource a force of     million people around the world to help see these goals through. If we have this collected data  and this connected crowd  based upon our experience of campaigning and getting world leaders to commit  I think world leaders will commit to most of the crowdsourced recommendations. But the question really is  through this process will we all have become committed  And if we are  are we ready to iterate  monitor and provide feedback  make sure these promises are really delivering results  Well  there's some fantastic examples here to scale up  mostly piloted within Africa  actually. There's Open Data Kenya  which geocodes and crowdsources information about where projects are  are they delivering results. Often  they're not in the right place. And Ushahidi  which means  witness  in Swahili  which geocodes and crowdsources information in complex emergencies to help target responses. This is some of the most exciting stuff in development and democracy  where citizens on the edge of a network are helping to force open the process to make sure that the big global aid promises and vague stuff up at the top really delivers for people at a grassroots level and inverts that pyramid. This openness  this forcing openness  is key  and if it wasn't entirely transparent already  I should be open  I've got a completely transparent agenda. Long term trends suggest that this century is going to be a tough place to live  with population increases  consumption patterns increasing  and conflict over scarce natural resources. And look at the state of global politics today. Look at the Rio Earth Summit that happened just last week  or the Mexican G    also last week. Both  if we're honest  a bust. Our world leaders  our global politics  currently can't get it done. They need our help. They need the cavalry  and the cavalry's not going to come from Mars. It's got to come from us  and I see this process of deciding democratically in a bottom up fashion what the world wants to work on together as one vital means by which we can crowdsource the force to really build that constituency that's going to reinvigorate global governance in the   st century. I started in     . Let me finish in     . Many people made fun of a big campaign a few years ago we had called Make Poverty History. It was a naive thought in many people's minds  and it's true  it was just a t shirt slogan that worked for the moment. But look. The empirical condition of living under a dollar and    is trending down  and look where it gets to by     . It's getting near zero. Now sure  progress in China and India and poverty reduction there was key to that  but recently also in Africa  poverty rates are being reduced. It will get harder as we get towards zero  as the poor will be increasingly located in post conflict  fragile states  or maybe in middle income states where they don't really care about the marginalized. But I'm confident  with the right kind of political campaigning and creative and technological innovation combined working together more and more as one  I think we can get this and other goals done. Thank you.  Applause  Chris Anderson  Jamie  here's the puzzle to me. If there was an incident today where a hundred kids died in some tragedy or where  say  a hundred kids were kidnapped and then rescued by special forces  I mean  it would be all over the news for a week  right  You just put up  just as one of your numbers there  that          is that the number  Jamie Drummond  Fewer children every day. CA  Five thousand fewer children dying every day. I mean  it dwarfs  dwarfs everything that is actually on our news agenda  and it's invisible. This must drive you crazy. JD  It does  and we're having a huge debate in this country about aid levels  for example  and aid alone is not the whole solution. Nobody thinks it is. But  you know  if people saw the results of this smart aid  I mean  they'd be going crazy for it. I wish the         people who really did march outside this very building knew these results. Right now they don't  and it would be great to find a way to better communicate it  because we have not. Creatively  we've failed to communicate this success so far. If those kinds of efforts just could multiply their voice and amplify it at the key moments  I know for a fact we'd get better policy. The Mexican G   need not have been a bust. Rio  if anyone cares about the environment  need not have been a bust  okay  But these conferences are going on  and I know people get skeptical and cynical about the big global summits and the promises and their never being kept  but actually  the bits that are  are making a difference  and what the politicians need is more permission from the public. CA  But you haven't fully worked out the Web mechanisms  etc. by which this might happen. I mean  if the people here who've had experience using open platforms  you're interested to talk with them this week and try to take this forward. JD  Absolutely. CA  All right  well I must say  if this conference led in some way to advancing that idea  that's a huge idea  and if you carry that forward  that is really awesome  so thank you. JD  I'd love your help. CA  Thank you  thank you. I'm going to start on a slightly somber note. Two thousand and seven  five years ago  my wife gets diagnosed with breast cancer. Stage IIB. Now  looking back  the most harrowing part of that experience was not just the hospital visits    these were very painful for my wife  understandably so. It was not even the initial shock of knowing that she had breast cancer at just    years old  absolutely no history of cancer in her family. The most horrifying and agonizing part of the whole experience was we were making decisions after decisions after decisions that were being thrust upon us. Should it be a mastectomy  Should it be a lumpectomy  Should it be a more aggressive form of treatment  given that it was stage IIB  With all the side effects  Or should it be a less aggressive form of treatment  And these were being thrust upon us by the doctors. Now you could ask this question  why were the doctors doing this  A simplistic answer would be  the doctors are doing this because they want to protect themselves legally. I think that is too simplistic. These are well meaning doctors  some of them have gone on to become very good friends. They probably were simply following the wisdom that has come down through the ages  this adage that when you're making decisions  especially decisions of importance  it's best to be in charge  it's best to be in control  it's best to be in the driver's seat. And we were certainly in the driver's seat  making all these decisions. And let me tell you    if some of you have been there  it was a most agonizing and harrowing experience. Which got me thinking. I said  is there any validity to this whole adage that when you're making decisions  it's best to take the driver's seat  be in charge  be in control  Or are there contexts where we're far better off taking the passenger's seat and have someone else drive  For example  a trusted financial advisor  could be a trusted doctor  etc. And since I study human decision making  I said  I'm going to run some studies to find some answers. And I'm going to share one of these studies with you today. So  imagine that all of you are participants in the study. I want to tell you that what you're going to do in the study is  you're going to drink a cup of tea. If you're wondering why  I'll tell you why in a few seconds from now. You are going to solve a series of puzzles  and I'm going to show you examples of these puzzles momentarily. And the more puzzles you solve  the greater the chances that you'll win some prizes. Now  why do you have to consume the tea  Why  Because it makes a lot of sense  In order to solve these puzzles effectively  if you think about it  your mind needs to be in two states simultaneously  right  It needs to be alert  for which caffeine is very good. Simultaneously  it needs to be calm    not agitated  calm    for which chamomile is very good. Now comes the between subjects design  the AB design  the AB testing. So what I'm going to do is randomly assign you to one of two groups. So imagine that there is an imaginary line out here  so everyone here will be group A  everyone out here will be group B. Now  for you folks  what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you these two teas  and I'll go ahead and ask you to choose your tea. So you can choose whichever tea you want. You can decide  what is your mental state  OK  I choose the caffeinated tea  I choose the chamomile tea. So you're going to be in charge  you're going to be in control  you're going to be in the driver's seat. You folks  I'm going to show you these two teas  but you don't have a choice. I'm going to give you one of these two teas  and keep in mind  I'm going to pick one of these two teas at random for you. And you know that. So if you think about it  this is an extreme case scenario  because in the real world  whenever you are taking passenger's seat  very often the driver is going to be someone you trust  an expert  etc. So this is an extreme case scenario. Now  you're all going to consume the tea. So imagine that you're taking the tea now  we'll wait for you to finish the tea. We'll give another five minutes for the ingredient to have its effects. Now you're going to have    minutes to solve    puzzles. Here's an example of the puzzle you're going to solve. Anyone in the audience want to take a stab  Audience member  Pulpit  Baba Shiv  Whoa  OK. That's cool. Yeah  so what we'd do if we had you who gave the answer as a participant  we would have calibrated the difficulty level of the puzzles to your expertise. Because we want these puzzles to be difficult. These are tricky puzzles  because your first instinct is to say  tulip.  And then you have to unstick yourself. Right  So these have been calibrated to your level of expertise  because we want this to be difficult  and I'll tell you why  momentarily. Now  here's another example. Anyone  This is much more difficult. Audience member  Embark. BS  Yeah. Wow  OK. So  yeah  so this is  again  difficult. You'll say  kamber   then you'll go   maker   and all that  and then you can unstick yourself. So you have    minutes now to solve these    puzzles. Now  the question we're asking here is  in terms of the outcome    and it comes in the number of puzzles solved    will you in the driver's seat end up solving more puzzles because you are in control  you could decide which tea you would choose  or would you be better off  in terms of the number of puzzles solved  And  systemically  what we will show  across a series of studies  is that you  the passengers  even though the tea was picked for you at random  will end up solving more puzzles than you  the drivers. We also observe another thing  and that is  you folks not only are solving fewer puzzles  you're also putting less juice into the task    less effort  you're less persistent  and so on. How do we know that  Well  we have two objective measures. One is  what is the time  on average  you're taking in attempting to solve these puzzles  You will spend less time compared to you. Second  you have    minutes to solve these  are you taking the entire    minutes or are you giving up before the    minutes elapse  You will be more likely to give up before the    minutes elapse  compared to you. So you're putting in less juice  and therefore  the outcome  fewer puzzles solved. That brings us now to  why does this happen  And under what situations    when    would we see this pattern of results where the passenger is going to show better  more favorable outcomes  compared to the driver  It all has to do with when you face what I call the INCA. It's an acronym that stands for the nature of the feedback you're getting after you made the decision. So if you think about it  in this particular puzzle task    it could happen in investing in the stock market  very volatile out there  it could be the medical situation    the feedback here is immediate. You know the feedback  whether you're solving the puzzles or not. Right  Second  it is negative. Remember  the deck was stacked against you  in terms of the difficulty level of these puzzles. And this can happen in the medical domain. For example  very early on in the treatment  things are negative  the feedback  before things become positive. Right  It can happen in the stock market. Volatile stock market  getting negative feedback  it is also immediate. And the feedback in all these cases is concrete  it's unambiguous  you know if you've solved the puzzles or not. Now  the added one  apart from this immediacy  negative  this concreteness    now you have a sense of agency. You were responsible for your decision. So what do you do  You focus on the foregone option. You say  you know what  I should have chosen the other tea. That casts your decision in doubt  reduces the confidence you have in the decision  the confidence you have in the performance  the performance in terms of solving the puzzles. And therefore less juice into the task  fewer puzzles solved and less favorable outcomes compared to you folks. And this can happen in the medical domain  if you think about it  right  A patient in the driver's seat  for example. Less juice  which means keeping herself or himself less physically fit  physically active to hasten the recovery process  which is what is often advocated. You probably wouldn't do that. And therefore  there are times when you're facing the INCA  when the feedback is going to be immediate  negative  concrete and you have the sense of agency  where you're far better off taking the passenger's seat and have someone else drive. Now  I started off on a somber note. I want to finish up on a more upbeat note. It has now been five years  slightly more than five years  and the good news  thank God  is that the cancer is still in remission. So it all ends well. But one thing I didn't mention was that very early on into her treatment  my wife and I decided that we would take the passenger's seat. And that made so much of a difference in terms of the peace of mind that came with that  we could focus on her recovery. We let the doctors make all the decisions and take the driver's seat. Thank you. So wouldn't it be amazing if our phones could see the world in the same way that we do  as we're walking around being able to point a phone at anything  and then have it actually recognize images and objects like the human brain  and then be able to pull in information from an almost infinite library of knowledge and experiences and ideas. Well  traditionally that was seen as science fiction  but now we've moved to a world where actually this has become possible. So the best way of explaining it is to just show it. What you can see over here is Tamara  who is holding my phone that's now plugged in. So let me start with this. What we have here is a painting of the great poet Rabbie Burns  and it's just a normal image  but if we now switch inputs over to the phone  running our technology  you can see effectively what Tamara's seeing on the screen  and when she points at this image  something magical happens. Voice  Now simmer blinks on flowery braes ... Matt Mills  Now  what's great about this is  there's no trickery here. There's nothing done to this image. And what's great about this is the technology's actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like how the human brain does. Not only that  but as I move the object around  it's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly. Again  the thing that's incredible about this is this is how advanced these devices have become. All the processing to do that was actually done on the device itself. Now  this has applications everywhere  whether in things like art in museums  like you just saw  or in the world of  say  advertising  or print journalism. So a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it's printed. And here is this morning's newspaper  and we have some Wimbledon news  which is great. Now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bulletin. Voice  ... To the grass  and it's very important that you adapt and you  you have to be flexible  you have to be willing to change direction at a split second  and she does all that. She's won this title. MM  And that linking of the digital content to something that's physical is what we call an aura  and I'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk. So  what's great about this is it isn't just a faster  more convenient way to get information in the real world  but there are times when actually using this medium allows you to be able to display information in a way that was never before possible. So what I have here is a wireless router. My American colleagues have told me I've got to call it a router  so that everyone here understands    Laughter    but nonetheless  here is the device. So now what I can do is  rather than getting the instructions for the device online  I can simply point at it  the device is recognized  and then    Voice  Begin by plugging in the grey ADSL cable. Then connect the power. Finally  the yellow ethernet cable. Congratulations. You have now completed setup. The incredible work that made that possible was done here in the U.K. by scientists at Cambridge  and they work in our offices  and I've got a lovely picture of them here. They couldn't all be on stage  but we're going to bring their aura to the stage  so here they are. They're not very animated.  Laughter  This was the fourth take  I'm told.  Laughter  Okay. So  as we're talking about Cambridge  let's now move on to technical advancements  because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones less than    months ago  the speed and the processing in these devices has grown at a really phenomenal rate  and that means that I can now take cinema quality  D models and place them in the world around me  so I have one over here. Tamara  would you like to jump in  MM  I should leap in. So then  after the fun  comes the more emotional side of what we do  because effectively  this technology allows you to see the world through someone's eyes  and for that person to be able to take a moment in time and effectively store it and tag it to something physical that exists in the real world. What's great about this is  the tools to do this are free. They're open  they're available to everyone within our application  and educators have really got on board with the classrooms. So we have teachers who've tagged up textbooks  teachers who've tagged up school classrooms  and a great example of this is a school in the U.K. I have a picture here from a video  and we're now going to play it. Teacher  See what happens.  Children talking  Keep going. Child  TV.  Children react  Child  Oh my God. Teacher  Now move it either side. See what happens. Move away from it and come back to it. Child  Oh  that is so cool. Teacher  And then  have you got it again  Child  Oh my God  How did you do that  Second child  It's magic. It's available for everyone to do  and actually I'm going to show you how easy it is to do by doing one right now. So  as sort of   I'm told it's called a stadium wave  so we're going to start from this side of the room on the count of three  and go over to here. Tamara  are you recording  Okay  so are you all ready  One  two  three. Go  Audience  Whooooooo  MM  Fellows are really good at that.  Laughs   Laughter  Okay. Now we're going to switch back into the Aurasma application  and what Tamara's going to do is tag that video that we just took onto my badge  so that I can remember it forever. Now  we have lots of people who are doing this already  and we've talked a little bit about the educational side. On the emotional side  we have people who've done things like send postcards and Christmas cards back to their family with little messages on them. We have people who have  for example  taken the inside of the engine bay of an old car and tagged up different components within an engine  so that if you're stuck and you want to find out more  you can point and discover the information. We're all very  very familiar with the Internet. In the last    years  it's really changed the way that we live and work  and the way that we see the world  and what's great is  we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift  because now we can literally take the content that we share  we discover  and that we enjoy and make it a part of the world around us. It's completely free to download this application. If you have a good Wi Fi connection or  G  this process is very  very quick. Oh  there we are. We can save it now. It's just going to do a tiny bit of processing to convert that image that we just took into a sort of digital fingerprint  and the great thing is  if you're a professional user     so  a newspaper    the tools are pretty much identical to what we've just used to create this demonstration. The only difference is that you've got the ability to add in links and slightly more content. Are you now ready  Tamara Roukaerts  We're ready to go. MM  Okay. So  I'm told we're ready  which means we can now point at the image  and there you all are. MM on video  One  two  three. Go  MM  Well done. We've been Aurasma. Thank you. Well  I was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia  which is total color blindness  so I've never seen color  and I don't know what color looks like  because I come from a grayscale world. To me  the sky is always gray  flowers are always gray  and television is still in black and white. But  since the age of     instead of seeing color  I can hear color. In       I started a project with computer scientist Adam Montandon  and the result  with further collaborations with Peter Kese from Slovenia and Matias Lizana from Barcelona  is this electronic eye. It's a color sensor that detects the color frequency in front of me    Frequency sounds    and sends this frequency to a chip installed at the back of my head  and I hear the color in front of me through the bone  through bone conduction. This is the sound of purple.  Frequency sounds  For example  this is the sound of grass.  Frequency sounds  This is red  like TED.  Frequency sounds  This is the sound of a dirty sock.  Laughter  Which is like yellow  this one. So I've been hearing color all the time for eight years  since       so I find it completely normal now to hear color all the time. At the start  though  I had to memorize the names you give for each color  so I had to memorize the notes  but after some time  all this information became a perception. I didn't have to think about the notes. And after some time  this perception became a feeling. I started to have favorite colors  and I started to dream in colors. So  when I started to dream in color is when I felt that the software and my brain had united  because in my dreams  it was my brain creating electronic sounds. It wasn't the software  so that's when I started to feel like a cyborg. It's when I started to feel that the cybernetic device was no longer a device. It had become a part of my body  an extension of my senses  and after some time  it even became a part of my official image. This is my passport from     . You're not allowed to appear on U.K. passports with electronic equipment  but I insisted to the passport office that what they were seeing was actually a new part of my body  an extension of my brain  and they finally accepted me to appear with the passport photo. So  life has changed dramatically since I hear color  because color is almost everywhere  so the biggest change for example is going to an art gallery  I can listen to a Picasso  for example. So it's like I'm going to a concert hall  because I can listen to the paintings. And supermarkets  I find this is very shocking  it's very  very attractive to walk along a supermarket. It's like going to a nightclub. It's full of different melodies.  Laughter  Yeah. Especially the aisle with cleaning products. It's just fabulous.  Laughter  Also  the way I dress has changed. Before  I used to dress in a way that it looked good. Now I dress in a way that it sounds good.  Laughter  So today I'm dressed in C major  so it's quite a happy chord.  Laughter  If I had to go to a funeral  though  I would dress in B minor  which would be turquoise  purple and orange.  Laughter  Also  food  the way I look at food has changed  because now I can display the food on a plate  so I can eat my favorite song.  Laughter  So depending on how I display it  I can hear and I can compose music with food. So imagine a restaurant where we can have  like  Lady Gaga salads as starters.  Laughter  I mean  this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables  probably. And also  some Rachmaninov piano concertos as main dishes  and some Bjork or Madonna desserts  that would be a very exciting restaurant where you can actually eat songs. Also  the way I perceive beauty has changed  because when I look at someone  I hear their face  so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible. the other way around. So I really enjoy creating  like  sound portraits of people. Instead of drawing someone's face  like drawing the shape  I point at them with the eye and I write down the different notes I hear  and then I create sound portraits. Here's some faces. Yeah  Nicole Kidman sounds good.  Laughter  Some people  I would never relate  but they sound similar. Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman. They have similar sound of eyes. So you relate people that you wouldn't relate  and you can actually also create concerts by looking at the audience faces. So I connect the eye  and then I play the audience's faces. The good thing about this is  if the concert doesn't sound good  it's their fault. It's not my fault  because    Laughter  And so another thing that happens is that I started having this secondary effect that normal sounds started to become color. I heard a telephone tone  and it felt green because it sounded just like the color green. The BBC beeps  they sound turquoise  and listening to Mozart became a yellow experience  so I started to paint music and paint people's voices  because people's voices have frequencies that I relate to color. And here's some music translated into color. For example  Mozart   Queen of the Night   looks like this. because there's many different frequencies. And this is a completely different song. It is very pink and very yellow. So  also voices  I can transform speeches into color  for example  these are two very well known speeches. One of them is Martin Luther King's  I Have A Dream   and the other one is Hitler. And I like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls without labels  and then I ask people   Which one do you prefer   And most people change their preference when I tell them that the one on the left is Hitler and the one on the right is Martin Luther King. So I got to a point when I was able to perceive     colors  just like human vision. I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel. But then  I just thought that this human vision wasn't good enough. There's many  many more colors around us that we cannot perceive  but that electronic eyes can perceive. So I decided to continue extending my color senses  and I added infrared and I added ultraviolet to the color to sound scale  so now I can hear colors that the human eye cannot perceive. For example  perceiving infrared is good because you can actually detect if there's movement detectors in a room. I can hear if someone points at me with a remote control. And the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that you can hear if it's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe  because ultraviolet is a dangerous color  a color that can actually kill us  so I think we should all have this wish to perceive things that we cannot perceive. That's why  two years ago  I created the Cyborg Foundation  which is a foundation that tries to help people become a cyborg  tries to encourage people to extend their senses by using technology as part of the body. We should all think that knowledge comes from our senses  so if we extend our senses  we will consequently extend our knowledge. I think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body. I think this will be a big  big change that we will see during this century. So I do encourage you all to think about which senses you'd like to extend. I would encourage you to become a cyborg. You won't be alone. Thank you.  Applause  So the machine I'm going to talk you about is what I call the greatest machine that never was. It was a machine that was never built  and yet  it will be built. It was a machine that was designed long before anyone thought about computers. If you know anything about the history of computers  you will know that in the '  s and the '  s  simple computers were created that started the computer revolution we have today  and you would be correct  except for you'd have the wrong century. The first computer was really designed in the     s and     s  not the     s and     s. It was designed  and parts of it were prototyped  and the bits of it that were built are here in South Kensington. That machine was built by this guy  Charles Babbage. Now  I have a great affinity for Charles Babbage because his hair is always completely unkempt like this in every single picture.  Laughter  He was a very wealthy man  and a sort of  part of the aristocracy of Britain  and on a Saturday night in Marylebone  were you part of the intelligentsia of that period  you would have been invited round to his house for a soiree   and he invited everybody  kings  the Duke of Wellington  many  many famous people   and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines. I really miss that era  you know  where you could go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer get demonstrated to you.  Laughter  But Babbage  Babbage himself was born at the end of the   th century  and was a fairly famous mathematician. He held the post that Newton held at Cambridge  and that was recently held by Stephen Hawking. He's less well known than either of them because he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices and never made any of them. The reason he never made any of them  he's a classic nerd. Every time he had a good idea  he'd think   That's brilliant  I'm going to start building that one. I'll spend a fortune on it. I've got a better idea. I'm going to work on this one.  Laughter  And I'm going to do this one.  He did this until Sir Robert Peel  then Prime Minister  basically kicked him out of Number    Downing Street  and kicking him out  in those days  that meant saying   I bid you good day  sir.   Laughter  The thing he designed was this monstrosity here  the analytical engine. Now  just to give you an idea of this  this is a view from above. Every one of these circles is a cog  a stack of cogs  and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive. So as I go through this talk  I want you to imagine this gigantic machine. We heard those wonderful sounds of what this thing would have sounded like. And I'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine   that's why it's computer architecture   and tell you about this machine  which is a computer. So let's talk about the memory. The memory is very like the memory of a computer today  except it was all made out of metal  stacks and stacks of cogs     cogs high. Imagine a thing this high of cogs  hundreds and hundreds of them  and they've got numbers on them. It's a decimal machine. Everything's done in decimal. And he thought about using binary. The problem with using binary is that the machine would have been so tall  it would have been ridiculous. As it is  it's enormous. So he's got memory. The memory is this bit over here. You see it all like this. This monstrosity over here is the CPU  the chip  if you like. Of course  it's this big. Completely mechanical. This whole machine is mechanical. This is a picture of a prototype for part of the CPU which is in the Science Museum. The CPU could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic    so addition  multiplication  subtraction  division    which already is a bit of a feat in metal  but it could also do something that a computer does and a calculator doesn't  this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision. It could do the  if then  for basic programmers  and that fundamentally made it into a computer. It could compute. It couldn't just calculate. It could do more. Now  if we look at this  and we stop for a minute  and we think about chips today  we can't look inside a silicon chip. It's just so tiny. Yet if you did  you would see something very  very similar to this. There's this incredible complexity in the CPU  and this incredible regularity in the memory. If you've ever seen an electron microscope picture  you'll see this. This all looks the same  then there's this bit over here which is incredibly complicated. All this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does  but of course you need to program this thing  and of course  Babbage used the technology of the day and the technology that would reappear in the '  s  '  s and '  s  which is punch cards. This thing over here is one of three punch card readers in here  and this is a program in the Science Museum  just not far from here  created by Charles Babbage  that is sitting there   you can go see it   waiting for the machine to be built. And there's not just one of these  there's many of them. He prepared programs anticipating this would happen. Now  the reason they used punch cards was that Jacquard  in France  had created the Jacquard loom  which was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards  so he was just repurposing the technology of the day  and like everything else he did  he's using the technology of his era  so     s      s      s  cogs  steam  mechanical devices. Ironically  born the same year as Charles Babbage was Michael Faraday  who would completely revolutionize everything with the dynamo  transformers  all these sorts of things. Babbage  of course  wanted to use proven technology  so steam and things. Now  he needed accessories. Obviously  you've got a computer now. You've got punch cards  a CPU and memory. You need accessories you're going to come with. You're not just going to have that  So  first of all  you had sound. You had a bell  so if anything went wrong    Laughter    or the machine needed the attendant to come to it  there was a bell it could ring.  Laughter  And there's actually an instruction on the punch card which says  Ring the bell.  So you can imagine this  Ting   You know  just stop for a moment  imagine all those noises  this thing   Click  clack click click click   steam engine   Ding   right   Laughter  You also need a printer  obviously  and everyone needs a printer. This is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for another machine of his  called the Difference Engine No.    which he never built  but which the Science Museum did build in the '  s and '  s. It's completely mechanical  again  a printer. It prints just numbers  because he was obsessed with numbers  but it does print onto paper  and it even does word wrapping  so if you get to the end of the line  it goes around like that. You also need graphics  right  I mean  if you're going to do anything with graphics  so he said   Well  I need a plotter. I've got a big piece of paper and an ink pen and I'll make it plot.  So he designed a plotter as well  and  you know  at that point  I think he got pretty much a pretty good machine. Along comes this woman  Ada Lovelace. Now  imagine these soirees  all these great and good comes along. This lady is the daughter of the mad  bad and dangerous to know Lord Byron  and her mother  being a bit worried that she might have inherited some of Lord Byron's madness and badness  thought   I know the solution  Mathematics is the solution. We'll teach her mathematics. That'll calm her down.  there's never been a mathematician that's gone crazy  so  you know  that'll be fine.  Laughter  Everything'll be fine. So she's got this mathematical training  and she goes to one of these soirees with her mother  and Charles Babbage  you know  gets out his machine. The Duke of Wellington is there  you know  get out the machine  obviously demonstrates it  and she gets it. She's the only person in his lifetime  really  who said   I understand what this does  and I understand the future of this machine.  And we owe to her an enormous amount because we know a lot about the machine that Babbage was intending to build because of her. Now  some people call her the first programmer. This is actually from one of    the paper that she translated. This is a program written in a particular style. It's not  historically  totally accurate that she's the first programmer  and actually  she did something more amazing. Rather than just being a programmer  she saw something that Babbage didn't. Babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics. He was building a machine to do mathematics  and Lovelace said   You could do more than mathematics on this machine.  And just as you do  everyone in this room already's got a computer on them right now  because they've got a phone. If you go into that phone  every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics. It's all numbers at the bottom. Whether it's video or text or music or voice  it's all numbers  it's all  underlying it  mathematical functions happening  and Lovelace said   Just because you're doing mathematical functions and symbols doesn't mean these things can't represent other things in the real world  such as music.  This was a huge leap  because Babbage is there saying   We could compute these amazing functions and print out tables of numbers and draw graphs      Laughter    and Lovelace is there and she says   Look  this thing could even compose music if you told it a representation of music numerically.  So this is what I call Lovelace's Leap. When you say she's a programmer  she did do some  but the real thing is to have said the future is going to be much  much more than this. Now  a hundred years later  this guy comes along  Alan Turing  and in       and invents the computer all over again. Now  of course  Babbage's machine was entirely mechanical. Turing's machine was entirely theoretical. Both of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective  but Turing told us something very important. He laid down the mathematical foundations for computer science  and said   It doesn't matter how you make a computer.  It doesn't matter if your computer's mechanical  like Babbage's was  or electronic  like computers are today  or perhaps in the future  cells  or  again  mechanical again  once we get into nanotechnology. We could go back to Babbage's machine and just make it tiny. All those things are computers. There is in a sense a computing essence. This is called the Church Turing thesis. And so suddenly  you get this link where you say this thing Babbage had built really was a computer. In fact  it was capable of doing everything we do today with computers  only really slowly.  Laughter  To give you an idea of how slowly  it had about  k of memory. It used punch cards  which were being fed in  and it ran about        times slower the first ZX  . It did have a RAM pack. You could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to. So there are plans. Over in Swindon  the Science Museum archives  there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages of notes written by Charles Babbage about this analytical engine. One of those is a set of plans that we call Plan     and that is also the name of a charity that I started with Doron Swade  who was the curator of computing at the Science Museum  and also the person who drove the project to build a difference engine  and our plan is to build it. Here in South Kensington  we will build the analytical engine. The project has a number of parts to it. One was the scanning of Babbage's archive. That's been done. The second is now the study of all of those plans to determine what to build. The third part is a computer simulation of that machine  and the last part is to physically build it at the Science Museum. When it's built  you'll finally be able to understand how a computer works  because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you  you've got to look at this humongous thing and say   Ah  I see the memory operating  I see the CPU operating  I hear it operating. I probably smell it operating.   Laughter  But in between that we're going to do a simulation. Babbage himself wrote  he said  as soon as the analytical engine exists  it will surely guide the future course of science. Of course  he never built it  because he was always fiddling with new plans  but when it did get built  of course  in the     s  everything changed. Now  I'll just give you a little taste of what it looks like in motion with a video which shows just one part of the CPU mechanism working. So this is just three sets of cogs  and it's going to add. This is the adding mechanism in action  so you imagine this gigantic machine. So  give me five years. Before the     s happen  we'll have it. Thank you very much.  Applause  Frugal Digital is essentially a small research group at C.I.D. where we are looking to find alternate visions of how to create a digitally inclusive society. That's what we're after. And we do this because we actually believe that silicon technology today is mostly about a culture of excess. It's about the fastest and the most efficient and the most dazzling gadget you can have  while about two thirds of the world can hardly reach the most basic of this technology to even address fundamental needs in life  including health care  education and all these kinds of very fundamental issues. So before I start  I want to talk about a little anecdote  a little story about a man I met once in Mumbai. So this man  his name is Sathi Shri. He is an outstanding person  because he's a small entrepreneur. He runs a little shop in one of the back streets of Mumbai. He has this little    square meter store  where so much is being done. It's incredible  because I couldn't believe my eyes when I once just happened to bump into him. Basically  what he does is  he has all these services for micro payments and booking tickets and all kinds of basic things that you would go online for  but he does it for people offline and connects to the digital world. More importantly  he makes his money by selling these mobile recharge coupons  you know  for the prepaid subscriptions. But then  in the backside  he's got this little nook with a few of his employees where they can fix almost anything. Any cell phone  any gadget you can bring them  they can fix it. And it's pretty incredible because I took my iPhone there  and he was like   Yeah  do you want an upgrade    Yes.   Laughter  I was a bit skeptical  but then  I decided to give him a Nokia instead.  Laughter  But what I was amazed about is this reverse engineering and know how that's built into this little two meters of space. They have figured out everything that's required to dismantle  take things apart  rewrite the circuitry  re flash the firmware  do whatever you want to with the phone  and they can fix anything so quickly. You can hand over a phone this morning and you can go pick it up after lunch  and it was quite incredible. But then we were wondering whether this is a local phenomenon  or is truly global  And  over time  we started understanding and systematically researching what this tinkering ecosystem is about  because that is something that's happening not just in one street corner in Mumbai. It's actually happening in all parts of the country. It's even happening in Africa  like  for example  in Cape Town we did extensive research on this. Even here in Doha I found this little nook where you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed  and it's a lot of tiny little parts. It's not easy. You've got to try it on your own to believe it. But what fuels this  It's this entire ecosystem of low cost parts and supplies that are produced all over the world  literally  and then redistributed to basically service this industry  and you can even buy salvaged parts. Basically  you don't have to necessarily buy brand new things. You have condemned computers that are stripped apart  and you can buy salvaged components and things that you can reassemble in a new configuration. But what does this new  sort of  approach give us  That's the real question  because this is something that's been there  part of every society that's deprived of enough resources. But there's an interesting paradigm. There's the traditional crafts  and then there's the technology crafts. We call it the technology crafts because these are emerging. They're not something that's been established. It's not something that's institutionalized. It's not taught in universities. It's taught  by  word of mouth  and it's an informal education system around this. So we said   What can we get out of this  You know  like  what are the key values that we can get out of this   The main thing is a fix it locally culture  which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn't have to go through a huge bureaucratic system to get it fixed. It also affords us cheap fabrication  which is fantastic  so it means that you can do a lot more with it. And then  the most important thing is  it gives us large math for low cost. So it means that you can actually embed pretty clever algorithms and lots of other kinds of extendable ideas into really simple devices. So  what we call this is a silicon cottage industry. It's basically what was the system or the paradigm before the industrial revolution is now re happening in a whole new way in small digital shops across the planet in most developing countries. So  we kind of toyed around with this idea  and we said   What can we do with this  Can we make a little product or a service out of it   So one of the first things we did is this thing called a multimedia platform. We call it a lunch box. Basically one of the contexts that we studied was schools in very remote parts of India. So there is this amazing concept called the one teacher school  which is basically a single teacher who is a multitasker who teaches this amazing little social setting. It's an informal school  but it's really about holistic education. The only thing that they don't have is access to resources. They don't even have a textbook sometimes  and they don't even have a proper curriculum. So we said   What can we do to empower this teacher to do more   How to access the digital world  Instead of being the sole guardian of information  be a facilitator to all this information. So we said   What are the steps required to empower the teacher   How do you make this teacher into a digital gateway  and how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform that can be constructed locally and serviced locally   So we walked around. We went and scavenged the nearby markets  and we tried to understand   What can we pick up that will make this happen   So the thing that we got was a little mobile phone with a little pico projector that comes for about    dollars. We went a bought a flashlight with a very big battery  and a bunch of small speakers. So essentially  the mobile phone gives us a connected multimedia platform. It allows us to get online and allows us to load up files of different formats and play them. The flashlight gives us this really intense  bright L.E.D.  and six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack  and the lunch box is a nice little package in which you can put everything inside  and a bunch of mini speakers to sort of amplify the sound large enough. Believe me  those little classrooms are really noisy. They are kids who scream at the top of their voices  and you really have to get above that. And we took it back to this little tinkering setup of a mobile phone repair shop  and then the magic happens. We dismantle the whole thing  we reassemble it in a new configuration  and we do this hardware mashup  systematically training the guy how to do this. Out comes this  a little lunch box    form factor. And we systematically field tested  because in the field testing we learned some important lessons  and we went through many iterations. One of the key issues was battery consumption and charging. Luminosity was an issue  when you have too much bright sunlight outside. Often the roofs are broken  so you don't have enough darkness in the classroom to do these things. We extended this idea. We tested it many times over  and the next version we came up with was a box that kind of could trickle charge on solar energy  but most importantly connect to a car battery  because a car battery is a ubiquitous source of power in places where there's not enough electricity or erratic electricity. And the other key thing that we did was make this box run off a USB key  because we realized that even though there was GPRS and all that on paper  at least  in theory  it was much more efficient to send the data on a little USB key by surface mail. It might take a few days to get there  but at least it gets there in high definition and in a reliable quality. So we made this box  and we tested it again and again and again  and we're going through multiple iterations to do these things. But it's not limited to just education. This kind of a technique or metrology can actually be applied to other kinds of areas  and I'm going to tell you one more little story. It's about this little device called a medi meter. It's basically a little health care screening tool that we developed. In India  there is a context of these amazing people  the health care workers called ASHA workers. They are essentially foot soldiers for the health care system who live in the local community and are trained with basic tools and basic concepts of health care  and the main purpose is basically to inform people to basically  how to lead a better life  but also to divert or sort of make recommendations of what kind of health care should they approach  They are basically referral services  essentially. But the problem with that is that we realized after a bunch of research that they are amazing at referring people to the nearest clinic or the public health care system  but what happens at the public health care system is this  these incredibly long lines and too many people who overload the system simply because there's not enough doctors and facilities for the population that's being referred. So everything from a common cold to a serious case of malaria gets almost the same level of attention  and there's no priorities. So we said   Come on  there's got to be a better way of doing this for sure.  So we said   What can we do with the ASHA worker that'll allow this ASHA worker to become an interesting filter  but not just a filter  a really well thought through referral system that allows load balancing of the network  and directs patients to different sources of health care based on the severity or the criticalness of those situations   So the real key question was  how do we empower this woman  How do we empower her with simple tools that's not diagnostic but more screening in nature so she at least knows how to advise the patients better  And that'll make such a huge difference on the system  because the amount of waiting time and the amount of distances that people need to travel  often sometimes seven to    kilometers  sometimes by foot  to get a simple health check done  is very  very detrimental in the sense that it really dissuades people from getting access to health care. So if there was something that she could do  that would be amazing. So what we did was that we converted this device into a medical device. I want to demo this actually  because it's a very simple process. Bruno  do you want to join us   Cheers  Come along.  Applause  So  what we're going to do is that we're going to measure a few basic parameters on you  including your pulse rate and the amount of oxygen that's there in your blood. So you're going to put your thumb on top of this. Bruno Giussani  Like this  works  Vinay Venkatraman  Yeah. That's right. BG  Okay. VV  So I'm going to start it up. I hope it works. So ...  Laughter  So I take it into the start position  and then I press the read button.  Beeps  So it's taking a little reading from you.  Beeps  And then the pointer goes and points to three different options. Let's see what happens here. BG  Great. Good news.  Applause  VV  So ...  Applause  So the thing about this is that if the pointer  unfortunately  had pointed to the red spot  we would have to rush you to a hospital. Luckily  not today. And if it had pointed to the orange or the amber  it basically meant you had to have  sort of  more continuous care from the health care worker. So that was a very simple three step screening process that could basically change the equation of how public health care works in so many different ways. BG  Thank you for the good news. VV  Yeah. So  very briefly  I'll just explain to you how this is done  because that's the more interesting part. So essentially  the three things that are required to make this conversion from this guy to this guy is a cheap remote control for a television that you can almost find in every home today  some parts from a computer mouse  basically  something that you can scavenge for very low cost  and a few parts that have to be pre programmed. Basically this is a micro controller with a few extra components that can be shipped for very little cost across the world  and that's what is all required with a little bit of local tinkering talent to convert the device into something else. So we are right now doing some systematic field tests to basically ascertain whether something like this actually makes sense to the ASHA worker. We are going through some reference tests to compare it against professional equipment to see if there's a degree of change in efficacy and if it actually makes an impact in people's lives. But most importantly  what we are trying to do right now is we are trying to scale this up  because there are over         ASHA workers on the ground who are these amazing foot soldiers  and if we can give at least a fraction of them the access to these things  it just changes the way the economics of public health care works  and it changes the way systems actually function  not just on a systematic planning level  but also in a very grassroots  bottom up level. So that's it  and we hope to do this in a big way. Thank you.  Applause  I'm gonna talk a little bit about open source security  because we've got to get better at security in this   st century. Let me start by saying  let's look back to the   th century  and kind of get a sense of how that style of security worked for us. This is Verdun  a battlefield in France just north of the NATO headquarters in Belgium. At Verdun  in       over a     day period          people were killed  so about       a day. If you roll it forward      th century security    into the Second World War  you see the Battle of Stalingrad      days    million people killed. We go into the Cold War  and we continue to try and build walls. We go from the trench warfare of the First World War to the Maginot Line of the Second World War  and then we go into the Cold War  the Iron Curtain  the Berlin Wall. Walls don't work. My thesis for us today is  instead of building walls to create security  we need to build bridges. This is a famous bridge in Europe. It's in Bosnia Herzegovina. It's the bridge over the Drina River  the subject of a novel by Ivo Andri   and it talks about how  in that very troubled part of Europe and the Balkans  over time there's been enormous building of walls. More recently  in the last decade  we begin to see these communities start  hesitatingly  to come together. I would argue  again  open source security is about connecting the international  the interagency  the private public  and lashing it together with strategic communication  largely in social networks. So let me talk a little bit about why we need to do that  because our global commons is under attack in a variety of ways  and none of the sources of threat to the global commons will be solved by building walls. Now  I'm a sailor  obviously. This is a ship  a liner  clipping through the Indian Ocean. What's wrong with this picture  It's got concertina wire along the sides of it. That's to prevent pirates from attacking it. Piracy is a very active threat today around the world. This is in the Indian Ocean. Piracy is also very active in the Strait of Malacca. It's active in the Gulf of Guinea. We see it in the Caribbean. It's a     billion a year discontinuity in the global transport system. Last year  at this time  there were    vessels      mariners held hostage. This is an attack on the global commons. We need to think about how to address it. Let's shift to a different kind of sea  the cyber sea. Here are photographs of two young men. At the moment  they're incarcerated. They conducted a credit card fraud that netted them over    billion dollars. This is part of cybercrime which is a    trillion a year discontinuity in the global economy. Two trillion a year. That's just under the GDP of Great Britain. So this cyber sea  which we know endlessly is the fundamental piece of radical openness  is very much under threat as well. Another thing I worry about in the global commons is the threat posed by trafficking  by the movement of narcotics  opium  here coming out of Afghanistan through Europe over to the United States. We worry about cocaine coming from the Andean Ridge north. We worry about the movement of illegal weapons and trafficking. Above all  perhaps  we worry about human trafficking  and the awful cost of it. Trafficking moves largely at sea but in other parts of the global commons. This is a photograph  and I wish I could tell you that this is a very high tech piece of US Navy gear that we're using to stop the trafficking. The bad news is  this is a semi submersible run by drug cartels. It was built in the jungles of South America. We caught it with that low tech raft    Laughter    and it was carrying six tons of cocaine. Crew of four. Sophisticated communications sweep. This kind of trafficking  in narcotics  in humans  in weapons  God forbid  in weapons of mass destruction  is part of the threat to the global commons. And let's pull it together in Afghanistan today. This is a field of poppies in Afghanistan. Eighty to    percent of the world's poppy  opium and heroin  comes out of Afghanistan. We also see there  of course  terrorism. This is where al Qaeda is staged from. We also see a very strong insurgency embedded there. So this terrorism concern is also part of the global commons  and what we must address. So here we are    st century. We know our   th century tools are not going to work. What should we do  I would argue that we will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun. We will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun. We will need the application of military force. When we do it  we must do it well  and competently. But my thesis is  open source security is about international  interagency  private public connection pulled together by this idea of strategic communication on the Internet. Let me give you a couple of examples of how this works in a positive way. This is Afghanistan. These are Afghan soldiers. They are all holding books. You should say   That's odd. I thought I read that this demographic  young men and women in their   s and   s  is largely illiterate in Afghanistan.  You would be correct. Eighty five percent cannot read when they enter the security forces of Afghanistan. Why  Because the Taliban withheld education during the period of time in which these men and women would have learned to read. So the question is  so  why are they all standing there holding books  The answer is  we are teaching them to read in literacy courses by NATO in partnership with private sector entities  in partnership with development agencies. We've taught well over         Afghan Security Forces to read and write at a basic level. When you can read and write in Afghanistan  you will typically put a pen in your pocket. At the ceremonies  when these young men and women graduate  they take that pen with great pride  and put it in their pocket. This is bringing together international   there are    nations involved in this mission   interagency   these development agencies   and private public  to take on this kind of security. Now  we are also teaching them combat skills  of course  but I would argue  open source security means connecting in ways that create longer lasting security effect. Here's another example. This is a US Navy warship. It's called the Comfort. There's a sister ship called the Mercy. They are hospital ships. This one  the Comfort  operates throughout the Caribbean and the coast of South America conducting patient treatments. On a typical cruise  they'll do         patient treatments. It is crewed not strictly by military but by a combination of humanitarian organizations  Operation Hope  Project Smile. Other organizations send volunteers. Interagency physicians come out. They're all part of this. To give you one example of the impact this can have  this little boy  eight years old  walked with his mother two days to come to the eye clinic put on by the Comfort. When he was fitted  over his extremely myopic eyes  he suddenly looked up and said   Mama  veo el mundo.   Mom  I see the world.  Multiply this by         patient treatments  this private public collaboration with security forces  and you begin to see the power of creating security in a very different way. Here you see baseball players. Can you pick out the two US Army soldiers in this photograph  They are the two young men on either side of these young boys. This is part of a series of baseball clinics  where we have explored collaboration between Major League Baseball  the Department of State  who sets up the diplomatic piece of this  military baseball players  who are real soldiers with real skills but participate in this mission  and they put on clinics throughout Latin America and the Caribbean  in Honduras  in Nicaragua  in all of the Central American and Caribbean nations where baseball is so popular  and it creates security. It shows role models to young men and women about fitness and about life that I would argue help create security for us. Another aspect of this partnership is in disaster relief. This is a US Air Force helicopter participating after the tsunami in      which killed         people. In each of these major disasters   the tsunami in               dead  the Kashmiri earthquake in Pakistan               dead  the Haitian earthquake  about         dead  more recently the awful earthquake tsunami combination which struck Japan and its nuclear industry   in all of these instances  we see partnerships between international actors  interagency  private public working with security forces to respond to this kind of natural disaster. So these are examples of this idea of open source security. We tie it together  increasingly  by doing things like this. Now  you're looking at this thinking   Ah  Admiral  these must be sea lanes of communication  or these might be fiber optic cables.  No. This is a graphic of the world according to Twitter. Purple are tweets. Green are geolocation. White is the synthesis. It's a perfect evocation of that great population survey  the six largest nations in the world in descending order  China  India  Facebook  the United States  Twitter and Indonesia.  Laughter  Why do we want to get in these nets  Why do we want to be involved  We talked earlier about the Arab Spring  and the power of all this. I'll give you another example  and it's how you move this message. I gave a talk like this in London a while back about this point. I said  as I say to all of you  I'm on Facebook. Friend me. Got a little laugh from the audience. There was an article which was run by AP  on the wire. Got picked up in two places in the world  Finland and Indonesia. The headline was  NATO Admiral Needs Friends. Thank you.  Applause  Which I do.  Laughter  And the story was a catalyst  and the next morning I had hundreds of Facebook friend requests from Indonesians and Finns  mostly saying   Admiral  we heard you need a friend  and oh  by the way  what is NATO    Laughter  So ...  Laughter  Yeah  we laugh  but this is how we move the message  and moving that message is how we connect international  interagency  private public  and these social nets to help create security. Now  let me hit a somber note. This is a photograph of a brave British soldier. He's in the Scots Guards. He's standing the watch in Helmand  in southern Afghanistan. I put him here to remind us  I would not want anyone to leave the room thinking that we do not need capable  competent militaries who can create real military effect. That is the core of who we are and what we do  and we do it to protect freedom  freedom of speech  all the things we treasure in our societies. But  you know  life is not an on and off switch. You don't have to have a military that is either in hard combat or is in the barracks. I would argue life is a rheostat. You have to dial it in  and as I think about how we create security in this   st century  there will be times when we will apply hard power in true war and crisis  but there will be many instances  as we've talked about today  where our militaries can be part of creating   st century security  international  interagency  private public  connected with competent communication. I would close by saying that we heard earlier today about Wikipedia. I use Wikipedia all the time to look up facts  and as all of you appreciate  Wikipedia is not created by    brilliant people locked in a room writing articles. Wikipedia  every day  is tens of thousands of people inputting information  and every day millions of people withdrawing that information. It's a perfect image for the fundamental point that no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together. No one person  no one alliance  no one nation  no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together. The vision statement of Wikipedia is very simple  a world in which every human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. My thesis for you is that by combining international  interagency  private public  strategic communication  together  in this   st century  we can create the sum of all security. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Hi. This is my mobile phone. A mobile phone can change your life  and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom. With a mobile phone  you can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria. With a mobile phone  you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt. And with a mobile phone  you can record a song  load it up to SoundCloud and become famous. All this is possible with your mobile phone. I'm a child of       and I live in the city of Berlin. Let's go back to that time  to this city. Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change. This is autumn       and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change had a mobile phone in their pocket. Who in the room has a mobile phone with you  Hold it up. Hold your phones up  hold your phones up  Hold it up. An Android  a Blackberry  wow. That's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile phone. But today I will talk about me and my mobile phone  and how it changed my life. And I will talk about this. These are        lines of information. Raw data. And why are these informations there  Because in the summer of       the E.U. Commission tabled a directive. This directive  is  called Data Retention Directive. This directive says that each phone company in Europe  each Internet service company all over Europe  has to store a wide range of information about the users. Who calls whom  Who sends whom an email  Who sends whom a text message  And if you use your mobile phone  where you are. All this information is stored for at least six months  up to two years by your phone company or your Internet service provider. And all over Europe  people stood up and said   We don't want this.  They said  we don't want this data retention. We want self determination in the digital age  and we don't want that phone companies and Internet companies have to store all this information about us. They were lawyers  journalists  priests  they all said   We don't want this.  And here you can see  like    thousands of people went out on the streets of Berlin and said   Freedom  not fear.  And some even said  this would be Stasi  . . Stasi was the secret police in East Germany. And I also ask myself  does it really work  Can they really store all this information about us  Every time I use my mobile phone  So I asked my phone company  Deutsche Telekom  which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany  and I asked them  please  send me all the information you have stored about me. And I asked them once  and I asked them again  and I got no real answer. It was only blah blah answers. But then I said  I want to have this information  because this is my life you are protocoling. So I decided to start a lawsuit against them  because I wanted to have this information. But Deutsche Telekom said  no  we will not give you this information. So at the end  I had a settlement with them. I'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information I ask for. Because in the mean time  the German Constitutional Court ruled that the implementation of this E.U. directive into German law was unconstitutional. So I got this ugly brown envelope with a C.D. inside. And on the C.D.  this was on. Thirty five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information. At first I saw it  and I said  okay  it's a huge file. Okay. But then after a while I realized  this is my life. This is six months of my life  into this file. So I was a little bit skeptical  what should I do with it  Because you can see where I am  where I sleep at night  what I am doing. But then I said  I want to go out with this information. I want to make them public. Because I want to show the people what does data retention mean. So together with Zeit Online and Open Data City  I did this. This is a visualization of six months of my life. You can zoom in and zoom out  you can wind back and fast forward. You can see every step I take. And you can even see how I go from Frankfurt by train to Cologne  and how often I call in between. All this is possible with this information. That's a little bit scary. But it is not only about me. It's about all of us. First  it's only like  I call my wife and she calls me  and we talk to each other a couple of times. And then there are some friends calling me  and they call each other. And after a while you are calling you  and you are calling you  and you have this great communication network. But you can see how your people are communicating with each other  what times they call each other  when they go to bed. You can see all of this. You can see the hubs  like who are the leaders in the group. If you have access to this information  you can see what your society is doing. If you have access to this information  you can control your society. This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran. This is a blueprint how to survey your society  because you know who talks to whom  who sends whom an email  all this is possible if you have access to this information. And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe  up to two years. Like I said at the beginning  imagine that all those people on the streets of Berlin in autumn of      had a mobile phone in their pocket. And the Stasi would have known who took part at this protest  and if the Stasi would have known who are the leaders behind it  this may never have happened. The fall of the Berlin Wall would maybe not  have been  there. And in the aftermath  also not the fall of the Iron Curtain. Because today  state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us  online and offline. They want to have the possibility to track our lives  and they want to store them for all time. But self determination and living in the digital age is no contradiction. But you have to fight for your self determination today. You have to fight for it every day. So  when you go home  tell your friends that privacy is a value of the   st century  and it's not outdated. When you go home  tell your representative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information  they don't have to do it. And if you don't believe me  ask your phone company what information they store about you. So  in the future  every time you use your mobile phone  let it be a reminder to you that you have to fight for self determination in the digital age. Thank you. I'm going to tell you about an affliction I suffer from. And I have a funny feeling that quite a few of you suffer from it as well. When I'm walking around an art gallery  rooms and rooms full of paintings  after about    or    minutes  I realize I'm not thinking about the paintings. I'm not connecting to them. Instead  I'm thinking about that cup of coffee I desperately need to wake me up. I'm suffering from gallery fatigue. How many of you out there suffer from    yes. Ha ha  ha ha  Now  sometimes you might last longer than    minutes  or even shorter  but I think we all suffer from it. And do you have the accompanying guilt  For me  I look at the paintings on the wall and I think  somebody has decided to put them there  thinks they're good enough to be on that wall  but I don't always see it. In fact  most of the time I don't see it. And I leave feeling actually unhappy. I feel guilty and unhappy with myself  rather than thinking there's something wrong with the painting  I think there's something wrong with me. And that's not a good experience  to leave a gallery like that. The thing is  I think we should give ourselves a break. If you think about going into a restaurant  when you look at the menu  are you expected to order every single thing on the menu  No  You select. If you go into a department store to buy a shirt  are you going to try on every single shirt and want every single shirt  Of course not  you can be selective. It's expected. How come  then  it's not so expected to be selective when we go to an art gallery  Why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting  Well I'm trying to take a different approach. And there's two things I do  When I go into a gallery  first of all  I go quite fast  and I look at everything  and I pinpoint the ones that make me slow down for some reason or other. I don't even know why they make me slow down  but something pulls me like a magnet and then I ignore all the others  and I just go to that painting. So it's the first thing I do is  I do my own curation. I choose a painting. It might just be one painting in   . And then the second thing I do is I stand in front of that painting  and I tell myself a story about it. Why a story  Well  I think that we are wired  our DNA tells us to tell stories. We tell stories all the time about everything  and I think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy  chaotic place  and sometimes stories  we're trying to make sense of the world a little bit  trying to bring some order to it. Why not apply that to our looking at paintings  So I now have this sort of restaurant menu visiting of art galleries. There are three paintings I'm going to show you now that are paintings that made me stop in my tracks and want to tell stories about them. The first one needs little introduction     Girl with a Pearl Earring  by Johannes Vermeer    th century Dutch painter. This is the most glorious painting. I first saw it when I was     and I immediately went out and got a poster of it  and in fact I still have that poster.    years later it's hanging in my house. It's accompanied me everywhere I've gone  I never tire of looking at her. What made me stop in my tracks about her to begin with was just the gorgeous colors he uses and the light falling on her face. But I think what's kept me still coming back year after year is another thing  and that is the look on her face  the conflicted look on her face. I can't tell if she's happy or sad  and I change my mind all the time. So that keeps me coming back. One day     years after I had this poster on my wall  I lay in bed and looked at her  and I suddenly thought  I wonder what the painter did to her to make her look like that. And it was the first time I'd ever thought that the expression on her face is actually reflecting how she feels about him. Always before I'd thought of it as a portrait of a girl. Now I began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship. And I thought  well  what is that relationship  So I went to find out. I did some research and discovered  we have no idea who she is. In fact  we don't know who any of the models in any of Vermeer's paintings are  and we know very little about Vermeer himself. Which made me go   Yippee   I can do whatever I want  I can come up with whatever story I want to. So here's how I came up with the story. First of all  I thought  I've got to get her into the house. How does Vermeer know her  Well  there've been suggestions that she is his    year old daughter. The daughter at the time was    when he painted the painting. And I thought  no  it's a very intimate look  but it's not a look a daughter gives her father. For one thing  in Dutch painting of the time  if a woman's mouth was open  it was indicating sexual availability. It would have been inappropriate for Vermeer to paint his daughter like that. So it's not his daughter  but it's somebody close to him  physically close to him. Well  who else would be in the house  A servant  a lovely servant. So  she's in the house. How do we get her into the studio  We don't know very much about Vermeer  but the little bits that we do know  one thing we know is that he married a Catholic woman  they lived with her mother in a house where he had his own room where he    his studio. He also had    children. It would have been a chaotic  noisy household. And if you've seen Vermeer's paintings before  you know that they're incredibly calm and quiet. How does a painter paint such calm  quiet paintings with    kids around  Well  he compartmentalizes his life. He gets to his studio  and he says   Nobody comes in here. Not the wife  not the kids. Okay  the maid can come in and clean.  She's in the studio. He's got her in the studio  they're together. And he decides to paint her. He has her wear very plain clothes. Now  all of the women  or most of the women in Vermeer's other paintings wore velvet  silk  fur  very sumptuous materials. This is very plain  the only thing that isn't plain is her pearl earring. Now  if she's a servant  there is no way she could afford a pair of pearl earrings. So those are not her pearl earrings. Whose are they  We happen to know  there's a list of Catharina  the wife's clothes. Amongst them a yellow coat with white fur  a yellow and black bodice  and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings  different women in the paintings  Vermeer's paintings. So clearly  her clothes were lent to various different women. It's not such a leap of faith to take that that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife. So we've got all the elements for our story. She's in the studio with him for a long time. These paintings took a long time to make. They would have spent the time alone  all that time. She's wearing his wife's pearl earring. She's gorgeous. She obviously loves him. She's conflicted. And does the wife know  Maybe not. And if she doesn't  well    that's the story. The next painting I'm going to talk about is called  Boy Building a House of Cards  by Chardin. He's an   th century French painter best known for his still lifes  but he did occasionally paint people. And in fact  he painted four versions of this painting  different boys building houses of cards  all concentrated. I like this version the best  because some of the boys are older and some are younger  and to me  this one  like Goldilocks's porridge  is just right. He's not quite a child  and he's not quite a man. He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience  and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting. And I looked at his face. It's like a Vermeer painting a bit. The light comes in from the left  his face is bathed in this glowing light. It's right in the center of the painting  and you look at it  and I found that when I was looking at it  I was standing there going   Look at me. Please look at me.  And he didn't look at me. He was still looking at his cards  and that's one of the seductive elements of this painting is  he's so focused on what he's doing that he doesn't look at us. And that is  to me  the sign of a masterpiece  of a painting when there's a lack of resolution. He's never going to look at me. So I was thinking of a story where  if I'm in this position  who could be there looking at him  Not the painter  I don't want to think about the painter. I'm thinking of an older version of himself. He's a man  a servant  an older servant looking at this younger servant  saying   Look at me. I want to warn you about what you're about to go through. Please look at me.  And he never does. And that lack of resolution  the lack of resolution in  Girl with a Pearl Earring     we don't know if she's happy or sad. I've written an entire novel about her  and I still don't know if she's happy or sad. Again and again  back to the painting  looking for the answer  looking for the story to fill in that gap. And we may make a story  and it satisfies us momentarily  but not really  and we come back again and again. The last painting I'm going to talk about is called  Anonymous  by anonymous.  Laughter  This is a Tudor portrait bought by the National Portrait Gallery. They thought it was a man named Sir Thomas Overbury  and then they discovered that it wasn't him  and they have no idea who it is. Now  in the National Portrait Gallery  if you don't know the biography of the painting  it's kind of useless to you. They can't hang it on the wall  because they don't know who he is. So unfortunately  this orphan spends most of his time in storage  along with quite a number of other orphans  some of them some beautiful paintings. This painting made me stop in my tracks for three reasons  One is the disconnection between his mouth that's smiling and his eyes that are wistful. He's not happy  and why isn't he happy  The second thing that really attracted me were his bright red cheeks. He is blushing. He's blushing for his portrait being made  This must be a guy who blushes all the time. What is he thinking about that's making him blush  The third thing that made me stop in my tracks is his absolutely gorgeous doublet. Silk  gray  those beautiful buttons. And you know what it makes me think of  is it's sort of snug and puffy  it's like a duvet spread over a bed. I kept thinking of beds and red cheeks  and of course I kept thinking of sex when I looked at him  and I thought  is that what he's thinking about  And I thought  if I'm going to make a story  what's the last thing I'm going to put in there  Well  what would a Tudor gentleman be preoccupied with  And I thought  well  Henry VIII  okay. He'd be preoccupied with his inheritance  with his heir. Who is going to inherit his name and his fortune  You put all those together  and you've got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back. Now  here's the story. It's short.  Rosy  I am still wearing the white brocade doublet Caroline gave me. It has a plain high collar  detachable sleeves and intricate buttons of twisted silk thread  set close together so that the fit is snug. The doublet makes me think of a coverlet on the vast bed. Perhaps that was the intention. I first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor. I knew even before I stood up to speak that my cheeks were inflamed. I have always flushed easily  from physical exertion  from wine  from high emotion. As a boy  I was teased by my sisters and by schoolboys  but not by George. Only George could call me Rosy. I would not allow anyone else. He managed to make the word tender. When I made the announcement  George did not turn rosy  but went pale as my doublet. He should not have been surprised. It has been a common assumption that I would one day marry his cousin. But it is difficult to hear the words aloud. I know  I could barely utter them. Afterwards  I found George on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden. Despite drinking steadily all afternoon  he was still pale. We stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces.  What do you think of my doublet   I asked. He glanced at me.  That collar looks to be strangling you.   We will still see each other   I insisted.  We can still hunt and play cards and attend court. Nothing need change.  George did not speak.  I am    years old. It is time for me to marry and produce an heir. It is expected of me.  George drained another glass of claret and turned to me.  Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials  James. I'm sure you'll be content together.  He never used my nickname again. Thank you. Thank you. Doc Edgerton inspired us with awe and curiosity with this photo of a bullet piercing through an apple  and exposure just a millionth of a second. But now     years later  we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million or a billion  but one trillion frames per second. I present to you a new type of photography  femto photography  a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion. And with that  we can create cameras that can look around corners  beyond line of sight  or see inside our body without an x ray  and really challenge what we mean by a camera. Now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trillionth of a second    which is several femtoseconds    I'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide. And that packet of photons  that bullet  will travel at the speed of light  and again  a million times faster than an ordinary bullet. Now  if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire into this bottle  how will those photons shatter into this bottle  How does light look in slow motion   Light in Slow Motion ...    Billion x Slow  Now  the whole event    Now remember  the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond    that's how much time it takes for light to travel. But I'm slowing down in this video by a factor of    billion  so you can see the light in motion. But Coca Cola did not sponsor this research. Now  there's a lot going on in this movie  so let me break this down and show you what's going on. So the pulse enters the bottle  our bullet  with a packet of photons that start traveling through and that start scattering inside. Some of the light leaks  goes on the table  and you start seeing these ripples of waves. Many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions. As you can see  there's a bubble of air and it's bouncing around inside. Meanwhile  the ripples are traveling on the table  and because of the reflections at the top  you see at the back of the bottle  after several frames  the reflections are focused. Now  if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video    again  by a factor of    billion    do you know how long you'll have to sit here to watch that movie  A day  a week  Actually  a whole year. It'll be a very boring movie    of a slow  ordinary bullet in motion. And what about some still life photography  You can watch the ripples  again  washing over the table  the tomato and the wall in the back. It's like throwing a stone in a pond of water. I thought  this is how nature paints a photo  one femto frame at a time  but of course our eye sees an integral composite. But if you look at this tomato one more time  you will notice  as the light washes over the tomato  it continues to glow. It doesn't become dark. Why is that  Because the tomato is actually ripe  and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato  and it comes out after several trillionths of a second. So in the future  when this femto camera is in your camera phone  you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it. So how did my team at MIT create this camera  Now  as photographers  you know  if you take a short exposure photo  you get very little light. But we're going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure  so you're going to get hardly any light. So what we do is we send that bullet    that packet of photons    millions of times  and record again and again with very clever synchronization  and from the gigabytes of data  we computationally weave together to create those femto videos I showed you. And we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways. So  Superman can fly. Some other heroes can become invisible. But what about a new power for a future superhero  To see around corners. The idea is that we could shine some light on the door  it's going to bounce  go inside the room  some of that is going to reflect back on the door  and then back to the camera. And we could exploit these multiple bounces of light. And it's not science fiction. We have actually built it. On the left  you see our femto camera. There's a mannequin hidden behind a wall  and we're going to bounce light off the door. So after our paper was published in Nature Communications  it was highlighted by Nature.com  and they created this animation.  A laser pulse is fired  Ramesh Raskar  We're going to fire those bullets of light  and they're going to hit this wall  and because of the packet of the photons  they will scatter in all the directions  and some of them will reach our hidden mannequin  which in turn will again scatter that light  and again in turn  the door will reflect some of that scattered light. And a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera  but most interestingly  they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot. And because we have a camera that can run so fast    our femto camera    it has some unique abilities. It has very good time resolution  and it can look at the world at the speed of light. And this way  we know the distances  of course to the door  but also to the hidden objects  but we don't know which point corresponds to which distance. By shining one laser  we can record one raw photo  which  if you look on the screen  doesn't really make any sense. But then we will take a lot of such pictures  dozens of such pictures  put them together  and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light  and from that  can we see the hidden object  Can we see it in full  D  So this is our reconstruction. Now  we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road  but in the future  we could create cars that avoid collisions with what's around the bend. Or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows. Or we can build endoscopes that can see deep inside the body around occluders  and also for cardioscopes. But of course  because of tissue and blood  this is quite challenging  so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about femto photography as really a new imaging modality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems. Now  like Doc Edgerton  a scientist himself  science became art    an art of ultra fast photography. And I realized that all the gigabytes of data that we're collecting every time  are not just for scientific imaging. But we can also do a new form of computational photography  with time lapse and color coding. And we look at those ripples. Remember  The time between each of those ripples is only a few trillionths of a second. But there's also something funny going on here. When you look at the ripples under the cap  the ripples are moving away from us. The ripples should be moving towards us. What's going on here  It turns out  because we're recording nearly at the speed of light  we have strange effects  and Einstein would have loved to see this picture. The order at which events take place in the world appears in the camera sometimes in reversed order. So by applying the corresponding space and time warp  we can correct for this distortion. So whether it's for photography around corners  or creating the next generation of health imaging  or creating new visualizations  since our invention  we have open sourced all the data and details on our website  and our hope is that the DIY  the creative and the research communities will show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels in cameras    and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging. It's about time. Thank you. As an architect  I often ask myself  what is the origin of the forms that we design  What kind of forms could we design if we wouldn't work with references anymore  If we had no bias  if we had no preconceptions  what kind of forms could we design if we could free ourselves from our experience  If we could free ourselves from our education  What would these unseen forms look like  Would they surprise us  Would they intrigue us  Would they delight us  If so  then how can we go about creating something that is truly new  I propose we look to nature. Nature has been called the greatest architect of forms. And I'm not saying that we should copy nature  I'm not saying we should mimic biology  instead I propose that we can borrow nature's processes. We can abstract them and to create something that is new. Nature's main process of creation  morphogenesis  is the splitting of one cell into two cells. And these cells can either be identical  or they can be distinct from each other through asymmetric cell division. If we abstract this process  and simplify it as much as possible  then we could start with a single sheet of paper  one surface  and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces. We're free to choose where we make the fold. And by doing so  we can differentiate the surfaces. Through this very simple process  we can create an astounding variety of forms. Now  we can take this form and use the same process to generate three dimensional structures  but rather than folding things by hand  we'll bring the structure into the computer  and code it as an algorithm. And in doing so  we can suddenly fold anything. We can fold a million times faster  we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations. And as we're seeking to make something three dimensional  we start not with a single surface  but with a volume. A simple volume  the cube. If we take its surfaces and fold them again and again and again and again  then after    iterations     steps  we end up with         surfaces and a shape that looks  for instance  like this. And if we change where we make the folds  if we change the folding ratio  then this cube turns into this one. We can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape  or this shape. So we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we're making the fold  but essentially you're looking at a folded cube. And we can play with this. We can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions. We can begin to sculpt the form. And because we're doing the folding on the computer  we are completely free of any physical constraints. So that means that surfaces can intersect themselves  they can become impossibly small. We can make folds that we otherwise could not make. Surfaces can become porous. They can stretch. They can tear. And all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce. But in each case  I didn't design the form. I designed the process that generated the form. In general  if we make a small change to the folding ratio  which is what you're seeing here  then the form changes correspondingly. But that's only half of the story      .  percent of the folding ratios produce not this  but this  the geometric equivalent of noise. The forms that I showed before were made actually through very long trial and error. A far more effective way to create forms  I have found  is to use information that is already contained in forms. A very simple form such as this one actually contains a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye. So  for instance  we can plot the length of the edges. White surfaces have long edges  black ones have short ones. We can plot the planarity of the surfaces  their curvature  how radial they are    all information that may not be instantly visible to you  but that we can bring out  that we can articulate  and that we can use to control the folding. So now I'm not specifying a single ratio anymore to fold it  but instead I'm establishing a rule  I'm establishing a link between a property of a surface and how that surface is folded. And because I've designed the process and not the form  I can run the process again and again and again to produce a whole family of forms. These forms look elaborate  but the process is a very minimal one. There is a simple input  it's always a cube that I start with  and it's a very simple operation    it's making a fold  and doing this over and over again. So let's bring this process to architecture. How  And at what scale  I chose to design a column. Columns are architectural archetypes. They've been used throughout history to express ideals about beauty  about technology. A challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column. I started using four cylinders. Through a lot of experimentation  these cylinders eventually evolved into this. And these columns  they have information at very many scales. We can begin to zoom into them. The closer one gets  the more new features one discovers. Some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility. And unlike traditional architecture  it's a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail. These forms are undrawable. An architect who's drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months  or it would take even a year to draw all the sections  all of the elevations  you can only create something like this through an algorithm. The more interesting question  perhaps  is  are these forms imaginable  Usually  an architect can somehow envision the end state of what he is designing. In this case  the process is deterministic. There's no randomness involved at all  but it's not entirely predictable. There's too many surfaces  there's too much detail  one can't see the end state. So this leads to a new role for the architect. One needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities that are out there. For one thing  one can design many variants of a form  in parallel  and one can cultivate them. And to go back to the analogy with nature  one can begin to think in terms of populations  one can talk about permutations  about generations  about crossing and breeding to come up with a design. And the architect is really  he moves into the position of being an orchestrator of all of these processes. But enough of the theory. At one point I simply wanted to jump inside this image  so to say  I bought these red and blue  D glasses  got up very close to the screen  but still that wasn't the same as being able to walk around and touch things. So there was only one possibility    to bring the column out of the computer. There's been a lot of talk now about  D printing. For me  or for my purpose at this moment  there's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff between scale  on the one hand  and resolution and speed  on the other. So instead  we decided to take the column  and we decided to build it as a layered model  made out of very many slices  thinly stacked over each other. What you're looking at here is an X ray of the column that you just saw  viewed from the top. Unbeknownst to me at the time  because we had only seen the outside  the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves  to grow on the inside of the column  which was quite a surprising discovery. From this shape  we calculated a cutting line  and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter to produce    and you're seeing a segment of it here    very many thin slices  individually cut  on top of each other. And this is a photo now  it's not a rendering  and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work  ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer. Almost all of the details  almost all of the surface intricacies were preserved. But it was very labor intensive. There's a huge disconnect at the moment still between the virtual and the physical. It took me several months to design the column  but ultimately it takes the computer about    seconds to calculate all of the    million faces. The physical model  on the other hand  is       layers  one millimeter thick  it weighs     kilos  it's made of sheet that can cover this entire auditorium. And the cutting path that the laser followed goes from here to the airport and back again. But it is increasingly possible. Machines are getting faster  it's getting less expensive  and there's some promising technological developments just on the horizon. These are images from the Gwangju Biennale. And in this case  I used ABS plastic to produce the columns  we used the bigger  faster machine  and they have a steel core inside  so they're structural  they can bear loads for once. Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns. You can see a different column in the mirror  if there's a mirror behind the column that creates a sort of an optical illusion. So where does this leave us  I think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object  but a process to generate objects. I've shown one simple process that was inspired by nature  there's countless other ones. In short  we have no constraints. Instead  we have processes in our hands right now that allow us to create structures at all scales that we couldn't even have dreamt up. And  if I may add  at one point we will build them. Thank you.  Applause  This man is wearing what we call a bee beard.  Laughter  A beard full of bees. Now  this is what many of you might picture when you think about honeybees  maybe insects  or maybe anything that has more legs than two. And let me start by telling you  I gotcha. I understand that. But  there are many things to know  and I want you to open your minds here  keep them open  and change your perspective about honeybees. Notice that this man is not getting stung. He probably has a queen bee tied to his chin  and the other bees are attracted to it. So this really demonstrates our relationship with honeybees  and that goes deep back for thousands of years. We're very co evolved  because we depend on bees for pollination and  even more recently  as an economic commodity. Many of you may have heard that honeybees are disappearing  not just dying  but they're gone. We don't even find dead bodies. This is called colony collapse disorder  and it's bizarre. Researchers around the globe still do not know what's causing it  but what we do know is that  with the declining numbers of bees  the costs of over     fruit and vegetable crops that we rely on for food is going up in price. So honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture. Here you can see some pictures of what are called green roofs  or urban agriculture. We're familiar with the image on the left that shows a local neighborhood garden in the South End. That's where I call home. I have a beehive in the backyard. And perhaps a green roof in the future  when we're further utilizing urban areas  where there are stacks of garden spaces. Check out this image above the orange line in Boston. Try to spot the beehive. It's there. It's on the rooftop  right on the corner there  and it's been there for a couple of years now. The way that urban beekeeping currently operates is that the beehives are quite hidden  and it's not because they need to be. It's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea  and that's why I want you today to try to think about this  think about the benefits of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing. Let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works. So we know flowers  we know fruits and vegetables  even some alfalfa in hay that the livestock for the meats that we eat  rely on pollinators  but you've got male and female parts to a plant here  and basically pollinators are attracted to plants for their nectar  and in the process  a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen  or that male kind of sperm counterpart  along the way  and then travel to different flowers  and eventually an apple  in this case  will be produced. You can see the orientation. The stem is down. The blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it  but that's a basic overview of how pollination works. And let's think about urban living  not today  and not in the past  but what about in a hundred years  What's it gonna look like  We have huge grand challenges these days of habitat loss. We have more and more people  billions of people  in     years  God knows how many people  and how little space there will be to fit all of them  so we need to change the way that we see cities  and looking at this picture on the left of New York City today  you can see how gray and brown it is. We have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back into the atmosphere  contributing to global climate change  no doubt. What about in     years  if we have green rooftops everywhere  and gardening  and we create our own crops right in the cities  We save on the costs of transportation  we save on a healthier diet  and we also educate and create new jobs locally. We need bees for the future of our cities and urban living. Here's some data that we collected through our company with Best Bees  where we deliver  install and manage honeybee hives for anybody who wants them  in the city  in the countryside  and we introduce honeybees  and the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop or fire escape  for even that matter  and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is. There's a counterintuitive trend that we noticed in these numbers. So let's look at the first metric here  overwintering survival. Now this has been a huge problem for many years  basically since the late     s  when the varroa mite came and brought many different viruses  bacteria and fungal diseases with it. Overwintering success is hard  and that's when most of the colonies are lost  and we found that in the cities  bees are surviving better than they are in the country. A bit counterintuitive  right  We think  oh  bees  countryside  agriculture  but that's not what the bees are showing. The bees like it in the city.  Laughter  Furthermore  they also produce more honey. The urban honey is delicious. The bees in Boston on the rooftop of the Seaport Hotel  where we have hundreds of thousands of bees flying overheard right now that I'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by  are going to all of the local community gardens and making delicious  healthy honey that just tastes like the flowers in our city. So the yield for urban hives  in terms of honey production  is higher as well as the overwintering survival  compared to rural areas. Again  a bit counterintuitive. And looking back historically at the timeline of honeybee health  we can go back to the year     and see that there was also a great mortality of bees in Ireland. So the problems of bees today isn't necessarily something new. It has been happening since over a thousand years ago  but what we don't really notice are these problems in cities. So one thing I want to encourage you to think about is the idea of what an urban island is. You think in the city maybe the temperature's warmer. Why are bees doing better in the city  This is a big question now to help us understand why they should be in the city. Perhaps there's more pollen in the city. With the trains coming in to urban hubs  they can carry pollen with them  very light pollen  and it's just a big supermarket in the city. A lot of linden trees live along the railroad tracks. Perhaps there are fewer pesticides in the cities than there are in  rural  areas. Perhaps there are other things that we're just not thinking about yet  but that's one idea to think about  urban islands. And colony collapse disorder is not the only thing affecting honeybees. Honeybees are dying  and it's a huge  huge grand challenge of our time. What you can see up here is a map of the world  and we're tracking the spread of this varroa mite. Now  the varroa mite is what changed the game in beekeeping  and you can see  at the top right  the years are changing  we're coming up to modern times  and you can see the spread of the varroa mite from the early     s through now. It's       and we're pretty much covering Asia.       we saw it spread to Europe and South America  and then  when we get to the     s  and specifically to       the varroa mite finally came to North America and to the United States  and that is when the game changed for honeybees in the United States. Many of us will remember our childhood growing up  maybe you got stung by a bee  you saw bees on flowers. Think of the kids today. Their childhood's a bit different. They don't experience this. The bees just aren't around anymore. So we need bees and they're disappearing and it's a big problem. What can we do here  So  what I do is honeybee research. I got my Ph.D. studying honeybee health. I started in      studying honeybees. In       honeybees started disappearing  so suddenly  like  this little nerd kid going to school working with bugs    Laughter    became very relevant in the world. And it worked out that way. So my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier. I don't research what's killing the bees  per se. I'm not one of the many researchers around the world who's looking at the effects of pesticides or diseases or habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees. We're looking at ways to make bees healthier through vaccines  through yogurt  like probiotics  and other types of therapies in ways that can be fed orally to bees  and this process is so easy  even a   year old can do it. You just mix up some pollen  sugar and water  and whatever active ingredient you want to put in  and you just give it right to the bees. No chemicals involved  just immune boosters. Humans think about our own health in a prospective way. We exercise  we eat healthy  we take vitamins. Why don't we think about honeybees in that same type of way  Bring them to areas where they're thriving and try to make them healthier before they get sick. I spent many years in grad school trying to poke bees and do vaccines with needles.  Laughter  Like  years  years at the bench   Oh my gosh  it's   a.m. and I'm still pricking bees.   Laughter  And then one day I said   Why don't we just do an oral vaccine   It's like   Ugh   so that's what we do.  Laughter  I'd love to share with you some images of urban beehives  because they can be anything. I mean  really open your mind with this. You can paint a hive to match your home. You can hide a hive inside your home. These are three hives on the rooftop of the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel  and they're beautiful here. I mean  we matched the new color of the inside of their rooms to do some type of a stained wood with blue for their sheets  and these bees are terrific  and they also will use herbs that are growing in the garden. That's what the chefs go to to use for their cooking  and the honey    they do live events    they'll use that honey at their bars. Honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar because there are different types of sugars in there. We also have a classroom hives project  where    this is a nonprofit venture    we're spreading the word around the world for how honeybee hives can be taken into the classroom or into the museum setting  behind glass  and used as an educational tool. This hive that you see here has been in Fenway High School for many years now. The bees fly right into the outfield of Fenway Park. Nobody notices it. If you're not a flower  these bees do not care about you.  Laughter  They don't. They don't. They'll say   S'cuse me  flying around.   Laughter  Some other images here in telling a part of the story that really made urban beekeeping terrific is in New York City  beekeeping was illegal until     . That's a big problem  because what's going to pollinate all of the gardens and the produce locally  Hands  I mean  locally in Boston  there is a terrific company called Green City Growers  and they are going and pollinating their squash crops by hand with Q Tips  and if they miss that three day window  there's no fruit. Their clients aren't happy  and people go hungry. So this is important. We have also some images of honey from Brooklyn. Now  this was a mystery in the New York Times where the honey was very red  and the New York State forensics department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dye with that found in a maraschino cherry factory down the street.  Laughter  So you can tailor your honey to taste however you want by planting bee friendly flowers. Paris has been a terrific model for urban beekeeping. They've had hives on the rooftop of their opera house for many years now  and that's what really got people started  thinking   Wow  we can do this  and we should do this.  Also in London  and in Europe across the board  they're very advanced in their use of green rooftops and integrating beehives  and I'll show you an ending note here. I would like to encourage you to open your mind. What can you do to save the bees or to help them or to think of sustainable cities in the future  Well  really  just change your perspective. Try to understand that bees are very important. A bee isn't going to sting you if you see it. The bee dies. Honeybees die when they sting  so they don't want to do it either.  Laughter  It's nothing to panic about. They're all over the city. You could even get your own hive if you want. There are great resources available  and there are even companies that will help get you set up and mentor you and it's important for our educational system in the world for students to learn about agriculture worldwide such as this little girl  who  again  is not even getting stung. Thank you.  Applause  In the past several days  I heard people talking about China. And also  I talked to friends about China and Chinese Internet. Something is very challenging to me. I want to make my friends understand  China is complicated. So I always want to tell the story  like  one hand it is that  the other hand is that. You can't just tell a one sided story. I'll give an example. China is a BRIC country. BRIC country means Brazil  Russia  India and China. This emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy. But at the same time  on the other hand  China is a SICK country  the terminology coined by Facebook IPO papers    file. He said the SICK country means Syria  Iran  China and North Korea. The four countries have no access to Facebook. So basically  China is a SICK BRIC country. Another project was built up to watch China and Chinese Internet. And now  today I want to tell you my personal observation in the past several years  from that wall. So  if you are a fan of the Game of Thrones  you definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom. It prevents weird things from the north. Same was true for China. In the north  there was a great wall  Chang Cheng. It protected China from invaders for       years. But China also has a great firewall. That's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world. It's not only to defend the Chinese regime from overseas  from the universal values  but also to prevent China's own citizens to access the global free Internet  and even separate themselves into blocks  not united. So  basically the  Internet  has two Internets. One is the Internet  the other is the Chinanet. But if you think the Chinanet is something like a deadland  wasteland  I think it's wrong. But we also use a very simple metaphor  the cat and the mouse game  to describe in the past    years the continuing fight between Chinese censorship  government censorship  the cat  and the Chinese Internet users. That means us  the mouse. But sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple. So today I want to upgrade it to  .  version. In China  we have     million Internet users. That's the biggest population of Netizens  Internet users  in the whole world. So even though China's is a totally censored Internet  but still  Chinese Internet society is really booming. How to make it  It's simple. You have Google  we have Baidu. You have Twitter  we have Weibo. You have Facebook  we have Renren. You have YouTube  we have Youku and Tudou. The Chinese government blocked every single international Web  .  service  and we Chinese copycat every one. So  that's the kind of the thing I call smart censorship. That's not only to censor you. Sometimes this Chinese national Internet policy is very simple  Block and clone. On the one hand  he wants to satisfy people's need of a social network  which is very important  people really love social networking. But on the other hand  they want to keep the server in Beijing so they can access the data any time they want. That's also the reason Google was pulled out from China  because they can't accept the fact that Chinese government wants to keep the server. Sometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands. For example  Mubarak  he shut down the Internet. He wanted to prevent the Netizens  from criticizing  him. But once Netizens can't go online  they go in the street. And now the result is very simple. We all know Mubarak is technically dead. But also  Ben Ali  Tunisian president  didn't follow the second rule. That means keep the server in your hands. He allowed Facebook  a U.S. based service  to continue to stay on inside of Tunisia. So he can't prevent it  his own citizens to post critical videos against his corruption. The same thing happend. He was the first to topple during the Arab Spring. But those two very smart international censorship policies didn't prevent Chinese social media  from  becoming a really public sphere  a pathway of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials. Because we have     million microbloggers in China. It's the entire population of the United States. So when these     million people  microbloggers  even they block the tweet in our censored platform. But itself    the Chinanet    but itself can create very powerful energy  which has never happened in the Chinese history.       in July  two  unclear  trains crashed  in Wenzhou  a southern city. Right after the train crash  authorities literally wanted to cover up the train  bury the train. So it angered the Chinese Netizens. The first five days after the train crash  there were    million criticisms of the posting on social media  which never happened in Chinese history. And later this year  the rail minister was sacked and sentenced to jail for    years. And also  recently  very funny debate between the Beijing Environment Ministry and the American Embassy in Beijing because the Ministry blamed the American Embassy for intervening in Chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of Beijing. So  the up is the Embassy data  the PM  . . He showed      they showed it's dangerous for the sensitive group. So a suggestion  it's not good to go outside. But that is the Ministry's data. He shows   . He says it's good. It's good to go outside. But    percent of Chinese microbloggers stand firmly on the Embassy's side. I live in Beijing. Every day  I just watch the American Embassy's data to decide whether I should open my window. Why is Chinese social networking  even within the censorship  so booming  Part of the reason is Chinese languages. You know  Twitter and Twitter clones have a kind of a limitation of     characters. But in English it's    words or a sentence with a short link. Maybe in Germany  in German language  it may be just  Aha   But in Chinese language  it's really about     characters  means a paragraph  a story. You can almost have all the journalistic elements there. For example  this is Hamlet  of Shakespeare. It's the same content. One  you can see exactly one Chinese tweet is equal to  .  English tweets. Chinese is always cheating  right  So because of this  the Chinese really regard this microblogging as a media  not only a headline to media. And also  the clone  Sina company is the guy who cloned Twitter. It even has its own name  with Weibo.  Weibo  is the Chinese translation for  microblog . It has its own innovation. At the commenting area   it makes  the Chinese Weibo more like Facebook  rather than the original Twitter. So these innovations and clones  as the Weibo and microblogging  when it came to China in       it immediately became a media platform itself. It became the media platform of     million readers. It became the media. Anything not mentioned in Weibo  it does not appear to exist for the Chinese public. But also  Chinese social media is really changing Chinese mindsets and Chinese life. For example  they give the voiceless people a channel to make your voice heard. We had a petition system. It's a remedy outside the judicial system  because the Chinese central government wants to keep a myth  The emperor is good. The old local officials are thugs. So that's why the petitioner  the victims  the peasants  want to take the train to Beijing to petition to the central government  they want the emperor to settle the problem. But when more and more people go to Beijing  they also cause the risk of a revolution. So they send them back in recent years. And even some of them were put into black jails. But now we have Weibo  so I call it the Weibo petition. People just use their cell phones to tweet. So your sad stories  by some chance your story will be picked up by reporters  professors or celebrities. One of them is Yao Chen  she is the most popular microblogger in China  who has about    million followers. They're almost like a national TV station. If you    so a sad story will be picked up by her. So this Weibo social media  even in the censorship  still gave the Chinese a real chance for     million people every day chatting together  talking together. It's like a big TED  right  But also  it is like the first time a public sphere happened in China. Chinese people start to learn how to negotiate and talk to people. But also  the cat  the censorship  is not sleeping. It's so hard to post some sensitive words on the Chinese Weibo. For example  you can't post the name of the president  Hu Jintao  and also you can't post the city of Chongqing  the name  and until recently  you can't search the surname of top leaders. So  the Chinese are very good at these puns and alternative wording and even memes. They even name themselves    you know  use the name of this world changing battle between the grass mud horse and the river crab. The grass mud horse is caon ma  is the phonogram for motherfucker  the Netizens call themselves. River crab is h xi   is the phonogram for harmonization  for censorship. So that's kind of a caon ma versus the h xi   that's very good. So  when some very political  exciting moments happened  you can see on Weibo  you see a lot of very weird stories happened. Weird phrases and words  even if you have a PhD of Chinese language  you can't understand them. But you can't even expand more  no  because Chinese Sina Weibo  when it was founded was exactly one month after the official blocking of Twitter.com. That means from the very beginning  Weibo has already convinced the Chinese government  we will not become the stage for any kind of a threat to the regime. For example  anything you want to post  like  get together  or  meet up  or  walk   it is automatically recorded and data mined and reported to a poll for further political analyzing. Even if you want to have some gathering  before you go there  the police are already waiting for you. Why  Because they have the data. They have everything in their hands. So they can use the      scenario data mining of the dissident. So the crackdown is very serious. But I want you to notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat and mouse. The cat is the censorship  but Chinese is not only one cat  but also has local cats. Central cat and local cats. You know  the server is in the  central  cats' hands  so even that    when the Netizens criticize the local government  the local government has not any access to the data in Beijing. Without bribing the central cats  he can do nothing  only apologize. So these three years  in the past three years  social movements about microblogging really changed local government  became more and more transparent  because they can't access the data. The server is in Beijing. The story about the train crash  maybe the question is not about why    million criticisms in five days  but why the Chinese central government allowed the five days of freedom of speech online. It's never happened before. And so it's very simple  because even the top leaders were fed up with this guy  this independent kingdom. So they want an excuse    public opinion is a very good excuse to punish him. But also  the Bo Xilai case recently  very big news  he's a princeling. But from February to April this year  Weibo really became a marketplace of rumors. You can almost joke everything about these princelings  everything  It's almost like you're living in the United States. But if you dare to retweet or mention any fake coup about Beijing  you definitely will be arrested. So this kind of freedom is a targeted and precise window. So Chinese in China  censorship is normal. Something you find is  freedom is weird. Something will happen behind it. Because he was a very popular Leftist leader  so the central government wanted to purge him  and he was very cute  he convinced all the Chinese people  why he is so bad. So Weibo  the     million public sphere  became a very good  convenient tool for a political fight. But this technology is very new  but technically is very old. It was made famous by Chairman Mao  Mao Zedong  because he mobilized millions of Chinese people in the Cultural Revolution to destroy every local government. It's very simple  because Chinese central government doesn't need to even lead the public opinion. They just give them a target window to not censor people. Not censoring in China has become a political tool. So that's the update about this game  cat and mouse. Social media changed Chinese mindset. More and more Chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech and human rights as their birthright  not some imported American privilege. But also  it gave the Chinese a national public sphere for people to  it's like a training of their citizenship  preparing for future democracy. But it didn't change the Chinese political system  and also the Chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen its power to counter the local government and the different factions. So  what's the future  After all  we are the mouse. Whatever the future is  we should fight against the  cat . There is not only in China  but also in the United States there are some very small  cute but bad cats. SOPA  PIPA  ACTA  TPP and ITU. And also  like Facebook and Google  they claim they are friends of the mouse  but sometimes we see them dating the cats. So my conclusion is very simple. We Chinese fight for our freedom  you just watch your bad cats. Don't let them hook  up  with the Chinese cats. Only in this way  in the future  we will achieve the dreams of the mouse  that we can tweet anytime  anywhere  without fear. Thank you. Good afternoon. I am not a farmer. I'm not. I'm a parent  I'm a resident and I'm a teacher. And this is my world. And along the way I've started noticing    I'm on my third generation of kids    that they're getting bigger. They're getting sicker. In addition to these complexities  I just learned that    percent of the kids that I see who are labeled learning disabled would not have been had they had proper prenatal nutrition. The realities of my community are simple. They look like this. Kids should not have to grow up and look at things like this. And as jobs continue to leave my community  and energy continues to come in  be exported in  it's no wonder that really some people refer to the South Bronx as a desert. But I'm the oldest sixth grader you'll ever meet  so I get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm that I'm hoping to share with you all today. And with that note  I come to you with this belief that kids should not have to leave their communities to live  learn and earn in a better one. So I'm here to tell you a story about me and this wall that I met outside  which I'm now bringing inside. And it starts with three people. The crazy teacher    that's me on the left  I dress up pretty  thank you  my wife  I love you for getting a good suit    my passionate borough president and a guy named George Irwin from Green Living Technologies who helped me with my class and helped me get involved with this patented technology. But it all starts with seeds in classrooms  in my place  which looks like this. And I'm here today hoping that my reach will exceed my grasp. And that's really what this is all about. And it starts with incredible kids like this  who come early and stay late. All of my kids are either IEP or ELL learners  most come with a lot of handicaps  most are homeless and many are in foster care. Almost all of my kids live below poverty. But with those seeds  from day one  we are growing in my classroom  and this is what it looks like in my classroom. And you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds. And then you notice that those seeds become farms across the Bronx that look like this. But again  I am not a farmer. I'm a teacher. And I don't like weeding  and I don't like back breaking labor. So I wanted to figure out how I could get this kind of success into something small  like this  and bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it  kids who didn't want to be outside could do it  and everyone could have access. So I called George Irwin  and what do you know  He came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall. And what we do is we partner it with authentic learning experiences  private based learning. And lo and behold  we gave birth to the first edible wall in New York City. So if you're hungry  get up and eat. You can do it right now. My kids play cow all the time. Okay  But we were just getting started  the kids loved the technology  so we called up George and we said   We gotta learn more   Now  Mayor Bloomberg  thank you very much  we no longer need work permits  which comes with slices and bonded contractors    we're available for you    We decided to go to Boston. And my kids  from the poorest congressional district in America  became the first to install a green wall  designed by a computer  with real live learning tools     stories up    if you're going to go visit it  it's on top of the John Hancock building. But closer to home  we started installing these walls in schools that look like this with lighting like that  real LED stuff    st century technology. And what do you know  We made   st century money  and that was groundbreaking. Wow  This is my harvest  people. And what do you do with this food  You cook it  And those are my heirloom students making heirloom sauce  with plastic forks  and we get it into the cafeteria  and we grow stuff and we feed our teachers. And that is the youngest nationally certified workforce in America with our Bronx Borough President. And what'd we do then  Well  I met nice people like you  and they invited us to the Hamptons. So I call this  from South Bronx to Southampton.  And we started putting in roofs that look like this  and we came in from destitute neighborhoods to start building landscape like this  wow  People noticed. And so we got invited back this past summer  and we actually moved into the Hamptons  payed       dollars a week for a house  and we learned how to surf. And when you can do stuff like this    These are my kids putting in this technology  and when you can build a roof that looks like that on a house that looks like that with sedum that looks like this  this is the new green graffiti. So  you may wonder what does a wall like this really do for kids  besides changing landscapes and mindsets  Okay  I'm going to tell you what it does. It gets me to meet incredible contractors like this  Jim Ellenberger from Ellenberger Services. And this is where it becomes true triple bottom line. Because Jim realized that these kids  my future farmers  really had the skills he needed to build affordable housing for New Yorkers  right in their own neighborhood. And this is what my kids are doing  making living wage. Now  if you're like me  you live in a building  there are seven guys out of work looking to manage a million dollars. I don't have it. But if you need a toilet fixed or  you know  some shelving  I gotta wait six months for an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me. That's the beauty of this economy. But my kids are now licensed and bonded in trade. And that's my first student to open up  the first in his family to have a bank account. This immigrant student is the first one in his family to use an ATM. And this is the true triple bottom line  because we can take neighborhoods that were abandoned and destitute and turn them into something like this with interiors like this. Wow  People noticed. And notice they did. So CNN called  and we were delighted to have them come to our farmer's market. And then when Rockefeller Center said  NBC  could you put this thing up on the walls  We were delighted. But this  I show you  when kids from the poorest congressional district in America can build a    foot by    foot wall  design it  plant it and install it in the heart of New York City  that's a true  s  se puede  moment. Really scholastic  if you ask me. But this is not a Getty image. That's a picture I took of my Bronx Borough President  addressing my kids in his house  not the jailhouse  making them feel a part of it. That's our State Senator Gustavo Rivera and Bob Bieder  coming to my classroom to make my kids feel important. And when the Bronx Borough President shows up and the State Senator comes to our class  believe you me  the Bronx can change attitudes now. We are poised  ready  willing and able to export our talent and diversity in ways we've never even imagined. And when the local senator gets on the scale in public and says he's got to lose weight  so do I  And I tell you what  I'm doing it and so are the kids. Okay  And then celebrities started. Produce Pete can't believe what we grow. Lorna Sass came and donated books. Okay  We're feeding seniors. And when we realized that we were growing for food justice in the South Bronx  so did the international community. And my kids in the South Bronx were repped in the first international green roof conference. And that's just great. Except what about locally  Well  we met this woman  Avis Richards  with the Ground Up Campaign. Unbelievable  Through her  my kids  the most disenfranchised and marginalized  were able to roll out     gardens to New York City public schools. That's triple bottom line  Okay  A year ago today  I was invited to the New York Academy of Medicine. I thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy New York made sense  especially when the resources were free. So thank you all and I love them. They introduced me to the New York City Strategic Alliance for Health  again  free resources  don't waste them. And what do you know  Six months later  my school and my kids were awarded the first ever high school award of excellence for creating a healthy school environment. The greenest class in New York City. But more importantly is my kids learned to get  they learned to give. And we took the money that we made from our farmer's market  and started buying gifts for the homeless and for needy around the world. So we started giving back. And that's when I realized that the greening of America starts first with the pockets  then with the heart and then with the mind. So we were onto something  and we're still onto something. And thank God Trinity Wall Street noticed  because they gave us the birth of Green Bronx Machine. We're       strong right now. And what does it really do  It teaches kids to re vision their communities  so when they grow up in places like this  they can imagine it like this. And my kids  trained and certified    Ma  you get the tax abatement. Thank you  Mayor Bloomberg    can take communities that look like this and convert them into things that look like that  and that to me  people  is another true  s  se puede  moment. Now  how does it start  It starts in schools. No more little Knicks and little Nets. Group by broccoli  group by your favorite vegetable  something you can aspire to. Okay  And these are my future farmers of America  growing up in Brook Park on    st Street  the most migrant community in America. When tenacious little ones learn how to garden like this  it's no wonder we get fruit like that. And I love it  And so do they. And we're building teepees in neighborhoods that were burning down. And that's a true  s  se puede  moment. And again  Brook Park feeds hundreds of people without a food stamp or a fingerprint. The poorest congressional district in America  the most migratory community in America  we can do this. Bissel Gardens is cranking out food in epic proportions  moving kids into an economy they never imagined. Now  somewhere over the rainbow  my friends  is the South Bronx of America. And we're doing it. How does it start  Well  look at Jose's attention to detail. Thank God Omar knows that carrots come from the ground  and not aisle   at the supermarket or through a bullet proof window or through a piece of styrofoam. And when Henry knows that green is good  so do I. And when you expand their palates  you expand their vocabulary. And most importantly  when you put big kids together with little kids  you get the big fat white guy out of the middle  which is cool  and you create this kind of accountability amongst peers  which is incredible. God  I'm going to run out of time  so I've gotta keep it moving. But this is my weekly paycheck for kids  that's our green graffiti. This is what we're doing. And behold the glory and bounty that is Bronx County. Nothing thrills me more than to see kids pollinating plants instead of each other. I gotta tell you  I'm a protective parent. But those kids are the kids who are now putting pumpkin patches on top of trains. We're also designing coin ponds for the rich and affluent. We're also becoming children of the corn  creating farms in the middle of Fordham Road for awareness and window bottles out of garbage. Now I don't expect every kid to be a farmer  but I expect you to read about it  write about it  blog about it  offer outstanding customer service. I expect them to be engaged  and man  are they  So that's my incredible classroom  that's the food. Where does it go  Zero miles to plate  right down into the cafeteria. Or more importantly  to local shelters  where most of our kids are getting one to two meals a day. And we're stepping it up. No Air Jordans were ever ruined on my farm. And in his day  a million dollar gardens and incredible installations. Let me tell you something  people. This is a beautiful moment. Black field  brown field  toxic waste field  battlefield    we're proving in the Bronx that you can grow anywhere  on cement. And we take orders for flowers. I'm putting the bake sale to shame. We take orders now. I'm booking for the spring. And these were all grown from seeds. We're learning everything. And again  when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse as this to do something as special as this  we're really creating a moment. Now  you may ask about these kids. Forty percent attendance to    percent attendance. All start overage and under credit. They are now  my first cohort is all in college  earning a living wage. The rest are scheduled to graduate this June. Happy kids  happy families  happy colleagues. Amazed people. The glory and bounty that is Bronx County. Let's talk about mint. Where is my mint  I grow seven kinds of mint in my class. Mojitos  anybody  I'll be at Telepan later. But  understand this is my intellectual Viagra. Ladies and gentlemen  I gotta move quick  but understand this  The borough that gave us baggy pants and funky fresh beats is becoming home to the organic ones. My green  unclear         pounds of vegetables  I'm growing organic citizens  engaged kids. So help us go from this to this. Self sustaining entities     months return on investment  plus we're paying people living wage and health benefits  while feeding people for pennies on the dollar. Martin Luther King said that people need to be uplifted with dignity. So here in New York  I urge you  my fellow Americans  to help us make America great again. It's simple. Share your passion. It's real easy. Go see these two videos  please. One got us invited to the White House  one's a recent incarnation. And most importantly  get the biggest bully out of schools. This has got to go tomorrow. People  you can all do that. Keep kids out of stores that look like this. Make them a healthy plate  especially if you can pick it off the wall in your own classroom    delicioso  Model good behavior. Get them to a green cart. Big kids love strawberries and bananas. Teach them entrepreneurship. Thank God for GrowNYC. Let them cook. Great lunch today  let them do culinary things. But most importantly  just love them. Nothing works like unconditional love. So  my good friend Kermit said it's not easy being green. It's not. I come from a place where kids can buy    flavors of blunt wrap at any day of the moment  where ice cream freezers are filled with slushy malt liquor. Okay  My dear friend Majora Carter once told me  we have everything to gain and nothing to lose. So here  and at a time when we've gone from the audacity to hope to hope for some audacity  I urge you to do something. I urge you to do something. Right now  we're all tadpoles  but I urge you to become a big frog and take that big  green leap. I don't care if you're on the left  on the right  up the middle  wherever. Join me. Use    I've got a lot of energy. Help me use it. We can do something here. And along the way  please take time to smell the flowers  especially if you and your students grew them. I'm Steve Ritz  this is Green Bronx Machine. I've got to say thank you to my wife and family  for my kids  thank you for coming every day  and for my colleagues  believing and supporting me. We are growing our way into a new economy. Thank you  God bless you and enjoy the day. I'm Steve Ritz. S  se puede
