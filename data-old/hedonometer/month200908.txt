There's an old saying   Just because you can't see something  doesn't mean it's not there.  My work is    it's a reflection of myself. What I wanted to do is to show the world that the little things can be the biggest things. We all seem to think that  you know  if we look down on the ground  there's nothing there. And we use the word  nothing.  Nothing doesn't exist  because there is always something. My mother told me that  when I was a child  that I should always respect the little things. What made me do this work  I shall go into my story. This all started when I was age five. What made me do it  At school  I will admit this  academically  I couldn't express myself. So I was  more or less  classed as  nothing.  My world was seen as less. So I decided I didn't really want to be a part of that world. I thought  I need to retreat into something else. So when my mother used to take me to school  she thought I was at school  and I used to do a U turn  when her back was turned  and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden. Now  the one time I was in the shed  and my mother suspected something  thinking I was at school. My mother was like the woman in Tom and Jerry. So you'd just see her feet. So I was hiding in the shed  like that. And all of a sudden ... And then I saw her legs. And then she said    grabbed me like that  because my mother was quite big    and she lifted me up and she says   How come you're not at school   I told her I couldn't face it because the way the teacher was treating me  ridiculing me  and using me as an example of failure. So I told her. At that age  obviously  I couldn't express it that way  but I told her I didn't feel right. And then she just said   You're going back to school tomorrow.  And walked off. And I didn't expect that  because I expected one of these ... But I didn't get it. So I'm sitting there thinking. And as I looked down on the ground  I noticed there was some ants running around. And I went into this little fantasy world. And I thought   These ants  are they looking for the queen ant  Or do they need somewhere to live   So I thought  Perhaps  if I made these ants some apartments  they'll move in.  So I did. And how I set about that  I got some splinters of wood. And I sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass  constructed this little apartment. Well it looked like a little shanty shed when I'd finished. But I thought  perhaps the ant won't know  it'll probably move in. And so they did. That was a bit crude  at the time. And I made all these little apartments and little merry go rounds  seesaws and swings  little ladders. And then I encouraged the ants to come 'round by putting sugar and things like that. And then I sat down and all the ants came along. And all I could hear was  Is this for us   And I say   Yes  they're all for you.  And they moved in  and decided not to pay me any rent. And from there I was watching this little world. It became part of me. When I discovered that I had this gift  I wanted to experiment with this world that we can't see. So I realized that there was more to life than just everything that we see around us that's huge. So I started to educate myself on this molecular level. And as I got older  I continued. I showed my mother. My mother told me to take it smaller. Now I shall show you something here. And I'll explain. As you can see  that's a pinhead. Now that is called the Huf Haus. The gentleman who commissioned me to do this was a gentleman called Peter Huf. And he says to me  Willard  can you put my house on a pinhead   So I say   How are you going to fit in there   And then he said to me   I don't believe you can do it. Can you really do it   And I says   Well  try me.  And then he said   But I don't believe that you can do this.  So I said   OK.  So  to cut a long story short  I went home  went underneath the microscope  and I crushed up a piece of glass  crushed it up. And underneath the microscope there were splinters of glass. Some of them were quite jagged. So I was crushing up these pieces of glass  which  as you can see  that's the actual frame of the house. And the actual roof is made up of a fiber  which I found in my sister's old teddy bear. So I got the teddy bear and I said   Do you mind if I pull out one of your fibers   So I did. And I looked at it beneath the microscope. And some of it was flat. So I decided to slice these up with the tool that I make by    I sharpen the end of a needle into a blade. And then I actually slow down my whole nervous system. And then I work between my heartbeat  I have one and a half seconds to actually move. And at the same time I have to watch I don't inhale my own work  at the same time. Because that has happened to me. So what I did  like I said  come back to the glass. I found these little bits of glass. And I had to make them square. So I'm thinking  How can I do this   So what I did  I got an oilstone. Broke the edge of an oilstone off. And what I did  I took pieces of glass. And I started to rub them. I used a little tweezer which I made from a hair clip. And I built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn't crush the glass. And then I started rubbing  very very gently  till some of the edges were quite square. And then I constructed it. And how I constructed it  is by making grooves in the top of the pinhead. And then pushing the glass in with its own friction. And as I was doing it  what happened  The instrument that I used turned into a catapult. And it went like this ... And then that was it. Gone. So I'm thinking   Mr. Huf isn't going to be very happy when I told him his house has gone to another  into the atmosphere somewhere.  So to cut the story short  I decided that I had to go back and do it. So I found some more. And I decided to  sort of  construct it very  very slowly  holding my breath  working between my heartbeat  and making sure everything is leveled. Because it's such a small sculpture  nothing can go wrong. And I decided to build it up. Then I used fibers out of my jumper  which I held and stretched. And made the beams going around the house. And the actual windows and the balcony had to be sort of constructed. I used a money spider's web to actually attach certain things  which sent me insane. But I managed to do it. And when I finished it  I came back the next day. I noticed that the house was occupied. Have we ever heard of a dust mite  Darren dust mite and his family moved in. So basically I'd completed the house. And there you are. Right. As you can see  Bart Simpson is having a little argument. I think they're arguing about the space on the pin. There's not enough room for the two of them. So I didn't think he was going to throw Bart off. I think he was just warning him actually. But this one was made out of a nylon tag out of my shirt. What I did  I plucked the tag out and put it underneath the microscope. I used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end. Can anybody see the blade on the end of that needle  Audience  No. WW  So what I did is the same process where I just kind of hold my breath and just work away very  very slowly  manipulating the plastic  cutting it  because it behaves different. Whenever you work on that level  things behave different. Because it's on this molecular level things change and they act different. And sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air. And  you know  all different things happen. But I had to make a little barrier  going around it  out of cellophane  to stop it moving. Then static electricity set in. And it went ... And I'm trying to remove it. And the static is interfering with everything. So there is sweat dripping off my head  because I have to carve Homer Simpson like that  in that position. And after I've cut out the shape  then I have to make sure that there is room for Bart's neck. So after I've done the same thing  then I have to paint it. And after I've actually sculpted them  I have to paint them. I experimented with a    I found a dead fly. And I plucked the hair off the fly's head. Decided to make a paintbrush. But I would never do it to a living fly. Because I've heard a fly in pain. And they go  Meow  Ow   Even though they get on our nerves  I would never kill an insect because   All creatures great and small     there is a hymn that says that. So what I decided to do is to pluck fine hair out of my face. And I looked at it underneath the microscope. That was the paintbrush. And whilst I'm painting I have to be very careful  because the paint starts to turn into little blobs. And it starts to dry very quickly. So I have to be very quick. If I'm not  it will end up looking not like what it's supposed to look like. It could end up looking like Humpty Dumpty or somebody else. So I have to be very very careful. This one took me approximately  I would say  six to seven weeks. My work  rough estimate  sometimes five  six to seven weeks  you can't always anticipate. As you can see  that's Charlton Heston brought down to size. He says to me   Willard     You can see him saying   Why me   I says   I enjoyed your film. That's why.  As you can see  there's an aphid fly there. That's just to show the scale and the actual size of the sculpture. I would say it probably measures ... a quarter of a millimeter. In America they say a period stop. So say if you cut a period stop in half  a full stop  that's about the size of the whole thing. It's made    the chariot is made of gold. And Charlton Heston is made of a floating fiber  which I took out of the air. When the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers. And what I normally do is walk 'round a room    trying to find one. And then I put it underneath the microscope. I remember one time I was doing it  and the window was open. And there was a lady standing by the bus stop. And she saw me walking around like this. And then she looked at me. And then I went ... And then she went   Hmm  OK  he's not mad.  Yeah  to actually do this thing    the actual chariot is made of gold. I had a    karat gold ring. And I cut off a little flake of gold. And I bent it 'round  and made it into the chariot. And the horse is made from nylon. And the spider's web is for the reins on the horse. To get the symmetrical shape of the horse was very difficult  because I had to get the horse to rear up and look as though it was in some kind of action. When I did this one  a gentleman seen it and said to me   There's no way you can do this  you must have used some kind of machine. There's no way a man can do that. It must be a machine.  So I says   OK then  if you say it's a machine ...  That one took me approximately six weeks. The most famous statue in the world. This one  I would say  was a serious challenge. Because I had to put the torch on the top. That one is  more or less  the same type of process. The bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand  because I wanted to get a bit of the stone effect. I used a microscopic shard of diamond to actually carve the actual base. Well  I can look at this one and I can be very proud of this  because that statue has always sort of kept an image in my head of  you know  the beginning of people coming to America. So it's sort of Ellis Island  and seeing America for the first time. And that's the first thing they saw. So I wanted to have that little image. And this is it. And we all know that is the Hulk. I wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle. Because we know we see needles  but people aren't familiar with the eye of a needle apart from putting a thread through it. So I broke the needle. And made a needle look like the Hulk's broken it. It's    I had to make little holes in the base of the needle  to shove his feet in. So most of my work  I don't use glue. They go in with their own friction. And that's how I managed to do it. As you can see  he's looking at the moment. He's got a little grimace on his face. And his mouth must be probably about three microns. So the eyes are probably about one micron or something. That ship there  that's made from    karat gold. And I normally rig it with the web of a money spider. But I had to rig it with strands of glue. Because the web of the spider  it was sending me insane  because I couldn't get the web to move off. And that's    karat gold. And it's constructed. I built it. Constructed each plank of gold. And the whole thing is sort of symmetrical. The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold. It's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right. As you can see  dressage. It's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the symmetrical shape. The actual rigging on the reins on the horse are made from the same sort of thing. And that was done with a particle from my shirt. And the pinhead I've made green around there by scraping the particles off a green shirt and then pressed onto the needle. It's very painstaking work  but the best things come in small packages. Bruno Giussani  Willard Wigan  Good morning everybody. I'd like to talk about a couple of things today. The first thing is water. Now I see you've all been enjoying the water that's been provided for you here at the conference  over the past couple of days. And I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source. But what if it wasn't  What if it was from a source like this  Then statistics would actually say that half of you would now be suffering with diarrhea. I talked a lot in the past about statistics  and the provision of safe drinking water for all. But they just don't seem to get through. And I think I've worked out why. It's because  using current thinking  the scale of the problem just seems too huge to contemplate solving. So we just switch off  us  governments and aid agencies. Well  today  I'd like to show you that through thinking differently  the problem has been solved. By the way  since I've been speaking  another        people around the world are suffering now with diarrhea. And four children have just died. I invented Lifesaver bottle because I got angry. I  like most of you  was sitting down  the day after Christmas in       when I was watching the devastating news of the Asian tsunami as it rolled in  playing out on TV. The days and weeks that followed  people fleeing to the hills  being forced to drink contaminated water or face death. That really stuck with me. Then  a few months later  Hurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America.  Okay   I thought   here's a First World country  let's see what they can do.  Day one  nothing. Day two  nothing. Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome  People were shooting each other on the streets for TV sets and water. That's when I decided I had to do something. Now I spent a lot of time in my garage  over the next weeks and months  and also in my kitchen    much to the dismay of my wife.  Laughter  However  after a few failed prototypes  I finally came up with this  the Lifesaver bottle. Okay  now for the science bit. Before Lifesaver  the best hand filters were only capable of filtering down to about     nanometers. The smallest bacteria is about     nanometers. So a     nanometer bacteria is going to get through a     nanometer hole. The smallest virus  on the other hand  is about    nanometers. So that's definitely going to get through those     nanometer holes. Lifesaver pores are    nanometers. So nothing is getting through. Okay  I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration. Would you like to see that  I spent all the time setting this up  so I guess I should. We're in the fine city of Oxford. So    someone's done that up. Fine city of Oxford  so what I've done is I've gone and got some water from the River Cherwell  and the River Thames  that flow through here. And this is the water. But I got to thinking  you know  if we were in the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh  the water wouldn't look like this. So I've gone and got some stuff to add into it. And this is from my pond. Okay.  Laughs  Right. We're just going to pour that in there. Audience  Ugh  Michael Pritchard  Okay. We've got some runoff from a sewage plant farm. So I'm just going to put that in there. Put that in there. There we go. And some other bits and pieces  chuck that in there. And I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit. So we're just going to put that in there as well. Okay.  Laughter  Now. The Lifesaver bottle works really simply. You just scoop the water up. Today I'm going to use a jug just to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there. That's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit. Okay  so I'm going to take this really filthy water  and put it in here. Do you want a drink yet  Okay. There we go. Replace the top. Give it a few pumps. Okay  That's all that's necessary. Now as soon as I pop the teat  sterile drinking water is going to come out. I've got to be quick. Okay  ready  There we go. Mind the electrics. That is safe  sterile drinking water. Cheers. There you go Chris. What's it taste of  Chris Anderson  Delicious. Michael Pritchard  Okay. Let's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay  Okay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world. It'll last for       liters. And when it's expired  using failsafe technology  the system will shut off  protecting the user. Pop the cartridge out. Pop a new one in. It's good for another       liters. So let's look at the applications. Traditionally  in a crisis  what do we do  We ship water. Then  after a few weeks  we set up camps. And people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water. What happens when        people congregate in a camp  Diseases spread. More resources are required. The problem just becomes self perpetuating. But by thinking differently  and shipping these  people can stay put. They can make their own sterile drinking water  and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives. Now  it doesn't require a natural disaster for this to work. Using the old thinking  of national infrastructure and pipe work  is too expensive. When you run the numbers on a calculator  you run out of noughts. So here is the  thinking different  bit. Instead of shipping water  and using man made processes to do it  let's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system. She picks the water up from there  desalinates it  for free  transports it over there  and dumps it onto the mountains  rivers  and streams. And where do people live  Near water. All we've go to do is make it sterile. How do we do that  Well  we could use the Lifesaver bottle. Or we could use one of these. The same technology  in a jerry can. This will process        liters of water  that's good enough for a family of four  for three years. And how much does it cost  About half a cent a day to run. Thank you. So  by thinking differently  and processing water at the point of use  mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day to collect their water. They can get it from a source nearby. So with just eight billion dollars  we can hit the millennium goal's target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water. To put that into context  The U.K. government spends about    billion pounds a year on foreign aid. But why stop there  With    billion dollars  everyone can have access to safe drinking water. So the three and a half billion people that suffer every year as a result  and the two million kids that die every year  will live. Thank you. Take a look at this picture. It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us. These African students are doing their homework under streetlights at the airport in the capital city because they don't have any electricity at home. Now  I haven't met these particular students  but I've met students like them. Let's just pick one    for example  the one in the green shirt. Let's give him a name  too  Nelson. I'll bet Nelson has a cellphone. So here is the puzzle. Why is it that Nelson has access to a cutting edge technology  like the cellphone  but doesn't have access to a     year old technology for generating electric light in the home  Now  in a word  the answer is  rules.  Bad rules can prevent the kind of win win solution that's available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like Nelson. What kinds of rules  The electric company in this nation operates under a rule  which says that it has to sell electricity at a very low  subsidized price    in fact  a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells. So it has neither the resources  nor the incentives  to hook up many other users. The president wanted to change this rule. He's seen that it's possible to have a different set of rules  rules where businesses earn a small profit  so they have an incentive to sign up more customers. That's the kind of rules that the cellphone company that Nelson purchases his telephony from operates under. The president has seen how those rules worked well. So he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity  but ran into a firestorm of protest from businesses and consumers who wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates. So he was stuck with rules that prevented him from letting the win win solution help his country. And Nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights. The real challenge then  is to try to figure out how we can change rules. Are there some rules we can develop for changing rules  I want to argue that there is a general abstract insight that we can make practical  which is that  if we can give more choices to people  and more choices to leaders    who  in many countries  are also people. But  it's useful to present the opposition between these two. Because the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader  a choice like giving the president the choice to raise prices on electricity  takes away a choice that people in the economy want. They want the choice to be able to continue consuming subsidized electric power. So if you give just to one side or the other  you'll have tension or friction. But if we can find ways to give more choices to both  that will give us a set of rules for changing rules that get us out of traps. Now  Nelson also has access to the Internet. And he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules  the ways that rules can keep people in the dark  look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night. In particular check out Asia. If you zoom in here  you can see North Korea  in outline here  which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors. Now  you won't be surprised to learn that the rules in North Korea keep people there in the dark. But it is important to recognize that North Korea and South Korea started out with identical sets of rules in both the sense of laws and regulations  but also in the deeper senses of understandings  norms  culture  values and beliefs. When they separated  they made choices that led to very divergent paths for their sets of rules. So we can change    we as humans can change the rules that we use to interact with each other  for better  or for worse. Now let's look at another region  the Caribbean. Zoom in on Haiti  in outline here. Haiti is also dark  compared to its neighbor here  the Dominican Republic  which has about the same number of residents. Both of these countries are dark compared to Puerto Rico  which has half as many residents as either Haiti or the Dominican Republic. What Haiti warns us is that rules can be bad because governments are weak. It's not just that the rules are bad because the government is too strong and oppressive  as in North Korea. So that if we want to create environments with good rules  we can't just tear down. We've got to find ways to build up  as well. Now  China dramatically demonstrates both the potential and the challenges of working with rules. Back in the beginning of the data presented in this chart  China was the world's high technology leader. Chinese had pioneered technologies like steel  printing  gunpowder. But the Chinese never adopted  at least in that period  effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas    a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread. And they soon adopted rules which slowed down innovation and cut China off from the rest of the world. So as other countries in the world innovated  in the sense both of developing newer technologies  but also developing newer rules  the Chinese were cut off from those advances. Income there stayed stagnant  as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world. This next chart looks at more recent data. It plots income  average income in China as a percentage of average income in the United States. In the '  s and '  s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent. But then in the late '  s something changed. Growth took off in China. The Chinese started catching up very quickly with the United States. If you go back to the map at night  you can get a clue to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China. The brightest spot in China  which you can see on the edge of the outline here  is Hong Kong. Hong Kong was a small bit of China that  for most of the   th century  operated under a very different set of rules than the rest of mainland China    rules that were copied from working market economies of the time  and administered by the British. In the     s  Hong Kong was a place where millions of people could go  from the mainland  to start in jobs like sewing shirts  making toys. But  to get on a process of increasing income  increasing skills led to very rapid growth there. Hong Kong was also the model which leaders like Deng Xiaoping could copy  when they decided to move all of the mainland towards the market model. But Deng Xiaoping instinctively understood the importance of offering choices to his people. So instead of forcing everyone in China to shift immediately to the market model  they proceeded by creating some special zones that could do  in a sense  what Britain did  make the opportunity to go work with the market rules available to the people who wanted to opt in there. So they created four special economic zones around Hong Kong  zones where Chinese could come and work  and cities grew up very rapidly there  also zones where foreign firms could come in and make things. One of the zones next to Hong Kong has a city called Shenzhen. In that city there is a Taiwanese firm that made the iPhone that many of you have  and they made it with labor from Chinese who moved there to Shenzhen. So after the four special zones  there were    coastal cites that were open in the same sense  and eventually demonstrated successes in these places that people could opt in to  that they flocked to because of the advantages they offered. Demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for a move toward the market model for the entire economy. Now the Chinese example shows us several points. One is  preserve choices for people. Two  operate on the right scale. If you try to change the rules in a village  you could do that  but a village would be too small to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people all working under good rules. On the other hand  the nation is too big. If you try to change the rules in the nation  you can't give some people a chance to hold back  see how things turn out  and let others zoom ahead and try the new rules. But cities give you this opportunity to create new places  with new rules that people can opt in to. And they're large enough to get all of the benefits that we can have when millions of us work together under good rules. So the proposal is that we conceive of something called a charter city. We start with a charter that specifies all the rules required to attract the people who we'll need to build the city. We'll need to attract the investors who will build out the infrastructure    the power system  the roads  the port  the airport  the buildings. You'll need to attract firms  who will come hire the people who move there first. And you'll need to attract families  the residents who will come and live there permanently  raise their children  get an education for their children  and get their first job. With that charter  people will move there. The city can be built. And we can scale this model. We can go do it over and over again. To make it work  we need good rules. We've already discussed that. Those are captured in the charter. We also need the choices for people. That's really built into the model if we allow for the possibility of building cities on uninhabited land. You start from uninhabited territory. People can come live under the new charter  but no one is forced to live under it. The final thing we need are choices for leaders. And  to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders we need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations  cases where nations work together  in effect  de facto  the way China and Britain worked together to build  first a little enclave of the market model  and then scale it throughout China. In a sense  Britain  inadvertently  through its actions in Hong Kong  did more to reduce world poverty than all the aid programs that we've undertaken in the last century. So if we allow for these kind of partnerships to replicate this again  we can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world. In some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility  a delegation of control from one country to another to take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities. Now  when I say that  some of you are starting to think   Well  is this just bringing back colonialism   It's not. But it's important to recognize that the kind of emotions that come up when we start to think about these things  can get in the way  can make us pull back  can shut down our ability  and our interest in trying to explore new ideas. Why is this not like colonialism  The thing that was bad about colonialism  and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs  is that it involved elements of coercion and condescension. This model is all about choices  both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places. And  choice is the antidote to coercion and condescension. So let's talk about how this could play out in practice. Let's take a particular leader  Raul Castro  who is the leader of Cuba. It must have occurred to Castro that he has the chance to do for Cuba what Deng Xiaoping did for China  but he doesn't have a Hong Kong there on the island in Cuba. He does  though  have a little bit of light down in the south that has a very special status. There is a zone there  around Guantanamo Bay  where a treaty gives the United States administrative responsibility for a piece of land that's about twice the size of Manhattan. Castro goes to the prime minister of Canada and says   Look  the Yankees have a terrible PR problem. They want to get out. Why don't you  Canada  take over  Build    run a special administrative zone. Allow a new city to be built up there. Allow many people to come in. Let us have a Hong Kong nearby. Some of my citizens will move into that city as well. Others will hold back. But this will be the gateway that will connect the modern economy and the modern world to my country.  Now  where else might this model be tried  Well  Africa. I've talked with leaders in Africa. Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule. It's a rule for changing rules. It's a way to create new rules  and let people opt in without coercion  and the opposition that coercion can force. They also totally get the idea that in some instances they can make more credible promises to long term investors    the kind of investors who will come build the port  build the roads  in a new city    they can make more credible promises if they do it along with a partner nation. Perhaps even in some arrangement that's a little bit like an escrow account  where you put land in the escrow account and the partner nation takes responsibility for it. There is also lots of land in Africa where new cities could be built. This is a picture I took when I was flying along the coast. There are immense stretches of land like this    land where hundreds of millions of people could live. Now  if we generalize this and think about not just one or two charter cites  but dozens    cities that will help create places for the many hundreds of millions  perhaps billions of people who will move to cities in the coming century    is there enough land for them  Well  throughout the world  if we look at the lights at night  the one thing that's misleading is that  visually  it looks like most of the world is already built out. So let me show you why that's wrong. Take this representation of all of the land. Turn it into a square that stands for all the arable land on Earth. And let these dots represent the land that's already taken up by the cities that three billion people now live in. If you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents take up only three percent of the arable land on earth. So if we wanted to build cities for another billion people  they would be dots like this. We'd go from three percent of the arable land  to four percent. We'd dramatically reduce the human footprint on Earth by building more cities that people can move to. And if these are cities governed by good rules  they can be cities where people are safe from crime  safe from disease and bad sanitation  where people have a chance to get a job. They can get basic utilities like electricity. Their kids can get an education. So what will it take to get started building the first charter cities  scaling this so we build many more  It would help to have a manual. What university professors could do is write some details that might go into this manual. You wouldn't want to let us run the cities  go out and design them. You wouldn't let academics out in the wild.  Laughter  But  you could set us to work thinking about questions like  suppose it isn't just Canada that does the deal with Raul Castro. Perhaps Brazil comes in as a participant  and Spain as well. And perhaps Cuba wants to be one of the partners in a four way joint venture. How would we write the treaty to do that  There is less precedent for that  but that could easily be worked out. How would we finance this  Turns out Singapore and Hong Kong are cities that made huge gains on the value of the land that they owned when they got started. You could use the gains on the value of the land to pay for things like the police  the courts  but the school system and the health care system too  which make this a more attractive place to live  makes this a place where people have higher incomes    which  incidentally  makes the land more valuable. So the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone and build it  and set up the basic rules  go very much in the right direction. So there are many other details like this. How could we have buildings that are low cost and affordable for people who work in a first job  assembling something like an iPhone  but make those buildings energy efficient  and make sure that they are safe  so they don't fall down in an earthquake or a hurricane. Many technical details to be worked out  but those of us who are already starting to pursue these things can already tell that there is no roadblock  there's no impediment  other than a failure of imagination  that will keep us from delivering on a truly global win win solution. Let me conclude with this picture. The reason we can be so well off  even though there is so many people on earth  is because of the power of ideas. We can share ideas with other people  and when they discover them  they share with us. It's not like scarce objects  where sharing means we each get less. When we share ideas we all get more. When we think about ideas in that way  we usually think about technologies. But there is another class of ideas  the rules that govern how we interact with each other  rules like  let's have a tax system that supports a research university that gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free. Let's have a system where we have ownership of land that is registered in a government office  that people can pledge as collateral. If we can keep innovating on our space of rules  and particularly innovate in the sense of coming up with rules for changing rules  so we don't get stuck with bad rules  then we can keep moving progress forward and truly make the world a better place  so that people like Nelson and his friends don't have to study any longer under the streetlights. Thank you. If I could reveal anything that is hidden from us  at least in modern cultures  it would be to reveal something that we've forgotten  that we used to know as well as we knew our own names. And that is that we live in a competent universe  that we are part of a brilliant planet  and that we are surrounded by genius. Biomimicry is a new discipline that tries to learn from those geniuses  and take advice from them  design advice. That's where I live  and it's my university as well. I'm surrounded by genius. I cannot help but remember the organisms and the ecosystems that know how to live here gracefully on this planet. This is what I would tell you to remember if you ever forget this again. Remember this. This is what happens every year. This is what keeps its promise. While we're doing bailouts  this is what happened. Spring. Imagine designing spring. Imagine that orchestration. You think TED is hard to organize.  Laughter  Right  Imagine  and if you haven't done this in a while  do. Imagine the timing  the coordination  all without top down laws  or policies  or climate change protocols. This happens every year. There is lots of showing off. There is lots of love in the air. There's lots of grand openings. And the organisms  I promise you  have all of their priorities in order. I have this neighbor that keeps me in touch with this  because he's living  usually on his back  looking up at those grasses. And one time he came up to me    he was about seven or eight years old    he came up to me. And there was a wasp's nest that I had let grow in my yard  right outside my door. And most people knock them down when they're small. But it was fascinating to me  because I was looking at this sort of fine Italian end papers. And he came up to me and he knocked. He would come every day with something to show me. And like  knock like a woodpecker on my door until I opened it up. And he asked me how I had made the house for those wasps  because he had never seen one this big. And I told him   You know  Cody  the wasps actually made that.  And we looked at it together. And I could see why he thought  you know    it was so beautifully done. It was so architectural. It was so precise. But it occurred to me  how in his small life had he already believed the myth that if something was that well done  that we must have done it. How did he not know    it's what we've all forgotten    that we're not the first ones to build. We're not the first ones to process cellulose. We're not the first ones to make paper. We're not the first ones to try to optimize packing space  or to waterproof  or to try to heat and cool a structure. We're not the first ones to build houses for our young. What's happening now  in this field called biomimicry  is that people are beginning to remember that organisms  other organisms  the rest of the natural world  are doing things very similar to what we need to do. But in fact they are doing them in a way that have allowed them to live gracefully on this planet for billions of years. So these people  biomimics  are nature's apprentices. And they're focusing on function. What I'd like to do is show you a few of the things that they're learning. They have asked themselves   What if  every time I started to invent something  I asked  'How would nature solve this '  And here is what they're learning. This is an amazing picture from a Czech photographer named Jack Hedley. This is a story about an engineer at J.R. West. They're the people who make the bullet train. It was called the bullet train because it was rounded in front  but every time it went into a tunnel it would build up a pressure wave  and then it would create like a sonic boom when it exited. So the engineer's boss said   Find a way to quiet this train.  He happened to be a birder. He went to the equivalent of an Audubon Society meeting. And he studied    there was a film about king fishers. And he thought to himself   They go from one density of medium  the air  into another density of medium  water  without a splash. Look at this picture. Without a splash  so they can see the fish. And he thought   What if we do this   Quieted the train. Made it go    percent faster on    percent less electricity. How does nature repel bacteria  We're not the first ones to have to protect ourselves from some bacteria. Turns out that    this is a Galapagos Shark. It has no bacteria on its surface  no fouling on its surface  no barnacles. And it's not because it goes fast. It actually basks. It's a slow moving shark. So how does it keep its body free of bacteria build up  It doesn't do it with a chemical. It does it  it turns out  with the same denticles that you had on Speedo bathing suits  that broke all those records in the Olympics  but it's a particular kind of pattern. And that pattern  the architecture of that pattern on its skin denticles keep bacteria from being able to land and adhere. There is a company called Sharklet Technologies that's now putting this on the surfaces in hospitals to keep bacteria from landing  which is better than dousing it with anti bacterials or harsh cleansers that many  many organisms are now becoming drug resistant. Hospital acquired infections are now killing more people every year in the United States than die from AIDS or cancer or car accidents combined    about        . This is a little critter that's in the Namibian desert. It has no fresh water that it's able to drink  but it drinks water out of fog. It's got bumps on the back of its wing covers. And those bumps act like a magnet for water. They have water loving tips  and waxy sides. And the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips. And it goes down the sides and goes into the critter's mouth. There is actually a scientist here at Oxford who studied this  Andrew Parker. And now kinetic and architectural firms like Grimshaw are starting to look at this as a way of coating buildings so that they gather water from the fog.    times better than our fog catching nets. CO  as a building block. Organisms don't think of CO  as a poison. Plants and organisms that make shells  coral  think of it as a building block. There is now a cement manufacturing company starting in the United States called Calera. They've borrowed the recipe from the coral reef  and they're using CO  as a building block in cement  in concrete. Instead of    cement usually emits a ton of CO  for every ton of cement. Now it's reversing that equation  and actually sequestering half a ton of CO  thanks to the recipe from the coral. None of these are using the organisms. They're really only using the blueprints or the recipes from the organisms. How does nature gather the sun's energy  This is a new kind of solar cell that's based on how a leaf works. It's self assembling. It can be put down on any substrate whatsoever. It's extremely inexpensive and rechargeable every five years. It's actually a company a company that I'm involved in called OneSun  with Paul Hawken. There are many many ways that nature filters water that takes salt out of water. We take water and push it against a membrane. And then we wonder why the membrane clogs and why it takes so much electricity. Nature does something much more elegant. And it's in every cell. Every red blood cell of your body right now has these hourglass shaped pores called aquaporins. They actually export water molecules through. It's kind of a forward osmosis. They export water molecules through  and leave solutes on the other side. A company called Aquaporin is starting to make desalination membranes mimicking this technology. Trees and bones are constantly reforming themselves along lines of stress. This algorithm has been put into a software program that's now being used to make bridges lightweight  to make building beams lightweight. Actually G.M. Opel used it to create that skeleton you see  in what's called their bionic car. It lightweighted that skeleton using a minimum amount of material  as an organism must  for the maximum amount of strength. This beetle  unlike this chip bag here  this beetle uses one material  chitin. And it finds many many ways to put many functions into it. It's waterproof. It's strong and resilient. It's breathable. It creates color through structure. Whereas that chip bag has about seven layers to do all of those things. One of our major inventions that we need to be able to do to come even close to what these organisms can do is to find a way to minimize the amount of material  the kind of material we use  and to add design to it. We use five polymers in the natural world to do everything that you see. In our world we use about     polymers to make all this. Nature is nano. Nanotechnology  nanoparticles  you hear a lot of worry about this. Loose nanoparticles. What is really interesting to me is that not many people have been asking   How can we consult nature about how to make nanotechnology safe   Nature has been doing that for a long time. Embedding nanoparticles in a material for instance  always. In fact  sulfur reducing bacteria  as part of their synthesis  they will emit  as a byproduct  nanoparticles into the water. But then right after that  they emit a protein that actually gathers and aggregates those nanoparticles so that they fall out of solution. Energy use. Organisms sip energy  because they have to work or barter for every single bit that they get. And one of the largest fields right now  in the world of energy grids  you hear about the smart grid. One of the largest consultants are the social insects. Swarm technology. There is a company called Regen. They are looking at how ants and bees find their food and their flowers in the most effective way as a whole hive. And they're having appliances in your home talk to one another through that algorithm  and determine how to minimize peak power use. There's a group of scientists in Cornell that are making what they call a synthetic tree  because they are saying   There is no pump at the bottom of a tree.  It's capillary action and transpiration pulls water up  a drop at a time  pulling it  releasing it from a leaf and pulling it up through the roots. And they're creating    you can think of it as a kind of wallpaper. They're thinking about putting it on the insides of buildings to move water up without pumps. Amazon electric eel    incredibly endangered  some of these species    create     volts of electricity with the chemicals that are in your body. Even more interesting to me is that     volts doesn't fry it. You know we use PVC  and we sheath wires with PVC for insulation. These organisms  how are they insulating against their own electric charge  These are some questions that we've yet to ask. Here's a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale. Humpback whale has scalloped edges on its flippers. And those scalloped edges play with flow in such a way that is reduces drag by    percent. These wind turbines can rotate in incredibly slow windspeeds  as a result. MIT just has a new radio chip that uses far less power than our chips. And it's based on the cochlear of your ear  able to pick up internet  wireless  television signals and radio signals  in the same chip. Finally  on an ecosystem scale. At Biomimicry Guild  which is my consulting company  we work with HOK Architects. We're looking at building whole cities in their planning department. And what we're saying is that  shouldn't our cities do at least as well  in terms of ecosystem services  as the native systems that they replace  So we're creating something called Ecological Performance Standards that hold cities to this higher bar. The question is    biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate. The question I would ask is   What's worth solving   If you haven't seen this  it's pretty amazing. Dr. Adam Neiman. This is a depiction of all of the water on Earth in relation to the volume of the Earth    all the ice  all the fresh water  all the sea water    and all the atmosphere that we can breathe  in relation to the volume of the Earth. And inside those balls life  over  .  billion years  has made a lush  livable place for us. And we are in a long  long line of organisms to come to this planet and ask ourselves   How can we live here gracefully over the long haul   How can we do what life has learned to do  Which is to create conditions conducive to life. Now in order to do this  the design challenge of our century  I think  we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses  and to somehow meet them again. One of the big ideas  one of the big projects I've been honored to work on is a new website. And I would encourage you all to please go to it. It's called AskNature.org. And what we're trying to do  in a TEDesque way  is to organize all biological information by design and engineering function. And we're working with EOL  Encyclopedia of Life  Ed Wilson's TED wish. And he's gathering all biological information on one website. And the scientists who are contributing to EOL are answering a question   What can we learn from this organism   And that information will go into AskNature.org. And hopefully  any inventor  anywhere in the world  will be able  in the moment of creation  to type in   How does nature remove salt from water   And up will come mangroves  and sea turtles and your own kidneys. And we'll begin to be able to do as Cody does  and actually be in touch with these incredible models  these elders that have been here far  far longer than we have. And hopefully  with their help  we'll learn how to live on this Earth  and on this home that is ours  but not ours alone. Thank you very much. I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal. And I come from a long way. I've been telling a story that has been so painful for me. It's been a tough journey for me  traveling the world  telling my story in form of a book. And also telling it like now. And also  the easiest one was when I was doing it in form of a music. So I have branded myself as a war child. I'm doing this because of an old lady in my village now  who have lost her children. There is no newspaper to cover her pain  and what she wants to change in this society. And I'm doing it for a young man who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice because he can't write. Or there is no Internet  like Facebook  MySpace  YouTube  for them to talk. Also one thing that kept me pushing this story  this painful stories out  the dreams I have  sometimes  is like the voices of the dead  that I have seen would tell me   Don't give up. Keep on going.  Because sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it  because I didn't know what I was putting myself into. Well I was born in the most difficult time  when my country was at war. I saw my village burned down. The world that meant a lot to me  I saw it vanish in my face. I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five. My mother was claimed by the war. My brothers and sisters were scattered. And up to now  me and my father were detached and I still have issues with him. Seeing people die every day  my mother crying  it's like I was raised in a violence. And that made me call myself a war child. And not only that  when I was eight I became a child soldier. I didn't know what was the war for. But one thing I knew was an image that I saw that stuck in my head. When I went to the training camp I say   I want to kill as many Muslims  and as many Arabs  as possible.  The training wasn't easy  but that was the driving force  because I wanted to revenge for my family. I wanted to revenge for my village. Luckily now things have changed because I came to discover the truth. What was actually killing us wasn't the Muslims  wasn't the Arabs. It was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system  and using religion to get what they want to get out of us  which is the oil  the diamond  the gold and the land. So realizing the truth gave me a position to choose  should I continue to hate  or let it go  So I happened to forgive. Now I sing music with the Muslims. I dance with them. I even had a movie out called  War Child   funded by Muslim people. So that pain has gone out. But my story is huge. So I'm just going to go into a different step now  which is easier for me. I'm going to give you poem called  Forced to Sin   which is from my album  War Child.  I talk about my story. One of the journey that I tread when I was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food and we were like around    . And only    people survived that journey. So I hope you're going to hear this. My dreams are like torment. My every moment. Voices in my brain  of friends that was slain. Friends like Lual who died by my side  of starvation. In the burning jungle  and the desert plain. Next was I  but Jesus heard my cry. As I was tempted to eat the rotten flesh of my comrade  he gave me comfort. We used to raid villages  stealing chickens  goats and sheeps  anything we could eat. I knew it was rude  but we needed food. And therefore I was forced to sin  forced to sin to make a living  forced to sin to make a living. Sometimes you gotta lose to win. Never give up. Never give in. Left home at the age of seven. One year later  live with an AK    by my side. Slept with one eye open wide. Run  duck  play dead and hide. I've seen my people die like flies. But I've never seen a dead body  at least one that I've killed. But still as I wonder  I won't go under. Guns barking like lightning and thunder. As a child so young and tender  Words I can't forget I still remember. I saw sergeant command raising his hand  no retreat  no surrender. I carry the banner of the trauma. War child  child without a mama  still fighting in the saga. Yet as I wage this new war I'm not alone in this drama. No sit or stop  as I reach for the top I'm fully dedicated like a patriotic cop. I'm on a fight  day and night. Sometime I do wrong in order to make things right. It's like I'm living a dream. First time I'm feeling like a human being. Ah  The children of Darfur. Your empty bellies on the telly and now it's you that I'm fighting for. Left home. Don't even know the day I'll ever return. My country is war torn. Music I used to hear was bombs and fire of guns. So many people die that I don't even cry no more. Ask God question  what am I here for. And why are my people poor. And why  why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write  I was learning how to fight. I ate snails  vultures  rabbits  snakes  and anything that had life. I was ready to eat. I know it's a shame. But who is to be blamed  That's my story shared in the form of a lesson. Thank you. What energized me and kept me going is the music I do. I never saw anybody to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy. So the music had been my therapy for me. It's been where I actually see heaven  where I can be happy  where I can be a child again  in dances  through music. So one thing I know about music  music is the only thing that has power to enter your cell system  your mind  your heart  influence your soul and your spirit  and can even influence the way you live without even you knowing. Music is the only thing that can make you want to wake up your bed and shake your leg  without even wanting to do it. And so the power music has I normally compare to the power love when love doesn't see a color. You know  if you fall in love with a frog  that's it. One testimony about how I find music is powerful is when I was still a soldier back then. I hated the people in the north. But I don't know why I don't hate their music. So we party and dance to their music. And one thing that shocked me is one day they brought an Arab musician to come and entertain the soldiers. And I almost broke my leg dancing to his music. But I had this question. So now I'm doing music so I know what the power of music is. So what's happening here  I've been in a painful journey. Today is day number     in which I only eat dinner. I don't eat breakfast. No lunch. And I've done a campaign called Lose to Win. Where I'm losing so that I could win the battle that I'm fighting now. So my breakfast  my lunch  I donate it to a charity that I founded because we want to build a school in Sudan. And I'm doing this because also it's a normal thing in my home  people eat one meal a day. Here I am in the West. I choose not to. So in my village now  kids there  they normally listen to BBC  or any radio  and they are waiting to know  the day Emmanuel will eat his breakfast it means he got the money to build our school. And so I made a commitment. I say   I'm gonna not eat my breakfast.  I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month  but I've been humbled. So it's taken me     days. And I said   No stop until we get it.  And like it's been done on Facebook  MySpace. The people are giving three dollars. The lowest amount we ever got was    cents. Somebody donated    cents online. I don't know how they did it. But that moved me. And so  the importance of education to me is what I'm willing to die for. I'm willing to die for this  because I know what it can do to my people. Education enlighten your brain  give you so many chances  and you're able to survive. As a nation we have been crippled. For so many years we have fed on aid. You see a    years old     years old families in a refugee camps. They only get the food that drops from the sky  from the U.N. So these people  you're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid. If anybody want to help us this is what we need. Give us tools. Give the farmers tools. It's rain. Africa is fertile. They can grow the crops. Invest in education. Education so that we have strong institution that can create a revolution to change everything. Because we have all those old men that are creating wars in Africa. They will die soon. But if you invest in education then we'll be able to change Africa. That's what I'm asking. So in order to do that  I founded a charter called Gua Africa  where we put kids in school. And now we have a couple in university. We have like    kids  ex child soldiers mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support. And I said  I'm going to put it in practice.  And with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things. That's what I want to do to change  to make a difference in the world. Well now  my time is going  so I want to sing a song. But I'll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a British aid worker called Emma McCune that made it possible for me to be here. I'm gonna sing this song  just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference. She came to my country and saw the importance of education. She said the only way to help Sudan is to invest in the women  educating them  educating the children  so that they could come and create a revolution in this complex society. So she even ended up marrying a commander from the SPLA. And she rescued over     child soldiers. One of them happened to be me now. And so at this moment I want to ask to celebrate Emma with me. Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma  Audience  Yes  Emmanuel Jal  All right.   This one goes to Emma McCune     Angel to rescue came one afternoon     I'm here because you rescued me     I'm proud to carry your legacy     Thank you. Bless you. R.I.P.     What would I be  Me      If Emma never rescued me  What would I be      What would I be  Me      Another starving refugee     What would I be      What would I be  Me      If Emma never rescued me  Yeah      Yeah  Yeah      You would have seen my face on the telly     Fat hungry belly     Flies in my eyes  head too big for my size     Just another little starving child     Running around in Africa  born to be wild     Praise God  praise the Almighty     for sending an angel to rescue me     I got a reason for being on this Earth     'Cause I know more than many what a life is worth     Now that I got a chance to stand my ground     I'm gonna run over mountains  leaps and bounds     I ain't an angel  hope I'll be one soon     And if I am  I wanna be like Emma McCune     Me  What would I be  Me      If Emma never rescued me      What would I be      What would I be  Me      Another starving refugee     What would I be      What would I be  Me      If Emma never rescued me  Yeah  Yeah     Yeah  Yeah      I would have probably died from starvation     Or some other wretched disease     I would have grown up with no education     Just another refugee     I stand here because somebody cared     I stand here because somebody dared     I know there is a lot of Emmas out there     Who is willing and trying to save a life of a child     What would I be  Me      If Emma never rescued me      What would I be      What would I be      Another starving refugee     I remember the time when I was small     When I couldn't read or write at all     Now I'm all grown up  I got my education     The sky is the limit and I can't be stopped by no one     How I prayed for this day to come     And I pray that the world find wisdom     To give the poor in need some assistance     Instead of putting up resistance  yeah     Sitting and waiting for the politics to fix this     It ain't gonna happen     They're all sitting on they asses     Popping champagne and sponging off the masses     Coming from a refugee boy soldier     But I still got my dignity     I gotta say it again     If Emma never rescued me     I'd be a corpse on the African plain   Is there anybody who's here in the back  some love. Big scream for Emma everybody. Yeah  I'm gonna get crazy now.   What would I be      If Emma never rescued me      What would I be      Another starving refugee     What would I be      If Emma never rescued me      Yeah  Yeah     Yeah  I would have probably died from starvation     Or some other wretched disease     I would have grown up with no education     Just another refugee   Thank you. Go save a life of a child. I need to make a confession at the outset here. A little over    years ago  I did something that I regret  something that I'm not particularly proud of. Something that  in many ways  I wish no one would ever know  but here I feel kind of obliged to reveal. In the late     s  in a moment of youthful indiscretion  I went to law school. In America  law is a professional degree  after your university degree  you go on to law school. When I got to law school  I didn't do very well. To put it mildly  I didn't do very well. I  in fact  graduated in the part of my law school class that made the top     possible. Thank you. I never practiced law a day in my life  I pretty much wasn't allowed to. But today  against my better judgment  against the advice of my own wife  I want to try to dust off some of those legal skills    what's left of those legal skills. I don't want to tell you a story. I want to make a case. I want to make a hard headed  evidence based  dare I say lawyerly case  for rethinking how we run our businesses. So  ladies and gentlemen of the jury  take a look at this. This is called the candle problem. Some of you might know it. It's created in      by a psychologist named Karl Duncker. He created this experiment that is used in many other experiments in behavioral science. And here's how it works. Suppose I'm the experimenter. I bring you into a room. I give you a candle  some thumbtacks and some matches. And I say to you   Your job is to attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn't drip onto the table.  Now what would you do  Many people begin trying to thumbtack the candle to the wall. Doesn't work. I saw somebody kind of make the motion over here    some people have a great idea where they light the match  melt the side of the candle  try to adhere it to the wall. It's an awesome idea. Doesn't work. And eventually  after five or ten minutes  most people figure out the solution  which you can see here. The key is to overcome what's called functional fixedness. You look at that box and you see it only as a receptacle for the tacks. But it can also have this other function  as a platform for the candle. The candle problem. I want to tell you about an experiment using the candle problem  done by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg  who is now at Princeton University  US  This shows the power of incentives. He gathered his participants and said   I'm going to time you  how quickly you can solve this problem.  To one group he said   I'm going to time you to establish norms  averages for how long it typically takes someone to solve this sort of problem.  To the second group he offered rewards. He said   If you're in the top     of the fastest times  you get five dollars. If you're the fastest of everyone we're testing here today  you get    dollars.  Now this is several years ago  adjusted for inflation  it's a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work. It's a nice motivator. Question  How much faster did this group solve the problem  Answer  It took them  on average  three and a half minutes longer.  .  min longer. This makes no sense  right  I mean  I'm an American. I believe in free markets. That's not how it's supposed to work  right  If you want people to perform better  you reward them. Right  Bonuses  commissions  their own reality show. Incentivize them. That's how business works. But that's not happening here. You've got an incentive designed to sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity  and it does just the opposite. It dulls thinking and blocks creativity. What's interesting about this experiment is that it's not an aberration. This has been replicated over and over again for nearly    years. These contingent motivators    if you do this  then you get that    work in some circumstances. But for a lot of tasks  they actually either don't work or  often  they do harm. This is one of the most robust findings in social science  and also one of the most ignored. I spent the last couple of years looking at the science of human motivation  particularly the dynamics of extrinsic motivators and intrinsic motivators. And I'm telling you  it's not even close. If you look at the science  there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does. What's alarming here is that our business operating system    think of the set of assumptions and protocols beneath our businesses  how we motivate people  how we apply our human resources   it's built entirely around these extrinsic motivators  around carrots and sticks. That's actually fine for many kinds of   th century tasks. But for   st century tasks  that mechanistic  reward and punishment approach doesn't work  often doesn't work  and often does harm. Let me show you. Glucksberg did another similar experiment  he presented the problem in a slightly different way  like this up here. Attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn't drip onto the table. Same deal. You  we're timing for norms. You  we're incentivizing. What happened this time  This time  the incentivized group kicked the other group's butt. Why  Because when the tacks are out of the box  it's pretty easy isn't it  If then rewards work really well for those sorts of tasks  where there is a simple set of rules and a clear destination to go to. Rewards  by their very nature  narrow our focus  concentrate the mind  that's why they work in so many cases. So  for tasks like this  a narrow focus  where you just see the goal right there  zoom straight ahead to it  they work really well. But for the real candle problem  you don't want to be looking like this. The solution is on the periphery. You want to be looking around. That reward actually narrows our focus and restricts our possibility. Let me tell you why this is so important. In western Europe  in many parts of Asia  in North America  in Australia  white collar workers are doing less of this kind of work  and more of this kind of work. That routine  rule based  left brain work    certain kinds of accounting  financial analysis  computer programming    has become fairly easy to outsource  fairly easy to automate. Software can do it faster. Low cost providers can do it cheaper. So what really matters are the more right brained creative  conceptual kinds of abilities. Think about your own work. Think about your own work. Are the problems that you face  or even the problems we've been talking about here  do they have a clear set of rules  and a single solution  No. The rules are mystifying. The solution  if it exists at all  is surprising and not obvious. Everybody in this room is dealing with their own version of the candle problem. And for candle problems of any kind  in any field  those if then rewards  the things around which we've built so many of our businesses  don't work  It makes me crazy. And here's the thing. This is not a feeling. Okay  I'm a lawyer  I don't believe in feelings. This is not a philosophy. I'm an American  I don't believe in philosophy. This is a fact    or  as we say in my hometown of Washington  D.C.  a true fact. Let me give you an example. Let me marshal the evidence here. I'm not telling a story  I'm making a case. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury  some evidence  Dan Ariely  one of the great economists of our time  he and three colleagues did a study of some MIT students. They gave these MIT students a bunch of games  games that involved creativity  and motor skills  and concentration. And the offered them  for performance  three levels of rewards  small reward  medium reward  large reward. If you do really well you get the large reward  on down. What happened  As long as the task involved only mechanical skill bonuses worked as they would be expected  the higher the pay  the better the performance. Okay  But once the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill  a larger reward led to poorer performance. Then they said   Let's see if there's any cultural bias here. Let's go to Madurai  India and test it.  Standard of living is lower. In Madurai  a reward that is modest in North American standards  is more meaningful there. Same deal. A bunch of games  three levels of rewards. What happens  People offered the medium level of rewards did no better than people offered the small rewards. But this time  people offered the highest rewards  they did the worst of all. In eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments  higher incentives led to worse performance. Is this some kind of touchy feely socialist conspiracy going on here  No  these are economists from MIT  from Carnegie Mellon  from the University of Chicago. Do you know who sponsored this research  The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States. That's the American experience. Let's go across the pond to the London School of Economics  LSE  London School of Economics  alma mater of eleven Nobel Laureates in economics. Training ground for great economic thinkers like George Soros  and Friedrich Hayek  and Mick Jagger. Last month  just last month  economists at LSE looked at    studies of pay for performance plans  inside of companies. Here's what they said   We find that financial incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance.  There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does. And what worries me  as we stand here in the rubble of the economic collapse  is that too many organizations are making their decisions  their policies about talent and people  based on assumptions that are outdated  unexamined  and rooted more in folklore than in science. And if we really want to get out of this economic mess  if we really want high performance on those definitional tasks of the   st century  the solution is not to do more of the wrong things  to entice people with a sweeter carrot  or threaten them with a sharper stick. We need a whole new approach. The good news is that the scientists who've been studying motivation have given us this new approach. It's built much more around intrinsic motivation. Around the desire to do things because they matter  because we like it  they're interesting  or part of something important. And to my mind  that new operating system for our businesses revolves around three elements  autonomy  mastery and purpose. Autonomy  the urge to direct our own lives. Mastery  the desire to get better and better at something that matters. Purpose  the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves. These are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system for our businesses. I want to talk today only about autonomy. In the   th century  we came up with this idea of management. Management did not emanate from nature. Management is not a tree  it's a television set. Somebody invented it. It doesn't mean it's going to work forever. Management is great. Traditional notions of management are great if you want compliance. But if you want engagement  self direction works better. Some examples of some kind of radical notions of self direction. You don't see a lot of it  but you see the first stirrings of something really interesting going on  what it means is paying people adequately and fairly  absolutely    getting the issue of money off the table  and then giving people lots of autonomy. Some examples. How many of you have heard of the company Atlassian  It looks like less than half. Atlassian is an Australian software company. And they do something incredibly cool. A few times a year they tell their engineers   Go for the next    hours and work on anything you want  as long as it's not part of your regular job. Work on anything you want.  Engineers use this time to come up with a cool patch for code  come up with an elegant hack. Then they present all of the stuff that they've developed to their teammates  to the rest of the company  in this wild and woolly all hands meeting at the end of the day. Being Australians  everybody has a beer. They call them FedEx Days. Why  Because you have to deliver something overnight. It's pretty  not bad. It's a huge trademark violation  but it's pretty clever. That one day of intense autonomy has produced a whole array of software fixes that might never have existed. It's worked so well that Atlassian has taken it to the next level with     time    done  famously  at Google    where engineers can spend     of their time working on anything they want. They have autonomy over their time  their task  their team  their technique. Radical amounts of autonomy. And at Google  as many of you know  about half of the new products in a typical year are birthed during that     time  things like Gmail  Orkut  Google News. Let me give you an even more radical example of it  something called the Results Only Work Environment  the ROWE   created by two American consultants  in place at a dozen companies around North America. In a ROWE people don't have schedules. They show up when they want. They don't have to be in the office at a certain time  or any time. They just have to get their work done. How they do it  when they do it  where they do it  is totally up to them. Meetings in these kinds of environments are optional. What happens  Almost across the board  productivity goes up  worker engagement goes up  worker satisfaction goes up  turnover goes down. Autonomy  mastery and purpose  the building blocks of a new way of doing things. Some of you might look at this and say   Hmm  that sounds nice  but it's Utopian.  And I say   Nope. I have proof.  The mid     s  Microsoft started an encyclopedia called Encarta. They had deployed all the right incentives  They paid professionals to write and edit thousands of articles. Well compensated managers oversaw the whole thing to make sure it came in on budget and on time. A few years later  another encyclopedia got started. Different model  right  Do it for fun. No one gets paid a cent  or a euro or a yen. Do it because you like to do it. Just    years ago  if you had gone to an economist  anywhere   Hey  I've got these two different models for creating an encyclopedia. If they went head to head  who would win      years ago you could not have found a single sober economist anywhere on planet Earth who would have predicted the Wikipedia model. This is the titanic battle between these two approaches. This is the Ali Frazier of motivation  right  This is the Thrilla in Manila. Intrinsic motivators versus extrinsic motivators. Autonomy  mastery and purpose  versus carrot and sticks  and who wins  Intrinsic motivation  autonomy  mastery and purpose  in a knockout. Let me wrap up. There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does. Here is what science knows. One  Those   th century rewards  those motivators we think are a natural part of business  do work  but only in a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances. Two  Those if then rewards often destroy creativity. Three  The secret to high performance isn't rewards and punishments  but that unseen intrinsic drive   the drive to do things for their own sake. The drive to do things cause they matter. And here's the best part. We already know this. The science confirms what we know in our hearts. So  if we repair this mismatch between science and business  if we bring our motivation  notions of motivation into the   st century  if we get past this lazy  dangerous  ideology of carrots and sticks  we can strengthen our businesses  we can solve a lot of those candle problems  and maybe  maybe    we can change the world. I rest my case. Early visions of wireless power actually were thought of by Nikola Tesla basically about     years ago. The thought that you wouldn't want to transfer electric power wirelessly  no one ever thought of that. They thought   Who would use it if you didn't   And so  in fact  he actually set about doing a variety of things. Built the Tesla coil. This tower was built on Long Island back at the beginning of the     s. And the idea was  it was supposed to be able to transfer power anywhere on Earth. We'll never know if this stuff worked. Actually  I think the Federal Bureau of Investigation took it down for security purposes  sometime in the early     s. But the one thing that did come out of electricity is that we love this stuff so much. I mean  think about how much we love this. If you just walk outside  there are trillions of dollars that have been invested in infrastructure around the world  putting up wires to get power from where it's created to where it's used. The other thing is  we love batteries. And for those of us that have an environmental element to us  there is something like    billion disposable batteries built every year for power that  generally speaking  is used within a few inches or a few feet of where there is very inexpensive power. So  before I got here  I thought   You know  I am from North America. We do have a little bit of a reputation in the United States.  So I thought I'd better look it up first. So definition number six is the North American definition of the word  suck.  Wires suck  they really do. Think about it. Whether that's you in that picture or something under your desk. The other thing is  batteries suck too. And they really  really do. Do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff     billion of these things built. This is what happens. They fall apart  they disintegrate  and they end up here. So when you talk about expensive power  the cost per kilowatt hour to supply battery power to something is on the order of two to three hundred pounds. Think about that. The most expensive grid power in the world is thousandths of that. So fortunately  one of the other definitions of  suck  that was in there  it does create a vacuum. And nature really does abhor a vacuum. What happened back a few years ago was a group of theoretical physicists at MIT actually came up with this concept of transferring power over distance. Basically they were able to light a    watt light bulb at a distance of about two meters. It got about    percent of the efficiency    by the way  that's still a couple thousand times more efficient than a battery would be  to do the same thing. But were able to light that  and do it very successfully. This was actually the experiment. So you can see the coils were somewhat larger. The light bulb was a fairly simple task  from their standpoint. This all came from a professor waking up at night to the third night in a row that his wife's cellphone was beeping because it was running out of battery power. And he was thinking   With all the electricity that's out there in the walls  why couldn't some of that just come into the phone so I could get some sleep   And he actually came up with this concept of resonant energy transfer. But inside a standard transformer are two coils of wire. And those two coils of wire are really  really close to each other  and actually do transfer power magnetically and wirelessly  only over a very short distance. What Dr. Soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology  which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room. It's a resonant phenomenon for which he actually received a MacArthur Fellowship Award  which is nicknamed the Genius Award  last September  for his discovery. So how does it work  Imagine a coil. For those of you that are engineers  there's a capacitor attached to it too. And if you can cause that coil to resonate  what will happen is it will pulse at alternating current frequencies    at a fairly high frequency  by the way. And if you can bring another device close enough to the source  that will only work at exactly that frequency  you can actually get them to do what's called strongly couple  and transfer magnetic energy between them. And then what you do is  you start out with electricity  turn it into magnetic field  take that magnetic field  turn it back into electricity  and then you can use it. Number one question I get asked. I mean  people are worried about cellphones being safe. You know. What about safety  The first thing is this is not a  radiative  technology. It doesn't radiate. There aren't electric fields here. It's a magnetic field. It stays within either what we call the source  or within the device. And actually  the magnetic fields we're using are basically about the same as the Earth's magnetic field. We live in a magnetic field. And the other thing that's pretty cool about the technology is that it only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency. And it's virtually impossible in nature to make that happen. Then finally we have governmental bodies everywhere that will regulate everything we do. They've pretty much set field exposure limits  which all of the things in the stuff I'll show you today sort of sit underneath those guidelines. Mobile electronics. Home electronics. Those cords under your desk  I bet everybody here has something that looks like that or those batteries. There are industrial applications. And then finally  electric vehicles. These electric cars are beautiful. But who is going to want to plug them in  Imagine driving into your garage    we've built a system to do this    you drive into your garage  and the car charges itself  because there is a mat on the floor that's plugged into the wall. And it actually causes your car to charge safely and efficiently. Then there's all kinds of other applications. Implanted medical devices  where people don't have to die of infections anymore if you can seal the thing up. Credit cards  robot vacuum cleaners. So what I'd like to do is take a couple minutes and show you  actually  how it works. And what I'm going to do is to show you pretty much what's here. You've got a coil. That coil is connected to an R.F. amplifier that creates a high frequency oscillating magnetic field. We put one on the back of the television set. By the way  I do make it look a little bit easier than it is. There's lots of electronics and secret sauce and all kinds of intellectual property that go into it. But then what's going to happen is  it will create a field. It will cause one to get created on the other side. And if the demo gods are willing  in about    seconds or so we should see it. The    seconds actually are because we    I don't know if any of you have ever thought about plugging a T.V. in when you use just a cord. Generally  you have to go over and hit the button. So I thought we put a little computer in it that has to wake up to tell it to do that. So  I'll plug that in. It creates a magnetic field here. It causes one to be created out here. And as I said  in sort of about    seconds we should start to see ... This is a commercially    available color television set. Imagine  you get one of these things. You want to hang them on the wall. How many people want to hang them on the wall  Think about it. You don't want those ugly cords coming down. Imagine if you can get rid of it. The other thing I wanted to talk about was safety. So  there is nothing going on. I'm okay. And I'll do it again  just for safety's sake. Almost immediately  though  people ask   How small can you make this  Can you make this small enough   Because remember Dr. Soljacic's original idea was his wife's cellphone beeping. So  I wanted to show you something. We're an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing. This a Google G . You know  it's the latest thing that's come out. It runs the Android operating system. I think I heard somebody talk about that before. It's odd. It has a battery. It also has coiled electronics that WiTricity has put into the back of it. And if I can get the camera    okay  great    you'll see  as I get sort of close... you're looking at a cellphone powered completely wirelessly. And I know some of you are Apple aficionados. So  you know they don't make it easy at Apple to get inside their phones. So we put a little sleeve on the back  but we should be able to get this guy to wake up too. And those of you that have an iPhone recognize the green center. And Nokia as well. You'll see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back  to do that  and it probably beeps  actually  as it goes on as well. But they typically use it to light up the screen. So  imagine these things could go ... they could go in your ceiling. They could go in the floor. They could go  actually  underneath your desktop. So that when you walk in or you come in from home  if you carry a purse  it works in your purse. You never have to worry about plugging these things in again. And think of what that would do for you. So I think in closing  sort of in the immortal visions of The New Yorker magazine  I thought I'd put up one more slide. And for those of you who can't read it  it says   It does appear to be some kind of wireless technology.  So  thank you very much. I'm going to talk about your mindset. Does your mindset correspond to my dataset  If not  one or the other needs upgrading  isn't it  When I talk to my students about global issues  and I listen to them in the coffee break  they always talk about  we  and  them.  And when they come back into the lecture room I ask them   What do you mean with  we  and  them    Oh  it's very easy. It's the western world and it's the developing world   they say.  We learned it in college.  And what is the definition then   The definition  Everyone knows   they say. But then you know  I press them like this. So one girl said  very cleverly   It's very easy. Western world is a long life in a small family. Developing world is a short life in a large family.  And I like that definition  because it enabled me to transfer their mindset into the dataset. And here you have the dataset. So  you can see that what we have on this axis here is size of family. One  two  three  four  five children per woman on this axis. And here  length of life  life expectancy            . Exactly what the students said was their concept about the world. And really this is about the bedroom. Whether the man and woman decide to have small family  and take care of their kids  and how long they will live. It's about the bathroom and the kitchen. If you have soap  water and food  you know  you can live long. And the students were right. It wasn't that the world consisted    the world consisted here  of one set of countries over here  which had large families and short life. Developing world. And we had one set of countries up there which was the western world. They had small families and long life. And you are going to see here the amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime. Then the developing countries applied soap and water  vaccination. And all the developing world started to apply family planning. And partly to USA who help to provide technical advice and investment. And you see all the world moves over to a two child family  and a life with    to    years. But some countries remain back in this area here. And you can see we still have Afghanistan down here. We have Liberia. We have Congo. So we have countries living there. So the problem I had is that the worldview that my students had corresponds to reality in the world the year their teachers were born. And we  in fact  when we have played this over the world. I was at the Global Health Conference here in Washington last week  and I could see the wrong concept even active people in United States had  that they didn't realize the improvement of Mexico there  and China  in relation to United States. Look here when I move them forward. Here we go. They catch up. There's Mexico. It's on par with United States in these two social dimensions. There was less than five percent of the specialists in Global Health that was aware of this. This great nation  Mexico  has the problem that arms are coming from North  across the borders  so they had to stop that  because they have this strange relationship to the United States  you know. But if I would change this axis here  I would instead put income per person. Income per person. I can put that here. And we will then see a completely different picture. By the way  I'm teaching you how to use our website  Gapminder World  while I'm correcting this  because this is a free utility on the net. And when I now finally got it right  I can go back     years in history. And I can find United States up there. And I can let the other countries be shown. And now I have income per person on this axis. And United States only had some  one  two thousand dollars at that time. And the life expectancy was    to    years  on par with Afghanistan today. And what has happened in the world  I will show now. This is instead of studying history for one year at university. You can watch me for one minute now and you'll see the whole thing. You can see how the brown bubbles  which is west Europe  and the yellow one  which is the United States  they get richer and richer and also start to get healthier and healthier. And this is now     years ago  where the rest of the world remains behind. Here we come. And that was the influenza. That's why we are so scared about flu  isn't it  It's still remembered. The fall of life expectancy. And then we come up. Not until independence started. Look here You have China over there  you have India over there  and this is what has happened. Did you note there  that we have Mexico up there  Mexico is not at all on par with the United States  but they are quite close. And especially  it's interesting to see China and the United States during     years  because I have my oldest son now working for Google  after Google acquired this software. Because in fact  this is child labor. My son and his wife sat in a closet for many years and developed this. And my youngest son  who studied Chinese in Beijing. So they come in with the two perspectives I have  you know  And my son  youngest son who studied in Beijing  in China  he got a long term perspective. Whereas when my oldest son  who works for Google  he should develop by quarter  or by half year. Or Google is quite generous  so he can have one or two years to go. But in China they look generation after generation because they remember the very embarrassing period  for     years  when they went backwards. And then they would remember the first part of last century  which was really bad  and we could go by this so called Great Leap Forward. But this was     . Mao Tse Tung eventually brought health to China  and then he died  and then Deng Xiaoping started this amazing move forward. Isn't it strange to see that the United States first grew the economy  and then gradually got rich  Whereas China could get healthy much earlier  because they applied the knowledge of education  nutrition  and then also benefits of penicillin and vaccines and family planning. And Asia could have social development before they got the economic development. So to me  as a public health professor  it's not strange that all these countries grow so fast now. Because what you see here  what you see here is the flat world of Thomas Friedman  isn't it. It's not really  really flat. But the middle income countries    and this is where I suggest to my students  stop using the concept  developing world.  Because after all  talking about the developing world is like having two chapters in the history of the United States. The last chapter is about present  and president Obama  and the other is about the past  where you cover everything from Washington to Eisenhower. Because Washington to Eisenhower  that is what we find in the developing world. We could actually go to Mayflower to Eisenhower  and that would be put together into a developing world  which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way  which have great entrepreneurs  but also have the collapsing countries. So  how could we make better sense about this  Well  one way of trying is to see whether we could look at income distribution. This is the income distribution of peoples in the world  from   . This is where you have food to eat. These people go to bed hungry. And this is the number of people. This is      whether you have a public or a private health service system. This is where you can provide health service for your family and school for your children  and this is OECD countries  Green  Latin America  East Europe. This is East Asia  and the light blue there is South Asia. And this is how the world changed. It changed like this. Can you see how it's growing  And how hundreds of millions and billions is coming out of poverty in Asia  And it goes over here  And I come now  into projections  but I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there  you know  because    that's where the projections are not valid any longer. Probably the world will do this. and then it will continue forward like this. But more or less  this is what will happen  and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided. We have the high income countries here  with the United States as a leading power  we have the emerging economies in the middle  which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout  and we have the low income countries here. Yeah  this is a fact that from where the money comes  they have been saving  you know  over the last decade. And here we have the low income countries where entrepreneurs are. And here we have the countries in collapse and war  like Afghanistan  Somalia  parts of Congo  Darfur. We have all this at the same time. That's why it's so problematic to describe what has happened in the developing world. Because it's so different  what has happened there. And that's why I suggest a slightly different approach of what you would call it. And you have huge differences within countries also. I heard that your departments here were by regions. Here you have Sub Saharan Africa  South Asia  East Asia  Arab states  East Europe  Latin America  and OECD. And on this axis  GDP. And on this  heath  child survival  and it doesn't come as a surprise that Africa south of Sahara is at the bottom. But when I split it  when I split it into country bubbles  the size of the bubbles here is the population. Then you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius  completely different. There is such a difference within Sub Saharan Africa. And I can split the others. Here is the South Asian  Arab world. Now all your different departments. East Europe  Latin America  and OECD countries. And here were are. We have a continuum in the world. We cannot put it into two parts. It is Mayflower down here. It is Washington here  building  building countries. It's Lincoln here  advancing them. It's Eisenhower bringing modernity into the countries. And then it's United States today  up here. And we have countries all this way. Now  this is the important thing of understanding how the world has changed. At this point I decided to make a pause. And it is my task  on behalf of the rest of the world  to convey a thanks to the U.S. taxpayers  for Demographic Health Survey. Many are not aware of    no  this is not a joke. This is very serious. It is due to USA's continuous sponsoring during    years of the very good methodology for measuring child mortality that we have a grasp of what's happening in the world. And it is U.S. government at its best  without advocacy  providing facts  that it's useful for the society. And providing data free of charge on the internet  for the world to use. Thank you very much. Quite the opposite of the World Bank  who compiled data with government money  tax money  and then they sell it to add a little profit  in a very inefficient  Gutenberg way. But the people doing that at the World Bank are among the best in the world. And they are highly skilled professionals. It's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies to deal with the world in the modern way  as we do. And when it comes to free data and transparency  United States of America is one of the best. And that doesn't come easy from the mouth of a Swedish public health professor. And I'm not paid to come here  no. I would like to show you what happens with the data  what we can show with this data. Look here. This is the world. With income down there and child mortality. And what has happened in the world  Since       during the last    years we have had a fall in child mortality. And it is the DHS that makes it possible to know this. And we had an increase in income. And the blue former developing countries are mixing up with the former industrialized western world. We have a continuum. But we still have  of course  Congo  up there. We still have as poor countries as we have had  always  in history. And that's the bottom billion  where we've heard today about a completely new approach to do it. And how fast has this happened  Well  MDG  . The United States has not been so eager to use MDG  . But you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it  because it's the only child mortality that we can measure. And we used to say that it should fall four percent per year. Let's see what Sweden has done. We used to boast about fast social progress. That's where we were      .       Sweden was there. Same child mortality as Bangladesh had        though they had lower income. They started very well. They used the aid well. They vaccinated the kids. They get better water. And they reduced child mortality  with an amazing  .  percent per year. They beat Sweden. I run Sweden the same    year period. Second round  it's Sweden        against Egypt      . Here we go. Once again the USA is part of the reason here. They get safe water  they get food for the poor  and they get malaria eradicated.  .  percent. They are faster than the millennium development goal. And third chance for Sweden  against Brazil here. Brazil here has amazing social improvement over the last    years  and they go faster than Sweden. This means that the world is converging. The middle income countries  the emerging economy  they are catching up. They are moving to cities  where they also get better assistance for that. Well the Swedish students protest at this point. They say   This is not fair  because these countries had vaccines and antibiotics that were not available for Sweden. We have to do real time competition.  Okay. I give you Singapore  the year I was born. Singapore had twice the child mortality of Sweden. It's the most tropical country in the world  a marshland on the equator. And here we go. It took a little time for them to get independent. But then they started to grow their economy. And they made the social investment. They got away malaria. They got a magnificent health system that beat both the U.S. and Sweden. We never thought it would happen that they would win over Sweden  All these green countries are achieving millennium development goals. These yellow are just about to be doing this. These red are the countries that doesn't do it  and the policy has to be improved. Not simplistic extrapolation. We have to really find a way of supporting those countries in a better way. We have to respect the middle income countries on what they are doing. And we have to fact base the whole way we look at the world. This is dollar per person. This is HIV in the countries. The blue is Africa. The size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected. You see the tragedy in South Africa there. About    percent of the adult population are infected. And in spite of them having quite a high income  they have a huge number of HIV infected. But you also see that there are African countries down here. There is no such thing as an HIV epidemic in Africa. There's a number  five to    countries in Africa that has the same level as Sweden and United States. And there are others who are extremely high. And I will show you that what has happened in one of the best countries  with the most vibrant economy in Africa and a good governance  Botswana. They have a very high level. It's coming down. But now it's not falling  because there  with help from PEPFAR  it's working with treatment. And people are not dying. And you can see it's not that easy  that it is war which caused this. Because here  in Congo  there is war. And here  in Zambia  there is peace. And it's not the economy. Richer country has a little higher. If I split Tanzania in its income  the richer    percent in Tanzania has more HIV than the poorest one. And it's really different within each country. Look at the provinces of Kenya. They are very different. And this is the situation you see. It's not deep poverty. It's the special situation  probably of concurrent sexual partnership among part of the heterosexual population in some countries  or some parts of countries  in south and eastern Africa. Don't make it Africa. Don't make it a race issue. Make it a local issue. And do prevention at each place  in the way it can be done there. So to just end up  there are things of suffering in the one billion poorest  which we don't know. Those who live beyond the cellphone  those who have yet to see a computer  those who have no electricity at home. This is the disease  Konzo  I spent    years elucidating in Africa. It's caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation. It's similar to the pellagra epidemic in Mississippi in the '  s. It's similar to other nutritional diseases. It will never affect a rich person. We have seen it here in Mozambique. This is the epidemic in Mozambique. This is an epidemic in northern Tanzania. You never heard about the disease. But it's much more than Ebola that has been affected by this disease. Cause crippling throughout the world. And over the last two years        people has been crippled in the southern tip of Bandundu region. That used to be the illegal diamond trade  from the UNITA dominated area in Angola. That has now disappeared  and they are now in great economic problem. And one week ago  for the first time  there were four lines on the Internet. Don't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies and the great capacity of people in the middle income countries and in peaceful low income countries. There is still mystery in one billion. And we have to have more concepts than just developing countries and developing world. We need a new mindset. The world is converging  but    but    but not the bottom billion. They are still as poor as they've ever been. It's not sustainable  and it will not happen around one superpower. But you will remain one of the most important superpowers  and the most hopeful superpower  for the time to be. And this institution will have a very crucial role  not for United States  but for the world. So you have a very bad name  State Department. This is not the State Department. It's the World Department. And we have a high hope in you. Thank you very much. I love theater. I love the idea that you can transform  become somebody else and look at life with a completely new perspective. I love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen. The idea that in that room at that moment  everyone  regardless of their age  their gender  their race  their color  their religion  comes together. At that moment  we transcend space and time together. Theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination. And our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers. Our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique. I was commissioned in      to create an original show  and began developing  Upwake.   Upwake  tells the story of Zero  a modern day business man  going to work with his life in a suitcase  stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two. I wanted  Upwake  to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would. And I wanted to let my imagination run wild. So I began drawing the story that was moving in my head. If Antoine de Saint Exupery  the author of  The Little Prince   were here  he would have drawn three holes inside that box and told you your sheep was inside. Because  if you look closely enough  things will begin to appear. This is not a box  these are the renderings of my imagination from head to paper to screen to life. In  Upwake  buildings wear suits  Zero tap dances on a giant keyboard  clones himself with a scanner  tames and whips the computer mice  sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper and launches into space. I wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist. Go from one world to another in a second. I wanted to have humor  beauty  simplicity and complexity and use metaphors to suggest ideas. At the beginning of the show  for example  Zero deejays dream and reality. Technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions in high definition  live  on stage. So today  I would like to talk to you about the relationship between theater and technology. Let's start with technology. All right. Let's start with theater. Thank you.  Upwake  lasts    minutes and    seconds. I project  D animation on all the four surfaces of the stage which I interact with. The use of animation and projection was a process of discovery. I didn't use it as a special effect  but as a partner on stage. There are no special effects in  Upwake   no artifice. It's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal. Three hundred and forty four frames  four and a half years and commissions later  what started as a one person show became a collaborative work of nineteen most talented artists. And here are some excerpts. Thank you. So this is  relatively  a new show that we're now beginning to tour. And in Austin  Texas  I was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon. When I arrived at one of the schools  I certainly did not expect this  Six hundred kids  packed in a gymnasium  waiting. I was a little nervous performing without animation  costume    really    and make up. But the teachers came to me afterward and told me they hadn't seen the kids that attentive. And I think the reason why is that I was able to use their language and their reality in order to transport them into another. Something happened along the way. Zero became a person and not just a character in a play. Zero does not speak  is neither man nor woman. Zero is Zero  a little hero of the   st Century  and Zero can touch so many more people than I possibly could. It's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box as it is about taking theater out of its box. As a street performer  I have learned that everybody wants to connect. And that usually  if you're a bit extraordinary  if you're not exactly of human appearance  then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud. It's as though you made something resonate within them. It's as though the mystery of the person they're interacting with and connecting allows them to be themselves just a bit more. Because through your mask  they let theirs go. Being human is an art form. I know theater can improve the quality of people's lives  and I know theater can heal. I've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years. I have seen sick kids and sad parents and doctors be lifted and transported in moments of pure joy. I know theater unites us. Zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow  tell various stories through different mediums. Comic books. Quantum physics video games. And Zero wants to go to the moon. In       Zero launched a green campaign  suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity every Sunday from      to      p.m. The idea is simple  basic. It's not original  but it's important  and it's important to participate. There is a revolution. It's a human and technological revolution. It's motion and emotion. It's information. It's visual. It's musical. It's sensorial. It's conceptual. It's universal. It's beyond words and numbers. It's happening. The natural progression of science and art finding each other to better touch and define the human experience. There is a revolution in the way that we think  in the way that we share  and the way that we express our stories  our evolution. This is a time of communication  connection and creative collaboration. Charlie Chaplin innovated motion pictures and told stories through music  silence  humor and poetry. He was social  and his character  The Tramp  spoke to millions. He gave entertainment  pleasure and relief to so many human beings when they needed it the most. We are not here to question the possible  we are here to challenge the impossible. In the science of today  we become artists. In the art of today  we become scientists. We design our world. We invent possibilities. We teach  touch and move. It is now that we can use the diversity of our talents to create intelligent  meaningful and extraordinary work. It's now. Thank you. I've been fascinated with crop diversity for about    years from now  ever since I stumbled across a fairly obscure academic article by a guy named Jack Harlan. And he described the diversity within crops    all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such    as a genetic resource. And he said   This genetic resource      and I'll never forget the words     stands between us and catastrophic starvation on a scale we cannot imagine.  I figured he was either really on to something  or he was one of these academic nutcases. So  I looked a little further  and what I figured out was that he wasn't a nutcase. He was the most respected scientist in the field. What he understood was that biological diversity    crop diversity    is the biological foundation of agriculture. It's the raw material  the stuff  of evolution in our agricultural crops. Not a trivial matter. And he also understood that that foundation was crumbling  literally crumbling. That indeed  a mass extinction was underway in our fields  in our agricultural system. And that this mass extinction was taking place with very few people noticing and even fewer caring. Now  I know that many of you don't stop to think about diversity in agricultural systems and  let's face it  that's logical. You don't see it in the newspaper every day. And when you go into the supermarket  you certainly don't see a lot of choices there. You see apples that are red  yellow  and green and that's about it. So  let me show you a picture of one form of diversity. Here's some beans  and there are about    or    different varieties of beans on this picture. Now  imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another about the same way as a poodle from a Great Dane. If I wanted to show you a picture of all the dog breeds in the world  and I put    or    of them on a slide  it would take about    slides because there about     breeds of dogs in the world. But there are    to        different varieties of beans. So if I were to going to show you all the beans in the world  and I had a slide like this  and I switched it every second  it would take up my entire TED talk  and I wouldn't have to say anything. But the interesting thing is that this diversity    and the tragic thing is    that this diversity is being lost. We have about         different varieties of wheat  and we have about   to         different varieties of rice  but it's being lost. And I want to give you an example of that. It's a bit of a personal example  in fact. In the United States  in the     s    that's where we have the best data    farmers and gardeners were growing       named varieties of apples. Imagine that.       apples with names. Today        of those are extinct  no longer to be seen again. I used to have a list of these extinct apples  and when I would go out and give a presentation  I would pass the list out in the audience. I wouldn't tell them what it was  but it was in alphabetical order  and I would tell them to look for their names  their family names  their mother's maiden name. And at the end of the speech  I would ask   How many people have found a name   And I never had fewer than two thirds of an audience hold up their hand. And I said   You know what  These apples come from your ancestors  and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them. They gave them their name. The bad news is they're extinct. The good news is a third of you didn't hold up your hand. Your apple's still out there. Find it. Make sure it doesn't join the list.  So  I want to tell you that the piece of the good news is that the Fowler apple is still out there. And there's an old book back here  and I want to read a piece from it. This book was published in     . It's called  The Apples of New York  and this is the second volume. See  we used to have a lot of apples. And the Fowler apple is described in here    I hope this doesn't surprise you    as   a beautiful fruit.  I don't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us  but ... but  to be honest  the description goes on and it says that it  doesn't rank high in quality  however.  And then he has to go even further. It sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine.  As grown in New York  the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and quality and is  on the whole  unsatisfactory.  And I guess there's a lesson to be learned here  and the lesson is  so why save it  I get this question all the time. Why don't we just save the best one  And there are a couple of answers to that question. One thing is that there is no such thing as a best one. Today's best variety is tomorrow's lunch for insects or pests or disease. The other thing is that maybe that Fowler apple or maybe a variety of wheat that's not economical right now has disease or pest resistance or some quality that we're going to need for climate change that the others don't. So it's not necessary  thank God  that the Fowler apple is the best apple in the world. It's just necessary or interesting that it might have one good  unique trait. And for that reason  we ought to be saving it. Why  As a raw material  as a trait we can use in the future. Think of diversity as giving us options. And options  of course  are exactly what we need in an era of climate change. I want to show you two slides  but first  I want to tell you that we've been working at the Global Crop Diversity Trust with a number of scientists    particularly at Stanford and University of Washington    to ask the question  What's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops to be able to adapt to this  In short  the answer is that in the future  in many countries  the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter than anything those crops have seen in the past. The coldest growing seasons of the future  hotter than the hottest of the past. Is agriculture adapted to that  I don't know. Can fish play the piano  If agriculture hasn't experienced that  how could it be adapted  Now  the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world  and the place where climate change  ironically  is going to be the worst is in South Asia and sub Saharan Africa. So I've picked two examples here  and I want to show you. In the histogram before you now  the blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures  going back about far as we have temperature data. And you can see that there's some difference between one growing season and another. Some are colder  some are hotter and it's a bell shaped curve. The tallest bar is the average temperature for the most number of growing seasons. In the future  later this century  it's going to look like the red  totally out of bounds. The agricultural system and  more importantly  the crops in the field in India have never experienced this before. Here's South Africa. The same story. But the most interesting thing about South Africa is we don't have to wait for      for there to be trouble. By       if the maize  or corn  varieties  which is the dominant crop       percent of the nutrition in Southern Africa are still in the field    in       we'll have a    percent decrease in production of maize because of the climate change already in     .    percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population  that's a food crisis. It's global in nature. We will watch children starve to death on TV. Now  you may say that    years is a long way off. It's two breeding cycles for maize. We have two rolls of the dice to get this right. We have to get climate ready crops in the field  and we have to do that rather quickly. Now  the good news is that we have conserved. We have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity  agricultural diversity  mostly in the form of seed  and we put it in seed banks  which is a fancy way of saying a freezer. If you want to conserve seed for a long term and you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers  you dry it and then you freeze it. Unfortunately  these seed banks are located around the world in buildings and they're vulnerable. Disasters have happened. In recent years we lost the gene bank  the seed bank in Iraq and Afghanistan. You can guess why. In Rwanda  in the Solomon Islands. And then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings  financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures  and all kinds of things  and every time something like this happens  it means extinction. We lose diversity. And I'm not talking about losing diversity in the same way that you lose your car keys. I'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs  actually losing it  never to be seen again. So  a number of us got together and decided that  you know  enough is enough and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility that can really offer protection for our biological diversity of    maybe not the most charismatic diversity. You don't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear  but it's very important diversity. So we needed a really safe place  and we went quite far north to find it. To Svalbard  in fact. This is above mainland Norway. You can see Greenland there. That's at    degrees north. It's as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane. It's a remarkably beautiful landscape. I can't even begin to describe it to you. It's otherworldly  beautiful. We worked with the Norwegian government and with the NorGen  the Norwegian Genetic Resources Program  to design this facility. What you see is an artist's conception of this facility  which is built in a mountain in Svalbard. The idea of Svalbard was that it's cold  so we get natural freezing temperatures. But it's remote. It's remote and accessible so it's safe and we don't depend on mechanical refrigeration. This is more than just an artist's dream  it's now a reality. And this next picture shows it in context  in Svalbard. And here's the front door of this facility. When you open up the front door  this is what you're looking at. It's pretty simple. It's a hole in the ground. It's a tunnel  and you go into the tunnel  chiseled in solid rock  about     meters. There are now a couple of security doors  so you won't see it quite like this. Again  when you get to the back  you get into an area that's really my favorite place. I think of it as sort of a cathedral. And I know that this tags me as a bit of a nerd  but ... Some of the happiest days of my life have been spent ... in this place there. If you were to walk into one of these rooms  you would see this. It's not very exciting  but if you know what's there  it's pretty emotional. We have now about         samples of unique crop varieties. There's        samples of different varieties of rice in this facility right now. About a year from now  we'll have over half a million samples. We're going up to over a million  and someday we'll basically have samples    about     seeds    of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state in this facility. This is a backup system for world agriculture. It's a backup system for all the seed banks. Storage is free. It operates like a safety deposit box. Norway owns the mountain and the facility  but the depositors own the seed. And if anything happens  then they can come back and get it. This particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the United States  of Canada  and an international institution from Syria. I think it's interesting in that this facility  I think  is almost the only thing I can think of these days where countries  literally  every country in the world    because we have seeds from every country in the world    all the countries of the world have gotten together to do something that's both long term  sustainable and positive. I can't think of anything else that's happened in my lifetime that way. I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a solution for climate change  for the water crisis. Agriculture takes    percent of fresh water supplies on earth. I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution for those things  or the energy crisis  or world hunger  or peace in conflict. I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a simple solution for that  but I can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can't solve any of those problems if we don't have crop diversity. Because I challenge you to think of an effective  efficient  sustainable solution to climate change if we don't have crop diversity. Because  quite literally  if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change  neither will we. And if crops don't adapt to climate change  neither will agriculture  neither will we. So  this is not something pretty and nice to do. There are a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exist just for the existence value of it. It is  I agree  a nice thing to do. But it's a necessary thing to do. So  in a very real sense  I believe that we  as an international community  should get organized to complete the task. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a wonderful gift that Norway and others have given us  but it's not the complete answer. We need to collect the remaining diversity that's out there. We need to put it into good seed banks that can offer those seeds to researchers in the future. We need to catalog it. It's a library of life  but right now I would say we don't have a card catalog for it. And we need to support it financially. My big idea would be that while we think of it as commonplace to endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university  we really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat.    million dollars in an endowment would take care of preserving all the diversity in wheat forever. So we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms. And my final thought is that we  of course  by conserving wheat  rice  potatoes  and the other crops  we may  quite simply  end up saving ourselves. Thank you.
