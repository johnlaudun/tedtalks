Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC. And I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked. So this is it. And for those of you that weren't there  the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted       kilometers in circumference. Its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began  up to     million times a second. It's nothing if not ambitious. This is the machine below Geneva. We take the pictures of those mini Big Bangs inside detectors. This is the one I work on. It's called the ATLAS detector       meters wide     meters in diameter. Spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction so you can see the scale. On the   th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time. And this picture was taken by ATLAS. It caused immense celebration in the control room. It's a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LHC  colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately  and showering particles into the detector. In other words  when we saw that picture on September   th we knew the machine worked  which is a great triumph. I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer  or this  when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that. It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact. About a week later we had a problem with the machine  related actually to these bits of wire here    these gold wires. Those wires carry    thousand amps when the machine is working in full power. Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say   No they don't. They're small wires.  They can do that because when they are very cold they are what's called superconducting wire. So at minus     degrees  colder than the space between the stars  those wires can take that current. In one of the joints between over       magnets in LHC  there was a manufacturing defect. So the wire heated up slightly  and its        amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance. This was the result. Now that's more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over    tons  and they moved about a foot. So we damaged about    of the magnets. We had to take them out  which we did. We reconditioned them all  fixed them. They're all on their way back underground now. By the end of March the LHC will be intact again. We will switch it on  and we expect to take data in June or July  and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are. Now of course  in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge. It's easy to refute. I think that the fact that it's so difficult  the fact that we're overreaching  is the value of things like the LHC. I will leave the final word to an English scientist  Humphrey Davy  who  I suspect  when defending his protege's useless experiments    his protege was Michael Faraday    said this   Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate  that there are no mysteries in nature  that our triumphs are complete  and that there are no new worlds to conquer.  Thank you. We look around the media  as we see on the news from Iraq  Afghanistan  Sierra Leone  and the conflict seems incomprehensible to us. And that's certainly how it seemed to me when I started this project. But as a physicist  I thought  well if you give me some data  I could maybe understand this. You know  give us a go. So as a naive New Zealander I thought  well I'll go to the Pentagon. Can you get me some information  No. So I had to think a little harder. And I was watching the news one night in Oxford. And I looked down at the chattering heads on my channel of choice. And I saw that there was information there. There was data within the streams of news that we consume. All this noise around us actually has information. So what I started thinking was  perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here. If we can get enough of these streams of information together  we can perhaps start to understand the war. So this is exactly what I did. We started bringing a team together  an interdisciplinary team of scientists  of economists  mathematicians. We brought these guys together and we started to try and solve this. We did it in three steps. The first step we did was to collect. We did     different sources of information    from NGO reports to newspapers and cable news. We brought this raw data in and we filtered it. We extracted the key bits on information to build the database. That database contained the timing of attacks  the location  the size and the weapons used. It's all in the streams of information we consume daily  we just have to know how to pull it out. And once we had this we could start doing some cool stuff. What if we were to look at the distribution of the sizes of attacks  What would that tell us  So we started doing this. And you can see here on the horizontal axis you've got the number of people killed in an attack or the size of the attack. And on the vertical axis you've got the number of attacks. So we plot data for sample on this. You see some sort of random distribution    perhaps    attacks  one person was killed  or    attacks where seven people were killed. We did this exact same thing for Iraq. And we didn't know  for Iraq what we were going to find. It turns out what we found was pretty surprising. You take all of the conflict  all of the chaos  all of the noise  and out of that comes this precise mathematical distribution of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict. This blew our mind. Why should a conflict like Iraq have this as its fundamental signature  Why should there be order in war  We didn't really understand that. We thought maybe there is something special about Iraq. So we looked at a few more conflicts. We looked at Colombia  we looked at Afghanistan  and we looked at Senegal. And the same pattern emerged in each conflict. This wasn't supposed to happen. These are different wars  with different religious factions  different political factions  and different socioeconomic problems. And yet the fundamental patterns underlying them are the same. So we went a little wider. We looked around the world at all the data we could get our hands on. From Peru to Indonesia  we studied this same pattern again. And we found that not only were the distributions these straight lines  but the slope of these lines  they clustered around this value of alpha equals  . . And we could generate an equation that could predict the likelihood of an attack. What we're saying here is the probability of an attack killing X number of people in a country like Iraq is equal to a constant  times the size of that attack  raised to the power of negative alpha. And negative alpha is the slope of that line I showed you before. So what  This is data  statistics. What does it tell us about these conflicts  That was a challenge we had to face as physicists. How do we explain this  And what we really found was that alpha  if we think about it  is the organizational structure of the insurgency. Alpha is the distribution of the sizes of attacks  which is really the distribution of the group strength carrying out the attacks. So we look at a process of group dynamics  coalescence and fragmentation  groups coming together  groups breaking apart. And we start running the numbers on this. Can we simulate it  Can we create the kind of patterns that we're seeing in places like Iraq  Turns out we kind of do a reasonable job. We can run these simulations. We can recreate this using a process of group dynamics to explain the patterns that we see all around the conflicts around the world. So what's going on  Why should these different    seemingly different conflicts have the same patterns  Now what I believe is going on is that the insurgent forces  they evolve over time. They adapt. And it turns out there is only one solution to fight a much stronger enemy. And if you don't find that solution as an insurgent force  you don't exist. So every insurgent force that is ongoing  every conflict that is ongoing  it's going to look something like this. And that is what we think is happening. Taking it forward  how do we change it  How do we end a war like Iraq  What does it look like  Alpha is the structure. It's got a stable state at  . . This is what wars look like when they continue. We've got to change that. We can push it up  the forces become more fragmented  there is more of them  but they are weaker. Or we push it down  they're more robust  there is less groups  but perhaps you can sit and talk to them. So this graph here  I'm going to show you now. No one has seen this before. This is literally stuff that we've come through last week. And we see the evolution of Alpha through time. We see it start. And we see it grow up to the stable state the wars around the world look like. And it stays there through the invasion of Fallujah until the Samarra bombings in the Iraqi elections of '  . And the system gets perturbed. It moves upwards to a fragmented state. This is when the surge happens. And depending on who you ask  the surge was supposed to push it up even further. The opposite happened. The groups became stronger. They became more robust. And so I'm thinking  right  great  it's going to keep going down. We can talk to them. We can get a solution. The opposite happened. It's moved up again. The groups are more fragmented. And this tells me one of two things. Either we're back where we started and the surge has had no effect  or finally the groups have been fragmented to the extent that we can start to think about maybe moving out. I don't know what the answer is to that. But I know that we should be looking at the structure of the insurgency to answer that question. Thank you. What I want to do today is to spend some time talking about some stuff that's sort of giving me a little bit of existential angst  for lack of a better word  over the past couple of years  and basically  these three quotes tell what's going on.  When God made the color purple  God was just showing off   Alice Walker wrote in  The Color Purple   and Zora Neale Hurston wrote in  Dust Tracks On A Road    Research is a formalized curiosity. It's poking and prying with a purpose.  And then finally  when I think about the near future  you know  we have this attitude  well  whatever happens  happens. Right  So that goes along with the Chesire Cat saying   If you don't care much where you want to get to  it doesn't much matter which way you go.  But I think it does matter which way we go  and what road we take  because when I think about design in the near future  what I think are the most important issues  what's really crucial and vital is that we need to revitalize the arts and sciences right now in     . If we describe the near future as            years from now  that means that what we do today is going to be critically important  because in the year       and the year             the world our society is going to be building on  the basic knowledge and abstract ideas  the discoveries that we came up with today  just as all these wonderful things we're hearing about here at the TED conference that we take for granted in the world right now  were really knowledge and ideas that came up in the '  s  the '  s  and the '  s. That's the substrate that we're exploiting today  whether it's the internet  genetic engineering  laser scanners  guided missiles  fiber optics  high definition television  sensing  remote sensing from space and the wonderful remote sensing photos that we see in  D weaving  TV programs like Tracker  and Enterprise  CD rewrite drives  flatscreen  Alvin Ailey's Suite Otis  or Sarah Jones'  Your Revolution Will Not Be Between These Thighs   which by the way was banned by the FCC  or ska  all of these things without question  almost without exception  are really based on ideas and abstract and creativity from years before  so we have to ask ourselves  what are we contributing to that legacy right now  And when I think about it  I'm really worried. To be quite frank  I'm concerned. I'm skeptical that we're doing very much of anything. We're  in a sense  failing to act in the future. We're purposefully  consciously being laggards. We're lagging behind. Frantz Fanon  who was a psychiatrist from Martinique  said   Each generation must  out of relative obscurity  discover its mission  and fulfill or betray it.  What is our mission  What do we have to do  I think our mission is to reconcile  to reintegrate science and the arts  because right now there's a schism that exists in popular culture. You know  people have this idea that science and the arts are really separate. We think of them as separate and different things  and this idea was probably introduced centuries ago  but it's really becoming critical now  because we're making decisions about our society every day that  if we keep thinking that the arts are separate from the sciences  and we keep thinking it's cute to say   I don't understand anything about this one  I don't understand anything about the other one   then we're going to have problems. Now I know no one here at TED thinks this. All of us  we already know that they're very connected  but I'm going to let you know that some folks in the outside world  believe it or not  they think it's neat when they say   You know  scientists and science is not creative. Maybe scientists are ingenious  but they're not creative. And then we have this tendency  the career counselors and various people say things like   Artists are not analytical. They're ingenious  perhaps  but not analytical   and when these concepts underly our teaching and what we think about the world  then we have a problem  because we stymie support for everything. By accepting this dichotomy  whether it's tongue in cheek  when we attempt to accommodate it in our world  and we try to build our foundation for the world  we're messing up the future  because  who wants to be uncreative  Who wants to be illogical  Talent would run from either of these fields if you said you had to choose either. Then they're going to go to something where they think   Well  I can be creative and logical at the same time.  Now I grew up in the '  s and I'll admit it  actually  my childhood spanned the '  s  and I was a wannabe hippie and I always resented the fact that I wasn't really old enough to be a hippie. And I know there are people here  the younger generation who want to be hippies  but people talk about the '  s all the time  and they talk about the anarchy that was there  but when I think about the '  s  what I took away from it was that there was hope for the future. We thought everyone could participate. There were wonderful  incredible ideas that were always percolating  and so much of what's cool or hot today is really based on some of those concepts  whether it's  you know  people trying to use the prime directive from Star Trek being involved in things  or again that three dimensional weaving and fax machines that I read about in my weekly readers that the technology and engineering was just getting started. But the '  s left me with a problem. You see  I always assumed I would go into space  because I followed all of this  but I also loved the arts and sciences. You see  when I was growing up as a little girl and as a teenager  I loved designing and making dogs' clothes and wanting to be a fashion designer. I took art and ceramics. I loved dance. Lola Falana. Alvin Ailey. Jerome Robbins. And I also avidly followed the Gemini and the Apollo programs. I had science projects and tons of astronomy books. I took calculus and philosophy. I wondered about the infinity and the Big Bang theory. And when I was at Stanford  I found myself  my senior year  chemical engineering major  half the folks thought I was a political science and performing arts major  which was sort of true because I was Black Student Union President and I did major in some other things  and I found myself the last quarter juggling chemical engineering separation processes  logic classes  nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy  and also producing and choreographing a dance production  and I had to do the lighting and the design work  and I was trying to figure out  do I go to New York City to try to become a professional dancer  or do I go to medical school  Now  my mother helped me figure that one out.  Laughter  But when I went into space  when I went into space I carried a number of things up with me. I carried a poster by Alvin Ailey  which you can figure out now  I love the dance company. An Alvin Ailey poster of Judith Jamison performing the dance  Cry   dedicated to all black women everywhere. A Bundu statue  which was from the Women's Society in Sierra Leone  and a certificate for the Chicago Public School students to work to improve their science and math  and folks asked me   Why did you take up what you took up   And I had to say   Because it represents human creativity  the creativity that allowed us  that we were required to have to conceive and build and launch the space shuttle  springs from the same source as the imagination and analysis it took to carve a Bundu statue  or the ingenuity it took to design  choreograph  and stage  Cry.  Each one of them are different manifestations  incarnations  of creativity  avatars of human creativity  and that's what we have to reconcile in our minds  how these things fit together. The difference between arts and sciences is not analytical versus intuitive  right  E MC squared required an intuitive leap  and then you had to do the analysis afterwards. Einstein said  in fact   The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.  Dance requires us to express and want to express the jubilation in life  but then you have to figure out  exactly what movement do I do to make sure that it comes across correctly  The difference between arts and sciences is also not constructive versus deconstructive  right  A lot of people think of the sciences as deconstructive. You have to pull things apart. And yeah  sub atomic physics is deconstructive. You literally try to tear atoms apart to understand what's inside of them. But sculpture  from what I understand from great sculptors  is deconstructive  because you see a piece and you remove what doesn't need to be there. Biotechnology is constructive. Orchestral arranging is constructive. So in fact we use constructive and deconstructive techniques in everything. The difference between science and the arts is not that they are different sides of the same coin  even  or even different parts of the same continuum  but rather they're manifestations of the same thing. Different quantum states of an atom  Or maybe if I want to be more   st century I could say that they are different harmonic resonances of a superstring. But we'll leave that alone.  Laughter  They spring from the same source. The arts and sciences are avatars of human creativity. It's our attempt as humans to build an understanding of the universe  the world around us. It's our attempt to influence things  the universe internal to ourselves and external to us. The sciences  to me  are manifestations of our attempt to express or share our understanding  our experience  to influence the universe external to ourselves. It doesn't rely on us as individuals. It's the universe  as experienced by everyone  and the arts manifest our desire  our attempt to share or influence others through experiences that are peculiar to us as individuals. Let me say it again another way  science provides an understanding of a universal experience  and arts provides a universal understanding of a personal experience. That's what we have to think about  that they're all part of us  they're all part of a continuum. It's not just the tools  it's not just the sciences  you know  the mathematics and the numerical stuff and the statistics  because we heard  very much on this stage  people talked about music being mathematical. Right  Arts don't just use clay  aren't the only ones that use clay  light and sound and movement. They use analysis as well. So people might say  well  I still like that intuitive versus analytical thing  because everybody wants to do the right brain  left brain thing  right  We've all been accused of being right brained or left brained at some point in time  depending on who we disagreed with.  Laughter  You know  people say intuitive  you know that's like you're in touch with nature  in touch with yourself and relationships. Analytical  you put your mind to work  and I'm going to tell you a little secret. You all know this though  but sometimes people use this analysis idea  that things are outside of ourselves  to be  say  that this is what we're going to elevate as the true  most important sciences  right  And then you have artists  and you all know this is true as well  artists will say things about scientists because they say they're too concrete  they're disconnected with the world. But  we've even had that here on stage  so don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.  Laughter  We had folks talking about the Flat Earth Society and flower arrangers  so there's this whole dichotomy that we continue to carry along  even when we know better. And folks say we need to choose either or. But it would really be foolish to choose either one  right  Intuitive versus analytical  That's a foolish choice. It's foolish  just like trying to choose between being realistic or idealistic. You need both in life. Why do people do this  I'm just gonna quote a molecular biologist  Sydney Brenner  who's    years old so he can say this. He said   It's always important to distinguish between chastity and impotence.  Now...  Laughter  I want to share with you a little equation  okay  How do understanding science and the arts fit into our lives and what's going on and the things that we're talking about here at the design conference  and this is a little thing I came up with  understanding and our resources and our will cause us to have outcomes. Our understanding is our science  our arts  our religion  how we see the universe around us  our resources  our money  our labor  our minerals  those things that are out there in the world we have to work with. But more importantly  there's our will. This is our vision  our aspirations of the future  our hopes  our dreams  our struggles and our fears. Our successes and our failures influence what we do with all of those  and to me  design and engineering  craftsmanship and skilled labor  are all the things that work on this to have our outcome  which is our human quality of life. Where do we want the world to be  And guess what  Regardless of how we look at this  whether we look at arts and sciences are separate or different  they're both being influenced now and they're both having problems. I did a project called S.E.E.ing the Future  Science  Engineering and Education  and it was looking at how to shed light on most effective use of government funding. We got a bunch of scientists in all stages of their careers. They came to Dartmouth College  where I was teaching  and they talked about with theologians and financiers  what are some of the issues of public funding for science and engineering research  What's most important about it  There are some ideas that emerged that I think have really powerful parallels to the arts. The first thing they said was that the circumstances that we find ourselves in today in the sciences and engineering that made us world leaders is very different than the '  s  the '  s  and the '  s and the '  s when we emerged as world leaders  because we're no longer in competition with fascism  with Soviet style communism  and by the way that competition wasn't just military  it included social competition and political competition as well  that allowed us to look at space as one of those platforms to prove that our social system was better. Another thing they talked about was the infrastructure that supports the sciences is becoming obsolete. We look at universities and colleges  small  mid sized community colleges across the country  their laboratories are becoming obsolete  and this is where we train most of our science workers and our researchers  and our teachers  by the way  and then that there's a media that doesn't support the dissemination of any more than the most mundane and inane of information. There's pseudo science  crop circles  alien autopsy  haunted houses  or disasters. And that's what we see. And this isn't really the information you need to operate in everyday life and figure out how to participate in this democracy and determine what's going on. They also said that there's a change in the corporate mentality. Whereas government money had always been there for basic science and engineering research  we also counted on some companies to do some basic research  but what's happened now is companies put more energy into short term product development than they do in basic engineering and science research. And education is not keeping up. In K through     people are taking out wet labs. They think if we put a computer in the room it's going to take the place of actually  we're mixing the acids  we're growing the potatoes. And government funding is decreasing in spending and then they're saying  let's have corporations take over  and that's not true. Government funding should at least do things like recognize cost benefits of basic science and engineering research. We have to know that we have a responsibility as global citizens in this world. We have to look at the education of humans. We need to build our resources today to make sure that they're trained so that they understand the importance of these things  and we have to support the vitality of science  and that doesn't mean that everything has to have one thing that's going to go on  or we know exactly what's going to be the outcome of it  but that we support the vitality and the intellectual curiosity that goes along  and if you think about those parallels to the arts  the competition with the Bolshoi Ballet spurred the Joffrey and the New York City Ballet to become better. Infrastructure museums  theaters  movie houses across the country are disappearing. We have more television stations with less to watch  we have more money spent on rewrites to get old television programs in the movies. We have corporate funding now that  when it goes to some company  when it goes to support the arts  it almost requires that the product be part of the picture that the artist draws  and we have stadiums that are named over and over again by corporations. In Houston  we're trying to figure out what to do with that Enron Stadium thing. in the schools is disappearing  and we have a government that seems like it's gutting the NEA and other programs  so we have to really stop and think  what are we trying to do with the sciences and the arts  There's a need to revitalize them. We have to pay attention to it. I just want to tell you really quickly what I'm doing. I want to tell you what I've been doing a little bit since... I feel this need to sort of integrate some of the ideas that I've had and run across over time. One of the things that I found out is that there's a need to repair the dichotomy between the mind and body as well. My mother always told me  you have to be observant  know what's going on in your mind and your body  and as a dancer I had this tremendous faith in my ability to know my body  just as I knew how to sense colors. Then I went to medical school  and I was supposed to just go on what the machine said about bodies. You know  you would ask patients questions and some people would tell you   Don't  don't  don't listen to what the patients said.  We know that patients know and understand their bodies better  but these days we're trying to divorce them from that idea. We have to reconcile the patient's knowledge of their body with physician's measurements. We had someone talk about measuring emotions and getting machines to figure out what  to keep us from acting crazy. Right  No  we shouldn't measure  we shouldn't use machines to measure road rage and then do something to keep us from engaging in it. Maybe we can have machines help us to recognize that we have road rage and then we need to know how to control that without the machines. We even need to be able to recognize that without the machines. What I'm very concerned about is how do we bolster our self awareness as humans  as biological organisms  Michael Moschen spoke of having to teach and learn how to feel with my eyes  to see with my hands. We have all kinds of possibilities to use our senses by  and that's what we have to do. That's what I want to do  is to try to use bioinstrumentation  those kind of things to help our senses in what we do  and that's the work I've been doing now as a company called BioSentient Corporation. I figured I'd have to do that ad  because I'm an entrepreneur  because entrepreneur says that that's somebody who does what they want to do because they're not broke enough that they have to get a real job. with BioSentient Corporation trying to figure out how do we integrate these things  Let me finish by saying that my personal design issue for the future is really about integrating  to think about that intuitive and that analytical. The arts and sciences are not separate. High school physics lesson before you leave. High school physics teacher used to hold up a ball. She would say this ball has potential energy  but nothing will happen to it  it can't do any work until I drop it and it changes states. I like to think of ideas as potential energy. They're really wonderful  but nothing will happen until we risk putting them into action. This conference is filled with wonderful ideas. We're going to share lots of things with people  but nothing's going to happen until we risk putting those ideas into action. We need to revitalize the arts and sciences of today  we need to take responsibility for the future. We can't hide behind saying it's just for company profits  or it's just a business  or I'm an artist or an academician. Here's how you judge what you're doing. I talked about that balance between intuitive  analytical. Fran Lebowitz  my favorite cynic  she said the three questions of greatest concern  now I'm going to add on to design  is   Is it attractive   That's the intuitive.  Is it amusing   The analytical.  And does it know its place   The balance. Thank you very much. This is a sculpture I made  which is a way of  kind of  freeing a form into an object that has different degrees of freedom. So  it can balance on a point. This is a bronze ball  an aluminum arm here  and then this wooden disk. And the wooden disk was really thought about as something that you'd want to hold on to  and that would glide easily through your hands. The aluminum is because it's very light. The bronze is nice hard  durable material that could roll on the ground. Inside of the bronze ball there's a lead weight that is free swinging on an axle that's on two bearings that pass in between  across it  like this  that counterbalance this weight. So it allows it to roll. And the sphere has that balance property that it always sort of stays still and looks the same from every direction. But if you put something on top of it  it disbalances it. And so it would tip over. But in this case because the interior is free swinging in relation to the sphere  it can stand up on one point. And then there was a second level to this object  which is that it    I wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in  which is the diameter of the Moon and the diameter of the Earth in proportion to each other. I was exploring  really early on  wanting to make things float in the air. And I thought up a lot of ideas. This is sculpture that I made that    it's magnetically levitated. The thing is  is that it's slightly dangerous. Normally it's sort of cordoned off when it's in a museum. But it's uh    let's see if I can manipulate it a little bit without  um    oops. So this is just floating  floating on a permanent magnetic field  which stabilizes it in all directions. Except there is a slight tether here  which keeps it from going over the top of its field. It's sort of surfing on a magnetic field at the crest of a wave. And that's what supports the object and keeps it stable. I think we could roll the tape  admin. I have a sort of a collection of videos that I took of different installations  which I could narrate. This is a sculpture of the Sun and the Earth  in proportion. Representing that eight and a half minutes that it takes light and gravity to connect the two. So here is the Earth. It's a little less than a millimeter that was turned of solid bronze. And here is a similar sculpture. That's the Sun at that end. And then in a series of    balls  it reduces  proportionately    each ball and the spaces between them reduce proportionately  until they get down to this little Earth. This is in a sculpture park in Taejon. This one is about the Moon and then the distance to the Earth  in proportion also. This is a little stone ball  floating. As you can see the little tether  that it's also magnetically levitated. And then this is the first part of    this is     spheres  since the Sun is     times the diameter of the Earth. And so this is the size of the Sun. And then each of these little spheres is the size of the Earth in proportion to the Sun. It's made up of    concentric shells. Each one has    spheres. This is in the courtyard of a twelfth century alchemist. I was thinking that the Sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist.  Laughter  So this  again  is on the subject    a slice from the equator of the Earth. And then the Moon in the center  and it's floating. And this is in France. This is in Sapporo. It's balancing on a shaft and a ball  right at the center of gravity  or just slightly above the center of gravity  which means that the lower half of the object is just a little bit more weighty. So you can see it rotating here. It weighs about a ton or over a ton. It's made of stainless steel  quite thick. But it's being balanced like that in equilibrium. It's susceptible to motion by the air currents. This is another species of work that I do. These are these arrays. These spheres are all suspended  but they have magnets horizontally in them that make them all like compasses. So all the red sides  for example  face one direction  south. And the blue side  the compliment  faces the other way. So as you turn around you're seeing different colors. This is based on the structure of a diamond. It was a diamond cell structure was the point of departure. And then there were kind of large spaces in the hollows between the atoms. And so I placed one more element of each one of them. These were white spheres. Then I had video projectors that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres. So they would catch parts of the images  and make sort of three dimensional color volumes  as you walk through it  through the object. This is something I did of a tactile communication system. It was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture  and then putting it into a communication system. This is an idea of moving a sculpture  a ball  that would be directed around the room by a computer. This is a clock I designed. It has Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion Map edited here. It turns once per day in synchrony with the Earth. And then  this is like projects that are harder to build. This has a diamond bottomed lake. So it's a floating island with water  fresh water  that can fly from place to place. This would be grown  I suppose  with nanotechnology in the future sometime. In the course of doing my work I sort of have a broad range of interests. And some of it is just the idea of creating media    media as a sculpture  something that would keep the sculpture fresh and ever changing  by just creating the media that the sculpture is made of. And I had a lot of    always interested in the concept of a crystal ball. And the idea that you could see things inside of a crystal ball and predict the future    or a television set  where it's sort of like a magic box where anything can appear. I had thought about  a long time ago  in the late '  s    when I was just starting out  I was under the influence of thinking about Buckminster Fuller's grand project for an electric globe across from the United Nations    and other things that were happening  the space program at that time  and Whole Earth Catalog  things like that. I was thinking about mass produced spherical television sets that could be linked to orbiting camera satellites. So if we could roll the next film here. This has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations. But this the current version of it  is a flying airship that is about    meters in diameter  about     feet in diameter. The whole surface of it is covered with    million diodes  red  blue  and green  that allow you to have a high resolution picture  visible in daylight. I came with a plan. I brought it to Paul MacCready's company AeroVironment to do a feasibility study  and they analyzed it  and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it. So we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen. This is the control room inside of the ship. The idea of this air genie is  it's something that can just transform and become anything. It's like a traveling show. It has speakers on it. And it has cameras over the surface of it. So it can see its environment  and then it can mimic its environment and disappear. Here the legs are retracting. The cabin is open or closed  as you like. It weighs about    tons. It has on board generators. It can generate about a million kilowatts  in order to be bright enough to be visible in daylight. The idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show. It really would be dedicated to the arts and to interacting. There would be on board a crew of artists  musicians  that would allow the thing to become actually kind of a conscious object that would respond to the moment  and to interact as an entity that was aware  that could communicate. It's completely silent and nonpolluting. It has electric motors with a novel propulsion system. It could be interacted with large crowds in different ways. Primarily I would be interested in how it would interact with  say  going to a college campus  and then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences  the world  the situation of the globe. The default image on the object would probably be a high resolution Earth image. But then one could interact with that and show plate tectonics or global warming issues  or migrations    all of the things that we're concerned with today. And then at night the idea is that it would be used as kind of a rave situation  where the people could cut loose  and the music and the lights  and everything. So it could land in a park  for example. Or this could represent a college green. And then it would have a corresponding website that would show the itinerary of this. And so interacting with the same kind of imagery. It would also be able to be an open code  so people could interact with it. It would be forum for people's ideas about what they would like to see on a giant screen of this type. So that's pretty much it. Okay. Thank you. Last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap  which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower    states  has shrunk by    percent. But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice. The arctic ice cap is  in a sense  the beating heart of the global climate system. It expands in winter and contracts in summer. The next slide I show you will be a rapid fast forward of what's happened over the last    years. The permanent ice is marked in red. As you see  it expands to the dark blue    that's the annual ice in winter  and it contracts in summer. The so called permanent ice  five years old or older  you can see is almost like blood  spilling out of the body here. In    years it's gone from this  to this. This is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean  where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which  when it thaws  is turned into methane by microbes. Compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere  that amount could double if we cross this tipping point. Already in some shallow lakes in Alaska  methane is actively bubbling up out of the water. Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter. Video  Whoa   Laughter  Al Gore  She's okay. The question is whether we will be. And one reason is  this enormous heat sink heats up Greenland from the north. This is an annual melting river. But the volumes are much larger than ever. This is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland. If you want to know how sea level rises from land base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea. These flows are increasing very rapidly. At the other end of the planet  Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet. Last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance. And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under sea islands  is particularly rapid in its melting. That's equal to    feet of sea level  as is Greenland. In the Himalayas  the third largest mass of ice  at the top you see new lakes  which a few years ago were glaciers.    percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow. In the Andes  this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city. The flows have increased. But when they go away  so does much of the drinking water. In California there has been a    percent decline in the Sierra snowpack. This is hitting the reservoirs. And the predictions  as you've read  are serious. This drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires. And the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate. Four times as many in the last    years as in the previous   . This is a completely unsustainable pattern. If you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing. In the last five years we've added    million tons of CO  every    hours       million tons every day to the oceans. Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific  from the Americas  extending westward  and on either side of the Indian subcontinent  where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans. The biggest single cause of global warming  along with deforestation  which is    percent of it  is the burning of fossil fuels. Oil is a problem  and coal is the most serious problem. The United States is one of the two largest emitters  along with China. And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants. But we're beginning to see a sea change. Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed. However there is a political battle in our country. And the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal  which is an oxymoron. That image reminded me of something. Around Christmas  in my home in Tennessee  a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled. You probably saw it on the news. This  all over the country  is the second largest waste stream in America. This happened around Christmas. One of the coal industry's ads around Christmas was this one. Video     Frosty the coal man is a jolly  happy soul. He's abundant here in America  and he helps our economy grow. Frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday. He's affordable and adorable  and workers keep their pay. Al Gore  This is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia. The largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal. Video  Don Blankenship  Let me be clear about it. Al Gore  Nancy Pelosi  Harry Reid  they don't know what they're talking about. Al Gore  So the Alliance for Climate Protection has launched two campaigns. This is one of them  part of one of them. Video  Actor  At COALergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business. That's why we've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal. The fact is  coal isn't dirty. We think it's clean    smells good  too. So don't worry about climate change. Leave that up to us. Video  Actor  Clean coal    you've heard a lot about it. So let's take a tour of this state of the art clean coal facility. Amazing  The machinery is kind of loud. But that's the sound of clean coal technology. And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming  the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything. Take a good long look  this is today's clean coal technology. Al Gore  Finally  the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge. Video  Narrator  America is in crisis    the economy  national security  the climate crisis. The thread that links them all  our addiction to carbon based fuels  like dirty coal and foreign oil. But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess. Repower America with     percent clean electricity within    years. A plan to put America back to work  make us more secure  and help stop global warming. Finally  a solution that's big enough to solve our problems. Repower America. Find out more. Al Gore  This is the last one. Video  Narrator  It's about repowering America. One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet. Man  Future's over here. Wind  sun  a new energy grid. Man     New investments to create high paying jobs. Narrator  Repower America. It's time to get real. Al Gore  There is an old African proverb that says   If you want to go quickly  go alone. If you want to go far  go together.  We need to go far  quickly. Thank you very much. I'm not at all a cook. So don't fear  this is not going to be a cooking demonstration. But I do want to talk to you about something that I think is dear to all of us. And that is bread    something which is as simple as our basic  most fundamental human staple. And I think few of us spend the day without eating bread in some form. Unless you're on one of these Californian low carb diets  bread is standard. Bread is not only standard in the Western diet. As I will show to you  it is actually the mainstay of modern life. So I'm going to bake bread for you. In the meantime I'm also talking to you  so my life is going to be complicated. Bear with me. First of all  a little bit of audience participation. I have two loaves of bread here. One is a supermarket standard  white bread  pre packaged  which I'm told is called a Wonderbread. I didn't know this word until I arrived. And this is more or less  a whole meal  handmade  small bakery loaf of bread. Here we go. I want to see a show of hands. Who prefers the whole meal bread  Okay let me do this differently. Is anybody preferring the Wonderbread at all  I have two tentative male hands. Okay  now the question is really  why is this so  And I think it is because we feel that this kind of bread really is about authenticity. It's about a traditional way of living. A way that is perhaps more real  more honest. This is an image from Tuscany  where we feel agriculture is still about beauty. And life is really  too. And this is about good taste  good traditions. Why do we have this image  Why do we feel that this is more true than this  Well I think it has a lot to do with our history. In the        years since agriculture evolved  most of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalists or they were closely related to food production. And we have this mythical image of how life was in rural areas in the past. Art has helped us to maintain that kind of image. It was a mythical past. Of course  the reality is quite different. These poor farmers working the land by hand or with their animals  had yield levels that are comparable to the poorest farmers today in West Africa. But we have  somehow  in the course of the last few centuries  or even decades  started to cultivate an image of a mythical  rural agricultural past. It was only     years ago that we had the advent of the Industrial Revolution. And while I'm starting to make some bread for you here  it's very important to understand what that revolution did to us. It brought us power. It brought us mechanization  fertilizers. And it actually drove up our yields. And even sort of horrible things  like picking beans by hand  can now be done automatically. All that is a real  great improvement  as we shall see. Of course we also  particularly in the last decade  managed to envelop the world in a dense chain of supermarkets  in a chain of global trade. And it means that you now eat products  which can come from all around the world. That is the reality of our modern life. Now you may prefer this loaf of bread. Excuse my hands but this is how it is. But actually the real relevant bread  historically  is this white Wonder loaf. And don't despise the white bread because it really  I think  symbolizes the fact that bread and food have become plentiful and affordable to all. And that is a feat that we are not really conscious of that much. But it has changed the world. This tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways and has a lot of problems has changed the world. So what is happening  Well the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution with modernization of agriculture in the last few decades  since the     s  food availability  per head  in this world  has increased by    percent. And the world population in the meantime has doubled. That means that we have now more food available than ever before in human history. And that is the result  directly  of being so successful at increasing the scale and volume of our production. And this is true  as you can see  for all countries  including the so called developing countries. What happened to our bread in the meantime  As food became plentiful here  it also meant that we were able to decrease the number of people working in agriculture to something like  on average  in the high income countries  five percent or less of the population. In the U.S. only one percent of the people are actually farmers. And it frees us all up to do other things    to sit at TED meetings and not to worry about our food. That is  historically  a really unique situation. Never before has the responsibility to feed the world been in the hands of so few people. And never before have so many people been oblivious of that fact. So as food became more plentiful  bread became cheaper. And as it became cheaper  bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things. We added in more sugar. We add in raisins and oil and milk and all kinds of things to make bread  from a simple food into kind of a support for calories. And today  bread now is associated with obesity  which is very strange. It is the basic  most fundamental food that we've had in the last ten thousand years. Wheat is the most important crop    the first crop we domesticated and the most important crop we still grow today. But this is now this strange concoction of high calories. And that's not only true in this country  it is true all over the world. Bread has migrated to tropical countries  where the middle classes now eat French rolls and hamburgers and where the commuters find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava. So bread has become from a main staple  a source of calories associated with obesity and also a source of modernity  of modern life. And the whiter the bread  in many countries  the better it is. So this is the story of bread as we know it now. But of course the price of mass production has been that we moved large scale. And large scale has meant destruction of many of our landscapes  destruction of biodiversity    still a lonely emu here in the Brazilian cerrado soybean fields. The costs have been tremendous    water pollution  all the things you know about  destruction of our habitats. What we need to do is to go back to understanding what our food is about. And this is where I have to query all of you. How many of you can actually tell wheat apart from other cereals  How many of you actually can make a bread in this way  without starting with a bread machine or just some kind of packaged flavor  Can you actually bake bread  Do you know how much a loaf of bread actually costs  We have become very removed from what our bread really is  which  again  evolutionarily speaking  is very strange. In fact not many of you know that our bread  of course  was not a European invention. It was invented by farmers in Iraq and Syria in particular. The tiny spike on the left to the center is actually the forefather of wheat. This is where it all comes from  and where these farmers who actually  ten thousand years ago  put us on the road of bread. Now it is not surprising that with this massification and large scale production  there is a counter movement that emerged    very much also here in California. The counter movement says   Let's go back to this. Let's go back to traditional farming. Let's go back to small scale  to farmers' markets  small bakeries and all that.  Wonderful. Don't we all agree  I certainly agree. I would love to go back to Tuscany to this kind of traditional setting  gastronomy  good food. But this is a fallacy. And the fallacy comes from idealizing a past that we have forgotten about. If we do this  if we want to stay with traditional small scale farming we are going  actually  to relegate these poor farmers and their husbands    among whom I have lived for many years  working without electricity and water  to try to improve their food production    we relegate them to poverty. What they want are implements to increase their production  something to fertilize the soil  something to protect their crop and to bring it to a market. We cannot just think that small scale is the solution to the world food problem. It's a luxury solution for us who can afford it  if you want to afford it. In fact we do not want this poor woman to work the land like this. If we say just small scale production  as is the tendency here  to go back to local food means that a poor man like Hans Rosling cannot even eat oranges anymore because in Scandinavia we don't have oranges. So local food production is out. But also we do not want to relegate to poverty in the rural areas. And we do not want to relegate the urban poor to starvation. So we must find other solutions. One of our problems is that world food production needs to increase very rapidly    doubling by about     . The main driver of that is actually meat. And meat consumption in Southeast Asia and China in particular is what drives the prices of cereals. That need for animal protein is going to continue. We can discuss alternatives in another talk  perhaps one day  but this is our driving force. So what can we do  Can we find a solution to produce more  Yes. But we need mechanization. And I'm making a real plea here. I feel so strongly that you cannot ask a small farmer to work the land and bend over to grow a hectare of rice          times  just to plant a crop and weed it. You cannot ask people to work under these conditions. We need clever low key mechanization that avoids the problems of the large scale mechanization that we've had. So what can we do  We must feed three billion people in cities. We will not do that through small farmers' markets because these people have no small farmers' markets at their disposal. They have low incomes. And they benefit from cheap  affordable  safe and diverse food. That's what we must aim for in the next    to    years. But yes there are some solutions. And let me just do one simple conceptual thing  if I plot science as a proxy for control of the production process and scale. What you see is that we've started in the left hand corner with traditional agriculture  which was sort of small scale and low control. We've moved towards large scale and very high control. What I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale    not just in terms of the scale of the fields  but in terms of the entire food network. That's where we should move. And the ultimate may be  but it doesn't apply to cereals  that we have entirely closed ecosystems    the horticultural systems right at the top left hand corner. So we need to think differently about agriculture science. Agriculture science for most people    and there are not many farmers among you here    has this name of being bad  of being about pollution  about large scale  about the destruction of the environment. That is not necessary. We need more science and not less. And we need good science. So what kind of science can we have  Well first of all I think we can do much better on the existing technologies. Use biotechnology where useful  particularly in pest and disease resistance. There are also robots  for example  who can recognize weeds with a resolution of half an inch. We have much cleverer irrigation. We do not need to spill the water if we don't want to. And we need to think very dispassionately about the comparative advantages of small scale and large scale. We need to think that land is multi functional. It has different functions. There are different ways in which we must use it    for residential  for nature  for agriculture purposes. And we also need to re examine livestock. Go regional and go to urban food systems. I want to see fish ponds in parking lots and basements. I want to have horticulture and greenhouses on top of residential areas. And I want to use the energy that comes from those greenhouses and from the fermentation of crops to heat our residential areas. There are all kinds of ways we can do it. We cannot solve the world food problem by using biological agriculture. But we can do a lot more. And the main thing that I would really ask all of you as you go back to your countries  or as you stay here  ask your government for an integrated food policy. Food is as important as energy  as security  as the environment. Everything is linked together. So we can do that. In fact in a densely populated country like the River Delta  where I live in the Netherlands  we have combined these functions. So this is not science fiction. We can combine things even in a social sense of making the rural areas more accessible to people    to house  for example  the chronically sick. There is all kinds of things we can do. But there is something you must do. It's not enough for me to say   Let's get more bold science into agriculture.  You must go back and think about your own food chain. Talk to farmers. When was the last time you went to a farm and talked to a farmer  Talk to people in restaurants. Understand where you are in the food chain  where your food comes from. Understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events. And that frees you up to do other things. And above all  to me  food is about respect. It's about understanding  when you eat  that there are also many people who are still in this situation  who are still struggling for their daily food. And the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have  to think that doing everything by hand is going to be the solution  is really not morally justified. We need to help to lift them out of poverty. We need to make them proud of being a farmer because they allow us to survive. Never before  as I said  has the responsibility for food been in the hands of so few. And never before have we had the luxury of taking it for granted because it is now so cheap. And I think there is nobody else who has expressed better  to me  the idea that food  in the end  in our own tradition  is something holy. It's not about nutrients and calories. It's about sharing. It's about honesty. It's about identity. Who said this so beautifully was Mahatma Gandhi     years ago  when he spoke about bread. He did not speak about rice  in India. He said   To those who have to go without two meals a day  God can only appear as bread.  And so as I'm finishing my bread here    and I've been baking it  and I'll try not to burn my hands. Let me share with those of you here in the first row. Let me share some of the food with you. Take some of my bread. And as you eat it  and as you try it    please come and stand up. Have some of it. I want you to think that every bite connects you to the past and the future  to these anonymous farmers  that first bred the first wheat varieties  and to the farmers of today  who've been making this. And you don't even know who they are. Every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world. Everything makes us so privileged  that we can eat this food  that we don't struggle every day. And that  I think  evolutionarily speaking is unique. We've never had that before. So enjoy your bread. Eat it  and feel privileged. Thank you very much. So sometimes I get invited to give weird talks. I got invited to speak to the people who dress up in big stuffed animal costumes to perform at sporting events. Unfortunately I couldn't go. But it got me thinking about the fact that these guys  at least most of them  know what it is that they do for a living. What they do is they dress up as stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events. Shortly after that I got invited to speak at the convention of the people who make balloon animals. And again  I couldn't go. But it's a fascinating group. They make balloon animals. There is a big schism between the ones who make gospel animals and porn animals  but    they do a lot of really cool stuff with balloons. Sometimes they get in trouble  but not often. And the other thing about these guys is  they also know what they do for a living. They make balloon animals. But what do we do for a living  What exactly to the people watching this do every day  And I want to argue that what we do is we try to change everything. That we try to find a piece of the status quo    something that bothers us  something that needs to be improved  something that is itching to be changed    and we change it. We try to make big  permanent  important change. But we don't think about it that way. And we haven't spent a lot of time talking about what that process is like. And I've been studying it for a couple years. And I want to share a couple stories with you today. First  about a guy named Nathan Winograd. Nathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA. And what you may not know about the history of the SPCA is  it was founded to kill dogs and cats. Cities gave them a charter to get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them. In a typical year four million dogs and cats were killed  most of them within    hours of being scooped off of the street. Nathan and his boss saw this  and they could not tolerate it. So they set out to make San Francisco a no kill city  create an entire city where every dog and cat  unless it was ill or dangerous  would be adopted  not killed. And everyone said it was impossible. Nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance. And people from SPCAs and humane shelters around the country flew to San Francisco to testify against them    to say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane. They persisted. And Nathan went directly to the community. He connected with people who cared about this  nonprofessionals  people with passion. And within just a couple years  San Francisco became the first no kill city  running no deficit  completely supported by the community. Nathan left and went to Tompkins County  New York    a place as different from San Francisco as you can be and still be in the United States. And he did it again. He went from being a glorified dogcatcher to completely transforming the community. And then he went to North Carolina and did it again. And he went to Reno and he did it again. And when I think about what Nathan did  and when I think about what people here do  I think about ideas. And I think about the idea that creating an idea  spreading an idea has a lot behind it. I don't know if you've ever been to a Jewish wedding  but what they do is  they take a light bulb and they smash it. Now there is a bunch of reasons for that  and stories about it. But one reason is because it indicates a change  from before to after. It is a moment in time. And I want to argue that we are living through and are right at the key moment of a change in the way ideas are created and spread and implemented. We started with the factory idea  that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient factory that could churn out change. We then went to the TV idea  that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece  if you could get on TV enough times  if you could buy enough ads  you could win. And now we're in this new model of leadership  where the way we make change is not by using money or power to lever a system  but by leading. So let me tell you about the three cycles. The first one is the factory cycle. Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea. It enables him to hire men who used to get paid    cents a day and pay them five dollars a day. Because he's got an efficient enough factory. Well with that sort of advantage you can churn out a lot of cars. You can make a lot of change. You can get roads built. You can change the fabric of an entire country. That the essence of what you're doing is you need ever cheaper labor  and ever faster machines. And the problem we've run into is  we're running out of both. Ever cheaper labor and ever faster machines. So we shift gears for a minute  and say   I know  television  advertising. Push push. Take a good idea and push it on the world. I have a better mousetrap. And if I can just get enough money to tell enough people  I'll sell enough.  And you can build an entire industry on that. If necessary you can put babies in your ads. If necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff. And if babies don't work  you can use doctors. But be careful. Because you don't want to get an unfortunate juxtaposition  where you're talking about one thing instead of the other. This model requires you to act like the king  like the person in the front of the room throwing things to the peons in the back. That you are in charge  and you're going to tell people what to do next. The quick little diagram of it is  you're up here  and you are pushing it out to the world. This method    mass marketing    requires average ideas  because you're going to the masses  and plenty of ads. What we've done as spammers is tried to hypnotize everyone into buying our idea  hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause  hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate. And  unfortunately  it doesn't work so well anymore either. But there is good news around the corner    really good news. I call it the idea of tribes. What tribes are  is a very simple concept that goes back        years. It's about leading and connecting people and ideas. And it's something that people have wanted forever. Lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe  or a church tribe  having a work tribe  having a community tribe. But now  thanks to the internet  thanks to the explosion of mass media  thanks to a lot of other things that are bubbling through our society around the world  tribes are everywhere. The Internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all. Instead what it's allowed is silos of interest. So you've got the red hat ladies over here. You've got the red hat triathletes over there. You've got the organized armies over here. You've got the disorganized rebels over here. You've got people in white hats making food. And people in white hats sailing boats. The point is that you can find Ukrainian folk dancers and connect with them  because you want to be connected. That people on the fringes can find each other  connect and go somewhere. Every town that has a volunteer fire department understands this way of thinking. Now it turns out this is a legitimate non photoshopped photo. People I know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon. And that what firemen do to train sometimes is they take a house that is going to be torn down  and they burn it down instead  and practice putting it out. But they always stop and take a picture. You know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one. They've got their own flag. They've got the eye patches. You can tell when you're running into someone in a tribe. And it turns out that it's tribes    not money  not factories    that can change our world  that can change politics  that can align large numbers of people. Not because you force them to do something against their will  but because they wanted to connect. That what we do for a living now  all of us  I think  is find something worth changing  and then assemble tribes that assemble tribes that spread the idea and spread the idea. And it becomes something far bigger than ourselves  it becomes a movement. So when Al Gore set out to change the world again  he didn't do it by himself. And he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads. He did it by creating a movement. Thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation for him  because he can't be in     or     or     cities in each night. You don't need everyone. What Kevin Kelley has taught us is you just need  I don't know  a thousand true fans    a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round and the next round and the next round. And that means that the idea you create  the product you create  the movement you create isn't for everyone  it's not a mass thing. That's not what this is about. What it's about instead is finding the true believers. It's easy to look at what I've said so far  and say   Wait a minute  I don't have what it takes to be that kind of leader.  So here are two leaders. They don't have a lot in common. They're about the same age. But that's about it. What they did  though  is each in their own way  created a different way of navigating your way through technology. So some people will go out and get people to be on one team. And some people will get people to be on the other team. It also informs the decisions you make when you make products or services. You know  this is one of my favorite devices. But what a shame that it's not organized to help authors create movements. What would happen if  when you're using your Kindle  you could see the comments and quotes and notes from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment. Or from your book group. Or from your friends  or from the circle you want. What would happen if authors  or people with ideas could use version two  which comes out on Monday  and use it to organize people who want to talk about something. Now there is a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here. But let me just try a couple. The Beatles did not invent teenagers. They merely decided to lead them. That most movements  most leadership that we're doing is about finding a group that's disconnected but already has a yearning    not persuading people to want something they don't have yet. When Diane Hatz worked on  The Meatrix   her video that spread all across the internet about the way farm animals are treated  she didn't invent the idea of being a vegan. She didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue. But she helped organize people  and helped turn it into a movement. Hugo Chavez did not invent the disaffected middle and lower class of Venezuela. He merely led them. Bob Marley did not invent Rastafarians. He just stepped up and said   Follow me.  Derek Sivers invented CD Baby  which allowed independent musicians to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man    to have place to take the mission they already wanted to go to  and connect with each other. What all these people have in common is that they are heretics. That heretics look at the status quo and say   This will not stand. I can't abide this status quo. I am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward. I see what the status quo is  I don't like it.  That instead of looking at all the little rules and following each one of them  that instead of being what I call a sheepwalker    somebody who's half asleep  following instructions  keeping their head down  fitting in    every once in a while someone stands up and says   Not me.  Someone stands up and says   This one is important. We need to organize around it.  And not everyone will. But you don't need everyone. You just need a few people    who will look at the rules  realize they make no sense  and realize how much they want to be connected. So Tony Hsieh does not run a shoe store. Zappos isn't a shoe store. Zappos is the one  the only  the best there ever was place for people who are into shoes to find each other  to talk about their passion  to connect with people who care more about customer service than making a nickel tomorrow. It can be something as prosaic as shoes  and something as complicated as overthrowing a government. It's exactly the same behavior though. What it requires  as Geraldine Carter has discovered  is to be able to say   I can't do this by myself. But if I can get other people to join my Climb and Ride  then together we can get something that we all want. We're just waiting for someone to lead us.  Michelle Kaufman has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture. She doesn't do it by quietly building one house at a time. She does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it. By connecting a tribe of people who are desperate to be connected to each other. By leading a movement and making change. And around and around and around it goes. So three questions I'd offer you. The first one is  who exactly are you upsetting  Because if you're not upsetting anyone  you're not changing the status quo. The second question is  who are you connecting  Because for a lot of people  that's what they're in it for  the connections that are being made  one to the other. And the third one is  who are you leading  Because focusing on that part of it    not the mechanics of what you're building  but the who  and the leading part    is where change comes. So Blake  at Tom's Shoes  had a very simple idea.  What would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes I gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn't even own a pair of shoes   This is not the story of how you get shelf space at Neiman Marcus. It's a story of a product that tells a story. And as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes and someone says   What are those   You get to tell the story on Blake's behalf  on behalf of the people who got the shoes. And suddenly it's not one pair of shoes or     pairs of shoes. It's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes. My friend Red Maxwell has spent the last    years fighting against juvenile diabetes. Not fighting the organization that's fighting it    fighting with them  leading them  connecting them  challenging the status quo because it's important to him. And the people he surrounds himself with need the connection. They need the leadership. It makes a difference. You don't need permission from people to lead them. But in case you do  here it is  they're waiting  we're waiting for you to show us where to go next. So here is what leaders have in common. The first thing is  they challenge the status quo. They challenge what's currently there. The second thing is  they build a culture. A secret language  a seven second handshake  a way of knowing that you're in or out. They have curiosity. Curiosity about people in the tribe  curiosity about outsiders. They're asking questions. They connect people to one another. Do you know what people want more than anything  They want to be missed. They want to be missed the day they don't show up. They want to be missed when they're gone. And tribe leaders can do that. It's fascinating  because all tribe leaders have charisma  but you don't need charisma to become a leader. Being a leader gives you charisma. If you look and study the leaders who have succeeded  that's where charisma comes from    from the leading. Finally  they commit. They commit to the cause. They commit to the tribe. They commit to the people who are there. So I'd like you to do something for me. And I hope you'll think about it before you reject it out of hand. What I want you to do  it only takes    hours  is  create a movement. Something that matters. Start. Do it. We need it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. AIDS was discovered       the virus      . These Gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was in      in the world  or how we estimate that it was. What we are showing here is    on this axis here  I'm showing percent of infected adults. And on this axis  I'm showing dollars per person in income. And the size of these bubbles  the size of the bubbles here  that shows how many are infected in each country  and the color is the continent. Now  you can see United States  in       had a very low percentage infected  but due to the big population  still a sizable bubble. There were quite many people infected in the United States. And  up there  you see Uganda. They had almost five percent infected  and quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country  then. And they were probably the most infected country in the world. Now  what has happened  Now you have understood the graph and now  in the next    seconds  we will play the HIV epidemic in the world. But first  I have a new invention here. I have solidified the beam of the laser pointer. So  ready  steady  go  First  we have the fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe. They went upwards like this. In Asia  the first country to be heavily infected was Thailand    they reached one to two percent. Then  Uganda started to turn back  whereas Zimbabwe skyrocketed  and some years later South Africa had a terrible rise of HIV frequency. Look  India got many infected  but had a low level. And almost the same happens here. See  Uganda coming down  Zimbabwe coming down  Russia went to one percent. In the last two to three years  we have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world.    years it took. But  steady state doesn't mean that things are getting better  it's just that they have stopped getting worse. And it has    the steady state is  more or less  one percent of the adult world population is HIV infected. It means    to    million people  the whole of California    every person  that's more or less what we have today in the world. Now  let me make a fast replay of Botswana. Botswana    upper middle income country in southern Africa  democratic government  good economy  and this is what happened there. They started low  they skyrocketed  they peaked up there in       and now they are down. But they are falling only slowly  because in Botswana  with good economy and governance  they can manage to treat people. And if people who are infected are treated  they don't die of AIDS. These percentages won't come down because people can survive    to    years. So there's some problem with these metrics now. But the poorer countries in Africa  the low income countries down here  there the rates fall faster  of the percentage infected  because people still die. In spite of PEPFAR  the generous PEPFAR  all people are not reached by treatment  and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries  only    percent are left on treatment after two years. It's not realistic with lifelong treatment for everyone in the poorest countries. But it's very good that what is done is being done. But focus now is back on prevention. It is only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it. Drugs is too costly    had we had the vaccine  or when we will get the vaccine  that's something more effective    but the drugs are very costly for the poor. Not the drug in itself  but the treatment and the care which is needed around it. So  when we look at the pattern  one thing comes out very clearly  you see the blue bubbles and people say HIV is very high in Africa. I would say  HIV is very different in Africa. You'll find the highest HIV rate in the world in African countries  and yet you'll find Senegal  down here    the same rate as United States. And you'll find Madagascar  and you'll find a lot of African countries about as low as the rest of the world. It's this terrible simplification that there's one Africa and things go on in one way in Africa. We have to stop that. It's not respectful  and it's not very clever to think that way. I had the fortune to live and work for a time in the United States. I found out that Salt Lake City and San Francisco were different. And so it is in Africa    it's a lot of difference. So  why is it so high  Is it war  No  it's not. Look here. War torn Congo is down there    two  three  four percent. And this is peaceful Zambia  neighboring country       percent. And there's good studies of the refugees coming out of Congo    they have two  three percent infected  and peaceful Zambia    much higher. There are now studies clearly showing that the wars are terrible  that rapes are terrible  but this is not the driving force for the high levels in Africa. So  is it poverty  Well if you look at the macro level  it seems more money  more HIV. But that's very simplistic  so let's go down and look at Tanzania. I will split Tanzania in five income groups  from the highest income to the lowest income  and here we go. The ones with the highest income  the better off    I wouldn't say rich    they have higher HIV. The difference goes from    percent down to four percent  and it is even bigger among women. There's a lot of things that we thought  that now  good research  done by African institutions and researchers together with the international researchers  show that that's not the case. So  this is the difference within Tanzania. And  I can't avoid showing Kenya. Look here at Kenya. I've split Kenya in its provinces. Here it goes. See the difference within one African country    it goes from very low level to very high level  and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest. So  what is it then  Why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries  Well  it is more common with multiple partners  there is less condom use  and there is age disparate sex    that is  older men tend to have sex with younger women. We see higher rates in younger women than younger men in many of these highly affected countries. But where are they situated  I will swap the bubbles to a map. Look  the highly infected are four percent of all population and they hold    percent of the HIV infected. HIV exists all over the world. Look  you have bubbles all over the world here. Brazil has many HIV infected. Arab countries not so much  but Iran is quite high. They have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran. India has many because they are many. Southeast Asia  and so on. But  there is one part of Africa    and the difficult thing is  at the same time  not to make a uniform statement about Africa  not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this  on one hand. On the other hand  try to say that this is not the case  because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now. UNAIDS have done good data available  finally  about the spread of HIV. It could be concurrency. It could be some virus types. It could be that there is other things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency. After all  if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex  the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in      . Don't jump to conclusions now on how to behave tonight and so on. But    and if you are in an unfavorable situation  more sexually transmitted diseases  it can be one in    . But what we think is that it could be concurrency. And what is concurrency  In Sweden  we have no concurrency. We have serial monogamy. Vodka  New Year's Eve    new partner for the spring. Vodka  Midsummer's Eve    new partner for the fall. Vodka    and it goes on like this  you know  And you collect a big number of exes. And we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic    terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years. HIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection and therefore  having more than one partner in the same month is much more dangerous for HIV than others. Probably  it's a combination of this. And what makes me so happy is that we are moving now towards fact when we look at this. You can get this chart  free. We have uploaded UNAIDS data on the Gapminder site. And we hope that when we act on global problems in the future we will not only have the heart  we will not only have the money  but we will also use the brain. Thank you very much. Let me talk about India through the evolution of ideas. Now I believe this is an interesting way of looking at it because in every society  especially an open democratic society  it's only when ideas take root that things change. Slowly ideas lead to ideology  lead to policies that lead to actions. In      this country went through a Great Depression  which led to all the ideas of the state and social security  and all the other things that happened in Roosevelt's time. In the     s we had the Reagan revolution  which lead to deregulation. And today  after the global economic crisis  there was a whole new set of rules about how the state should intervene. So ideas change states. And I looked at India and said  really there are four kinds of ideas which really make an impact on India. The first  to my mind  is what I call as  the ideas that have arrived.  These ideas have brought together something which has made India happen the way it is today. The second set of ideas I call  ideas in progress.  Those are ideas which have been accepted but not implemented yet. The third set of ideas are what I call as  ideas that we argue about     those are ideas where we have a fight  an ideological battle about how to do things. And the fourth thing  which I believe is most important  is  the ideas that we need to anticipate.  Because when you are a developing country in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having  you can actually anticipate what that did and do things very differently. Now in India's case I believe there are six ideas which are responsible for where it has come today. The first is really the notion of people. In the '  s and '  s we thought of people as a burden. We thought of people as a liability. Today we talk of people as an asset. We talk of people as human capital. And I believe this change in the mindset  of looking at people as something of a burden to human capital  has been one of the fundamental changes in the Indian mindset. And this change in thinking of human capital is linked to the fact that India is going through a demographic dividend. As healthcare improves  as infant mortality goes down  fertility rates start dropping. And India is experiencing that. India is going to have a lot of young people with a demographic dividend for the next    years. What is unique about this demographic dividend is that India will be the only country in the world to have this demographic dividend. In other words  it will be the only young country in an aging world. And this is very important. At the same time if you peel away the demographic dividend in India  there are actually two demographic curves. One is in the south and in the west of India  which is already going to be fully expensed by       because in that part of the country  the fertility rate is almost equal to that of a West European country. Then there is the whole northern India  which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend. But a demographic dividend is only as good as the investment in your human capital. Only if the people have education  they have good health  they have infrastructure  they have roads to go to work  they have lights to study at night    only in those cases can you really get the benefit of a demographic dividend. In other words  if you don't really invest in the human capital  the same demographic dividend can be a demographic disaster. Therefore India is at a critical point where either it can leverage its demographic dividend or it can lead to a demographic disaster. The second thing in India has been the change in the role of entrepreneurs. When India got independence entrepreneurs were seen as a bad lot  as people who would exploit. But today  after    years  because of the rise of entrepreneurship  entrepreneurs have become role models  and they are contributing hugely to the society. This change has contributed to the vitality and the whole economy. The third big thing I believe that has changed India is our attitude towards the English language. English language was seen as a language of the imperialists. But today  with globalization  with outsourcing  English has become a language of aspiration. This has made it something that everybody wants to learn. And the fact that we have English is now becoming a huge strategic asset. The next thing is technology. Forty years back  computers were seen as something which was forbidding  something which was intimidating  something that reduced jobs. Today we live in a country which sells eight million mobile phones a month  of which    percent of those mobile phones are prepaid phones because people don't have credit history. Forty percent of those prepaid phones are recharged at less than    cents at each recharge. That is the scale at which technology has liberated and made it accessible. And therefore technology has gone from being seen as something forbidding and intimidating to something that is empowering. Twenty years back  when there was a report on bank computerization  they didn't name the report as a report on computers  they call them as  ledger posting machines.  They didn't want the unions to believe that they were actually computers. And when they wanted to have more advanced  more powerful computers they called them  advanced ledger posting machines.  So we have come a long way from those days where the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment  and really has changed the way Indians think of technology. And then I think the other point is that Indians today are far more comfortable with globalization. Again  after having lived for more than     years under the East India Company and under imperial rule  Indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization believing it was a form of imperialism. But today  as Indian companies go abroad  as Indians come and work all over the world  Indians have gained a lot more confidence and have realized that globalization is something they can participate in. And the fact that the demographics are in our favor  because we are the only young country in an aging world  makes globalization all the more attractive to Indians. And finally  India has had the deepening of its democracy. When democracy came to India    years back it was an elite concept. It was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy because they wanted to bring in the idea of universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth. But today democracy has become a bottom up process where everybody has realized the benefits of having a voice  the benefits of being in an open society. And therefore democracy has become embedded. I believe these six factors    the rise of the notion of population as human capital  the rise of Indian entrepreneurs  the rise of English as a language of aspiration  technology as something empowering  globalization as a positive factor  and the deepening of democracy    has contributed to why India is today growing at rates it has never seen before. But having said that  then we come to what I call as ideas in progress. Those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society  but you are not able to implement those things. And really there are four things here. One is the question of education. For some reason  whatever reason    lack of money  lack of priorities  because of religion having an older culture    primary education was never given the focus it required. But now I believe it's reached a point where it has become very important. Unfortunately the government schools don't function  so children are going to private schools today. Even in the slums of India more than    percent of urban kids are going into private schools. So there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work. But having said that  there is an enormous desire among everybody  including the poor  to educate their children. So I believe primary education is an idea which is arrived but not yet implemented. Similarly  infrastructure    for a long time  infrastructure was not a priority. Those of you who have been to India have seen that. It's certainly not like China. But today I believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to implement. It is reflected in the political statements.    years back the political slogan was   Roti  kapada  makaan   which meant   Food  clothing and shelter.  And today's political slogan is   Bijli  sadak  pani   which means  Electricity  water and roads.  And that is a change in the mindset where infrastructure is now accepted. So I do believe this is an idea which has arrived  but simply not implemented. The third thing is again cities. It's because Gandhi believed in villages and because the British ruled from the cities  therefore Nehru thought of New Delhi as an un Indian city. For a long time we have neglected our cities. And that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see. But today  finally  after economic reforms  and economic growth  I think the notion that cities are engines of economic growth  cities are engines of creativity  cities are engines of innovation  have finally been accepted. And I think now you're seeing the move towards improving our cities. Again  an idea which is arrived  but not yet implemented. The final thing is the notion of India as a single market    because when you didn't think of India as a market  you didn't really bother about a single market  because it didn't really matter. And therefore you had a situation where every state had its own market for products. Every province had its own market for agriculture. Increasingly now the policies of taxation and infrastructure and all that  are moving towards creating India as a single market. So there is a form of internal globalization which is happening  which is as important as external globalization. These four factors I believe    the ones of primary education  infrastructure  urbanization  and single market    in my view are ideas in India which have been accepted  but not implemented. Then we have what I believe are the ideas in conflict. The ideas that we argue about. These are the arguments we have which cause gridlock. What are those ideas  One is  I think  are ideological issues. Because of the historical Indian background  in the caste system  and because of the fact that there have been many people who have been left out in the cold  a lot of the politics is about how to make sure that we'll address that. And it leads to reservations and other techniques. It's also related to the way that we subsidize our people  and all the left and right arguments that we have. A lot of the Indian problems are related to the ideology of caste and other things. This policy is causing gridlock. This is one of the factors which needs to be resolved. The second one is the labor policies that we have  which make it so difficult for entrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies  that    percent of Indian labor is in the unorganized sector. They have no benefits  they don't have social security  they don't have pension  they don't have healthcare  none of those things. This needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people into the formal workforce  you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised. Therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws  which are not as onerous as they are today. At the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector  and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for. The third thing is our higher education. Indian higher education is completely regulated. It's very difficult to start a private university. It's very difficult for a foreign university to come to India. As a result of that our higher education is simply not keeping pace with India's demands. That is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address. But most important I believe are the ideas we need to anticipate. Here India can look at what is happening in the west and elsewhere  and look at what needs to be done. The first thing is  we're very fortunate that technology is at a point where it is much more advanced than when other countries had the development. So we can use technology for governance. We can use technology for direct benefits. We can use technology for transparency  and many other things. The second thing is  the health issue. India has equally horrible health problems of the higher state of cardiac issue  the higher state of diabetes  the higher state of obesity. So there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases with a set of rich country diseases. Therefore we're to rethink the whole way we look at health. We really need to put in place a strategy so that we don't go to the other extreme of health. Similarly today in the West you're seeing the problem of entitlement    the cost of social security  the cost of Medicare  the cost of Medicaid. Therefore when you are a young country  again you have a chance to put in place a modern pension system so that you don't create entitlement problems as you grow old. And then again  India does not have the luxury of making its environment dirty  because it has to marry environment and development. Just to give an idea  the world has to stabilize at something like    gigatons per year. On a population of nine billion our average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year. India is already at two tons per year. But if India grows at something like eight percent  income per year per person will go to    times by     . So we're saying  income growing at    times and no growth in carbon. Therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment  the way we look at energy  the way we create whole new paradigms of development. Now why does this matter to you  Why does what's happening    thousand miles away matter to all of you  Number one  this matters because this represents more than a billion people. A billion people     th of the world population. It matters because this is a democracy. And it is important to prove that growth and democracy are not incompatible  that you can have a democracy  that you can have an open society  and you can have growth. It's important because if you solve these problems  you can solve the problems of poverty in the world. It's important because you need it to solve the world's environment problems. If we really want to come to a point  we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission  we want to really lower the use of energy    it has to be solved in countries like India. You know if you look at the development in the West over     years  the average growth may have been about two percent. Here we are talking about countries growing at eight to nine percent. And that makes a huge difference. When India was growing at about three   .  percent and the population was growing at two percent  its per capita income was doubling every    years. When the economic growth goes to eight percent and population growth drops to  .  percent  then per capita income is doubling every nine years. In other words  you're certainly fast forwarding this whole process of a billion people going to prosperity. And you must have a clear strategy which is important for India and important for the world. That is why I think all of you should be equally concerned with it as I am. Thank you very much.   I think I'm ready to do my thing     I think I'm ready to take my chances     I've been dining out and all stressed out     Due to the circumstances.

Believe me or not  I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem  with the requisite focus on climate. And the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind  and the resulting decline of the biosphere. That culprit is business and industry  which happens to be where I have spent the last    years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in     . As an industrial engineer  cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur. After founding my company  Interface  from scratch in          years ago  to produce carpet tiles in America for the business and institution markets  and shepherding it through start up and survival to prosperity and global dominance in its field  I read Paul Hawken's book   The Ecology of Commerce   the summer of     . In his book  Paul charges business and industry as  one  the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere  and  two  the only institution that is large enough  and pervasive enough  and powerful enough  to really lead humankind out of this mess. And by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth. And I then challenged the people of Interface  my company  to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability  which we defined as eventually operating our petroleum intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the earth  naturally and rapidly    not another fresh drop of oil    and to do no harm to the biosphere. Take nothing  do no harm. I simply said   If Hawken is right and business and industry must lead  who will lead business and industry  Unless somebody leads  nobody will.  It's axiomatic. Why not us  And thanks to the people of Interface  I have become a recovering plunderer. I once told a Fortune Magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail. And that became the headline of a Fortune article. They went on to describe me as America's greenest CEO. From plunderer to recovering plunderer  to America's greenest CEO in five years    that  frankly  was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in     . Asked later in the Canadian documentary   The Corporation   what I meant by the  go to jail  remark  I offered that theft is a crime. And theft of our children's future would someday be a crime. But I realized  for that to be true    for theft of our children's future to be a crime    there must be a clear  demonstrable alternative to the take make waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization  and is the major culprit  stealing our children's future  by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator    in short  digging up the earth and converting it to pollution. According to Paul and Anne Ehrlich and a well known environmental impact equation  impact    a bad thing    is the product of population  affluence and technology. That is  impact is generated by people  what they consume in their affluence  and how it is produced. And though the equation is largely subjective  you can perhaps quantify people  and perhaps quantify affluence  but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify. So the equation is conceptual. Still it works to help us understand the problem. So we set out at Interface  in       to create an example  to transform the way we made carpet  a petroleum intensive product for materials as well as energy  and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact  rather than multiplied it. Paul and Anne Ehrlich's environmental impact equation  I is equal to P times A times T  population  affluence and technology. I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read I equals P times A divided by T. Now  the mathematically minded will see immediately that T in the numerator increases impact    a bad thing    but T in the denominator decreases impact. So I ask   What would move T  technology  from the numerator    call it T     where it increases impact  to the denominator    call it T     where it reduces impact  I thought about the characteristics of first industrial revolution  T   as we practiced it at Interface  and it had the following characteristics. Extractive  taking raw materials from the earth. Linear  take  make  waste. Powered by fossil fuel derived energy. Wasteful  abusive and focused on labor productivity. More carpet per man hour. Thinking it through  I realized that all those attributes must be changed to move T to the denominator. In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable  linear by cyclical  fossil fuel energy by renewable energy  sunlight  wasteful by waste free  and abusive by benign  and labor productivity by resource productivity. And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes  and get rid of T  altogether  we could reduce our impact to zero  including our impact on the climate. And that became the Interface plan in       and has been the plan ever since. We have measured our progress very rigorously. So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing    years. Net greenhouse gas emissions down    percent in absolute tonnage. Over the same span of time sales have increased by two thirds and profits have doubled. So an    percent absolute reduction translates into a    percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales. This is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by      to avoid catastrophic climate disruption    so the scientists are telling us. Fossil fuel usage is down    percent per unit of production  due to efficiencies in renewables. The cheapest  most secure barrel of oil there is is the one not used through efficiencies. Water usage is down    percent in our worldwide carpet tile business. Down    percent in our broadloom carpet business  which we acquired in      right here in California  City of Industry  where water is so precious. Renewable or recyclable materials are    percent of the total  and growing rapidly. Renewable energy is    percent of our total  going for     percent. We have diverted     million pounds    that's        tons    of used carpet from landfills  closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started    years ago. Those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold    million square yards of climate neutral carpet since       meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain  from mine and well head clear to end of life reclamation    independent third party certified. We call it Cool Carpet. And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator  increasing sales and profits. Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home  under the brand Flor  misspelled F L O R. You can point and click today at Flor.com and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days. It is practical  and pretty too. We reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal  zero impact  zero footprint. We've set      as our target year for zero  for reaching the top  the summit of Mount Sustainability. We call this Mission Zero. And this is perhaps the most important facet  we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business. A better business model  a better way to bigger profits. Here is the business case for sustainability. From real life experience  costs are down  not up  reflecting some     million dollars of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste    the first face of Mount Sustainability. This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface. And this dispels a myth too  this false choice between the environment and the economy. Our products are the best they've ever been  inspired by design for sustainability  an unexpected wellspring of innovation. Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose. You cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together. And the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing. No amount of advertising  no clever marketing campaign  at any price  could have produced or created this much goodwill. Costs  products  people  marketplaces    what else is there  It is a better business model. And here is our    year record of sales and profits. There is a dip there  from      to       a dip when our sales  over a three year period  were down    percent. But the marketplace was down    percent. We literally gained market share. We might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability. If every business were pursuing Interface plans  would that solve all our problems  I don't think so. I remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation  I equals P times A divided by T . That A is a capital A  suggesting that affluence is an end in itself. But what if we reframed Ehrlich further  And what if we made A a lowercase 'a ' suggesting that it is a means to an end  and that end is happiness    more happiness with less stuff. You know that would reframe civilization itself    and our whole system of economics  if not for our species  then perhaps for the one that succeeds us  the sustainable species  living on a finite earth  ethically  happily and ecologically in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations  or        generations    that is to say  into the indefinite future. But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species  Well maybe so. But I don't think so. At Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable  zero footprint industrial company fully into existence by     . We can see our way now  clear to the top of that mountain. And now the challenge is in execution. And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says   If something exists  it must be possible.  If we can actually do it  it must be possible. If we  a petro intensive company can do it  anybody can. And if anybody can  it follows that everybody can. Hawken fulfilled business and industry  leading humankind away from the abyss because  with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere  a very dear person is at risk here    frankly  an unacceptable risk. Who is that person  Not you. Not I. But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here. And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb. On a Tuesday morning in March of       I was talking to people  as I did at every opportunity back then  bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting. But about five days later back in Atlanta  I received an email from Glenn Thomas  one of my people in the California meeting. He was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our Tuesday morning together. And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life. Because it told me  by God  one person got it. Here is what Glenn wrote. And here is that person  most at risk. Please meet  Tomorrow's Child.   Without a name  an unseen face  and knowing not your time or place  Tomorrow's child  though yet unborn  I met you first last Tuesday morn. A wise friend introduced us two. And through his sobering point of view I saw a day that you would see  a day for you but not for me. Knowing you has changed my thinking. For I never had an inkling that perhaps the things I do might someday  somehow threaten you. Tomorrow's child  my daughter  son  I'm afraid I've just begun to think of you and of your good  though always having known I should. Begin  I will. The way the cost of what I squander  what is lost  if ever I forget that you will someday come and live here too.  Well  every day of my life since   Tomorrow's Child  has spoken to me with one simple but profound message  which I presume to share with you. We are  each and every one  a part of the web of life. The continuum of humanity  sure  but in a larger sense  the web of life itself. And we have a choice to make during our brief  brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet  to hurt it or to help it. For you  it's your call. Thank you. I'll tell you a little bit about irrational behavior. Not yours  of course    other people's. So after being at MIT for a few years  I realized that writing academic papers is not that exciting. You know  I don't know how many of those you read  but it's not fun to read and often not fun to write    even worse to write. So I decided to try and write something more fun. And I came up with an idea that I would write a cookbook. And the title for my cookbook was going to be   Dining Without Crumbs  The Art of Eating Over the Sink.  And it was going to be a look at life through the kitchen. I was quite excited about this. I was going to talk a little bit about research  a little bit about the kitchen. We do so much in the kitchen  I thought this would be interesting. I wrote a couple of chapters  and took it to MIT Press and they said   Cute  but not for us. Go and find somebody else.  I tried other people  and everybody said the same thing   Cute. Not for us.  Until somebody said   Look  if you're serious about this  you have to write about your research first  you have to publish something  then you'll get the opportunity to write something else. If you really want to do it  you have to do it.  I said   I don't want to write about my research. I do it all day long  I want to write something a bit more free  less constrained.  And this person was very forceful and said   Look  that's the only way you'll ever do it.  So I said   Okay  if I have to do it     I had a sabbatical. I said   I'll write about my research  if there's no other way. And then I'll get to do my cookbook.  So  I wrote a book on my research. And it turned out to be quite fun in two ways. First of all  I enjoyed writing. But the more interesting thing was that I started learning from people. It's a fantastic time to write  because there's so much feedback you can get from people. People write to me about their personal experience  and about their examples  and where they disagree  and their nuances. And even being here    I mean  the last few days  I've known heights of obsessive behavior I never thought about. Which I think is just fascinating. I will tell you a little bit about irrational behavior  and I want to start by giving you some examples of visual illusion as a metaphor for rationality. So think about these two tables. And you must have seen this illusion. If I asked you what's longer  the vertical line on the table on the left  or the horizontal line on the table on the right  which one seems longer  Can anybody see anything but the left one being longer  No  right  It's impossible. But the nice thing about visual illusion is we can easily demonstrate mistakes. So I can put some lines on  it doesn't help. I can animate the lines. And to the extent you believe I didn't shrink the lines  which I didn't  I've proven to you that your eyes were deceiving you. Now  the interesting thing about this is when I take the lines away  it's as if you haven't learned anything in the last minute. You can't look at this and say   Now I see reality as it is.  Right  It's impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer. Our intuition is really fooling us in a repeatable  predictable  consistent way. and there is almost nothing we can do about it  aside from taking a ruler and starting to measure it. Here's another one. It's one of my favorite illusions. What color is the top arrow pointing to  Audience  Brown. Dan Ariely  Brown. Thank you. The bottom one  Yellow. Turns out they're identical. Can anybody see them as identical  Very  very hard. I can cover the rest of the cube up. If I cover the rest of the cube  you can see that they are identical. If you don't believe me  you can get the slide later and do some arts and crafts and see that they're identical. But again  it's the same story  that if we take the background away  the illusion comes back. There is no way for us not to see this illusion. I guess maybe if you're colorblind  I don't think you can see that. I want you to think about illusion as a metaphor. Vision is one of the best things we do. We have a huge part of our brain dedicated to vision    bigger than dedicated to anything else. We use our vision more hours of the day than anything else. We're evolutionarily designed to use vision. And if we have these predictable repeatable mistakes in vision  which we're so good at  what are the chances we won't make even more mistakes in something we're not as good at  for example  financial decision making. Something we don't have an evolutionary reason to do  we don't have a specialized part of the brain for  and we don't do that many hours of the day. The argument is in those cases  it might be that we actually make many more mistakes. And worse    not having an easy way to see them  because in visual illusions  we can easily demonstrate the mistakes  in cognitive illusion it's much  much harder to demonstrate the mistakes to people. So I want to show you some cognitive illusions  or decision making illusions  in the same way. And this is one of my favorite plots in social sciences. It's from a paper by Johnson and Goldstein. It basically shows the percentage of people who indicated they would be interested in donating their organs. These are different countries in Europe. You basically see two types of countries  countries on the right  that seem to be giving a lot  and countries on the left that seem to giving very little  or much less. The question is  why  Why do some countries give a lot and some countries give a little  When you ask people this question  they usually think that it has to be about culture. How much do you care about people  Giving organs to somebody else is probably about how much you care about society  how linked you are. Or maybe it's about religion. But if you look at this plot  you can see that countries that we think about as very similar  actually exhibit very different behavior. For example  Sweden is all the way on the right  and Denmark  which we think is culturally very similar  is all the way on the left. Germany is on the left  and Austria is on the right. The Netherlands is on the left  and Belgium is on the right. And finally  depending on your particular version of European similarity  you can think about the U.K. and France as either similar culturally or not  but it turns out that with organ donation  they are very different. By the way  the Netherlands is an interesting story. You see  the Netherlands is kind of the biggest of the small group. It turns out that they got to    percent after mailing every household in the country a letter  begging people to join this organ donation program. You know the expression   Begging only gets you so far.  It's    percent in organ donation. But whatever the countries on the right are doing  they're doing a much better job than begging. So what are they doing  Turns out the secret has to do with a form at the DMV. And here is the story. The countries on the left have a form at the DMV that looks something like this.  Check the box below if you want to participate in the organ donor program.  And what happens  People don't check  and they don't join. The countries on the right  the ones that give a lot  have a slightly different form. It says   Check the box below if you don't want to participate ...  Interestingly enough  when people get this  they again don't check  but now they join. Now  think about what this means. You know  we wake up in the morning and we feel we make decisions. We wake up in the morning and we open the closet  we feel that we decide what to wear. we open the refrigerator and we feel that we decide what to eat. What this is actually saying  is that many of these decisions are not residing within us. They are residing in the person who is designing that form. When you walk into the DMV  the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you'll end up doing. Now  it's also very hard to intuit these results. Think about it for yourself. How many of you believe that if you went to renew your license tomorrow  and you went to the DMV  and you encountered one of these forms  that it would actually change your own behavior  Very hard to think that it would influence us. We can say   Oh  these funny Europeans  of course it would influence them.  But when it comes to us  we have such a feeling that we're in the driver's seat  such a feeling that we're in control and we are making the decision  that it's very hard to even accept the idea that we actually have an illusion of making a decision  rather than an actual decision. Now  you might say   These are decisions we don't care about.  In fact  by definition  these are decisions about something that will happen to us after we die. How could we care about something less than about something that happens after we die  So a standard economist  somebody who believes in rationality  would say   You know what  The cost of lifting the pencil and marking a  V  is higher than the possible benefit of the decision  so that's why we get this effect.  But  in fact  it's not because it's easy. It's not because it's trivial. It's not because we don't care. It's the opposite. It's because we care. It's difficult and it's complex. And it's so complex that we don't know what to do. And because we have no idea what to do  we just pick whatever it was that was chosen for us. I'll give you one more example. This is from a paper by Redelmeier and Shafir. And they said   Would this effect also happens to experts  People who are well paid  experts in their decisions  and who make a lot of them   And they took a group of physicians. They presented to them a case study of a patient. They said   Here is a patient. He is a    year old farmer. He's been suffering from right hip pain for a while.  And then  they said to the physicians   You decided a few weeks ago that nothing is working for this patient. All these medications  nothing seems to be working. So you refer the patient for hip replacement therapy. Hip replacement. Okay   So the patient is on a path to have his hip replaced. Then they said to half of the physicians   Yesterday  you reviewed the patient's case  and you realized that you forgot to try one medication. You did not try ibuprofen. What do you do  Do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen  Or do you let him go and have hip replacement   Well  the good news is that most physicians in this case decided to pull the patient and try ibuprofen. Very good for the physicians. To the other group of physicians  they said   Yesterday when you reviewed the case  you discovered there were two medications you didn't try out yet    ibuprofen and piroxicam.  You have two medications you didn't try out yet. What do you do  You let him go  or you pull him back  And if you pull him back  do you try ibuprofen or piroxicam  Which one   Now  think of it  This decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement  but pulling him back  all of the sudden it becomes more complex. There is one more decision. What happens now  The majority of the physicians now choose to let the patient go for a hip replacement. I hope this worries you  by the way    when you go to see your physician. The thing is that no physician would ever say   Piroxicam  ibuprofen  hip replacement. Let's go for hip replacement.  But the moment you set this as the default  it has a huge power over whatever people end up doing. I'll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision making. Imagine I give you a choice  Do you want to go for a weekend to Rome  all expenses paid    hotel  transportation  food  a continental breakfast  everything    or a weekend in Paris  Now  weekend in Paris  weekend in Rome    these are different things. They have different food  different culture  different art. Imagine I added a choice to the set that nobody wanted. Imagine I said   A weekend in Rome  a weekend in Paris  or having your car stolen   It's a funny idea  because why would having your car stolen  in this set  influence anything  But what if the option to have your car stolen was not exactly like this  What if it was a trip to Rome  all expenses paid  transportation  breakfast  but it doesn't include coffee in the morning  If you want coffee  you have to pay for it yourself  it's two euros   . Now in some ways  given that you can have Rome with coffee  why would you possibly want Rome without coffee  It's like having your car stolen. It's an inferior option. But guess what happened  The moment you add Rome without coffee  Rome with coffee becomes more popular  and people choose it. The fact that you have Rome without coffee makes Rome with coffee look superior  and not just to Rome without coffee    even superior to Paris. Here are two examples of this principle. This was an ad in The Economist a few years ago that gave us three choices  an online subscription for    dollars  a print subscription for     dollars  or you could get both for    . Now I looked at this  and I called up The Economist  and I tried to figure out what they were thinking. And they passed me from one person to another to another  until eventually I got to the person who was in charge of the website  and I called them up  and they went to check what was going on. The next thing I know  the ad is gone  no explanation. So I decided to do the experiment that I would have loved The Economist to do with me. I took this and I gave it to     MIT students. I said   What would you choose   These are the market shares    most people wanted the combo deal. Thankfully  nobody wanted the dominant option. That means our students can read. But now  if you have an option that nobody wants  you can take it off  right  So I printed another version of this  where I eliminated the middle option. I gave it to another     students. Here is what happened  Now the most popular option became the least popular  and the least popular became the most popular. What was happening was the option that was useless  in the middle  was useless in the sense that nobody wanted it. But it wasn't useless in the sense that it helped people figure out what they wanted. In fact  relative to the option in the middle  which was get only the print for      the print and web for     looked like a fantastic deal. And as a consequence  people chose it. The general idea here  by the way  is that we actually don't know our preferences that well. And because we don't know our preferences that well  we're susceptible to all of these influences from the external forces  the defaults  the particular options that are presented to us  and so on. One more example of this. People believe that when we deal with physical attraction  we see somebody  and we know immediately whether we like them or not  if we're attracted or not. This is why we have these four minute dates. So I decided to do this experiment with people. I'll show you images here  no real people  but the experiment was with people. I showed some people a picture of Tom  and a picture of Jerry. and I said   Who do you want to date  Tom or Jerry   But for half the people  I added an ugly version of Jerry. I took Photoshop and I made Jerry slightly less attractive. For the other people  I added an ugly version of Tom. And the question was  will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom help their respective  more attractive brothers  The answer was absolutely yes. When ugly Jerry was around  Jerry was popular. When ugly Tom was around  Tom was popular. This of course has two very clear implications for life in general. If you ever go bar hopping  who do you want to take with you  You want a slightly uglier version of yourself. Similar  but slightly uglier. The second point  or course  is that if somebody invites you to bar hop  you know what they think about you. Now you get it. What is the general point  The general point is that  when we think about economics  we have this beautiful view of human nature.  What a piece of work is a man  How noble in reason   We have this view of ourselves  of others. The behavioral economics perspective is slightly less  generous  to people  in fact  in medical terms  that's our view. But there is a silver lining. The silver lining is  I think  kind of the reason that behavioral economics is interesting and exciting. Are we Superman  or are we Homer Simpson  When it comes to building the physical world  we kind of understand our limitations. We build steps. And we build these things that not everybody can use  obviously. We understand our limitations  and we build around them. But for some reason  when it comes to the mental world  when we design things like healthcare and retirement and stock markets  we somehow forget the idea that we are limited. I think that if we understood our cognitive limitations in the same way we understand our physical limitations  even though they don't stare us in the face the same way  we could design a better world  and that  I think  is the hope of this thing. Thank you very much. Alright. I'm going to show you a couple of images from a very diverting paper in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine. I'm going to go way out on a limb and say that it is the most diverting paper ever published in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine. The title is  Observations of In Utero Masturbation.  Okay. Now on the left you can see the hand    that's the big arrow    and the penis on the right. The hand hovering. And over here we have  in the words of radiologist Israel Meisner   The hand grasping the penis in a fashion resembling masturbation movements.  Bear in mind this was an ultrasound  so it would have been moving images. Orgasm is a reflex of the autonomic nervous system. Now  this is the part of the nervous system that deals with the things that we don't consciously control  like digestion  heart rate and sexual arousal. And the orgasm reflex can be triggered by a surprisingly broad range of input. Genital stimulation. Duh. But also  Kinsey interviewed a woman who could be brought to orgasm by having someone stroke her eyebrow. People with spinal cord injuries  like paraplegias  quadriplegias  will often develop a very  very sensitive area right above the level of their injury  wherever that is. There is such a thing as a knee orgasm in the literature. I think the most curious one that I came across was a case report of a woman who had an orgasm every time she brushed her teeth. Something in the complex sensory motor action of brushing her teeth was triggering orgasm. And she went to a neurologist  who was fascinated. He checked to see if it was something in the toothpaste  but no    it happened with any brand. They stimulated her gums with a toothpick  to see if that was doing it. No. It was the whole  you know  motion. And the amazing thing to me is that you would think this woman would have excellent oral hygiene. Sadly    this is what it said in the journal paper     She believed that she was possessed by demons and switched to mouthwash for her oral care.  It's so sad. When I was working on the book  I interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm. She was part of a study at Rutgers University. You've got to love that. Rutgers. So I interviewed her in Oakland  in a sushi restaurant. And I said   So  could you do it right here   And she said   Yeah  but you know I'd rather finish my meal if you don't mind.  But afterwards  she was kind enough to demonstrate on a bench outside. It was remarkable. It took about one minute. And I said to her   Are you just doing this all the time   She said   No. Honestly  when I get home  I'm usually too tired.  She said that the last time she had done it was on the Disneyland tram. The headquarters for orgasm  along the spinal nerve  is something called the sacral nerve root  which is back here. And if you trigger  if you stimulate with an electrode  the precise spot  you will trigger an orgasm. And it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people    a certain kind of dead person  a beating heart cadaver. Now this is somebody who is brain dead  legally dead  definitely checked out  but is being kept alive on a respirator  so that their organs will be oxygenated for transplantation. Now in one of these brain dead people  if you trigger the right spot  you will see something every now and then. There is a reflex called the Lazarus reflex. And this is    I'll demonstrate as best I can  not being dead. It's like this. You trigger the spot. The dead guy  or gal  goes... like that. Very unsettling for people working in pathology labs. Now  if you can trigger the Lazarus reflex in a dead person  why not the orgasm reflex  I asked this question to a brain death expert  Stephanie Mann  who was foolish enough to return my emails. I said   So  could you conceivably trigger an orgasm in a dead person   She said   Yes  if the sacral nerve is being oxygenated  you conceivably could.  Obviously it wouldn't be as much fun for the person. But it would be an orgasm    nonetheless. There is a researcher at the University of Alabama who does orgasm research. I said to her   You should do an experiment. You know  You can get cadavers if you work at a university.  I said   You should actually do this.  She said   You get the human subjects review board approval for this one.  According to     s marriage manual author  Theodoor van De Velde  a slight seminal odor can be detected on the breath of a woman within about an hour after sexual intercourse. Theodoor van De Velde was something of a semen connoisseur. This is a guy writing a book   Ideal Marriage   you know. Very heavy hetero guy. But he wrote in this book   Ideal Marriage     he said that he could differentiate between the semen of a young man  which he said had a fresh  exhilarating smell  and the semen of mature men  whose semen smelled  quote   Remarkably like that of the flowers of the Spanish chestnut. Sometimes quite freshly floral  and then again sometimes extremely pungent.  Okay. In       in the state of Israel  a man began hiccupping. And this was one of those cases that went on and on. He tried everything his friends suggested. Nothing seemed to help. Days went by. At a certain point  the man  still hiccupping  had sex with his wife. And lo and behold  the hiccups went away. He told his doctor  who published a case report in a Canadian medical journal under the title   Sexual Intercourse as a Potential Treatment for Intractable Hiccups.  I love this article because at a certain point they suggested that unattached hiccuppers could try masturbation. I love that because there is like a whole demographic  unattached hiccuppers. Married  single  unattached hiccupper. In the     s  early     s  a lot of gynecologists believed that when a woman has an orgasm  the contractions serve to suck the semen up through the cervix and sort of deliver it really quickly to the egg  thereby upping the odds of conception. It was called the  upsuck  theory. If you go all the way back to Hippocrates  physicians believed that orgasm in women was not just helpful for conception  but necessary. Doctors back then were routinely telling men the importance of pleasuring their wives. Marriage manual author and semen sniffer Theodoor van De Velde    has a line in his book. I loved this guy. I got a lot of mileage out of Theodoor van De Velde. He had this line in his book that supposedly comes from the Habsburg Monarchy  where there was an empress Maria Theresa  who was having trouble conceiving. And apparently the royal court physician said to her   I am of the opinion that the vulva of your most sacred majesty be titillated for some time prior to intercourse.  It's apparently  I don't know  on the record somewhere. Masters and Johnson  now we're moving forward to the     s. Masters and Johnson were upsuck skeptics  which is also really fun to say. They didn't buy it. And they decided  being Masters and Johnson  that they would get to the bottom of it. They brought women into the lab    I think it was five women    and outfitted them with cervical caps containing artificial semen. And in the artificial semen was a radio opaque substance  such that it would show up on an X ray. This is the     s. Anyway  these women sat in front of an X ray device. And they masturbated. And Masters and Johnson looked to see if the semen was being sucked up. Did not find any evidence of upsuck. You may be wondering   How do you make artificial semen   I have an answer for you. I have two answers. You can use flour and water  or cornstarch and water. I actually found three separate recipes in the literature. My favorite being the one that says    you know  they have the ingredients listed  and then in a recipe it will say  for example   Yield  two dozen cupcakes.  This one said   Yield  one ejaculate.  There's another way that orgasm might boost fertility. This one involves men. Sperm that sit around in the body for a week or more start to develop abnormalities that make them less effective at head banging their way into the egg. British sexologist Roy Levin has speculated that this is perhaps why men evolved to be such enthusiastic and frequent masturbators. He said   If I keep tossing myself off I get fresh sperm being made.  Which I thought was an interesting idea  theory. So now you have an evolutionary excuse. Okay. All righty. There is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom    pigs  for instance. In Denmark  the Danish National Committee for Pig Production found out that if you sexually stimulate a sow while you artificially inseminate her  you will see a six percent increase in the farrowing rate  which is the number of piglets produced. So they came up with this five point stimulation plan for the sows. There is posters they put in the barn  and they have a DVD. And I got a copy of this DVD. This is my unveiling  because I am going to show you a clip. So  okay. Now  here we go  la la la  off to work. It all looks very innocent. He's going to be doing things with his hands that the boar would use his snout  lacking hands. Okay. This is it. The boar has a very odd courtship repertoire. This is to mimic the weight of the boar. You should know  the clitoris of the pig is inside the vagina. So this may be sort of titillating for her. Here we go. And the happy result. I love this video. There is a point in this video  towards the beginning  where they zoom in for a close up of his hand with his wedding ring  as if to say   It's okay  it's just his job. He really does like women.  Okay. When I was in Denmark  my host was named Anne Marie. And I said   So why don't you just stimulate the clitoris of the pig  Why don't you have the farmers do that  That's not one of your five steps.  I have to read you what she said  because I love it. She said   It was a big hurdle just to get farmers to touch underneath the vulva. So we thought  let's not mention the clitoris right now.  Shy but ambitious pig farmers  however  can purchase a    this is true    a sow vibrator  that hangs on the sperm feeder tube to vibrate. Because  as I mentioned  the clitoris is inside the vagina. So possibly  you know  a little more arousing than it looks. And I also said to her   Now  these sows. I mean  you may have noticed there. The sow doesn't look to be in the throes of ecstasy.  And she said  you can't make that conclusion  because animals don't register pain or pleasure on their faces in the same way that we do. Pigs  for example  are more like dogs. They use the upper half of the face  the ears are very expressive. So you're not really sure what's going on with the pig. Primates  on the other hand  we use our mouths more. This is the ejaculation face of the stump tailed macaque. And  interestingly  this has been observed in female macaques  but only when mounting another female. Masters and Johnson. In the     s  they decided  okay  we're going to figure out the entire human sexual response cycle  from arousal  all the way through orgasm  in men and women    everything that happens in the human body. Okay  with women  a lot of this is happening inside. This did not stop Masters and Johnson. They developed an artificial coition machine. This is basically a penis camera on a motor. There is a phallus  clear acrylic phallus  with a camera and a light source  attached to a motor that is kind of going like this. And the woman would have sex with it. That is what they would do. Pretty amazing. Sadly  this device has been dismantled. This just kills me  not because I wanted to use it    I wanted to see it. One fine day  Alfred Kinsey decided to calculate the average distance traveled by ejaculated semen. This was not idle curiosity. Doctor Kinsey had heard    and there was a theory going around at the time  this being the     s    that the force with which semen is thrown against the cervix was a factor in fertility. Kinsey thought it was bunk  so he got to work. He got together in his lab     men  a measuring tape  and a movie camera. And in fact  he found that in three quarters of the men the stuff just kind of slopped out. It wasn't spurted or thrown or ejected under great force. However  the record holder landed just shy of the eight foot mark  which is impressive. Yes. Exactly. Sadly  he's anonymous. His name is not mentioned. In his write up of this experiment in his book  Kinsey wrote   Two sheets were laid down to protect the oriental carpets.  Which is my second favorite line in the entire oeuvre of Alfred Kinsey. My favorite being   Cheese crumbs spread before a pair of copulating rats will distract the female  but not the male.  Thank you very much. Thanks  Two years ago here at TED I reported that we had discovered at Saturn  with the Cassini Spacecraft  an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small Saturnine moon Enceladus  seen here. This region seen here for the first time in the Cassini image taken in     . This is the south polar region  with the famous tiger stripe fractures crossing the south pole. And seen just recently in late       here is that region again  now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere is experiencing the onset of August and eventually winter. And I also reported that we'd made this mind blowing discovery    this once in a lifetime discovery of towering jets erupting from those fractures at the south pole  consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane. And at that time two years ago I mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers  and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface  but we weren't really sure. However  the implications of those results    of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry  and perhaps life itself    were so exciting that  in the intervening two years  we have focused more on Enceladus. We've flown the Cassini Spacecraft by this moon now several times  flying closer and deeper into these jets  into the denser regions of these jets  so that now we have come away with some very precise compositional measurements. And we have found that the organic compounds coming from this moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported. While they're not amino acids  we're now finding things like propane and benzene  hydrogen cyanide  and formaldehyde. And the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of salty water  which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the jets come from pockets of liquid water  but that that liquid water is in contact with rock. And that is a circumstance that could supply the chemical energy and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life. So we are very encouraged by these results. And we are much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon  under the south pole  an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms. Whether or not there are living organisms there  of course  is an entirely different matter. And that will have to await the arrival  back at Enceladus  of the spacecrafts  hopefully some time in the near future  specifically equipped to address that particular question. But in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the Saturnine system  and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park  just because we can. Thank you. I'm here because I have a very important message  I think we have found the most important factor for success. And it was found close to here  Stanford. Psychology professor took kids that were four years old and put them in a room all by themselves. And he would tell the child  a four year old kid   Johnny  I am going to leave you here with a marshmallow for    minutes. If  after I come back  this marshmallow is here  you will get another one. So you will have two.  To tell a four year old kid to wait    minutes for something that they like  is equivalent to telling us   We'll bring you coffee in two hours.  Exact equivalent. So what happened when the professor left the room  As soon as the door closed... two out of three ate the marshmallow. Five seconds     seconds     seconds     seconds  two minutes  four minutes  eight minutes. Some lasted    and a half minutes. Couldn't do it. Could not wait. What's interesting is that one out of three would look at the marshmallow and go like this ... Would look at it. Put it back. They would walk around. They would play with their skirts and pants. That child already  at four  understood the most important principle for success  which is the ability to delay gratification. Self discipline  the most important factor for success.    years later     or    years later  follow up study. What did they find  They went to look for these kids who were now    and   . And they found that     percent of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful. They had good grades. They were doing wonderful. They were happy. They had their plans. They had good relationships with the teachers  students. They were doing fine. A great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow  they were in trouble. They did not make it to university. They had bad grades. Some of them dropped out. A few were still there with bad grades. A few had good grades. I had a question in my mind  Would Hispanic kids react the same way as the American kids  So I went to Colombia. And I reproduced the experiment. And it was very funny. I used four  five and six years old kids. And let me show you what happened. So what happened in Colombia  Hispanic kids  two out of three ate the marshmallow  one out of three did not. This little girl was interesting  she ate the inside of the marshmallow. In other words  she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it  so she would get two. But she ate it. So we know she'll be successful. But we have to watch her. She should not go into banking  for example  or work at a cash register. But she will be successful. And this applies for everything. Even in sales. The sales person that    the customer says   I want that.  And the person says   Okay  here you are.  That person ate the marshmallow. If the sales person says   Wait a second. Let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice.  Then you sell a lot more. So this has applications in all walks of life. I end with    the Koreans did this. You know what  This is so good that we want a marshmallow book for children. We did one for children. And now it is all over Korea. They are teaching these kids exactly this principle. And we need to learn that principle here in the States  because we have a big debt. We are eating more marshmallows than we are producing. Thank you so much. Let's talk about manias. Let's start with Beatlemania. Hysterical teenagers  crying  screaming  pandemonium. Sports mania  deafening crowds  all for one idea    get the ball in the net. Okay  religious mania  there's rapture  there's weeping  there's visions. Manias can be good. Manias can be alarming. Or manias can be deadly. The world has a new mania. A mania for learning English. Listen as Chinese students practice their English  by screaming it  Teacher  ... change my life  Students  I want to change my life  T  I don't want to let my parents down  S  I don't want to let my parents down  T  I don't ever want to let my country down  S  I don't ever want to let my country down  T  Most importantly... S  Most importantly... T  I don't want to let myself down  S  I don't want to let myself down  How many people are trying to learn English worldwide  Two billion of them. Students  A t shirt. A dress. Jay Walker  In Latin America  in India  in Southeast Asia  and most of all  in China. If you're a Chinese student  you start learning English in the third grade  by law. That's why this year  China will become the world's largest English speaking country. Why English  In a single word  opportunity. Opportunity for a better life  a job  to be able to pay for school  or put better food on the table. Imagine a student taking a giant test for three full days. Her score on this one test literally determines her future. She studies    hours a day for three years to prepare. Twenty five percent of her grade is based on English. It's called the gaokao  and    million high school Chinese students have already taken this grueling test. The intensity to learn English is almost unimaginable  unless you witness it. Teacher  Perfect  Students  Perfect  T  Perfect  S  Perfect  T  I want to speak perfect English  S  I want to speak perfect English  T  I want to speak ... S  I want to speak ... T  ... perfect English  S  ... perfect English  T  yelling more loudly   I want to change my life  S  yelling more loudly   I want to change my life  JW  So is English mania good or bad  Is English a tsunami  washing away other languages  Not likely. English is the world's second language. Your native language is your life. But with English you can become part of a wider conversation    a global conversation about global problems  like climate change or poverty  or hunger or disease. The world has other universal languages. Mathematics is the language of science. Music is the language of emotions. And now English is becoming the language of problem solving. Not because America is pushing it  but because the world is pulling it. So English mania is a turning point. Like the harnessing of electricity in our cities  or the fall of the Berlin Wall  English represents hope for a better future    a future where the world has a common language to solve its common problems. Thank you very much. This is my first trip  my first foreign trip as a first lady. Can you believe that  And while this is not my first visit to the U.K.  I have to say that I am glad that this is my first official visit. The special relationship between the United States and the U.K. is based not only on the relationship between governments  but the common language and the values that we share  and I'm reminded of that by watching you all today. During my visit I've been especially honored to meet some of Britain's most extraordinary women    women who are paving the way for all of you. And I'm honored to meet you  the future leaders of Great Britain and this world. And although the circumstances of our lives may seem very distant  with me standing here as the First Lady of the United States of America  and you  just getting through school  I want you to know that we have very much in common. For nothing in my life's path would have predicted that I'd be standing here as the first African American First Lady of the United States of America. There is nothing in my story that would land me here. I wasn't raised with wealth or resources or any social standing to speak of. I was raised on the South Side of Chicago. That's the real part of Chicago. And I was the product of a working class community. My father was a city worker all of his life  and my mother was a stay at home mom. And she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother. Neither of them attended university. My dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the prime of his life. But even as it got harder for him to walk and get dressed in the morning    I saw him struggle more and more    my father never complained about his struggle. He was grateful for what he had. He just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder. And my brother and I were raised with all that you really need  love  strong values and a belief that with a good education and a whole lot of hard work  that there was nothing that we could not do. I am an example of what's possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nurtured by the people around them. I was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life  grandmothers  teachers  aunts  cousins  neighbors  who taught me about quiet strength and dignity. And my mother  the most important role model in my life  who lives with us at the White House and helps to care for our two little daughters  Malia and Sasha. She's an active presence in their lives  as well as mine  and is instilling in them the same values that she taught me and my brother  things like compassion  and integrity  and confidence  and perseverance    all of that wrapped up in an unconditional love that only a grandmother can give. I was also fortunate enough to be cherished and encouraged by some strong male role models as well  including my father  my brother  uncles and grandfathers. The men in my life taught me some important things  as well. They taught me about what a respectful relationship should look like between men and women. They taught me about what a strong marriage feels like  that it's built on faith and commitment and an admiration for each other's unique gifts. They taught me about what it means to be a father and to raise a family. And not only to invest in your own home but to reach out and help raise kids in the broader community. And these were the same qualities that I looked for in my own husband  Barack Obama. And when we first met  one of the things that I remember is that he took me out on a date. And his date was to go with him to a community meeting. I know  how romantic. But when we met  Barack was a community organizer. He worked  helping people to find jobs and to try to bring resources into struggling neighborhoods. As he talked to the residents in that community center  he talked about two concepts. He talked about  the world as it is  and  the world as it should be.  And I talked about this throughout the entire campaign. What he said  that all too often  is that we accept the distance between those two ideas. And sometimes we settle for the world as it is  even when it doesn't reflect our values and aspirations. But Barack reminded us on that day  all of us in that room  that we all know what our world should look like. We know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like. We all know. And he urged the people in that meeting  in that community  to devote themselves to closing the gap between those two ideas  to work together to try to make the world as it is and the world as it should be  one and the same. And I think about that today because I am reminded and convinced that all of you in this school are very important parts of closing that gap. You are the women who will build the world as it should be. You're going to write the next chapter in history. Not just for yourselves  but for your generation and generations to come. And that's why getting a good education is so important. That's why all of this that you're going through    the ups and the downs  the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't    why it's so important. Because communities and countries and ultimately the world are only as strong as the health of their women. And that's important to keep in mind. Part of that health includes an outstanding education. The difference between a struggling family and a healthy one is often the presence of an empowered woman or women at the center of that family. The difference between a broken community and a thriving one is often the healthy respect between men and women who appreciate the contributions each other makes to society. The difference between a languishing nation and one that will flourish is the recognition that we need equal access to education for both boys and girls. And this school  named after the U.K.'s first female doctor  and the surrounding buildings named for Mexican artist Frida Kahlo  Mary Seacole  the Jamaican nurse known as the  black Florence Nightingale   and the English author  Emily Bronte  honor women who fought sexism  racism and ignorance  to pursue their passions to feed their own souls. They allowed for no obstacles. As the sign said back there   without limitations.  They knew no other way to live than to follow their dreams. And having done so  these women moved many obstacles. And they opened many new doors for millions of female doctors and nurses and artists and authors  all of whom have followed them. And by getting a good education  you too can control your own destiny. Please remember that. If you want to know the reason why I'm standing here  it's because of education. I never cut class. Sorry  I don't know if anybody is cutting class. I never did it. I loved getting As. I liked being smart. I liked being on time. I liked getting my work done. I thought being smart was cooler than anything in the world. And you too  with these same values  can control your own destiny. You too can pave the way. You too can realize your dreams  and then your job is to reach back and to help someone just like you do the same thing. History proves that it doesn't matter whether you come from a council estate or a country estate. Your success will be determined by your own fortitude  your own confidence  your own individual hard work. That is true. That is the reality of the world that we live in. You now have control over your own destiny. And it won't be easy    that's for sure. But you have everything you need. Everything you need to succeed  you already have  right here. My husband works in this big office. They call it the Oval Office. In the White House  there's the desk that he sits at    it's called the Resolute desk. It was built by the timber of Her Majesty's Ship Resolute and given by Queen Victoria. It's an enduring symbol of the friendship between our two nations. And its name  Resolute  is a reminder of the strength of character that's required not only to lead a country  but to live a life of purpose  as well. And I hope in pursuing your dreams  you all remain resolute  that you go forward without limits  and that you use your talents    because there are many  we've seen them  it's there    that you use them to create the world as it should be. Because we are counting on you. We are counting on every single one of you to be the very best that you can be. Because the world is big. And it's full of challenges. And we need strong  smart  confident young women to stand up and take the reins. We know you can do it. We love you. Thank you so much. All human life  all life  depends on plants. Let me try to convince you of that in a few seconds. Just think for a moment. It doesn't matter whether you live in a small African village  or you live in a big city  everything comes back to plants in the end  whether it's for the food  the medicine  the fuel  the construction  the clothing  all the obvious things  or whether it's for the spiritual and recreational things that matter to us so much  or whether it's soil formation  or the effect on the atmosphere  or primary production. Damn it  even the books here are made out of plants. All these things  they come back to plants. And without them we wouldn't be here. Now plants are under threat. They're under threat because of changing climate. And they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet with people like us. And people like us want to do things that destroy plants  and their habitats. And whether that's because of food production  or because of the introduction of alien plants into places that they really oughtn't be  or because of habitats being used for other purposes    all these things are meaning that plants have to adapt  or die  or move. And plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move because there might be cities and other things in the way. So if all human life depends on plants  doesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them  I think it does. And I want to tell you about a project to save plants. And the way that you save plants is by storing seeds. Because seeds  in all their diverse glory  are plants' futures. All the genetic information for future generations of plants are held in seeds. So here is the building  it looks rather unassuming  really. But it goes down below ground many stories. And it's the largest seed bank in the world. It exists not only in southern England  but distributed around the world. I'll come to that. This is a nuclear proof facility. God forbid that it should have to withstand that. So if you're going to build a seed bank  you have to decide what you're going to store in it. Right  And we decided that what we want to store first of all  are the species that are most under threat. And those are the dry land species. So first of all we did deals with    different countries. It means negotiating with heads of state  and with secretaries of state in    countries to sign treaties. We have     partner institutions all over the world  in all those countries colored orange. People come from all over the world to learn  and then they go away and plan exactly how they're going to collect these seeds. They have thousands of people all over the world tagging places where those plants are said to exist. They search for them. They find them in flower. And they go back when their seeds have arrived. And they collect the seeds. All over the world. The seeds    some of if is very untechnical. You kind of shovel them all in to bags and dry them off. You label them. You do some high tech things here and there  some low tech things here and there. And the main thing is that you have to dry them very carefully  at low temperature. And then you have to store them at about minus    degrees C    that's about minus four Fahrenheit  I think    with a very critically low moisture content. And these seeds will be able to germinate  we believe  with many of the species  in thousands of years  and certainly in hundreds of years. It's no good storing the seeds if you don't know they're still viable. So every    years we do germination tests on every sample of seeds that we have. And this is a distributed network. So all around the world people are doing the same thing. And that enables us to develop germination protocols. That means that we know the right combination of heat and cold and the cycles that you have to get to make the seed germinate. And that is very useful information. And then we grow these things  and we tell people  back in the countries where these seeds have come from   Look  actually we're not just storing this to get the seeds later  but we can give you this information about how to germinate these difficult plants.  And that's already happening. So where have we got to  I am pleased to unveil that our three billionth seed    that's three thousand millionth seed    is now stored. Ten percent of all plant species on the planet         species are safe         species  if we get the funding  by next year. Twenty five percent of all the world's plants  by     . These are not just crop plants  as you might have seen stored in Svalbard in Norway    fantastic work there. This is at least     times bigger. We have thousands of collections that have been sent out all over the world  drought tolerant forest species sent to Pakistan and Egypt  especially photosynthetic efficient plants come here to the United States  salt tolerant pasture species sent to Australia  the list goes on and on. These seeds are used for restoration. So in habitats that have already been damaged  like the tall grass prairie here in the USA  or in mined land in various countries  restoration is already happening because of these species    and because of this collection. Some of these plants  like the ones on the bottom to the left of your screen  they are down to the last few remaining members. The one where the guy is collecting seeds there on the truck  that is down to about    last remaining trees. Fantastically useful plant  both for protein and for medicine. We have training going on in China  in the USA  and many other countries. How much does it cost        dollars per species is the average. I think that's cheap  at the price. And that gets you all the scientific data that goes with it. The future research is  How can we find the genetic and molecular markers for the viability of seeds  without having to plant them every    years   And we're almost there. Thank you very much.
